   The New York City that brims with health and vibrancy today
seemed destined for a different ending in 1977. The city went broke
and grew steadily dirtier and more disheveled. A blackout plunged
millions of people into a darkness punctuated by fiery riots and
the screeching voices of looters. While televising baseball from
Yankee Stadium, cameras panned the horizon for the flame-tinged
columns of smoke spawned by arsonists who single-mindedly torched
the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Life in a city that seemed to be terminally breaking down was
tense enough. But a serial killer whom the tabloids had dubbed the
``Son of Sam'' was stalking the streets, killing at random,
taunting the police with handwritten notes. Parents feared for
their children as the corpses mounted. Neighbor suspected neighbor.
Fearful of being outside after dark, New Yorkers were driven into
cramped, airless apartments during one of the hottest summers ever
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   New York was being stalked by what seemed like an evil of
biblical proportions _ a killer whose malevolence was almost
without limit. But like most murderers, David Berkowitz turned out
to be a flesh-and-blood human being who made mistakes, the most
fateful of which was getting a parking ticket in an area where his
car was identified and eventually traced back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Cities, like human beings, tend to repress horrific memories in
favor of pleasant ones. When Berkowitz went to jail, New York
caught its breath and went back to a slightly milder version of its
heightened reality. People who had lost loved ones to the killer
were never the same. But for the rest of the city, the summer of
1977 was soon like a nightmare that might never have happened at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The opening this week of Spike Lee's new film ``Summer of Sam''
brings that harrowing summer back from the mental depths to which
most New Yorkers had cast it. For those who experienced the real
thing, the movie will summon up the chaos and paranoia of one of
the most difficult periods in the city's history. It will also
remind them yet again that evil does indeed exist.

BRAVES THRASH METS IN LAUGHER, 16-0 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the clubhouse, after a 16-0 shellacking brushed on
by the bats of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves,
manager Bobby Valentine of the New York Mets mustered a sheepish
smile. ``Well, that was interesting, wasn't it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, what occurred in the ninth inning Friday night did
get intriguing in a terribly farcical way.
</P>
<P>
   What up to that point had been a merely miserable showing before
a bored crowd of 51,979 _ the team's second sellout of the year _
was enlivened by the appearance of backup infielder/outfielder Matt
Franco on the pitcher's mound with two on and two out.
</P>
<P>
   But to get him there, Valentine had to move right fielder Roger
Cedeno to second base and Luis Lopez from second to third base, and
insert a starting pitcher, Rick Reed, into right field on his day
off. None of this was a stunt. On a night the Braves banged an
overworked Mets pitching staff for five home runs, Valentine
anticipated that Franco, who had pitched two innings in the minor
leagues, might get some work from the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third inning, I told him we might need him,'' said
Valentine, whose team trailed Greg Maddux by 8-0 at that point.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome in the ninth inning, as well as after the game,
was the reason Franco was needed to pitch _ because the other
Franco, the closer, John, felt something pop in his right middle
finger after starting the inning and getting two men out. With John
Franco on his way to the clubhouse for X-rays, Matt Franco faced
Gerald Williams with two on.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing overhand meatballs clocked at 84 mph, Franco worked
Williams to a 1-1 count. But the third pitch was knocked far out of
the field. ``I was just throwing batting practice,'' said Franco,
who says he pitched two innings in Triple-A in 1995. ``And they hit
it like it was batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   After Williams' long ball, Franco gave up a double to Ozzie
Guillen, but recovered his dignity in time to strike out Andruw
Jones _ much to the delight of a crowd that had become distracted
watching the Braves bat around while awaiting a post-game fireworks
display.
</P>
<P>
   But he could hardly be blamed on a night when the Braves got 15
hits off six bonafide Mets' pitchers and Franco for their third
victory over the Mets in four games in the span of a week. The
crowd expected a low-hit, high-strike pitchers' game between the
steely, four-time Cy Young Award winner Maddux and Masato Yoshi,
who tested him last week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Yoshi and Maddux impersonated a couple of doctors trying
to get to the golf course on a Friday afternoon. They worked fast
and precisely in a downright fleeting 2 hour, 6 minute game won by
the Braves, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux held up his end Friday night. He took a no-hitter to the
fifth inning before Lopez got a one-out single. And he raised his
record to 8-5 by striking out one, walking two and holding the Mets
to just two hits over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshi didn't hold up his end and heard about it from the
crowd, which was grumbling about his performance after the Braves
scored three runs in the first inning, two of them on a 412-foot
blast by Chipper Jones, the first of two home runs he hit on his
way to a 2 for 2, four-runs-batted-in night.

 NURSES FACE REVIEW FOR EXPLICIT WEB BUSINESS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A husband-wife team of critical-care nurses says a Scottsdale
hospi tal is trying to dump them because they star on an X-rated
Web site they say has 22,000 paid subscrib ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing it to help pay for our kids' college
educations,'' said George Miller, 35, father of a 5-year-old
daughter and an 11-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   George said he and his wife, Tracy, 33, of northeast Phoenix,
did not tout their Web site during work hours at Scottsdale
Healthcare Os born. But word leaked out about a month ago and
employees began connecting to the steamy site on their work
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   George Miller said when he showed up for work as an on-call
nurse on Thursday, he was told by a supervisor she had ``forgotten
to cancel me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home, he said, a supervisor called and told him
that ``because of the Web site, we were not to come to work until
further notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the hospital has a prob lem with nudity, or they don't
want their image tarnished,'' he said. ``But no one would have ever
known at Scottsdale Healthcare if they had not brought this to
light. They created their own problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Sperduti, hospital spokes woman, would not comment on the
Millers' case except to say, ``The matter is under review.'' She
said she did not know how long the review will take.
</P>
<P>
   She would say only that employ ees must sign a hospital policy
statement that says they can be disciplined for ``immoral or inde
cent conduct while on or off duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy does not spell out what is considered immoral or
indecent, Sperduti said.
</P>
<P>
   George says that the Web site, which shows his bare-breasted
wife sitting at a computer or in other sexually explicit poses, is
not im moral and is none of the hospital's business.
</P>
<P>
   He said the couple haven't de cided to sue, even though he is
convinced the hospital is ``invading our rights of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, says Terry Hall, a Phoenix attorney who represents
employees but is not involved in the Millers' case.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said state and federal work ers' rights to privacy are
guaranteed by the Constitution as long as their off-duty lives
don't affect their work.
</P>
<P>
   But he and another attorney said workers for private companies
don't have those broad constitutional guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eleanor Eisenberg, an attor ney at the American Civil
Liberties Union, who is familiar with the case, said she is
concerned about ``employers invading employees' privacy and making
decisions based on facts unrelated to their job performance.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he and Tracy don't identify themselves as nurses or
hospital workers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which the couple put up two months ago, features
Tracy as ``the very touchable'' Dakota Rae, and invites surfers to
view pictures of her in teeny bikinis or soaped up in a
bubble-filled bathtub. But if viewers register and agree to pay
$14.95 a month, they can see the dark-haired and much more exposed
Dakota Rae in steam ier stills.
</P>
<P>
   George appears in some shots engaging in sexual activity with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The site also links surfers to her ``cousins,'' CBaby and Jilly.
</P>
<P>
   George says the site has been popular, but the couple still need
the money they make as on-call nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hospital is doing is taking our income away by
sticking their nose in our business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said he and his wife made $92,000 ``because we
worked a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he considers his wife and himself as hospital regulars
because he has worked there two years and his wife has been there
three, each averaging 36 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sperduti said the hospital has no obligation to schedule fill-in
work ers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George says, rumors are whirling around the hospital
that the Millers are wife-swapping swingers.
</P>
<P>
   But he said they have been married for 14 years, are faithful to
each other and still ``very much in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Posing for X-rated pictures, he said, ``is just something we
like to do.'' &QL;

NORTHERN IRELAND FACES LOSS OF LEGISLATURE IF IMPASSE ON PACT
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: ADDS three grafs at end with Clinton's comment, details.)    (rm) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish governments
delivered an ultimatum to the feuding politicians of Ulster Friday
night to resolve the impasse threatening the Northern Ireland peace
settlement or see their hard fought new legislature shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern issued their formal
challenge after personally devoting five grueling days to talks
that failed to produce an agreement between the Ulster Unionists,
the Protestant group that is the province's largest party, and the
Catholic group Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had centered on the timing of which of two key steps
in the peace settlement formula would occur first _ the creation of
a power-sharing executive to run the new Northern Ireland assembly,
favored by Sinn Fein, or the beginning of the disarming of
paramilitary groups, demanded by the Ulster Unionists. The plan
includes a first-ever disarmament pledge by Sinn Fein and sets out
a sequence that makes the two events occur within weeks of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read from the steps of the Stormont Castle
Buildings where the grinding marathon talks took place, Blair
wearily cast the document in upbeat tones but acknowledged that it
faced a test in convincing the distrustful Catholic and Protestant
communities to accept it as ``the way forward,'' as it was
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most historic chance for peace that this land has
known for years and years,'' he said, ``and I ask you to give it a
chance.'' Ahern said it ``gives the whole island a bright future''
but added, ``if we can agree upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing what had blocked progress in putting into effect the
much hailed April 1998 peace agreement, the document specified that
a power-sharing executive who will run the legislature will be
nominated in two weeks, and that disarmament of guerrilla weapons
will begin in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is entitled to two of the 10 positions in the new
cabinet, in effect the new government of Northern Ireland, and the
Ulster Unionists have refused to permit the party to occupy its
seats until the IRA begins giving up its weapons. Under the
proposal, Sinn Fein achieves its aim of entering the government
without acceding to this condition, a result that left the
Unionists complaining of unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   What the British and Irish prime ministers hoped would placate
the Unionists was a first-ever statement from Sinn Fein that it
would seek full disarmament of the IRA by the May 2000 date in the
original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also sought to reassure the Unionists with the
promise of prompt British legislation setting out the punishment of
automatic and immediate suspension of the legislature and other
institutions set up by the peace agreement if the IRA does not live
up to the disarmament pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament of paramilitary weapons, called decommissioning
here, has long been the stumbling block to peace proposals in
Northern Ireland, and the matter was left deliberately vague in the
1998 peace accord in an effort to gain Sinn Fein backing for it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Unionists' demand for immediate action on
decommissioning, and Sinn Fein's refusal to respond to it, held up
what is the most important stage of putting the overall peace
agreement into action _ the creation of the executive and the
accompanying transfer of powers from the British Parliament in
London to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That delay became particularly dramatic this week when new
legislatures in Wales and Scotland received their powers from
London in the program of constitutional reform that Blair has
brought to Britain. Northern Ireland was supposed to be part of
that move; instead Northern Ireland became the reason why Blair had
to cancel his appearance at the ceremonial opening of the Scottish
Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's blueprint, the formal exchange of powers from
London to Belfast will take place on July 18, three days after the
formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament proposal that led to the prime ministers' master
plan was only spelled out Saturday morning when a long-awaited
document was submitted to them by John de Chastelain, a retired
Canadian General who heads up the International Independent
Commission on Decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   The report was deliberately held up in recent days so it could
incorporate crucial compromises achieved since Monday. Thus, when
finally made public today, it referred to developments Thursday
that led the commission to conclude that Sinn Fein was now prepared
to persuade the IRA to start turning in guns on a scheduled
timetable and to have eliminated its entire arsenal by May 22,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will hold meetings promptly with representatives
of paramilitary groups to establish the dates and manner of turning
in weapons and will formally report progress in September and
December and then next May.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, appeared buoyant in his
comments on the governments' proposal. He said he wanted to work in
``partnership'' with the Unionists and urged their leadership to
stand up to ``people who want to break this down.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, the Unionists' leader and the First Minister
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, questioned Sinn Fein's commitment
to peace and criticized the governments' plan as ``fundamentally
unfair'' to his party and vague and ``aspirational'' on points
where the Unionists had hoped for ``certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble faces the task of selling a deal he clearly has little
enthusiasm for to his party members, some of whom are not
supporters of the original peace agreement and others who will find
it hard to step back from their hardline position of demanding IRA
disarmament before the entry of Sinn Fein into government. One of
them, Jeffrey Donaldson, a Unionist member of the British
Parliament, announced Friday that he opposed the way forward plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble will also have to confront the voluble opposition of the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher-politician and head of the
Ulster Democrats, who is a much lampooned figure in British life
but still commands fervent backing from his hardline followers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called on both sides to bend to
reach an agreement, saying, ``No one is going to get something for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing Trimble and his party members is the fact that if they do
not set up the executive on July 15 with the Sinn Fein members,
they will face the shutdown of the legislature that their party has
the most power in and of which Trimble is the first minister.
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks of deliberations come during the July season of
sectarian marches. The parade that has been a flash point for
violence is the procession of members of the Orange Lodge from
Drumcree Church, scheduled for this Sunday.

 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY and SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Tour de France, one of Europe's legendary sporting
events, will draw 180 of the finest bicycle riders in the world
Saturday to a theme park in western France. From there, they will
embark on the Tour's annual three-week race to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, an estimated 15 million people line the race
route and another 160 million worldwide watch on television. And in
a typical year, Daniel Baal would be among the most interested
spectators. Baal is the president of the French Cycling Federation
and a vice president of the International Cycling Union, which
governs the sport worldwide. But Baal said he had been unable to
watch a bicycle race this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not able to believe any longer in the sport,'' he said,
citing the repeated drug scandals that had rocked the world of
elite cycling over the past year. ``I haven't seen a race yet. I
can't watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   An air of profound pessimism hangs over the sport of cycling,
and it hangs heavier than usual with the Tour de France about to
begin, for it was during last year's race that the depths of the
sport's drug problem was laid bare. Since then, cycling, the sport
that for Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a
formidable commercial enterprise, has suffered a collapse in
credibility so great that many of its riders, organizers and
sponsors fear for its future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Tour de France champion, Marco Pantani of Italy, was
recently thrown out of the Tour of Italy because of suspected drug
use, and weeks after that, four cyclists failed blood tests during
the Tour of Switzerland. Perhaps most dispiriting, 11 riders
competing in last month's Tour of Italy amateur race, which is used
as a kind of prep race for young cyclists, also failed blood tests
that indicate drug use.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, nearly a dozen commercial sponsors of cycling
teams and races across Europe have formally expressed concern that
the sport is in peril, and two, Coca-Cola and the French bank
Credit Lyonnais, have threatened to end their millions of dollars
in financing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, criminal investigations aimed at cracking
Continent-wide drug rings go on in France, and earlier this year
the No. 1 book on France's list of best-selling nonfiction was a
tell-all book by Willy Voet, a former employee of France's top
cycling team, that details how riders bought drugs, cheated on drug
tests and undermined the notion of pure competition in one of
Europe's revered sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in cycling took everybody for fools and treated
them like fools _ the journalists and the fans,'' said Voet, the
former masseur for the Festina team who was caught by French
authorities last year in possession of banned drugs days before the
start of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of performance-enhancing drug use, of course, has
plagued virtually all sports in recent years. Football, track and
field and swimming, to name several, have all been bedeviled by
steroids use, and the International Olympic Committee has
identified drug use as the single greatest threat to international
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But the kind of grim declarations voiced by Voet have echoed
with unique regularity and resonance throughout the world of
cycling _ a sport that annually offers millions of dollars in prize
money and tens of millions of dollars in endorsement deals and
commercial sponsorship. Riders talk with anger and despair,
occasionally with contrition. Organizers, fans and sponsors talk
with both cynicism and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it's something new,'' said Bobby Julich, the
American rider who finished third in last year's Tour de France.
``It's pretty hard to stay serious and motivate yourself for the
Tour.'' Of the recent disclosure that young riders in the amateur
division of the Tour of Italy had failed drug tests, Julich said:
``They are 21, 22, 18 even. That breaks your heart, it does, it
really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour, agreed that the
sport's state of crisis was real and deep. And just this week,
Leblanc said, it got worse. Leblanc had attempted to bar four
French riders and an entire Dutch team from the Tour because of
concerns about drugs, but because of a rules technicality, he was
ordered by the world cycling federation to permit Richard Virenque,
a former rider for Festina, to compete. Leblanc had said that
Virenque's ``name and image are the incarnation of doping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been prevented from completing our attempt to restore
the image of the Tour,'' Leblanc said of the decision by the
International Cycling Union. Of the sport's condition generally, he
added, ``Our significance has cracked, just like the public's trust
in us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, cycling, a grueling, glamorous sport in Europe, has
been wrestling with drug use and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Tommy Simpson, a British cyclist, died while competing
in the Tour de France, his death ultimately linked to his use of
amphetamines. Succeeding years brought additional embarrassments:
In 1969, the Belgian star Eddy Merckx was suspended while leading
the Tour of Italy for using amphetamines; in 1978, Michel
Pollentier, another Belgian, was suspended while leading the Tour
de France after he was caught concealing a clean urine sample to
trick testers, and in 1988, Pedro Delgado of Spain won the Tour de
France despite having tested positive for using what is known as a
masking agent, a substance designed to hide drug use, but one that
then was not banned by the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the early 1990s, according to riders and cycling
officials, the sport's top competitors began to experiment with
much more effective and difficult-to-detect drugs, chief among them
erythropoietin, or EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Originally developed to treat kidney disorders, EPO increases
the number of red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to weary
muscles. Because EPO is a synthetic version of a hormone that
exists naturally in the body, it is hard to detect, even more so
because riders, facing testing, have injected themselves with
saline solution to dilute their blood and mask their EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had doping products in our sport, but there is a
lot of voodoo in these products, and cheaters either believed in
them or they didn't,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the
International Cycling Union. ``But EPO is highly effective. It
really increases capacity considerably, and the sad thing is that
many athletes in our sport have felt forced to use it because it is
so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zulle is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rider, you feel tied into the system,'' Zulle, one of the
six riders for Festina who confessed to EPO use during the 1998
Tour de France, told reporters last year. ``It's like being on the
highway. The law says there's a speed limit of 65, but everyone is
driving 70 or faster. Why should I be the one who obeys the speed
limit?''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the rationale for widespread cheating is more
straightforwardly cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're all addicted to is making cycling _ this painful,
brutal sport _ easy,'' Voet, the former Festina employee, said in
an interview. The Tour de France, for instance, covers more than
2,000 miles, many of them in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Baal, the French Cycling Federation official, agreed. ``I feel
insulted by these riders who climb long hills with their mouths
closed, not even breathing hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the episodes have kept coming, sometimes revealing
individual duplicity, sometimes revealing the extraordinary
dimensions of the drug problem in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with two stages remaining in the Tour of Italy,
Marco Pantani, the bald, bold climber who had won last year's Tour
de France after weeks of drug raids, police interrogations and
rider protests, was comfortably in the lead. Pantani, whose income
from salary and sponsorship deals tops $3 million annually and who
for many represented what might still be engaging about the sport,
failed a blood test. The level of red blood cells in his system
indicated EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   While Pantani denied using EPO, the sport had absorbed another
hit to its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The blows, though, have been bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a Paris narcotics squad questioned two professional
cyclists _ one of them the rising Belgian star Frank Vandenbroucke
_ as part of its investigation of a supply network for
performance-enhancing drugs. That network was allegedly
orchestrated by two Frenchmen: Bernard Sainz, a homeopathic
practitioner who has treated many riders and is suspected of
practicing medicine without a license, and Bertrand Lavelot, a
lawyer who often represented teams and riders, sometimes in doping
cases. Vandenbroucke and the other rider have been suspended from
their team, pending an investigation, and Sainz and Lavelot remain
in custody, maintaining their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Smadja, an aide to the French sports minister,
Marie-George Buffet, said the investigation of Sainz and the riders
was a first attempt to take on what authorities believe is a
lucrative market in illicit drugs for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone from the stage where doping was essentially
rudimentary and individual to the stage where it is now very well
organized with distribution networks and traffickers and
established points of supply,'' Smadja said. ``Doping brings in
more money than crack in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment of fear, anger and suspicion has been toxic.
Police in France have been extremely aggressive in detaining,
searching and questioning riders. And some cyclists call the
testing officials employed by the cycling organizations ``the
vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicycle riders have become easy prey,'' said Laurent Jalabert,
a French rider who competes for the Spanish team Once, but who is
refusing to race in the Tour de France this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cyclists,'' Pantani said recently of all the testing,
``not blood donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, he failed a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 Tour scandal _ only 96 of the 198 riders who
started the race finished after the suspensions and protest
withdrawals took their toll _ cycling was arguably the sport second
in popularity behind soccer in several Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major commercial sponsors, who are centered in France,
Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, spend
between $4 million and $6 million annually to assemble teams of
about 20 men. The teams compete for purses great and small, with
the Tour de France's $2 million in total prize money the biggest
payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the cycling circuit has always functioned as a great
advertising gambit, and so sponsors financed the sport as a way of
gaining exposure for products and services ranging from vacuum
cleaners to insurance. According to cycling officials, the total
spent on road racing sponsorship annually is roughly $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the central worries rippling through the sport then is
whether that kind of financing will diminish if the drug scandals
persist. Though no major sponsors have withdrawn, several are
reconsidering their participation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Coca-Cola, which pays about $3.5 million annually
to be an official partner of the Tour de France, has indicated that
its future involvement depends on how the 1999 race unfolds.
Earlier this month, 10 team sponsors sent an open letter to the
International Cycling Union emphasizing that the sport was ``in
danger'' and asking for stricter medical inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the top races, fearful that equivocation on the
drug problem by riders, officials or sponsors will further sap
public confidence, are closely monitoring attendance figures and
television ratings. The indicators have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper Le Figaro, France Television's viewer
share for its Tour coverage shrank from 9 percent to 7.4 percent
last year as police raids frequently overshadowed the daily stages.
This spring, as drug episodes continued to claim the sport's top
riders, crowds were thin at a handful of events. Still, the Tour of
Italy drew crowds as big as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the right any longer to trick the fans who
continue to show us affection and support,'' Leblanc, the director
of the Tour de France, said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with one sponsor of the Tour de France, Credit
Lyonnais, said they were gratified that Leblanc had tried to bar
riders from this year's race who had been implicated in drug use.
But the action was decried in some other parts of Europe, including
Spain and the Netherlands, for coming before the legal proceedings
against the riders had been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cycling circuit and its badly tarnished crown
jewel, the Tour de France, will unfold under considerable pressure.
Every competitor will have his blood tested before the race begins,
and there will be frequent testing of the leaders and random
testing of other racers throughout the event. Leblanc, a former
professional rider, has made it clear that he will resign if this
year's race becomes another fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the scope and regularity of the drug scandals have forced a
kind of healthy self-examination on the world of cycling, they have
also underscored how difficult finding a way out of the morass
might be. After all, one of the things that recent revelations have
made clear is how clever riders and their assistants can be in
defeating detection.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, cyclists were subject to urine tests only, and
during the Tour de France, daily tests were given to two race
leaders and two other riders selected at random. During the last
decade, the Tour reported only one positive test. And despite
riders' agreeing to more detailed blood testing in 1997, EPO use
evidently continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   But Voet, in his confessional book, argues that cheating was
routine. He writes of planting clean urine samples inside bathrooms
where drug tests were to take place. He also claims that some
cyclists passed drug tests by inserting condoms full of clean urine
into their anuses _ condoms that were attached to plastic tubes
taped to their scrotums so they could feign urinating.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Voet, who remains under investigation by
French authorities, is not optimistic about a cleaner future for
the sport. ``The thieves have left the scene of the crime. They
already have shifted to something else,'' he said, saying that EPO
and other standard cheating drugs were now being improved upon.
``Now, it's synthetic hemoglobin or interleukin or products which
augment the oxygen level in muscles without raising the red blood
cell count.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbruggen, the president of the International Cycling Union,
shares the worry. ``In the near future, we will have genetic
manipulation,'' he said. ``There is a role for governments here.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have been the most aggressive in going after drugs in
sports. In March, a doping law was passed in France that
established maximum prison terms of seven years for trafficking in
banned performance-enhancing substances and instituted fines of up
to 1 million francs ($160,000). Under the new law, police have been
given wider powers to search and investigate.
</P>
<P>
   It is Marie-George Buffet, the sports minister who assumed her
post in 1997, who is behind the French forcefulness. The annual
antidoping budget in France has increased by more than 50 percent
this year to 25.5 million francs, and Buffet has asked for 115
million francs next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a long fight,'' Buffet said. ``A problem like
doping is never solved only by passing a law.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no other European nation has comparable
penalties against trafficking in sports drugs. Last month, though,
the ministers or secretaries in charge of sport in the 15 member
nations of the European Union held a first-ever meeting in which
they discussed ways of unifying their widely divergent antidoping
legislation. And Giovanna Melandri, the minister who oversees sport
in Italy, is proposing a law similar to France's in her country's
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are looking at it seriously is that we do
believe it has become a serious social problem,'' Melandri said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, there are questions about just how
committed the sport's riders and officials are to ending drug use.
The international federation's tests for EPO use measure a rider's
red blood cell count against what would be regarded as normal for a
fit athlete. But many people have complained that the test is too
lenient and allows for a degree of calculated cheating, riders
using just enough EPO to have their red blood cell count approach,
but not exceed the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe, as a result, that the greatest hope for an
effective system to counteract doping lies with the model being
developed by the French.
</P>
<P>
   The French Cycling Federation requires its riders to take four
annual medical tests. The idea is to establish a detailed and
carefully monitored portrait of a competitor's biological
characteristics from an early age, against which officials might
document any irregularities that develop suggesting doping.
</P>
<P>
   The new French law requires athletes to possess a medical
certificate to compete, and doctors who detect signs of doping in
an athlete are required to withhold the certificate, inform the
athlete of the risks and then transmit the information to a medical
supervisor. The procedure is required to be confidential, and
doctors who fail to follow it are subject to disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the Tour de France starting today, everyone in
cycling is holding his breath. And the riders understand they face
a long stretch of suspicion, fair or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very bad situation for cyclists,'' said Johan Bruyneel,
a Belgian who is the sports director for the U.S. Postal Service
team that competes in Europe. ``Everywhere we go, people look at us
almost as if we're criminals.''

NORTHERN IRELAND FACES LOSS OF LEGISLATURE IF IMPASSE ON PACT
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: CHANGES fought to won in lede.)    (rm) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish governments
delivered an ultimatum to the feuding politicians of Ulster Friday
night to resolve the impasse threatening the Northern Ireland peace
settlement or see their hard-won new legislature shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern issued their formal
challenge after personally devoting five grueling days to talks
that failed to produce an agreement between the Ulster Unionists,
the Protestant group that is the province's largest party, and the
Catholic group Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had centered on the timing of which of two key steps
in the peace settlement formula would occur first _ the creation of
a power-sharing executive to run the new Northern Ireland assembly,
favored by Sinn Fein, or the beginning of the disarming of
paramilitary groups, demanded by the Ulster Unionists. The plan
includes a first-ever disarmament pledge by Sinn Fein and sets out
a sequence that makes the two events occur within weeks of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read from the steps of the Stormont Castle
Buildings where the grinding marathon talks took place, Blair
wearily cast the document in upbeat tones but acknowledged that it
faced a test in convincing the distrustful Catholic and Protestant
communities to accept it as ``the way forward,'' as it was
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most historic chance for peace that this land has
known for years and years,'' he said, ``and I ask you to give it a
chance.'' Ahern said it ``gives the whole island a bright future''
but added, ``if we can agree upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing what had blocked progress in putting into effect the
much hailed April 1998 peace agreement, the document specified that
a power-sharing executive who will run the legislature will be
nominated in two weeks, and that disarmament of guerrilla weapons
will begin in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is entitled to two of the 10 positions in the new
cabinet, in effect the new government of Northern Ireland, and the
Ulster Unionists have refused to permit the party to occupy its
seats until the IRA begins giving up its weapons. Under the
proposal, Sinn Fein achieves its aim of entering the government
without acceding to this condition, a result that left the
Unionists complaining of unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   What the British and Irish prime ministers hoped would placate
the Unionists was a first-ever statement from Sinn Fein that it
would seek full disarmament of the IRA by the May 2000 date in the
original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also sought to reassure the Unionists with the
promise of prompt British legislation setting out the punishment of
automatic and immediate suspension of the legislature and other
institutions set up by the peace agreement if the IRA does not live
up to the disarmament pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament of paramilitary weapons, called decommissioning
here, has long been the stumbling block to peace proposals in
Northern Ireland, and the matter was left deliberately vague in the
1998 peace accord in an effort to gain Sinn Fein backing for it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Unionists' demand for immediate action on
decommissioning, and Sinn Fein's refusal to respond to it, held up
what is the most important stage of putting the overall peace
agreement into action _ the creation of the executive and the
accompanying transfer of powers from the British Parliament in
London to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That delay became particularly dramatic this week when new
legislatures in Wales and Scotland received their powers from
London in the program of constitutional reform that Blair has
brought to Britain. Northern Ireland was supposed to be part of
that move; instead Northern Ireland became the reason why Blair had
to cancel his appearance at the ceremonial opening of the Scottish
Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's blueprint, the formal exchange of powers from
London to Belfast will take place on July 18, three days after the
formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament proposal that led to the prime ministers' master
plan was only spelled out Saturday morning when a long-awaited
document was submitted to them by John de Chastelain, a retired
Canadian General who heads up the International Independent
Commission on Decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   The report was deliberately held up in recent days so it could
incorporate crucial compromises achieved since Monday. Thus, when
finally made public today, it referred to developments Thursday
that led the commission to conclude that Sinn Fein was now prepared
to persuade the IRA to start turning in guns on a scheduled
timetable and to have eliminated its entire arsenal by May 22,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will hold meetings promptly with representatives
of paramilitary groups to establish the dates and manner of turning
in weapons and will formally report progress in September and
December and then next May.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, appeared buoyant in his
comments on the governments' proposal. He said he wanted to work in
``partnership'' with the Unionists and urged their leadership to
stand up to ``people who want to break this down.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, the Unionists' leader and the First Minister
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, questioned Sinn Fein's commitment
to peace and criticized the governments' plan as ``fundamentally
unfair'' to his party and vague and ``aspirational'' on points
where the Unionists had hoped for ``certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble faces the task of selling a deal he clearly has little
enthusiasm for to his party members, some of whom are not
supporters of the original peace agreement and others who will find
it hard to step back from their hardline position of demanding IRA
disarmament before the entry of Sinn Fein into government. One of
them, Jeffrey Donaldson, a Unionist member of the British
Parliament, announced Friday that he opposed the way forward plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble will also have to confront the voluble opposition of the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher-politician and head of the
Ulster Democrats, who is a much lampooned figure in British life
but still commands fervent backing from his hardline followers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called on both sides to bend to
reach an agreement, saying, ``No one is going to get something for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing Trimble and his party members is the fact that if they do
not set up the executive on July 15 with the Sinn Fein members,
they will face the shutdown of the legislature that their party has
the most power in and of which Trimble is the first minister.
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks of deliberations come during the July season of
sectarian marches. The parade that has been a flash point for
violence is the procession of members of the Orange Lodge from
Drumcree Church, scheduled for this Sunday.

NURSES FACE REVIEW FOR EXPLICIT WEB BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (resending to correct slug) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A husband-wife team of critical-care nurses says a Scottsdale
hospi tal is trying to dump them because they star on an X-rated
Web site they say has 22,000 paid subscrib ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing it to help pay for our kids' college
educations,'' said George Miller, 35, father of a 5-year-old
daughter and an 11-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   George said he and his wife, Tracy, 33, of northeast Phoenix,
did not tout their Web site during work hours at Scottsdale
Healthcare Os born. But word leaked out about a month ago and
employees began connecting to the steamy site on their work
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   George Miller said when he showed up for work as an on-call
nurse on Thursday, he was told by a supervisor she had ``forgotten
to cancel me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home, he said, a supervisor called and told him
that ``because of the Web site, we were not to come to work until
further notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the hospital has a prob lem with nudity, or they don't
want their image tarnished,'' he said. ``But no one would have ever
known at Scottsdale Healthcare if they had not brought this to
light. They created their own problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Sperduti, hospital spokes woman, would not comment on the
Millers' case except to say, ``The matter is under review.'' She
said she did not know how long the review will take.
</P>
<P>
   She would say only that employ ees must sign a hospital policy
statement that says they can be disciplined for ``immoral or inde
cent conduct while on or off duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy does not spell out what is considered immoral or
indecent, Sperduti said.
</P>
<P>
   George says that the Web site, which shows his bare-breasted
wife sitting at a computer or in other sexually explicit poses, is
not im moral and is none of the hospital's business.
</P>
<P>
   He said the couple haven't de cided to sue, even though he is
convinced the hospital is ``invading our rights of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, says Terry Hall, a Phoenix attorney who represents
employees but is not involved in the Millers' case.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said state and federal work ers' rights to privacy are
guaranteed by the Constitution as long as their off-duty lives
don't affect their work.
</P>
<P>
   But he and another attorney said workers for private companies
don't have those broad constitutional guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eleanor Eisenberg, an attor ney at the American Civil
Liberties Union, who is familiar with the case, said she is
concerned about ``employers invading employees' privacy and making
decisions based on facts unrelated to their job performance.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he and Tracy don't identify themselves as nurses or
hospital workers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which the couple put up two months ago, features
Tracy as ``the very touchable'' Dakota Rae, and invites surfers to
view pictures of her in teeny bikinis or soaped up in a
bubble-filled bathtub. But if viewers register and agree to pay
$14.95 a month, they can see the dark-haired and much more exposed
Dakota Rae in steam ier stills.
</P>
<P>
   George appears in some shots engaging in sexual activity with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The site also links surfers to her ``cousins,'' CBaby and Jilly.
</P>
<P>
   George says the site has been popular, but the couple still need
the money they make as on-call nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hospital is doing is taking our income away by
sticking their nose in our business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said he and his wife made $92,000 ``because we
worked a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he considers his wife and himself as hospital regulars
because he has worked there two years and his wife has been there
three, each averaging 36 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sperduti said the hospital has no obligation to schedule fill-in
work ers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George says, rumors are whirling around the hospital
that the Millers are wife-swapping swingers.
</P>
<P>
   But he said they have been married for 14 years, are faithful to
each other and still ``very much in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Posing for X-rated pictures, he said, ``is just something we
like to do.'' &QL;

U.S. AND ALLIES PREVENT FLIGHTS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS INTO KOSOVO

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its NATO allies have blocked
Russia from flying hundreds of troops into Kosovo this weekend,
before details of Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force
could be worked out, administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 48 hours, Russia asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
for use of their airspace to fly 10 planeloads of peacekeepers on
Sunday into Pristina, the provincial capital, the officials said.
But those countries rejected the request after consulting with top
American and NATO officials, the administration officials said.
Hungary is a new member of NATO, while both Romania and Bulgaria
would like to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian point of view was, `Let's get our troops in there
while we work out the arrangements,''' said an administration
official. ``Our view is, `Let's get the details down before we have
them deploy more troops.'''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Russian Embassy here said there was no one
available Friday night to comment on the flights. Similarly, there
was no government spokesman in Moscow or at the Russian Mission to
the United Nations to discuss the matter, officials said. It was
unclear exactly how many more troops Russian had intended to
deploy, though American officials said it was at least a few
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after an agreement reached in Helsinki, Finland,
Russian military negotiators this week sought to alter it by having
their troops in Kosovo take orders only from Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also wants
to station forces in the Italian as well as French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to Pristina
airport last month and an unusual military exercise last week in
which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian fighter-bombers near
Iceland, administration officials said Friday they wanted no more
surprises from Russia over the July 4 holiday weekend, when many
senior American officials plan to be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, vacationing in Europe,
today called her Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, to explain
NATO's objections to continuing the deployment of 3,600 Russian
troops into Kosovo until several sticking points are resolved, a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials had expected to settle the details of Russia's
peacekeeping role at high-level military talks in Mons, Belgium,
this week. Anticipating this, Russia had scheduled to fly 10
hulking Ilyushin Il-96 cargo planes full of troops and equipment
into Pristina to join about 400 Russian troops already there.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks struck an impasse and were not set to resume in
Belgium until next week. When Russia signaled that it was preparing
to send its troops to Kosovo anyway, American and NATO officials
quickly intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,
spoke to his Russian counterpart while NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana and his top aides consulted with officials in
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian planes were not on the runway ready to launch,''
said a senior military official. ``But calls were made to Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania to coordinate our response'' if anything
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The deal is, the
technical details of the Helsinki agreement must be worked out
before they send in more troops. Those details have not been worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
flatly ruled out the Russian proposals, but did not give any hint
at the tense, behind-the-scenes brinkmanship unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were various efforts made by the Russian side to present
modifications or new interpretations of issues previously agreed at
Helsinki,'' Clark told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We
deflected those attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached in Helsinki on June 18 outlined ways for
the Russian troops to cooperate with French, German and U.S.
forces, as well as control ground operations at the Pristina
airport, which is in the heart of the British sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian zone in the German sector borders on the Italian
sector in western Kosovo, and allied officials say that the
Russians want to operate in that sector as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to draw the lines along in areas that they would
feel more comfortable in operating in,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen told reporters on Thursday. ``We feel it's very important
that we stay within the existing map as it was drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Any changes in the patrol areas would require approval by NATO's
political arm, the North Atlantic Council, and the Russian
Federation. ``Some concern was expressed by some of the Russians on
the ground, having seen the KLA up a little close and personal,
that maybe the sectors they picked weren't the most convenient
sectors for the Russian forces to be in,'' Clark told reporters on
Thursday, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``They'll have
to come back through proper channels if this is going to be
adjusted.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki agreement also calls for Russian peacekeepers to
have their own commander, Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, and liaison
officers with the French, German and American commanders up the
allied chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians would not formally report to NATO commanders,
they are expected to follow allied military operational
requirements, a delicate distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Russian negotiator, Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov,
appears to be seeking permission for Russian troops to operate
under their own rules, not NATO's, American and NATO officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to keep this strictly within the bounds agreed at
Helsinki, including unity of command,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who said Russian troops would examine their assigned
operational areas in Kosovo in the next few days, expressed
optimism that impasse could be resolved by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian elements are going to do on-the-ground
reconnaissance,'' Clark said. ``They're going to come back and see
us again at my headquarters next week, where we're going to
finalize the details of Russian participation.''

MINOR-LEAGUE BASEBALL IS BIG HIT IN SMALL MISSOURI TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZARK, Mo. -- Juan Pacheco's 5-year-old daughter, Styler,
presses her face to the chain-link fence around the field. Her
Winnie-the-Pooh backpack slips as she clutches her Ozark Mountain
Ducks pennant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Styler looks away shyly as her dad asks Jason Thompson, the
spark plug center fielder, to sign her pennant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Thompson oblige, but he also takes the pennant to
three teammates sitting on plastic chairs in the bullpen. They
sign, too. When Thompson returns it, he acts as if little Styler is
doing him a favor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, minor-league baseball has changed; a supermarket's name
graces the stadium, the sports bar sells microbrews, and denim Duck
shirts go for $45. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Ozark has welcomed the Ducks like small towns embrace new
neighbors. The Ducks, in their first season, lead the league in
attendance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco was here on opening night. Scanning the roster, he saw a
few players with Latin last names. He figured he'd say hello. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next thing he knew, two players were bunking with his family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hombre,'' he shouts in Spanish to Sergio Cairo, an outfielder
from the Dominican Republic. ``Your stuff is still at my house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't big-time baseball. Players make an average of $1,000
a month, so little that Pacheco didn't want his guests to pitch in
for groceries. The team operates by the seat of its pants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to figure out where to put them all. I might have
to sleep on the couch,'' Pacheco said as a peanut vendor hawked his
wares nearby. ``But they're good guys. I'm just glad to have
baseball here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long wait. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, the Springfield (Mo.) Cardinals were a
minor-league affiliate for St. Louis. Future stars such as Stan
Musial honed their craft before moving to the big leagues. The last
local team, an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs, left town in 1950. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, town leaders have tried to bring baseball back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Springfield voters rejected a plan in 1990 that would have
raised the city sales tax to partly fund a stadium. A 1995 plan to
move a Nashville, Tenn., team failed when the Missouri General
Assembly didn't OK funds for a stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Texas-Louisiana League, an independent outfit with
such franchises as the Bayou Bullfrogs of Lafayette, La., and the
Rio Grande Valley White Wings of Harlingen, Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   League officials saw Ozark, a fast-growing suburb south of
Springfield, as a ripe market. So much so that, for the first time,
the league paid to build a park. The stadium, which seats 4,127,
was finished with days to spare. Price Cutter paid an undisclosed
amount to put its name on the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the team name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is a Mountain Duck anyway? It came from a
name-the-team contest. Brad Eldridge, the general manager, says it
combined several entries that mentioned mountains or ducks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it looks good on a T-shirt,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As fans blew into plastic duck calls in the bleachers around
her, Madge Morris rolled her eyes when someone mentioned the name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks have won over the skeptics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite bumbling to an 8-21 start, the team is averaging 3,392
fans through 15 home games, leading the seven-team league. The club
has sold 1,800 season tickets, far outpacing projections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only minor-league sensation in Missouri. The
River City Rascals, who play in O'Fallon, sold out opening night
and have drawn strong crowds for their inaugural season in the
independent Frontier League. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks win fans over with friendly players and wacky
gimmicks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is that, even if the team just got creamed 15-2, fans
still walk away saying they had a good time,'' Eldridge said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, waiters from nearby Lambert's Cafe -- where bread
is thrown to diners -- heave rolls to fans, who dive for them as if
they were foul balls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the ``K-Man'' is introduced -- one opponent each game. If
he strikes out -- registered as ``K'' in the scorebook -- fans win
five free hot wings at a nearby Hooter's. On this night, the K-man
was Chris Cassels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how'd you like to be Cassels, 30 years old, a career
minor-leaguer, just off a 12-hour bus trip from Mississippi. The
pitcher gets two strikes and all of a sudden, the announcer starts
heckling you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants hot wings?'' he yells. ``Let me hear you!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Cassels doesn't strike out all night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, too, because some of the Ducks could surely use the
meal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hovey, a rookie pitcher from Kansas City, Mo., scrapes
by at $650 a month. Mark McGwire, the Cardinals slugger, will make
about twice as much an inning as Hovey will all season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hovey also gets $12 daily for meals. He deliberately sleeps in
so he can miss breakfast and save money. He eats fast food for
lunch. Players refuse to spring for a cab ride to nicer
restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team takes overnight bus trips of as long as 17 hours to
far-flung stops in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Hovey complaining? No way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hovey, who attended Southwest Missouri State University, hounded
the Ducks to give him a tryout. They like what they see. Hovey has
pitched four innings without giving up a run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is pro baseball's bottom rung. Hovey knows he's a few
hanging curveballs away from a real job. So far, he's enjoying his
pursuit of The Dream: hooking on with a major-league system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough. I would guess that the travel and the money
eliminates a lot of guys,'' Hovey said. ``I wouldn't trade it,
though. I feel lucky. I'm doing something that I love.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is talent in this league. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few Ducks have played on minor-league teams. Most are raw.
Kendall Rhodes, the starting pitcher, threw bullets most of the
night. Unfortunately, three pitches hit the backstop on the fly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least the Ducks' advertising department is major-league. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 ads cover the outfield wall at a minimum of $4,000.
The first inning has a sponsor. When a runner is caught stealing,
the P.A. man says: ``Fans, there's another runner that wouldn't
have got caught stealing if he'd have gotten his oil changed at Mr.
Smith's Fast Lube.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge said the ads are necessary to keep ticket prices low.
The most expensive seats cost $8 and include waiters who bring
food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some people think it's overcommercialized, but it has
to be from the revenue standpoint,'' he said. ``We always ask
ourselves: Will fans enjoy this or are we just prostituting
ourselves?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks will never be accused of being coldly corporate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that old-fashioned neighborliness is winning over residents
of Ozark, which has doubled in population since 1990. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kozal, who lives a few blocks from the stadium, focused
his eyes on the field as the team from Greenville, Miss., staged a
late-game rally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't always a Ducks fan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors in a new subdivision groused about the traffic
tie-ups, noise and lights the stadium created. Kozal complained,
too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But during his first game, Kozal started talking to a team
official about Homer, the Ducks' mascot. Could they use a backup,
he wondered? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before he knew it, Kozal got the gig. After a few public
appearances, he performed in his first game last weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a fan on this night, Kozal kept his eyes focused on Homer,
who gets as manic as Jim Carrey on a double espresso. Kozal watched
the duck romp. He watched the children laugh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were going down to defeat -- again -- but he was
smiling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought baseball could be this fun,'' he said. &QL;

SUPERINTENDENT CANDIDATES NARROWED DOWN TO TWO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The field of candidates for Kansas City
school superintendent is down to two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School board members are scheduled to meet privately with Pascal
Forgione Jr. at 7 p.m. Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second candidate, Benjamin Demps Jr., contacted the school
district late Friday to say he still is interested in the position.
An interview has not been scheduled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two other finalists no longer are candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The board's initial choice, Air Force Maj. Gen. Jay T. Edwards,
withdrew abruptly Thursday after he and board members were unable
to reach agreement on a contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grandview (Mo.) School Superintendent John Martin then told
school district officials he no longer was interested in the post. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members are being pressured by the court-appointed
Desegregation Monitoring Committee to name the next superintendent
by Friday from the original pool of candidates identified by a
selection committee dominated by the monitoring committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring committee member Charles McClain said he wasn't sure
what would happen if the board failed to reach agreement with
either of the two candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hope that isn't the case,'' McClain said.
``We're still hopeful something will happen next week.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, general administrator of the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission, returned to Oklahoma City on Thursday night after talks
with the board broke off. Reached Friday at his Oklahoma City
office, Edwards expressed disappointment about his Kansas City
experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the money that stopped me,'' Edwards said. ``It was
a combination of things that led me to believe I would be unhappy
and unsuccessful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said those included the lack of unified board support
and the board's refusal to grant him a three-year contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he feared long-term bureaucrats would resist any
changes he initiated, thinking they could simply wait out his
tenure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Kansas City said Edwards simply wasn't cut out
for the job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The general was a decent and dignified man who upon close
scrutiny probably lacked the temperament and fortitude to succeed
in this school district and develop a meaningful working
relationship with one of the primary constituencies _
African-Americans,'' district activist Clinton Adams Jr. said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Adams said, unlike some leaders in the black community, he
does not believe the next superintendent must be black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The next superintendent needs to have a demonstrated record of
working with African-Americans to address the educational needs of
African-American students,'' Adams said. ``In my view, it's myopic
and ignorant to think that only a black person can do that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios acknowledged Friday that Edwards
probably was not the best of the four finalists, but that politics
had clouded his thinking when he voted to support Edwards as the
finalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Rios said Forgione was the best candidate for the
position. Rios initially opposed Forgione because Missouri
Education Commissioner Bob Bartman and Arthur A. Benson II, lawyer
for the plaintiff schoolchildren in the desegregation lawsuit, both
were urging the board to hire Forgione. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he didn't want it to appear that others were dictating
whom the board should hire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lance Loewenstein said he believed a clear majority
of the board now supports Forgione for the job. At least three
other board members agreed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But board member Terry Riley said those board members may be
mistaken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just speculation,'' Riley said. ``Maybe (Loewenstein)
has talked to some board members, but he hasn't talked to all of
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lee Barnes Jr. reiterated that he will work with
whomever the board hires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that I am necessarily going to support it
when they vote,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he still is frustrated because he originally wanted
former candidate Grandview Superintendent John Martin for the
Kansas City post, but he was eliminated from the beginning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is always asked of us: `Will we support someone
if they aren't black?' '' Barnes said. ``Well, the question needs
to be asked of them: `Will they support someone if they're not
white?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he will not be forced to support any candidate, even
if that candidate is the only candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This process has tied the hands of each and every board
member. These people have been thrown down our throats,'' Riley
said. ``I think there are a lot of people who are out there who can
possibly do the job, and I don't think Forgione is the man.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Forgione was among five leading candidates for
superintendent of the Austin School District in Texas. The Austin
school board's top choice has since withdrawn as a candidate, and
the school board is expected to meet with its search consultant
next week to review a new group of candidates. Forgione may be
among that group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgione has been working as a consultant for Education
Secretary Richard Riley on a six-month contract since his term as a
commissioner at the U.S. Department of Education expired last
month. He formerly served as the state schools superintendent in
Delaware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps was a longtime official with the Federal Aviation
Administration before serving as the director of the Oklahoma
Department of Human Services from 1991 to 1994. He owns an aviation
consulting company, Demps Enterprises Inc. in Oklahoma City. &QL;

DRESS CODES AT CLUBS AND DISCOTHEQUES CHALLENGED AS RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Jamiah-Khaliq just wanted to dance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she and a group of friends showed up June 19 at Adolfo's
Discotheque, an upscale Kansas City nightclub at 1111 Grand Blvd.,
the 30-year-old dental student was wearing a two-piece navy suit.
She thought she measured up to the club's dress code. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But she was turned away, she said, because of her dreadlocks, a
hairstyle primarily worn by African-Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hairstyles and clothing do not make a person bad,'' she said.
``People obviously don't understand that this is discrimination.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Kansas City Human Rights Commission received a
complaint from another woman who said Adolfo's barred her because
of her hairstyle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll investigate them to determine whether this is'' racial
discrimination, said Michael Bates, the commission's director of
human relations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Adolfo's said that ``management feels that the
dress code is a reflection of the style of the club, and the items
listed in the dress code are not appropriate for the nightclub.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo's dress code for Friday and Saturday nights bans
dreadlocks and braids, jeans, tennis shoes, athletic wear,
neon-colored and spiked hair, hats, baggy clothing, untucked shirts
and FUBU clothing. (FUBU, which stands for For Us By Us, is a
clothing line that was started by a group of African-American men
in New York City.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo's, which is owned by Vincent Fries of southern Johnson
County, Kan., has 18 employees, 15 of whom are minorities, the
statement said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The club is the second at which issues of dress codes and race
have emerged recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Olathe, Kan., the owners of Roadhouse Ruby's South agreed in
June to change rules that forbid men from wearing corn rows, braids
or dreadlocks, and banned anyone wearing FUBU clothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roadhouse Ruby's South co-owner Vicki Robertson said that club's
dress code had been misunderstood and that the restrictions were
not intended to discriminate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This might have been a perception, and that is damaging to the
business,'' Robertson said. ``We've always enjoyed the company of
anyone that wanted to come in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the policy was aimed at the way patrons dress,
not their race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is profile clothing,'' Robertson
said. ``It's a clothing thing. We don't want kids coming in there
sloppy, with clothing that would be less than desirable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gueary III, president of the NAACP Olathe branch, said
Robertson told him that certain hairstyles were banned because a
security company told nightclub owners that corn rows, dreadlocks
and braids were typically worn by gang members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamiah-Khaliq sees dreadlocks differently. To her, they're one
of the most beautiful and natural hairstyles that an
African-American woman can wear. It allows women to stray from the
mainstream, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been called a gangster before,'' she said. ``We're
talking about them basing gang-related behavior on hairstyles and
clothing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP of Olathe received nine written complaints about
Roadhouse Ruby's South and several phone calls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Human Rights Commission did not receive complaints
about the Olathe business, but the commission's executive director,
Bill Minner in Topeka, Kan., said he was familiar with the dress
code and did not believe it violated the law because it was applied
to both black and white customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bates, of the Kansas City rights commission, disagreed with his
Kansas counterpart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly public accommodations can have a dress code, but if
that dress code is really designed to exclude certain groups of
people, then I disagree,'' Bates said. ``If we had a complaint
about that, we would take a very hard look at.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bates said that a local shopping center once identified patrons
wearing bandannas as troublemakers or gang members. Those people,
most of whom were black males, were asked to leave. Once commission
members worked with the mall, the policy was changed, he said. &QL;

FISCAL YEAR 2000 BEGINS WITHOUT A BUG IN KANSAS, MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas and Missouri say they began their
2000 budget year this week without a Y2K bug in sight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the rollover into the new fiscal year and everything
seems to be fine,'' said Morey Sullivan, an information resource
manager for the state of Kansas. ``If we were going to have
wholesale computer rejections it would have already happened.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A team of accountants and technicians fanned out across the
Kansas Y2K landscape Thursday but found nothing amiss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, Missouri and 44 other states began their 1999-2000
budget year Thursday. It was the first test of whether millions of
dollars worth of repairs had solved the states' Y2K problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a non-event,'' said Mike Benzen, Missouri's chief
information officer and president of the National Association of
State Information Resources Executives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the question becomes: Will Y2K glitches that fall through
the cracks begin to surface in the coming weeks and overwhelm the
states' ability to manage their business? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, said Don Heiman, chief information technology officer in
Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once ``I can cross the July 1 barrier comfortably, I've
mitigated 25 percent of my system risk,'' Heiman said. ``So, it's a
big date for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the fiscal boundary is significant because it tells
Heiman the state's Y2K testing procedures are sound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas didn't run into any data entry problems, even with as
many as 1,000 people logging onto the state's payroll and other
payment systems, Heiman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, however, the July 1 date is no big deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because most fiscal year dates are not used to calculate
the payments that thousands of state residents receive every month.
Bills are paid, food stamps are issued, Medicaid payments are made
and vouchers are tracked by actual dates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yardeni of Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, who predicts
a 70 percent chance of worldwide recession because of Y2K, warns
that ``non-event'' headlines may do more harm than good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent these 1999 sideshows are set up as major tests
of whether Y2K is or isn't a big deal and they turn out to be
non-events, then people become even more complacent,'' Yardeni
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a meteor shower last November was supposed
to cause havoc with our satellites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital.)What's the big deal?(end ital.) people said later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Euro monetary conversion was another harbinger of Y2K woe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital.)Who cares?(end ital.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians got through their new fiscal year, and airlines
began booking flights into 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital.)It was all hype.(end ital.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This still doesn't mean we're going to get through Y2K
unscathed,'' Yardeni said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the record, as of June 23 Kansas had spent $7.2 million of
its $25 million Y2K budget to fix 187 mission-critical systems and
was 83 percent compliant. Missouri had spent $36 million of its $57
million Y2K budget to fix 225 mission-critical systems and was 88
percent compliant. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:Making it ...  &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Last Wednesday was the day many companies set as their deadline
to complete their year 2000 repairs, and some used the deadline to
trumpet their success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. said it had found and
repaired its Y2K problems. Utilicorp United, which operates
Missouri Public Service, followed on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Systems that provide natural gas and electricity to customers in
its eight-state area are year 2000 ready, said Bud Jeffress,
director of Utilicorp's year 2000 project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We found very few items in our energy delivery systems that
needed to be corrected for year 2000,'' Jeffress said. ``We've
completed those necessary upgrades and replacements in systems
vital to providing the energy needs of our customers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp. said all
crucial systems ``required for safe and reliable continued plant
operation are Y2K ready.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has worked hard to ensure Wolf Creek will be online
Dec. 31, as well as Jan. 1,'' said Rick Muench, vice president of
engineering for Wolf Creek. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like all other area financial institutions, Commerce Bank was
required to complete its Y2K fixes by Thursday, and the St.
Louis-based financial institution said it made the deadline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on track with the regulatory requirements for year
2000 readiness,'' said Charles F. Erker, corporate vice president
for Commerce Bancshares. ``We feel confident in our program and
look forward to a smooth transition into the year 2000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some other area financial instutitions already had announced
they were compliant. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:Up in the air &QL; 
 &LR; txt:Despite visions of skydiving airplanes, some airlines say
bookings for Christmas and New Year's are as high as if not higher
than last year at this time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said bookings are up 5
percent over last year. And United Airlines, one of the world's
largest air carriers, reports that bookings are unchanged over last
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. computer reservation systems began accepting year 2000
travel requests on Feb. 4, easing fears that the Y2K bug could
snarl travel. &QL;

VICA'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR SKILLED WORKERS BENEFIT KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Don't bet against high school dropout Tony
Criscione achieving his career ambition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to teach at the college level,'' said the 28-year-old
Prairie Village, Kan., man and SkillsUSA-VICA finalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Criscione walked away from formal education a decade ago. Since
then he's found faith and a supportive wife, earned a high school
diploma and now stands just a few classes shy of a two-year
associate's degree from Johnson County (Kan.) Community College. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Virginia-based Vocational Industrial Clubs of America
Inc., he's also a reigning state champion and one of the nation's
best young practitioners at his skilled trade: heating, cooling and
ventilation equipment technician. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Criscione was one of 3,800 finalists who competed the past week
at the SkillsUSA-VICA national skills championships at Bartle Hall
in Kansas City Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth consecutive year the event has been in Kansas
City, and VICA officials announced this week they'll be back for at
least nine more years -- through 2008. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it here,'' said Stephen Danby, executive director of
the 34-year-old youth organization. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Danby said the Kansas City business and civic community's
financial assistance and volunteer support for the convention is
unprecedented. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels treat our young people like adults,'' he said. ``We
have an excellent working relationship with the convention and
visitors bureau. They're real professionals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This (VICA convention) didn't just come to Kansas City,''
Danby said. ``You people are doing your jobs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Reynolds, a VICA contest official and instructor at the
Kansas City Kansas Area Vocational Technical School, said the 80
computers loaned by Gateway Inc.'s Kansas City computer service
center are typical of the ``phenomenal'' level of community support
for VICA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Gateway stepped in, Reynolds said, students brought their
own computers to the competition. Readying that hodgepodge of
hardware for competition ``was a nightmare,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local unions contribute convention floor equipment and set-up
expertise, and scores of local companies provide judges, equipment
and supplies for the competition. Many more companies are
year-round VICA sponsors who furnish cash and other support to
VICA's classroom and on-the-job training programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VICA gives plenty back to Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chappell, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau
of Greater Kansas City, said VICA's 10,000 conventioneers spend
about $10 million while they're in town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And this year they left behind more than greenbacks from their
wallets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross collected 43 units of blood that will be
used by blood banks in Missouri and Illinois. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VICA also may have helped a few Kansas Citians find jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the organization set up a
public-access area where anyone could walk in, submit a resume via
e-mail, fill out a job application form and arrange for job
interviews with nearly three dozen participating companies, many of
them in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the organization will formally adopt the
SkillsUSA-VICA name it has used the past few years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some call VICA's annual competition the Olympics of everyday
life. High school and post-secondary education students such as
Criscione compete in 68 skilled labor events from computer repair
to welding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winners take home medals, scholarships and prizes of cash and
tools of their trade donated by a nationwide roster of sponsoring
businesses and corporations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily altruism on the part of private industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto industry will need 60,000 new auto technicians the
next few years,'' said Donald L. Gray, president and chief
executive of the industry's 3-year-old Youth Education Systems
group, which is active in training programs nationwide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that VICA plays a critical role in our
industry,'' Gray said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with a nationwide skilled labor shortage, many
industries are desperate for experienced and trainable new
employees and VICA's 250,000 members are at the top of many job
applicant lists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All week Bartle Hall's massive convention floor was a jumble of
stoves, engines, air conditioners, hair dryers, computer terminals,
lumber, electrical wiring and other appliances, devices, gadgets
and tools used in business and industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One area was set up as a restaurant, where food and beverage
service contestants waited on judge-diners and were scored on their
performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One competitor, Jessica DeMotte, a 17-year-old junior at the
Johnson County Technical Education Center, said she is preparing
for a career in the hospitality industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was a little girl the thing I love to do is
cook,'' DeMotte said. ``I hope someday to own my own restaurant.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, husband-and-wife team Gerald and Billie Randall
staffed a union booth at VICA's career and technical education
fair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City couple retired from TWA a few years ago but
remain active in Local 1650 of the International Machinists and
Aerospace Workers union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Randall observed that times have changed for skilled
workers. ``I came out of a cornfield'' in 1949, he said, when a
friend found him a job at the old Fairfax Airport in Kansas City,
Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people today have a lot more opportunity than I had at
that age,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two vocational and technical students from Missouri and
Kansas qualified for competition this year, and several won top
honors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Morche, from Johnson County Community College, won first
place in the post-secondary schools division for nail care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Harrisonville, Mo., team of Nanette Bosley, Cheri Graham,
Kelly Jennings and Misty Owens won second place in the
post-secondary Health Knowledge Bowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, Stefanie Ribbing, of Springfield, Mo., was elected to be
national VICA Post Secondary Division secretary. &QL;

MUSEUM PRESERVES EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Two weeks ago, the daughters of the late J.
Mett Shippee, a pioneering Kansas City, Mo., area archaeologist,
delivered their father's remarkable collection to the St. Joseph
Museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which includes most of Shippee's field notes,
encompasses more than 20,000 specimens, including pottery, spear
and arrow points, stone knives, ornamental items and numerous
tools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The items range in age from recent times back to what
archaeologists call the Paleo-Indian era, more than 10,000 years
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the finest and most comprehensive array of artifacts
ever assembled in the Kansas City region,'' said Jim Feagins, a
retired science teacher and a member of both the Missouri and
Kansas City archaeological societies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And because of the quality of Mett Shippee's field notes, it
is a gold mine of scientific value.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the collection's importance, Shippee's four daughters
spent years seeking a proper home for it. Initially they hoped to
place it in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Shippee's eldest daughter, Joan Wagner, who herself lives in
Kansas City, said that she and her sisters finally chose the St.
Joseph Museum because its staff seemed to understand the
collection's scientific value better than staffers at any Kansas
City facility they had visited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, sad to say, St. Joe seems to have a greater
appreciation for history than Kansas City,'' Wagner said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't tear things down or throw things away like Kansas
City does. And my father always wanted to preserve the past.'' &QL; 
Drawn to digs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shippee, who died in 1985 at age 89, was first drawn to
archaeology during a visit to Illinois when he was 11 years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While walking in a field there, he found a chipped-stone spear
point. And as he turned it in his hand, examining the fine
workmanship, something awakened in him that remained vibrant for
the rest of his life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hooked then and there,'' Wagner said. ``He was
absolutely fascinated by the idea that there had been other people
on that land, literally thousands of years before he was, people
who could make these wonderful objects.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his early adult years, Shippee earned his living as a
carpenter. But he was constantly drawn away from his paying job and
back to archaeological digs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most amateur ``pot hunters,'' he kept meticulous notes
and detailed diagrams related to everything he found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``From his voracious reading and study, he understood the value
of scientific methodology,'' Wagner said. ``He documented
everything down to the smallest detail.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shippee's observational abilities and intuitions as a field
archaeologist were often astounding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once while he was driving on old Route 10 through Avondale, Mo.,
with his daughter Helen, something caught his eye. He suddenly
braked the car, got out, walked into a field, and pulled a
beautiful stone point from the side of a hill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years later, while walking on a sandbar in a northwest Missouri
stream, he plucked a chipped point from beneath the sand. It was a
Clovis point, made by one of the still-mysterious nomadic hunters
who roamed the plains some 10,000 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each new discovery was for him a source of almost immeasurable
delight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wagner recalls a day in her childhood when her father drove home
in his old 1926 Ford. He was so excited he could barely talk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging in Platte County, near Riverside, Mo., he had
found a wonderful specimen, a large and beautifully made ceremonial
stone knife, perfectly preserved. It was, he estimated, several
thousand years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he was proud as a peacock that day,'' Wagner said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shippee's wife, Margaret, a brilliant woman with a strong
personality, had until then been dubious about his low-paying
archaeological work. She worried that it stole too much time from
making a living. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after that day, everything changed. She had been greatly
moved by his joy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it looks like your father is going to be doing this work
permanently from now on,'' she told her daughters. ``And I guess I
might as well just make up my mind to it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She then went back to college and became a teacher, and her
earnings were soon the family's main financial support. &QL; 
Smithsonian sends help &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Shippee sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington outlining his work up to that point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His letter so intrigued the Smithsonian's staff that they sent a
young professional archaeologist named Waldo Wedel to work with
Shippee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greatly impressed by Shippee's discoveries and notes, Wedel gave
him the equivalent of a post-graduate education in field technique.
And together they made some of the most significant finds in the
history of Midwestern archaeology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s they found and excavated two sites of major
importance. One, known as the Steed-Kisker site (after the
landowners on whose property the excavation took place), was
located on the east bank of the Missouri River between Farley and
Weston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There the two men uncovered the existence of a previously
unknown farming people whose hamlets had flourished along the river
between 1000 and 1250 A.D. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other major dig was near Riverside. There they found
convincing evidence that the ancient Hopewell people, whose
once-great culture was centered in Ohio and Illinois, had extended
their range into the Missouri Valley before 600 A.D. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, Shippee found significant traces of a much
older society near Missouri City. He named it the Nebo Hill site,
after a nearby church, and there he documented the existence of an
archaic culture that dated back as far as 3000 B.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Midwestern archaeology proved to be a fantastic field of
study,'' Feagins said. ``And Mett Shippee was right on the cutting
edge.''
`Salvage archaeologist' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As his work progressed, Shippee developed an ever-deepening
sense of kinship with the cultures whose traces he encountered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He would sit for hours pondering a specimen,'' Wagner said.
``I remember hearing him ask aloud, `How did the maker of this feel
as he worked? What did he think?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, gentle man, Shippee was rarely angered. But the
thought of untold archaeological treasures being bulldozed into
oblivion under new highways and subdivisions drove him into a
fury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His blue eyes just flashed with rage when he talked about
that,'' Wagner said. ``He knew that things of inestimable value
were being lost forever.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Shippee's friends in later years was a younger
archaeological enthusiast named Mike Fisher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mett spent his last years trying to save sites from
destruction,'' he said. ``He began to see himself as a salvage
archaeologist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is now working with the St. Joseph Museum team cataloging
Shippee's collection, a job that will take at least a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mett would be glad his work is here,'' Fisher said.
``He wanted to preserve history for everybody, not just for
academics or the rich. And that's what this place is all about.
It's for everybody.''

GREER DELIVERS WINNER IN NINTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers right-hander Rick Helling delivered
the game's first pitch in Texas' typical 90-degree July heat.
</P>
<P>
   That would pale in comparison to the emotions experienced last
night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame the sixth-inning ejections of second
baseman Luis Alicea and manager Johnny Oates and a ninth-inning
failure by closer John Wetteland to beat the Seattle Mariners, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer delivered shortstop Royce Clayton
across the plate with the game-winning run with a one-out,
ninth-inning single off Mariners left-hander Jordan Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second time this season and the 15th since the
start of the 1995 season that Greer drove in the game-winning run
during the Rangers' final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively as a team, we're playing with such confidence
that nobody panicked,'' said Clayton, who led off the inning with a
double against Mariners right-hander Ken Cloude (3-4). ``It was
like, `Now, let's just take care of business and take it from
here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something this team is getting a grip on. We're getting
some swagger and confidence, and there's no time like now to get
that going into the All-Star break and playing against teams in our
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer entered last night hitting .224 (24-for-107) during the
past 28 games, but the Rangers' red-headed outfielder came through
once again with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've been swinging the bat recently, it just feels
good to contribute,'' said Greer, who deposited a 3-1 fastball into
the gap in left-center field. ``I'm up there trying to find it on a
daily basis. One at-bat I feel good; the next at-bat I don't. I
just have to keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Rangers after Wetteland (2-2) failed to protect the
one-run lead that center fielder Roberto Kelly provided with his
one-out, eighth-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good win, and that's the point,'' said Wetteland, who
lost his bid for save No. 26 when Charles Gipson scored on the
sacrifice fly by shortstop Alex Rodriguez. ``It probably should
have ended a half hour earlier before it did. I'm not disappointed,
though. I threw the ball extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions swelled during the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the bottom half of that inning staring at a
5-2 deficit after the Mariners chased Helling during the top half
with their three-run, four-hit outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers rallied against Mariners left-hander Jamie
Moyer with consecutive one-out doubles by Greer and right fielder
Juan Gonzalez, and third baseman Todd Zeile and first baseman Lee
Stevens delivered two-out, run-scoring singles.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' single scored Zeile with the tying run and forced
Mariners manager Lou Piniella into his bullpen. Piniella summoned
right-hander Ken Cloude, who promptly loaded the bases by hitting
Clayton with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Alicea to the plate, whom Moyer retired twice on
called third strikes by plate umpire Marty Foster. Alicea worked
the count full before again watching a called third strike go by
with Foster behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Foster ejected Alicea for arguing balls and strikes and Oates
soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to the wrong people,'' Oates said of the
ejections. ``Go to the umpires' room if you want to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers escaped with their fourth consecutive
victory and extended their lead to seven games in the American
League West with Greer's ninth-inning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was I couldn't get my slider over the plate,''
Zimmerman said. ``I threw three sliders. They were all balls, and
he caught me on a fastball on the outside part of the plate. It's
my job to get a left-handed hitter out, and I just didn't get it
done.''

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN MURDER OF WOMAN WHO HELPED HIM ESCAPE PRISON

<P>
   Within hours of killing Tracy L. Hayes last November, Chipper
Cox turned himself in and confessed to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He admitted his crime again Friday in court, pleading guilty to
strangling Hayes with his hands and her bra after she helped him
escape from prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 31, must spend at least 25 years in prison before he can
seek parole under Friday's agreement between Chief Public Defender
Byron Cerrillo and Assistant District Attorney Rick Guinn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox pleaded guilty in Johnson County (Kan.) District Court to a
charge of first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life
sentence with parole eligibility after either 25 or 40 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors will not seek the
``Hard 40'' sentence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, 27, was left dead in a Shawnee, Kan., field Nov. 5. Cox
turned himself in to Oklahoma police and directed officers to her
body, which he had hidden under grass and pieces of clothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He told police that he killed Hayes after she refused to drive
him back to his minimum security work assignment outside the walls
of the Lansing Correctional Facility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She and Cox had a 9-year-old son together, and prosecutors said
he lured her into helping him by promising to give her thousands of
dollars to pay off her mounting debts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They alleged in court documents that he concocted phony letters
to convince her that someone had paid him a large sum of money for
protecting his son in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox was serving a 10- to 20-year sentence for the robbery and
attempted kidnapping of a woman in Edgerton, Kan., in 1992. He had
just been denied parole the month before the killing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' mother, Becky Hamill, was in the courtroom Friday to
witness Cox's plea. Afterward, she said she would have preferred to
see Cox get the death penalty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to squirm and be afraid like my daughter was,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamill said she has known Cox since he was a teen-ager. He has
always been a violent, foul-tempered ``conniver,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's done away with in prison,'' she said. ``I'll jump
for joy if it happens.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamill said her daughter was a loving spirit who was as close to
a perfect daughter as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Her problem was believing that scum,'' Hamill said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Thomas Bornholdt scheduled sentencing for Cox for
Aug. 6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guinn said the case would have not qualified for the death
penalty under Kansas law. He said the plea ensures that in all
likelihood Cox will die in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guinn said he would continue to pursue a battery charge filed
against Cox for allegedly assaulting a deputy in the Johnson County
Jail in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And sentencing is still pending for Cox in Leavenworth County,
where he pleaded guilty to a charge of escape. &QL;

Tech track coach Sholars charged with assault
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former assistant alleges she was bitten, punched
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The head coach of Texas Tech's men's and women's track and field
teams, Greg Sholars, has been charged with assault as a result of
an incident in which he allegedly bit and punched a female
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sholars has been charged with misdemeanor assault as a result of
a March 16 incident in which he allegedly bit and punched Trece
Hayslett, then one of Sholars' assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock County court records show the charge was filed June 1
and that Sholars was arrested June 11. He posted $1,000 bond and
was released.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence for misdemeanor assault is one year in jail
and a $4,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   According to an offense report prepared by Tech police, the
alleged assault occurred when Sholars and Hayslett argued in a
parked car on the Tech campus.
</P>
<P>
   The report states Hayslett immediately reported the incident to
Judith Henry, Tech's associate athletic director/senior woman
administrator, and was led to believe the matter would be
investigated by the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Hayslett showed Henry a bite mark on
her left thigh. The report also indicates Sholars later
acknowledged to Henry that he had bitten Hayslett's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Hayslett reported the matter to campus police May 5, the police
report states, following a meeting in which she believed she had
been verbally abused by Sholars. According to the report, she
provided police with a series of photographs she had taken soon
after the alleged assault, one of which shows a bruise and teeth
marks on her left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes Hayslett as saying she planned to take a leave
of absence from Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Although the alleged assault occurred three days after Tech's
first meet of the 1999 outdoor track season, Sholars continued to
coach the men's and women's teams. The Tech women finished 12th at
the NCAA championships on the strength of the performance of
distance runner Leigh Daniels, who placed first in the 10,000
meters and second in the 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tech athletic director Gerald Myers said Friday he could not
comment on the alleged assault because it is a personnel issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like that did happen _ and I'm not saying more
than if _ then we have policies in place to look into it,'' he
said. ``We would involve personnel (officials) and legal counsel.
That's not something we'd let slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact Sholars at his home and office Friday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Sholars' attorney, Jesse Mendez, declined to discuss specific
aspects of the case but said his client is not guilty of assaulting
Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you his position is he's not guilty of anything
he's been charged with,'' Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry declined comment, saying questions regarding the matter
should be directed to Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at her parents' home in Memphis, Tenn., Hayslett said
she did not want to comment on the details of the alleged assault
other than to say the police report is a true account.
</P>
<P>
   She said she initially did not go to police because she wanted
to protect Tech's track program and its athletes from negative
publicity and because she believed downplaying the incident would
improve her chances of becoming head women's track coach if the
program was split for the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   But as the spring wore on, she said, her responsibilities were
diminished and she became a target for harassment from Sholars and
other members of the track coaching staff. She said Sholars tried
to portray her as suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   When she mentioned her problems to Myers, she said, the athletic
director suggested she consider a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Myers) told me, `You can either work for him (Sholars), or
you can leave,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in which Sholars was particularly hostile,
Hayslett said, she decided to contact campus police and return to
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, I realized the only one who could protect me is
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayslett said she returned to Lubbock last week to put some
items in storage and meet with Henry. During the meeting, Hayslett
said, Henry asked her to return any items in her possession
belonging to the university and informed her that her last day of
employment would be June 30.
</P>
<P>
   She said Henry could not give her specific information regarding
Sholars but indicated Tech would turn over its entire track and
field staff by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said Hayslett's employment as an assistant coach ended
June 30 because her contract was up. He declined comment on
Sholars' status except to say an announcement would be
``forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sholars, 33, came to Tech as men's track coach in 1995 after
three years as assistant women's track coach and head women's cross
country coach at the University of Texas. He was given
responsibility for both the men's and women's track teams at Tech
when the programs were merged in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hayslett, 28, was hired by Sholars as an assistant coach at Tech
in 1997. She worked with hurdlers, jumpers and sprinters and had
responsibilities relating to recruiting and managing events. Before
coming to Tech, she worked as an assistant coach at Tulane and
Stephen F. Austin and as an intern in athletic administration at
UT.
</P>
<P>
   According to the offense report prepared by Tech police,
Hayslett said she and Sholars began arguing in Sholars' car March
16 because Sholars had taken a gun from her apartment without her
consent. She said Sholars left his vehicle with the gun, which was
in a case, and she left the vehicle with a pair of Oakley
sunglasses belonging to Sholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hayslett told police she went to her car with the sunglasses and
was pursued by Sholars, who beat on the window and asked loudly
that his sunglasses be returned. When she let him in her vehicle,
she said, he lunged for the sunglasses, which had fallen on the
floor, and bit her left thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Hayslett reported that Sholars also scratched her leg and
punched her twice with a closed fist on her right side. She told
police she went directly to Henry's office to report the incident
and showed the Tech official the teeth marks on her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hayslett's account, the police report includes a
summary of an interview with Henry conducted May 7 in which the
administrator described seeing a bruise and teeth marks on
Hayslett's leg. Henry also told police Sholars had voluntarily come
to her office the next week and admitted biting Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   Sholars, when contacted by campus police, said he did not want
to answer questions without first consulting an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Hayslett called the investigating
officer May 10 and 11 from Memphis stating that she did not want to
press charges against Sholars, in part because she feared she would
be subject to personal and professional retaliation. The report
states Hayslett was told the case would be presented to Lubbock
County prosecutors even if she wanted it dropped.

UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS LEARN ABOUT CITY PROGRAMS, IDEAS DURING KC
VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YANG JIANXIANG  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Two Ukrainian city officials concluding a
two-week visit to Kansas City said they enjoyed a city with
``fairy-tale'' beauty and an impressive level of citizen
participation in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one person or one place we met with or visited we did not
enjoy,'' Olena Maksymivna Pshenyshnyuk, deputy mayor of Pervomaisk,
said at a press conference Friday morning at the Greater Kansas
City Chamber of Commerce. ``What I have seen here exceeded my
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pshenyshnyuk and Valentyna Hryhorivna Zavadska, director of
Pervomaisk's Economic and Reforms Unit, came as part of a Community
Partnerships project pairing 18 Ukrainian cities with U.S.
counterparts. The three-year partnerships project, started a year
ago, provides training and education to local governments in
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Pervomaisk is a city of 82,800 people in south-central Ukraine.
It was a center of nuclear missile construction in the former
Soviet Union, and now faces the problem of shifting a heavily
military-based industrial base to a civilian one.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, the Ukraine officials observed a variety
of local government activities around the metropolitan area. They
toured a Missouri Area Agency on Aging office, participated in a
``Clean Sweep'' neighborhood clean-up in Kansas City and visited
the Summit Technology Campus in Lee's Summit, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   They also went to Whiteman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, Mo.,
where they watched U.S. technicians dismantle nuclear missiles once
aimed at the former Soviet Union. A team of three Kansas Citians
witnessed a similar scene in Pervomaisk last November.
</P>
<P>
   Pshenyshnyuk said she hopes the partnership between the two
cities could focus on business in the near future. The two
officials spent part of their time here trying to line up potential
retail outlets for Ukrainian crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to establish a business center in
Pervomaisk to promote economic development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pshenyshnyuk expressed thanks for three Y2K-compliant computers
donated by Sprint, which will be installed in the new business
center.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors said they were impressed by the ``very high level''
of citizen participation in government here. They said they believe
the right kind of government encouragement can promote greater
participation, and that was a focus of much of their conversation
with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were also amazed at the good working atmosphere
in all the places they visited. ``People talk openly and freely,
regardless of their positions,'' Zavadska said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainian guests said they had learned in advance that the
United States was a rich country offering ``many possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful country,'' Pshenyshnyuk said. ``We may not
achieve that level in the short term. But it is what we're looking
at in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The learning was reciprocal. Roger L. Kroh, director of Johnson
County's (Kan.) Department of Planning, Development and Codes, said
the exchange of views with the visitors made him more appreciative
of what Americans' ancestors have done with this country.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Davis III, associate director of the Civic Council of
Greater Kansas City, said he was now convinced that a truly
successful democracy starts with local government, not
``top-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pshenyshnyuk said the biggest surprise she had was witnessing
the crowd stand for the national anthem at a Royals' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people stood up, even children who might not know very
well what that means. It's a good way to show respect to your
country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zavadska was impressed with a retirement community they visited.
They talked with a resident whose grandparents came from Ukraine.
There are no such communities in Pervomaisk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is beautiful, like in a fairy tale,'' Pshenyshnyuk
said. She thought highly of the ``Clean Sweep'' activity, a Kansas
City program in which city workers and neighborhood volunteers
clean up a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials will depart for home today from Kansas City
International Airport. Another team of three from Kansas City will
leave for Pervomaisk in August.

AL EXEC ASKS TORRE NOT TO PICK GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Phyllis Merhige, the American League's senior
vice president, advised Yankees manager Joe Torre not to select
Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez as a reserve for the 1999
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Merhige determined yesterday that Gonzalez does not plan to
attend the All-Star Game if selected after conversations yesterday
with Rangers officials. Gonzalez reiterated that position before
last night's game at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Merhige also spoke with Torre in New York, but the final
decision rests with the Yankees' manager, who will select the
league's pitchers and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just do my job, and that is make my choices,'' said
Torre, who will manage the AL. ``If Juan chooses not to go, I'll
choose somebody else. I hope he comes, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez refused to budge from his position despite yesterday's
plea from Torre. Gonzalez remains miffed by the balloting process
and described it as ``a popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' two-time AL most valuable player remains fifth in
the balloting behind Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. and Cleveland's
Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton and David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to recharge my batteries and come back strong for
the second half to help my team,'' Gonzalez said. ``I don't play
for the league. I play for the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, whose contract calls for him to receive a $50,000
bonus if selected to play in the All-Star Game, appreciated Torre's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with Joe,'' Gonzalez said. ``Joe is a
great guy and a great manager.''

JOHN MULLIN, 85, WHOSE MAGNETIC TAPE FREED RADIO BROADCASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John T. Mullin, who brought broadcasting and the record industry
together with the magnetic audiotape technology that revolutionized
them in the late 1940s, died June 24 at his home in Camarillo,
Calif. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical engineer, Mullin became interested in magnetic
audiotape when he was a lieutenant with the U.S. Army Signal Corps
in England in 1943. He heard, inexplicably, what sounded like live
classical music, free of clicks and scratches, coming 24 hours a
day from a German radio station.
</P>
<P>
   After the war ended, Mullin was sent to Paris, where he
discovered two German magnetophones, high-fidelity magnetic
audiotape recorders.
</P>
<P>
   He then brought the machines to the United States, where he and
a colleague, William Palmer, improved them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, their creation was the first machine in the United
States to produce a master tape that was turned into a commercial
recording, ``Songs by Merv Griffin.''
</P>
<P>
   The masters from which records were produced had until then been
made by recording directly onto an acetate disk, which made editing
almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bing Crosby was so impressed with the quality of the tape's
sound and, especially, the ability to edit recordings that he
backed Mullin and Palmer financially.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Crosby, who hated live performances, used the
technology to record his show on the ABC network, ``Philco Radio
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first coast-to-coast commercial broadcast using
magnetic tape instead of a live performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin and Palmer also used the ability to edit audiotape for
less artistic purposes. For Crosby's show, at the singer's behest,
they made some of the first laugh tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Using scissors and tape, the pair added applause and laughter to
tapes of live performances that didn't inspire enough audience
reaction or that weren't really live at all.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Mullin and Palmer, working with Ampex
Corp., made the first commercial audiotape recorder, called Model
200. And in 1951, Mullin and another engineer, Wayne Johnson,
working again with Crosby Enterprises, also developed a prototype
of the video camera, which they called ``the filmless camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, known as Jack, was born Oct. 5, 1913, in San Francisco.
He graduated from Santa Clara University with an engineering
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Besides working with Crosby Enterprises and Ampex, Mullin spent
28 years at the 3M Company, which bought Crosby's electronics
company in 1956, as the head of its Mincom division. He retired in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Eve Collier of Camarillo; two
sons, John C., of Los Osos, Calif., and Peter B., of Huntington
Beach, Calif., and three grandchildren.

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Two-time champion and noted commentator
Ned Jarrett has a reputation as one of the foremost experts on
stock-car racing, but his bosses at CBS Sports might want to
re-evaluate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup season hits the midway point with the running of
the Pepsi 400 tonight at Daytona International Speedway, and
Jarrett said the guy to beat in the points race is not the guy in
first, second, third or fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's favorite is the driver in fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way they run, the way they approach things, he is
still the man to beat, even as far back as he is,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jarrett isn't so crazy. ``He'' is three-time champion
Jeff Gordon, and although Gordon is 314 points behind leader Dale
Jarrett, Gordon's No. 24 DuPont Refinishes Chevrolet looms large
going into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never count the 24 car out,'' said Jimmy Makar, crew
chief of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac that Bobby Labonte
has driven to second place in the standings. ``That's a very
capable race team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to the talents, reputations and accomplishments
of Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham that they would even be
mentioned as a possible team to beat in the second half,
considering the hole they dug in the first 16 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be leading the points and have guys try to
knock me off than be where we're at,'' said Gordon, who led after
the 17th race last year en route to his third championship in four
years. ``We have a lot more work to do from where we're at now than
we would if we were leading.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of work might be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Gordon in fifth place, but he trails a veritable
who's who of NASCAR superstars. Jarrett is first, followed by Bobby
Labonte, Mark Martin and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett might be due to win his first championship. The driver
of the No. 88 Quality Care/Ford Credit Ford finished third in the
points in 1996, second in '97 and third last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since getting caught up in a wreck and finishing 37th at the
season-opening Daytona 500, Jarrett has dominated. He has won two
races, finished in the top five 12 times, and in the top 10 14
times. He is 157 points ahead of Labonte, the biggest lead of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically haven't had any problems since Daytona,'' Jarrett
said. ``There's been days that we've struggled, but we've made
something of it. Hopefully, we can continue and the next time I'm
in Daytona, we'll be talking about my first Winston Cup
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is having the best season of his career, despite four
finishes of 24th or lower. He has won twice and finished in the top
five 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can gain on things even more through the rest of
the year,'' said the Texas native, whose best Winston Cup finish
came last year, when he was sixth. ``We've got a long ways to go.
We're just trying to run every race just as good as we can and
we're not going to worry about the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is having his usual season of quiet, consistent
excellence. The driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford, who has been in
the top five in points eight times this decade, has won once and
finished in the top 10 in 13 of the first 16 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the performance of this team,'' he
said. ``We may not have won as many races as last year yet, but
there have been many races that we were in a position to win. Even
though we may not have the best car every week, if we are
consistently competitive, we will be up front to capitalize on an
opportunity to win a race that we might not have dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton is the only one of the drivers leading Gordon who isn't
running well at the moment. He finished 36th and 24th in the past
two races, and starts 37th tonight after blowing an engine in
qualifying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Burton was good enough earlier in the season to win
three races this year and to finish in the top five nine times, and
expects to turn it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're going to go out and win 10 of the next 16
races, but I am saying that I think we'll have the chance to win
some races,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that foursome ahead of him, it will be difficult for Gordon
to ascend to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Mark Martin, Jeff
Burton, those guys have just really been doing what they need to
do, and that's finishing up front and winning races,'' Gordon said.
``As long as they're doing that, we're going to have a tough time
catching them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will have to avoid the problems that plagued him thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly invincible driver was shockingly mortal at times
in the first half. He failed to finish four races, including the
Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on March 28, when he hit the
wall in Turn 4 and finished last for the first time in his career.
He had only two DNFs all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've got going against them this year that they
haven't in the past few years is the luck factor, that bad
fortune-good fortune thing,'' Ned Jarrett said. ``They were in
quite a few situations in years past that I'd see them drive
through, around and not get involved in. This year, they seem to be
getting caught up in things. That's all it takes in this business
to find yourself down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, though, is back up at the moment. He climbed three spots
in the standings in the past four weeks with one victory and three
second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, team morale is good, and our confidence level is
there,'' Gordon said. ``We feel like we're capable of winning each
time we go out. We're performing excellent right now. We've got the
consistency, and that's what we need to continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps it up, Ned Jarrett's prediction of Gordon as the man
to beat in the second half might not seem so crazy after all.

DIGITAL ERA DAWNS FOR SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMUS, N.J. _ As a theater at the Loews Cineplex filled for a
showing of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' Peter
Melnyk, a movie projectionist for 28 years, repeated the ritual of
his trade, spraying air into the innards of a 1960s projector to
clear dust before lacing the celluloid film through its spools.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he and the Century projector were there as a
backup. In this theater, one theater in Secaucus, and two theaters
in suburbs of Los Angeles, George Lucas' high-tech hit was
projected from a computer hard drive by a technician wielding a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Lucas and 20th Century-Fox began these four-week
runs of the movie to test two new competing types of digital
projectors, which use banks of hard drives, microchips, prisms, and
liquid crystal arrays to beam a film onto a standard screen.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience from the 1 p.m. show filtered out of the
theater, viewers gushed over what they had just seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it the old-fashioned way, and this just blows it away,''
said John Rybacki, who is a video technician from Norwood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Another film, ``An Ideal Husband,'' produced by Miramax Films,
is being shown until July 15 using the digital projection method at
the Clearview Chelsea 9 in Manhattan and at the Laemmle Sunset 5 in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 5 to 10 years, film industry experts say, digital cinema is
likely to begin replacing film reels. That will allow the industry
to distribute movies from studios to theaters via coded satellite
links, avoiding the high cost and delay of making thousands of
prints of a new movie and shipping them across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd. president Gordon Radley said the decision to
unveil digital projection to the public came after Lucas decided
the digital projectors were as good as existing film projectors. At
a side-by-side screening of celluloid and digital versions of ``The
Phantom Menace'' for movie business executives and journalists in
Los Angeles in mid-June, he said, half of the audience could not
guess which was which.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, which is also eager to shift to digital pictures,
decided to hold its own screenings, said Mark Gill, president of
Miramax's Los Angeles division. Gill said the company chose a
period piece with many subtle cinematographic touches, so that
audiences would understand the method can be used with any movie.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has already realized the benefits of the new
projection method. When a movie is an unexpected hit, cinemas in
small towns will no longer have to wait for one of the few
remaining copies to be shipped to them. And when a movie is a
box-office bomb, there will be no wasted cost in making piles of
prints, at up to $2,000 apiece, with no cinemas interested in
showing them, said Michael Targoff, the chairman and chief
executive officer of Cinecomm, which is jointly owned by Qualcomm
Inc. and Hughes-JVC. His company made the digital copies of the
Star Wars film that are being shown in Paramus and Winnetka,
Calif., using projectors made by Hughes-JVC Technology.
</P>
<P>
   A competing digital projection system, made by Texas
Instruments, is being tested in Secaucus, N.J., and Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz has already been spreading. The digital showing of
``The Phantom Menace'' in Paramus attracted amateur technofiles
from as far away as Maryland, said the staff at the theater. Studio
executives from Sony and Disney, as well as owners of other theater
chains, also visited to gauge audience interest and assess the
quality of the picture, said Kevin Romano, a co-founder of
Cinecomm. It will be shown at the theater until July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The transition to digital cinema is not likely to be quite as
smooth as Romano predicted, with industry experts saying the
studios and theater owners have not even begun to negotiate who
will pay what share of the cost of switching to the new projection
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the first audiences for the new method seemed awed by what
they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people who had seen the previous showing of the movie
stayed afterward for a tour led by Romano. He explained that it
takes three weeks to scan all the frames in a 14,000-foot-long
movie, the length of ``The Phantom Menace,'' turn it into more than
a trillion zeros and ones, the basic code of the digital era, and
then compress that data.
</P>
<P>
   In the booth for the digital screening, Richard Sutton, a
technician for Hughes-JVC, clicked his mouse on the ``play'' icon
on a monitor, and the trailers, advertisements and finally the film
itself rolled.
</P>
<P>
   The system works like a home projection television, with each
movie moment dissected into its red, green and blue components,
which are recorded separately and then projected as three beams of
light. When the three beams merge at the screen, the viewer sees
the full-color scene. But in the digital system, every frame of a
movie is recorded as hundreds of thousands of bits of information
so that the subtlest nuance of shading or color is captured exactly
as it was originally filmed.
</P>
<P>
   As Melnyk watched the digital movie projector upload the sci-fi
epic, he recalled the days when he danced between two projectors,
readying each successive 20-minute reel of a film to run seamlessly
as the preceding one ended, and replacing the burning carbon
filaments in the light source every 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future _ I'm looking at it,'' Melnyk said of the
digital projector, even as his old projector started up in tandem
and the film snaked into the projector.
</P>
<P>
   But the lamp would be flicked on only if there was some
unexpected glitch. There was none.

EDITORIAL: PRESERVING PEACE IN BELFAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   Five days of intense negotiating in Northern Ireland have not
yet produced an agreement to let the historic peace plan signed
last year go forward. To fill the dangerous vacuum, the British and
Irish governments Friday offered a public proposal for Northern
Ireland's politicians to take back to their constituents for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inflammatory season of summer marches begins Sunday,
and agreement has been elusive so far, acceptance is not assured.
But we can hope that a few days' consultation with their rank and
file will allow Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams to build enough support for the plan to
overcome the objections of the extremists in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse is over the issue of disarming Sinn Fein's armed
colleagues in the Irish Republican Army. Trimble is supposed to
head a new government for Northern Ireland, but balked at allowing
Sinn Fein members into the cabinet while the IRA still holds its
guns. The peace agreement signed last year simply commits the
parties to doing what they can to get armed groups to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The plan offered by London and Dublin is based on a new,
optimistic report by an international commission that has been
supervising disarmament talks, which indicates that the IRA has
softened its opposition and may now be willing to give up all its
weapons by next May. Under the plan, Trimble would form his
government _ with Sinn Fein _ on July 15, and would receive formal
self-governing powers from Britain. The IRA would not commit to
disarming, but Sinn Fein would agree that the Northern Ireland
government would be dissolved if the IRA failed to meet deadlines
for disarmament over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have until July 15 to respond _ a shrewd deadline
that keeps the plan, and thus incentive for good behavior, alive
during the marches of the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has not committed to the plan, but did praise it, saying
that the two sides' joint participation in government would give
the IRA confidence to disarm. This is a significant change from the
IRA's earlier announcements that it would never disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who reportedly endorsed the plan only to see it
rejected by others in his party, says he needs a hard commitment
from the IRA before letting Sinn Fein into the cabinet. He should
instead help his hard-liners recognize that they have gotten much
of what they demanded. &QL;

FATHER-SON TEAM RIDES MOTORCYCLE TO RECORD BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some fathers and sons are happy enough to toss a
baseball around, but not ``Super Joe'' Reed and 5-year-old ``Super
Joey'' Reed, a pair of motorcycle daredevils from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the daring duo took a shot at the record books with a
death-defying leap before a screaming pack of Super Joey's
playmates, some 40 kids at the Spoonful of Sugar Child Care Center
in Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite safety concerns, the stunt did not come under the
scrutiny of the Los Angeles Police Department or other public
safety officials since it was held on private property.
</P>
<P>
   The Reeds' quest to make The Guinness Book of Records took Joey
13 feet over plywood ramps as he straddled the gas tank of a
motorcycle driven by his father _ who was wearing a blindfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good today because I jumped with my daddy,'' Joey
shouted at his friends over a bullhorn. ``I was all protected
because I have safety gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You did good Joey,'' said 5-year-old Cody Bausch.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to make father proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other team like us in the world,'' said Joe Reed,
41, who makes a living as a Federal Express deliveryman when not
wearing his tasseled, red-white-and-blue leather daredevil suit.
``We'll come back and keep breaking and setting records.''
</P>
<P>
   The record, in this case, is the farthest jump by the oldest and
youngest daredevils on the same bike, with the driver blindfolded.
Owing to the specificity of the record, it is in jeopardy of being
broken only by the Reeds themselves, said the elder Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he began riding with his son last year and had to coax
his wife to let him introduce their son to the world of
professional daredevils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would much prefer that they didn't do it, but if they're
going to at least it's with someone whose safe about it and knows
all the ins and outs of the business,'' said Reed's wife, Jennifer
Reed, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Reed, a motocross racer who turned daredevil in 1983, said
he took many safety precautions including using protective clothing
and helmets on himself and his son.
</P>
<P>
   He wore three cloth blindfolds and was guided over the ramp by
radio instructions from fellow daredevil ``Jumpin' Jamie''
Pamintuan.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in the audience relished the danger and showered Joey
with chats of ``Jo-ey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awesome,'' Kevin Betsayad, 5, said after the first
jump.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Joey flashed two thumbs up in true show-biz style.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Reed said he does not necessarily want his son to
become a daredevil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just us playing around. I'll leave it up to him if he
wants to do it on his own later in life,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, he said his son would take on the record
set in England in 1979 when a 9-year-old jumped 14 feet through a
ring of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he's 6 he'll break that record,'' Reed said of his
son. ``He'll go farther and he'll do it blindfolded with me
training him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said his most recent Guinness Record-setting stunt was to
jump 65 feet between two 14-story buildings in downtown Los Angeles
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   His next goal is to do what his hero, Evel Knievel, tried but
fell short of completing 25 years ago: flying over a 2,600-foot
span of Snake River Canyon, Idaho, in a rocket-powered bike this
fall.

CLINTON TO ANNOUNCE VENTURE CAPITAL PLAN FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small businesses in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in
Arizona will get the same kind of economic boost that gave Intel
Corp. and Federal Express Corp. their start under a plan President
Clinton will announce Wednesday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new investment company being formed will be the first of its
kind in the nation aimed at ``New Markets,'' companies locating or
hiring in lower-income areas such as south and central Phoenix,
White House officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Six major banks in the Valley already have committed $5 million,
the minimum needed to form the Small Business Investment Company,
to be called Magnet Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers, led by the Arizona MultiBank, have been forming the
plan and raising money since September. On Wednesday, Clinton will
officially announce their application for a license for the
investment company.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers say this is what Clinton will deliver to the
Valley, specifically to lower-income areas in Phoenix. For small
businesses, the investment company will fill the huge gap that
exists in Arizona between traditional bank loans and big-bucks,
hard-to-get venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the right things and do them in a businesslike
manner,'' said Andrew Gordon, president of the Arizona MultiBank.
``Only with profits can we sustain our positive impact in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBIC is an example of the private investment Clinton hopes
to encourage on his tour next week. About 336 similar investment
companies already operate in the United States, with $9.9 billion
invested or ready to invest. But the Phoenix firm will be the first
to apply under new rules aimed at developing investment in New
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet &UR; Capital is expected to open next spring. It will
emphasize investment in lower-income areas but will do deals
statewide, said Gordon and Mike Shields, national projects manager
for Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One, Wells Fargo Bank, Arizona MultiBank, Sears National
Bank, Union Bank of Arizona and Northern Trust Bank have signed on
as investors. More are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet &UR; Capital will be a for-profit, limited partnership with
separate management from the MultiBank. Shields and Greg Mischel, a
former Bank of America executive and small-business consultant,
will be the general partners and managers of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It will look for younger, fast-growing companies that don't
necessarily have enough tangible assets or income to get bank
loans. &UR; Instead it will provide ``patient capital,'' Gordon and
Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   It will look to invest in manufacturing, wholesale and service
businesses, ``non-glamorous'' companies that do an estimated $96
billion in sales in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be looking for a business in the less glamorous
category than high tech and the Internet; the more common kind of
manufacturing, wholesale and service-sector businesses,'' Shields
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``They will be generally younger businesses that appear to be
growing rapidly and that have a need for `patient' capital,
generally less than $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona MultiBank is a non-profit corporation founded in
1992 as an initiative of the Arizona Bankers Association to finance
deals considered too risky for traditional banks. Since then, it
has made 203 loans totaling $12.7 million, with 86 percent of the
deals going to small businesses and the rest to non-profit
corporations and affordable housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The MultiBank started seriously investigating the idea of an
SBIC last fall, Gordon said, when it started seeing more businesses
that need equity financing rather than loans.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers made a presentation to the SBA in February, about the
same time the proposed regulations on New Markets investment
companies came out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The banks are interested in Magnet Capital because they already
have branches and employees in lower-income areas, and this could
help grow businesses that could become their customers, Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The U.S. Small Business Administration, which oversees the SBIC
program, plans to offer a number of incentives to the investment
companies. Some of them:
</P>
<P>
   The SBA will double or triple the private investment, allowing
SBICs to borrow millions of dollars in additional capital at
favorable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The SBIC will not have to make payments to the government for up
to five years, allowing it to be ``patient'' with the companies it
invests in.
</P>
<P>
   The SBIC would be allowed to own a controlling interest of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SBICs also would have the chance to make greater profits,
because they could negotiate for warrants or stock options, which
can pay off handsomely if a company prospers.
</P>
<P>
   SBICs have generated returns of 8 percent to 19 percent over the
past four years, but that is considered conservative because many
of the investments are still with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gordon and Shields believe the Valley has plenty of companies
with untapped potential for the new SBIC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Despite the large amount of economic growth we've seen in
Phoenix and Arizona, I'm not sure some of the underserved
geographical markets have moved along at the same pace,'' Shields
said. ``I think there are wonderful opportunities out there.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: Y2K LIABILITY LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's ill-advised turnabout on
legislation designed to limit the liability of computer and
software manufacturers for year 2000 computer problems will hurt
consumers and small businesses. The Y2K defect is in some computers
and software that record years by the last two digits. Unless
corrected, the glitch could cause serious malfunctions when the
date rolls over to 2000 and a computer confuses that with 1900. For
months the White House voiced opposition to both House and Senate
bills that would restrict the legal rights of those injured by a
Y2K computer failure.
</P>
<P>
   But with the high-tech industry worried about frivolous lawsuits
and demanding legal protections, the White House changed its tune
and agreed to a compromise that is not much better than earlier
bills it had rejected. The compromise bill's provisions would not
merely discourage frivolous suits, they would reduce the rights of
those with legitimate claims. Worse, they might lessen the
incentive for industry to identify and correct Y2K problems before
they arise. The bill, approved by Congress on Thursday, would make
it harder to bring class-action suits. It caps punitive damages at
$250,000 against companies with fewer than 50 employees and gives
companies 90 days to cure a Y2K problem before they can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also suspend ``joint and several'' liability, the
legal principle that makes any defendant liable for the entire
judgment in case other responsible parties cannot be sued or are
otherwise unable to pay. The bill would limit financial liability
in most Y2K cases to a formula based on a defendant's share of
responsibility, a significant departure from tort law principles
designed to fully compensate injured plaintiffs. Only in cases
brought by individual consumers would joint and several liability
still apply. Just two months ago, the administration said it would
accept a change to these liability rules only for defendants who
had taken steps to prevent or minimize Y2K breakdowns. The
compromise bill fails to include this crucial requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the bill addresses a unique problem and
will not set a precedent for broader tort reform. The bill applies
only to Y2K-related claims arising before 2003. But people and
businesses with losses caused by the Y2K bug will find it harder to
get redress from those responsible.

BONDS' TWO HOMERS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adrian Beltre had a chance to atone for Carlos
Perez. Instead he strained a groin muscle. What else is new with
the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had a two-run homer Friday night at Dodger Stadium that
shook the frustrated sellout crowd of 53,869 and appeared to give
the struggling Perez a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Giants' 6-3 victory belonged to Barry Bonds, who
had two of the four home runs off Perez. Bonds came in 3 for 18
lifetime against Perez with no homers and just one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He left after handing the Dodgers their fifth straight loss, one
that dropped them 9{ games behind the first-place Giants to open a
mini, three-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   As for Beltre, one of the bright spots in the Dodgers' miserable
season, he left after the fifth inning with a tight groin. He will
be evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   There was no one to take up the slack. Todd Hollandsworth,
starting in place of Gary Sheffield (flu) in left, went 0 for 4
with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, the Dodgers had a chance to tie the game
when Dave Hansen opened with a walk and Jose Vizcaino singled him
to third. Pinch hitter Greg Counsell brought out the Giants
left-hander Alan Embree to replace starter Chris Brock (5-6).
</P>
<P>
   Counsell sacrificed both runners up, but Eric Young, who went 0
for 4, bounced to third and Hansen was thrown out at the plate.
Hollandsworth took a called third strike to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Bernard led off the top of the ninth with a home run off
Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw. It was the Giants' fifth homer, the most
in one game since August 1995 against Philadelphia. Robb Nen, who
allowed a ninth-inning, game-winning homer to Todd Hundley last
Saturday, pitched the ninth for his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was a test for all the Dodgers, who came in with
four consecutive losses and were still in last despite the
fourth-place Colorado Rockies having lost eight straight.
</P>
<P>
   Perez (2-9) was coming off his best outing last Saturday even
though he received a no decision in the Dodgers 7-6
come-from-behind victory in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This time he showed improved velocity, especially in the strike
zone. After retiring the first two batters in the first, Bonds
launched a 2-1 fastball over the fence in right center.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks opened the fourth with a home run, his 12th. Two
batters later, shortstop Rich Aurilia drove a 1-0 fastball into
dead center for his 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by three runs, the Dodgers came back. Hot-hitting Eric
Karros lined a one-out double into the left-field corner off Brock
Hundley followed with a sharp single to right. One out later,
Beltre drove a 1-1 fastball into the left field stands to tie the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Karros came batting .410 (15 for 36) in his last 10 games and
.357 (30 for 84) with six homers and 15 RBI in his last 23.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, batting over .300 most of his first full season, dropped
to .290 with an 0-for-10 slump.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Perez retired the first two batters for the fourth
time in the game before going to a 3-2 count on Bonds. Perez threw
him a fastball and Bonds hit it into the right-field stands for a
4-3 Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent followed with a double to left and scored on a single
by Burks. Perez got out of the inning but was pulled after walking
Aurilia to open the sixth. In five innings Perez threw 90 pitches,
allowing six hits and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' fifth-inning shot marked the 34th multi-homer game of his
Hall of Fame career. Last September, Bonds became the first player
in major-league history to record 400 homers and 400 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   After missing 47 games due to surgery on a torn left tricep
tendon, Bonds is starting to show his old form. He was 1 for 17
after coming off the disabled list, but came to the plate in the
first inning 12 for 40 (.300) with two homers, eight RBI and 10
walks since the slump.

DODGERS LOSE IN HIDE-N-SEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When that wacky major-league schedule finally
brought the San Francisco Giants to Dodger Stadium Friday night _
just about two months into the season _ you wondered if they'd have
the nerve to show up.
</P>
<P>
   After their shameful display last weekend at 3Com Park, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Not losing two out of three games to the Dodgers, shameful as
that might have been.
</P>
<P>
   What was disgraceful was pulling the hidden-ball trick on the
Dodgers in the Saturday afternoon game.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, taking advantage of the weak-minded that way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, generations of Californians, southern and northern,
have understood the Giants will stop at nothing to frustrate the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Candlestick Park groundskeeper used to muddy the baselines
to slow Maury Wills. Dick Dietz tried to end Don Drysdale's shutout
streak by (begin ital)letting(end ital) a pitch hit him; he didn't
get away with it. In the notorious case of Juan Marichal and Johnny
Roseboro, the Giants resorted to bopping their rival on the head
with a stick; Marichal got off light with a $1,750 fine and an
eight-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows what Gaylord Perry had up his sleeve?
</P>
<P>
   All in the spirit of competition, those things.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the Giants sank too low.
</P>
<P>
   We already knew the Giants were the savvy, resourceful team and
the Dodgers were the brawny, big-money team.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden-ball trick?
</P>
<P>
   That was rubbing it in.
</P>
<P>
   It happened with two out in the fourth inning, with Chris Brock
on the mound for the Giants, after Dodgers pitcher Carlos Perez
legged out a bunt single that scored Devon White with the run that
made the lead 3-1 in a game Los Angeles won 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Giants first baseman J.T. Snow realized he had a
live one, like guy with a shell game spotting a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close play,'' Giants first baseman J.T. Snow said
before Friday's game, ``and when I turned around to see the
umpire's call, I saw that Perez and the first-base coach (John
Shelby) had their backs turned, so they wouldn't know if I threw
the ball back to Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow tucked the ball in his glove and hovered near first base as
Perez sauntered back to the bag, conversing with Shelby as he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mouthed to Chris that I had the ball, and he nodded,'' Snow
said. ``Pitchers are good guys to use it on because they're not on
base that much. (Perez) was a good guy to try it with because he's
emotional. He gave it a little (celebration) when he was called
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick depended on Brock's acting ability, on Perez's sloppy
fundamentals and nobody else in blue shouting a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Brock had to look busy until Perez wandered off the bag, an
assignment complicated by the rules that say standing on the
pitching rubber without the ball constitutes a balk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Giants had to hope Perez wasn't taught to stay on
the base until the pitcher toes the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing about the play was that Chris got up on the
mound, and that's when Perez stepped off the bag. I couldn't tag
him then, because Chris was near the rubber,'' Snow said. ``I just
kind of stared at Chris and looked over at Perez.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock took the non-verbal cue and walked off the back of the
mound, as if he was going to the resin bag. Perez, a few feet off
the base, looked stunned when Snow slapped him with his glove and
umpired Charlie Reliford delivered an emphatic ``out'' call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about doing a little dance myself,'' said Snow,
referring to the shimmy with which Perez punctuates strikeouts _ to
the annoyance of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco fans loved it so much, a video clip of the play is
a new fixture on the Giants Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden-ball trick is something you pull on your kid brother
who doesn't quite understand the game. It rarely fools
big-leaguers. It's rarely (begin ital)tried(end ital) against
big-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker said this was the second time he'd
seen it work in 27 years as a major-league player, coach and
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're all professionals,'' said Giants second
baseman Jeff Kent, ``and we know where the ball's going. Plus
you've got 25 guys in the other dugout _ plus coaches _ to help the
runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't work, it kind of backfires on you,'' said Snow.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the runner catches on, (begin ital)you're(end
ital) the idiot.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Dodgers-Giants rivalry runs these days, it's no
surprise the stunt worked.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry has changed since the days of Wills, Marichal and
Perry, when the best the Giants could do was nip at the Dodgers'
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have gone 64-61 against the Dodgers in the 1990s. The
Giants have put up 26 more regular-season wins than the Dodgers
since the start of 1986 and finished higher in the National League
West standings in seven of those 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-3 victory Friday _ with Brock defeating Perez but without a
hidden-ball trick _ kept the Giants at the top of the division and
the Dodgers at the bottom. No longer do the Giants live to
frustrate the Dodgers. And the Dodgers are plenty frustrated with
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants are a talented club (and) they know what it takes
to win,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, asked about
the contrast during batting practice Friday. ``I think we've got
talent comparable with any team we play. We have winning players.
Now we need to come together and be a winning (begin ital)team(end
ital).''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the tricks the Giants seem to know and the Dodgers
need to learn. &QL;

BAKER HAS NO PITY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the essence of Dodger baseball is being
challenged on a daily basis, and now from the unique perspective of
last place, it is disconcerting to see Dusty Baker in a San
Francisco Giants uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he has been wearing one for 12 years now, the last
seven as manager, doesn't change the feeling. The Dodgers no longer
look like the Dodgers. But when you look at Baker, even in the
Giants' Halloween colors, you still see Dodger Blue.
</P>
<P>
   He wore the uniform for eight years and in more games than any
other, and was part of four division champions. When you talk about
the Dodgers' past, and lord knows there's little reason to talk to
about the present, Baker is as much a part of it as any other '70s
and '80s icon.
</P>
<P>
   He served up an example of the good old days sitting at his desk
in the visiting clubhouse Friday evening. He was putting together
his lineup card while a TV interview of former teammate Don Sutton
played in the background. As Sutton made a reference to ``his not
being cocky or arrogant,'' Baker, head down, said, ``Awwww,
Sutton.''
</P>
<P>
   It broke the room up. It was one more laugh than the Dodgers
have had this season.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's Dodgers never had their heart or work ethic questioned,
as the '90s Dodgers have, and the clubhouse attitude reflected why.
It was a happenin' place to be. Teammates occasionally quibbled
i.e., Steve Garvey versus Sutton, still good for a smile 20 years
later but the sense of purpose never wavered. Considering the
inertness of the '90s Dodgers, a good old scuffle might be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's Giants clubhouse has a happenin' atmosphere. There was
plenty of noise, talk and attitude in the hours before game time,
loud counterpoint to the Dodgers' daily funeral mass.
</P>
<P>
   It has essentially been that way since Baker was named manager
in 1993, which may explain why the Giants have contended for a
division title or postseason play every year but one, the
injury-wracked 1996 team.
</P>
<P>
   Baker takes no credit for it. ``It comes from them,'' he said.
``This is my office. It's their clubhouse. What I can do is head
things off when I see a potential problem coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them the freedom to enjoy themselves, so long
as they know when it's time to get serious. It can't be grab-ass.
All I ever ask of them is to play hard and play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But would the Giants have been in contention so often this
decade if not for Baker? Probably not. This team has been known as
Barry Bonds and his Octet now for seven years. Only one other every
day player has been an all-star since '93, Matt Williams, who has
been gone for three years.
</P>
<P>
   And can you name a Giants starting pitcher from the last seven
years? It's a brain teaser. The Giants have had six different
pitchers lead the team in wins the last six seasons, and they're
headed for a seventh if Russ Ortiz (9-5) holds his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Baker does not have sympathy, advice or time for the Dodgers.
There's no crying in baseball, and there's no sympathy, either.
``If you're looking for sympathy, you're in the wrong business,''
he said. ``And I have no time to worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker freely admits that playing and beating the Dodgers does
not have the same feeling as it did three years ago. Giant fans may
take the rivalry quite literally ``It's a north-south, L.A.-San
Francisco thing. Fresno is the Mason-Dixon line, and L.A. stole our
water,'' he said but beat L.A. is not a rallying cry for the team.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't bury them, either. He respects Dodgers General
Manager Kevin Malone, he of the spring training World Series
proclamation that now hangs from his neck like a two-ton necklace,
and he says times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like and respect Kevin,'' he said. ``The problem with making
a statement like that is, if you're wrong, you've got to live with
it, and it can put a lot of pressure on the team and manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said teams do not grow up together, as the Dodgers once
did, and the sense of ``home'' has been skewed by so much player
movement. Baker and Reggie Smith were additions to the
Garvey-Sutton group, but they stayed long enough for them to be
considered Dodgers for life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the wake of the Fox-for-O'Malley transaction, the
Dodgers change faces with as much abandon as any team,. There are
only two regulars and not a single pitcher left from 1993, Baker's
first season as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's not the same organization when people you knew
and cared about are no longer there,'' he said. ``You get used to
seeing the same batting practice guys and same stadium people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing lasts forever. It's no different than in the
corporate world, when a new CEO brings in his own people. They can
do whatever they want. It's their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The reminder was apropos, but not needed.

BONDS' TWO HOMERS LIFT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barry Bonds had done it to a lot of guys. Just not
Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the Dodgers' worst pitcher had been one of the
best against Bonds, but all that changed Friday night in the San
Francisco Giants' 6-3 victory before a sellout crowd of 53,869 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in with just three singles and one RBI in 18 career
at-bats against Perez, Bonds hit two home runs and showed he might
be all the way back from arm surgery that cost him almost two
months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, who in a game last September against the Dodgers became
the first player in major-league history to reach 400 career homers
and 400 stolen bases, struggled after coming back from the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   But now that he has uncovered Perez, whose record dropped to 2-9
after the Dodgers' fifth straight loss, Bonds appears ready to
resume his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not 100 percent, he certainly is close,'' manager
Dusty Baker said after his NL West-leading Giants won their fifth
straight. ``I've never seen the ball fly out of here like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker should know. He played eight years with the Dodgers and
once hit 30 home runs in one season. But he has never seen a
Dodgers pitching staff struggle this way, either.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed Perez, who has given up at least six runs in six of
his starts, might allow that many Friday night. Although his
velocity matched the season-high 89 mph fastball he had last
Saturday in San Francisco, Perez made four seriously bad pitches.
All went for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a power pitcher and he can't make mistakes,''
pitching coach Claude Osteen said of Perez, who didn't make it out
of the sixth. ``I was pleased with his fastball, but he put them in
some bad places and got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre had a chance to atone for Perez when he hit a
game-tying two-run homer in the fourth against Giants starter Chris
Brock (5-6). But two innings later, Beltre left the game with a
strained groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, one of the few bright spots in the Dodgers' (34-43)
miserable season, will be reexamined today.
</P>
<P>
   There was no one to take up the slack. Todd Hollandsworth,
starting in place of Gary Sheffield (flu) in left, went 0 for 4
with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, the Dodgers had a chance to tie the game
when Dave Hansen opened with a walk and Jose Vizcaino singled him
to third. Pinch-hitter Greg Counsell brought out Giants left-hander
Alan Embree to replace Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Counsell sacrificed both runners up, but Eric Young, now 0 for 8
after a 9-for-22 stretch on the road, bounced to third and Hansen
was thrown out at the plate. Hollandsworth took a called third
strike to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard led off the top of the ninth with a home run off
Dodgers reliever Jeff Shaw, brought in to get some work. It was the
Giants' fifth homer, the most in one game since August 1995 against
Philadelphia. The others were by Ellis Burks to open the fourth and
Rich Aurilia one out later.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen, who allowed a ninth-inning, game-winning homer to Todd
Hundley last Saturday, pitched the ninth for his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was a test for all the Dodgers, who were still in
last despite eight straight losses by the fourth-place Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by three in the fourth, the Dodgers came back.
Hot-hitting Eric Karros lined a one-out double into the left-field
corner off Brock and Hundley followed with a sharp single to right.
One out later, Beltre drove a 1-1 fastball into the left-field
stands to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Karros came in batting .410 (15 for 36) in his last 10 games and
.357 (30 for 84) with six homers and 15 RBI in his last 23.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, batting over .300 most of his first full season, had
dropped to .290 with an 0-for-10 slump before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Perez retired the first two batters for the fourth
time in the game before going to a 3-2 count on Bonds. Perez threw
him a fastball and Bonds hit it over the center-field wall for a
4-3 Giants lead.

ANGELS DEFEAT A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ It was a fresh start, a chance for some healing.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels lost three in a row to the Texas Rangers
earlier in the week, they got a chance to move onward with a
three-game series against the Oakland A's, whom they swept last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took their cue and beat the A's 10-6 before 8,570 at
the Oakland Coliseum. The Angels scored what turned out to be the
winning run not on a hit, but on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde, who had four of the Angels' 14 hits, scored from
third when Chad Harville's breaking ball got past catcher A.J.
Hinch, giving the Angels a 7-6 lead with one out in the eighth. The
Angels added three runs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fifth time in the last 35 games the Angels have
scored at least five runs in a game. Reliever Mark Petkovsek (7-2)
earned the win over Harville (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Texas series, as much as anything, showed the Angels how far
they have to go. They were swept by scores of 9-1, 5-0 and 18-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed me we have tough work to do,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``Obviously, we're not where we want to be. I don't
care if we lose 3-1, 3-1, 3-1 or 15-2, 15-2, 15-2. The bottom line
is we lost all three games and we lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, it's disappointing because we were exposed
in every facet where we are weak. We have a lot of work to do, it's
a long road ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That road started with Friday's game against Oakland. No matter
how discouraging the losses to the Rangers were, DiSarcina said the
Angels must realize there is still more than half the season
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game where you have to file the disappointments real
quickly or you'll end up dwelling on it for weeks,'' he said. ``You
have to move on and accept the fact they pummeled us. You don't
want to dig a hole, bury our heads in it and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds out of the lineup because of
injuries, the Angels have little room for error, DiSarcina says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't moan about what you don't have,'' he said. ``That's
wasted energy. You have to do the little things when you're missing
the big guys. Move runners over, and make sure you don't give a
team four outs.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had a chance to make a big play in the fifth inning
Friday but came up short. With the game tied at 4, the A's had
Jason Giambi at third with two out. Ramon Hernandez hit a grounder
up the middle that DiSarcina smothered, but his throw to first was
late and Giambi scored to give the A's their first lead of the game
5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied in the seventh, taking a 6-5 lead on Troy
Glaus' two-run double. For the slumping Glaus, it was just his
third extra-base hit in 75 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But the A's came back again, tying the game at 6 on Hinch's RBI
single in the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, who raised his average to .305, started the Angels'
winning rally in the eighth with his third hit. He went to third on
Mo Vaughn's single before coming home on the wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the game despite losing the services of pitching
coach Dick Pole, who was ejected in the bottom of the first inning
by first-base ump Terry Craft.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, Matt Stairs hit a
grounder to Vaughn at first. Vaughn threw to DiSarcina at second
for the force, and his relay to pitcher Steve Sparks, covering
first, appeared to be in time. But instead of being the final out
of the inning, Craft called Stairs safe.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Pole was ejected for arguing from the bench.

ANGELS BEAT A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ It was a fresh start, a chance for some healing.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels were embarrassed in losing three in a row to
the Texas Rangers earlier in the week, they got a chance to move
onward with a three-game series against the Oakland A's, whom they
swept last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took their cue and beat the A's 10-6 before 8,570 at
the Oakland Coliseum on Friday night. The Angels scored what turned
out to be the winning run not on a hit, but on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde, who had four of the Angels' 14 hits, scored from
third when Chad Harville's breaking ball got past catcher A.J.
Hinch, giving the Angels a 7-6 lead with one out in the eighth
inning. The Angels added three runs in the ninth to put the game
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Third base coach Larry) Bowa reminded me, there were two
strikes _ look for a ball in the dirt,'' Velarde said. ``And he was
true to form.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fifth time in the last 35 games the Angels have
scored at least five runs in a game. Reliever Mark Petkovsek (7-2)
earned the win over Harville (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of this team the way we bounced back,'' Velarde
said. ``We were pretty much humiliated in the three-game series
with Texas. We had our character on the wall today. I'm proud of
the guys, we all were able to chip in. It was a tough victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas series as much as anything showed the Angels how far
they have to go. They were swept by scores of 9-1, 5-0 and 18-4 and
never had a chance to win any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed me we have tough work to do,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``Obviously, we're not where we want to be. I don't
care if we lose 3-1, 3-1, 3-1 or 15-2, 15-2, 15-2. The bottom line
is we lost all three games and we lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, it's disappointing because we were exposed
in every facet where we are weak. We have a lot of work to do, it's
a long road ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
   That road started with Friday's game against Oakland. No matter
how discouraging the losses to the Rangers were, DiSarcina said the
Angels must realize there is still more than half the season
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game where you have to file the disappointments real
quickly or you'll end up dwelling on it for weeks,'' he said. ``You
have to move on and accept the fact they pummeled us. You don't
want to dig a hole, bury our heads in it and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels third baseman Troy Glaus has struggled as much as any
Angels hitter, entering Friday's game with only seven hits in his
previous 57 at-bats. But his two-run double in the seventh inning
turned a 5-4 deficit into a 6-5 lead. It was only his third
extra-base hit in 75 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept pecking away and got guys on,'' manager Terry
Collins said. ``We got big hits with guys in scoring position and
it made a difference. Troy's hit really gave us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   But the A's came back again, tying the game at 6 on Hinch's RBI
single in the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, who raised his average to .305, started the Angels'
winning rally in the eighth with his third hit. He went to third on
Mo Vaughn's single before coming home on the wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the game despite losing the services of pitching
coach Dick Pole, who was ejected in the bottom of the first inning
by first-base ump Terry Craft.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, Matt Stairs hit a
grounder to Vaughn at first. Vaughn threw to DiSarcina at second
for the force, and his relay to pitcher Steve Sparks covering first
appeared to be in time. But instead of being the final out of the
inning, Craft called Stairs safe.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Pole was ejected for arguing from the bench.

REVISIONIST THINKING HAS JARRETT WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the fourth week of Jeff Burton's reign atop the NASCAR
Winston Cup points standings this season, I had a phone
conversation with one of Ford Motor Co.'s public relations
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was flexing real muscle in his Ford Taurus at that point.
He had taken a lead that had shrunk to two points over Bobby
Labonte and expanded it to 85 over Dale Jarrett after the Goody's
Body Pain 500 at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, the reigning and three-time Cup champion, was
fourth at that juncture, 129 points behind Burton. What was
bothering my friend at Ford was that practically every mention of
Burton was almost immediately followed by a reference to Gordon,
who happens to drive a Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Brand loyalty aside, the point was this: When does it become
time to write off Gordon's chances of repeating as Cup champion?
</P>
<P>
   We may be able to stick a fork into Gordon and the Rainbow
Warriors soon, although not after tonight's Pepsi 400 at the
Daytona International Speedway. Gordon runs great in restrictor
plate races at DIS, where he is the defending event champion and
where he won the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   But standing between Jarrett and Gordon in the points chase are
a growing-in-confidence Bobby Labonte, the relentless Mark Martin
and his clone, Burton. That's a lot of heavy metal and mettle to
leapfrog during the remaining 18 races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon clearly will need a repeat of his awesome 1998
second-half to make a run for it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that one year ago _ after 16 races _ Gordon had put up
these stats: Five poles, four victories, 10 top-fives, 11 top-10s
and two Did Not Finish results. He was leading the standings by 40
points over Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's stats heading into tonight? Five poles, four victories,
10 top-fives, 11 top-10s _ the same as last year in each category _
but four DNFs.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Race No. 17 last year at Loudon, N.H., Gordon
went on a 14-race romp that produced seven victories, four
runner-ups, a third and two fifths. It's difficult to imagine even
Gordon _ winner of a single-season record-tying 13 races last year
_ consistently putting those kinds of whippings on Jarrett,
Labonte, Martin ``and'' Burton this time around.
</P>
<P>
   My revised choice to replace Gordon, then, is Jarrett, who has
finished third or better in the final standings for three
consecutive years. At 42, the clock is ticking on his bid to join
father Ned as a Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has racked up more top-fives (12) and top-10s (14) this
season than Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott, who also have
suffered only one DNF. NASCAR's points system rewards that kind of
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gordon. And the system will crown Jarrett a first-time
champion on or before the season-ender on Nov. 21.

Service for AMs of Sunday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   QATAR-ARAB-TV (Doha, Qatar) _ In millions of homes and offices
across the Arab world, television sets are regularly tuned these
days to Al Jazeera, a hard-hitting Arabic-language news channel
that explores issues long suppressed by the region's rulers,
including the lack of democracy, the persecution of political
dissidents and the repression of women. By John F. Burns. (With
photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERB-CHURCH (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ To see and hear
Father Stojan Stokic speak is to believe that something fundamental
is changing in the soul of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which 10
years ago welcomed Slobodan Milosevic's violent nationalist land
grab in the collapsing Yugoslavia and whose most senior bishops
traveled in the war zones of Croatia and Bosnia, blessing Serb
forces shelling towns such as Sarajevo. By Blaine Harden with
Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ELECTION (Ecatepec, Mexico) _ Battling to maintain
control over Mexico's most populous state, the governing party has
been testing the limits of electoral legality, buying or coercing
the votes of poor Mexicans who are to cast ballots in elections for
governor on Sunday, according to electoral watchdog groups and
interviews with residents. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Nearly two months into an
armed conflict over the disputed territory of Kashmir, India and
Pakistan _ the world's newest nuclear powers _ are once again
playing the tired roles of time-tested enemies. By Celia W. Dugger
with Barry Bearak. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   KUWAIT-VOTE (Kuwait) _ Kuwaitis voted today in what may be the
country's last all-male elections, after a campaign dominated by a
heated national discussion of whether it is time to allow women
political rights. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-OLYMPICS (Geneva) _ Like chocolate, cheese, precision
watches, the Red Cross, skiing and banking, the Olympic movement
has been linked for decades with Switzerland. So it has been doubly
infuriating for the Swiss to endure what is widely perceived as the
latest blow to their national pride: the decision to award the 2006
Winter Olympics not to the front-running Alpine resort of Sion, but
to an upstart Italian rival, the industrial city of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHIRELAND-ASSESS (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Understanding
how much more readily negative responses than positive ones occur
to the quarreling and distrustful politicians of this conflicted
province is the only way to comprehend the bewildering week that
has just passed and the perilous days for the peace settlement that
lie ahead. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-ROGUE-TRADER (London) _ For a while, he was the kid from
nowhere whose Midas touch made millions for his patrician
overlords. Then, when it all turned sour, he was the rogue trader
whose breath-stopping losses epitomized the dizzy excesses of the
markets in the mid-1990s. And Saturday, as Nick Leeson was set to
fly back to Britain after almost four years in a Singapore jail,
the 32-year-old former trader who brought down Britain's oldest
merchant bank faced a bittersweet homecoming. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-FAMILIES (Milwaukee, Wis) _ Loving a troubled relative
to death, a struggle often forgotten in policy forums, is one of
the most common situations poor women face when leaving the welfare
rolls. Loyalties to the job often conflict with loyalties at home.
Addicted sisters, imprisoned brothers, needy cousins and aunts _
the great national drive from welfare to work winds through a
forest of familial distractions. By Jason DeParle. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   See also WELFARE-ACADEMY sidebar.
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-EDUC (Evanston, Ill.) _ Taking on one of the most
troublesome and contentious issues in American education, school
officials and educators have begun a nationwide discussion of why
black middle-class and upper-income students lag behind whites of
comparable economic status. By Pam Belluck. With photos, map,
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CITIZENSHIP-TEST (New York) _ As part of one of the biggest
naturalization movements in the country's history, 1.8 million
applicants for citizenship _ the biggest group ever _ are waiting
anxiously to be tested on their knowledge of English, civics and
history. The test is at the core of one of the weightiest decisions
any nation can make: who should be a citizen? By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   RV-LUXURY (Thorntown, Ind.) _ It is simple, Clarence and Maryann
Cornell said. Financially secure, they wanted to travel and they
wanted to do it in comfort and style, their two yelping dachshunds
in tow. With that, the Cornells, owners of two stationary homes _
one in Minnesota, the other in Florida _ explained their latest
acquisition: a $112,000 Fleetwood Southwind motor home. The
Cornells are part of a national trend. By Peter T. Kilborn. (With
photos.)
</P>
<P>
   FENWAY-FRACAS (Boston) _ Apologies to organized religion, but
surely any candid clergyman would concur: The most widely revered
shrine in Boston is Fenway Park. So the fight brewing here stands
out from the slew of stadium battles that have cropped up around
the country. To hear some talk, at stake is the legacy of Babe
Ruth, the cream of all sports-fan experiences, yea, the very
Valhalla of baseball. Plus a lot of money. And a city neighborhood.
By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ By the federal reporting period
that ended June 30, George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, had
amassed $36.3 million. No presidential candidate has ever collected
that much even over an entire primary season. And Bush's money
machine is only warming up. A look at how he got where he is today.

<P>
   HERBERT-COLUMN _ The latest splendid effort from the documentary
filmmaker Ken Burns is about two women who barely register in the
consciousness of late-20th-century America, but whose lives were
critically important to the freedoms most of us take for granted.
If you mention Thomas Jefferson, or Lincoln, or Martin Luther King,
you'll get a sense, at the very least, that people know whom you're
talking about. Mention Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony
and you're likely to encounter an epidemic of blank stares. By Bob
Herbert.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ Taking on one of the most troublesome and
contentious issues in American education, school officials and
educators around the nation have begun discussing why the academic
achievement of black middle-class and upper-income students lags
behind whites of comparable socioeconomic status.
</P>
<P>
   On some tests, black students from middle-class or wealthier
families have done no better than white students who live in
poverty. And some especially puzzling data have suggested that at
higher achievement levels, the gap between black and white
performance is wider than at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   School officials and black education experts are increasingly
troubled by the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we explain the underproductivity of middle-class kids,
of able and gifted minority youngsters who come out of situations
where you would expect high achievement?'' asked Edmund W. Gordon,
a professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University and the
co-chairman of the National Task Force on Minority High
Achievement, formed in 1997 by the College Board. ``This is not
something that a lot of people feel comfortable talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most closely watched efforts in education circles,
more than a dozen middle-class, racially integrated communities
across the country, including Evanston, and two in the New York
metropolitan area _ White Plains, N.Y., and South Orange-Maplewood,
N.J. _ have formed a network to learn more about the disparity and
to try to do something about it. They will scrutinize what happens
in schools and classrooms, and will also look at research on the
home lives, study habits, and attitudes of black students.
</P>
<P>
   In Evanston, a comfortable, attractive community just north of
Chicago, Venessa Woods has a firsthand look at the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woods, who runs a high school program to help minority
students do better, keeps coming across black students from stable,
educated, middle-class families who have fallen behind despite
seeming to have all the ingredients for academic success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that came to my head is `Oh, they're poor' or
`Oh, they're in a single-parent home,' '' said Ms. Woods, who is
black. ``To my surprise, the students were living in the better
part of Evanston. Students were living with two-parent families who
have college degrees. They have computers. They have personal
tutors. And they're getting C's and D's, and why?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody claims to have clear answers. But from conversations with
teachers, students, researchers and parents, the reasons seem to be
multilayered, going beyond a student's socioeconomic status to
include factors like lingering racial inferiority complexes, peer
pressure, low teacher expectations, curriculum, parental
involvement and access to information, and vestiges of racism in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most compelling insights come from students like
Akilah Rogers, who just completed her junior year at Evanston
Township High School taking advanced placement and accelerated
classes, and helped organize a day of student discussion about
minority achievement this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the most African-Americans in one of my
honors classes is three,'' said Akilah, who is 17. Early on, she
said, ``People were like, `Oh, you're an oreo.' Getting good grades
was always connected to white people. So they're like, `Are you
going to be white and achieve?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 14 schools in the network are mostly top-notch, with high
per-pupil spending, many middle-class families and diverse student
populations. At these schools, middle-class blacks typically
perform better than poor blacks and often score above the national
and state average for blacks. Many are in university towns like
Berkeley, Calif., Chapel Hill, N.C., and Amherst, Mass. But they
still perform worse on average than whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are areas in the country where you would think you would
get people being high achievers, but it's not happening to the
degree it should,'' said Allan Alson, superintendent of Evanston's
High School, who is concerned about what schools like his should be
doing differently.
</P>
<P>
   At Evanston, 42 percent of the high school's 2,900 students are
black. And while there is poverty here _ about 30 percent of the
students, mostly blacks, receive free or reduced-price lunches _
there is also a solid black middle class. Evanston provides
after-school, summer and weekend programs for struggling students,
and honors and advanced placement courses are open to any student
who wants to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers at Evanston have been disappointing. A study
of the first semester of the 1997-1998 school year found that
nearly 25 percent of black students had failed at least one class,
compared with 4 percent of white students. Seven percent of black
students' grades were A's, compared with 25 percent for whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, on a state reading test, 49 percent of blacks at the
school were reading below grade level, compared with 9 percent of
whites. And while the college attendance rate of both blacks and
whites here is above the national average, 66 percent of blacks go
to college, compared with 95 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Evanston's most recent efforts include hiring more
African-American teachers, raising the academic eligibility
requirements for participation in sports, increasing the amount of
homework, and creating more advanced placement courses.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Evanston and elsewhere say doing well in school is
not always accepted by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzroy Dennison, 18, said he was so conscious of the stigma
that he avoided speaking grammatically correct English with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to switch it off,'' said Fitzroy, whose parents are
from Panama and Belize. ``When you're on the streets, you speak
Ebonics. When you're at home, you speak Creole. When you're in
school, you speak proper English. But when you talk too proper,
your peers will call you white and say you're a cracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Eddy, a history teacher at Evanston, recalled that during
a class that mixed middle-level and honors students, ``a black
student came in the room and pointed to a couple of black kids in
the room, and one kid got very upset and said, `He's pointing out
that this is an all-white class and there are only a couple of
black students in here.' ''

</P>
<P>
   Some clues to the problem might come from students who have
achieved in spite of considerable adversity, like Albert Smith,
whose family is so poor that he and his parents, four siblings and
a nephew often struggle to have enough food.
</P>
<P>
   For Albert, a wiry, energetic 17-year-old, race had a profound
effect on his self-esteem in school. As a freshman in history and
English honors classes, he said, ``the people around me, they were
white, and it intimidated me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought they were smart because they were white,'' he
added. ``I didn't want to raise my hand to answer a question.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, Albert's grade point average was 2.7, and he said
African-American friends in regular classes treated him like a
genius, even when he was not getting the grades he wanted. He
started to push himself harder after teachers told him he had
potential, and after he started ``to become comfortable with all
the white people.''
</P>
<P>
   By junior year, Albert was averaging 3.6. He graduated in June,
was accepted to several colleges and his classmates voted him best
all-around male student.
</P>
<P>
   Albert said he believed that many black students privately
respect high achievers, but they ``openly praise the people who are
doing badly, the people in the gangs, the people who are doing
negative things.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some seem afraid to try hard because ``if they push
themselves to the hardest and they don't do well, they think
they've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they'll start believing some of the stigmas that are out
there in society,'' Albert said, ``that African-Americans aren't as
smart as their white counterparts.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some researchers say differences in home life may affect how
well students do. Ronald F. Ferguson, a researcher at Harvard
University, has been surveying students at Shaker Heights High
School outside of Cleveland, an academically acclaimed school in
the new network where most black and white families are solidly
middle-class. There, while blacks make up half the student
population, blacks constituted 9 percent of those who graduated in
the top fifth of their class, but 83 percent of those in the bottom
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Ferguson found that ``black kids watch twice
as much TV as white kids _ three hours a day as opposed to one and
a half hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   National studies have also found differences. One asked students
to name the lowest grade they could take home without their parents
becoming angry. Blacks consistently named lower grades than Asian,
white or Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Ladson-Billings, an education professor at the University
of Wisconsin in Madison, said middle-class, college-educated black
parents were often the first generation of their families to have
such success, so the roots of their academic and economic
accomplishments are shallower than many white families.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whites, if you go to grandma's house you're maybe going to
this huge family library,'' but for many blacks, grandma's is ``a
working-class household where people are very proud of what you're
doing but they don't have any way of really supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   On their upwardly mobile trajectory, black families may have
moved frequently, switching children from school to school, not
usually an educational plus.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said that because they did not grow up in academically
oriented homes, ``many minority parents who are serious about their
child's education insist that their kids study, do homework, but
the same parents are seldom seen by their kids reading a lot or
doing anything studious.''
</P>
<P>
   Those differences may help account for some test results that
showed the gap between black and white achievement on national
reading tests and on SAT's was wider for children whose parents had
college or graduate degrees than for children whose parents did not
have a high school diploma. (But some researchers say those results
might be partly explained by other factors: subtle cultural biases
in tests or in schools, the many fewer black parents than white
parents with advanced educational backgrounds, or the possibility
that black children may have been more likely than whites to
overstate or misconstrue their parents' educational history.)
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American parents are going to have to step up to the
plate and do more,'' said Martha Burns, an Evanston mother who
pushed to get her two children into accelerated elementary school
classes, takes them to after-school reading programs and limits
television watching. ``Anytime you bring this up, people get
defensive, insulted and then we just retreat. We really never bring
it on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burns, a co-president of the PTA council, and experts like
Gordon also said African-American churches and community centers
should create more extracurricular academic programs, following the
example of, say, Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But some students and parents say that teachers and guidance
counselors, white or black, may, consciously or unconsciously, have
lower expectations of black students and that this may ultimately
translate into self-fulfilling prophecies of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tanya Bernard, a middle-class 17-year-old who got mostly A's and
B's as a junior this year, said that when a counselor discouraged
her from taking a Spanish honors class she felt she was ready for,
``I think it may have been a little bit of a racial thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Shepard, whose daughter is a student at Evanston, said she
believed that early on, many teachers label African-American
children as having less potential than whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think teachers expect excellence, and you get what you
expect,'' said Ms. Shepard, a school board member for the lower
grades.
</P>
<P>
   That impression, she and others said, can lead parents to
distrust schools. The parents may feel less able to act as
advocates for their children, less knowledgeable about how to get
the attention of teachers, or simply less certain that it will make
a difference if they urge their children to strive harder.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``My teachers are not telling me I have to do it; my parents
don't tell me I have to do it,'' said Fitzroy, who graduated this
year. ``African-American parents, they settle for less, not knowing
they can get more for their students.''

 By JASON DePARLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Lashanda Washington was a street-smart,
fight-hardened girl of 16, riding a city bus home from school, when
she saw the face that she had been dreaming about for years.
</P>
<P>
   The woman boarding the No. 14 looked older than the one who had
long stalked her fading childhood memories. She was thin like an
addict and bloated like a drinker. She was scarred like a fighter
and worn like a pauper. She was as beautiful as anyone Ms.
Washington had ever seen. The girl's heart nearly exploded from the
rush of fear and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my mama?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my daughter?'' the woman replied.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Ms. Washington traded a foster mother she had
never liked for the troubled mother she scarcely knew. She helped
her mother find an apartment, worked two jobs for a while to pay
the rent and worried her way through the alcoholic storms that
battered her mother each day.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Ms. Washington is a single mother herself,
swept up in the vast migration off the nation's welfare rolls. And
like countless other young central-city women, she has found her
efforts to build a new life complicated by family bonds more
powerful than many policy-makers understand.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, her mother, Linnie Washington, remains in her care, where
she is at once a cherished matriarch, a wellspring of solace and a
source of almost daily sabotage. She mocks her daughter's attempts
to work, blames her for her own drinking, and locks her out of the
house. Yet nothing seems to diminish the fidelity she receives in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama is like everything to me,'' the younger Ms. Washington
said. ``I love my mama to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving a troubled relative to death, a struggle often forgotten
in policy forums, is one of the most common situations poor women
face when leaving the welfare rolls. Loyalties to the job often
conflict with loyalties at home. Addicted sisters, imprisoned
brothers, needy cousins and aunts _ the great national drive from
welfare to work winds through a forest of familial distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Now 20, Lashanda is an energetic, resilient woman who weds
earnestness with streetwise flamboyance. She said she was eager to
escape ``all that ghetto stuff'' that has followed her all her
life, and sometimes she tries to break free. She can land jobs
quickly. She can charm people in positions of authority. She talks
of becoming a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   As Lashanda has landed and lost jobs over the last five months,
her mother, by her own account, has staggered drunk in the street
and been hit by a car; checked into a psychiatric ward; weathered
immobilizing outbreaks of herpes, and started many days crying
aloud that she fears she is dying. Lashanda said her mother grew so
angry when she refused to buy her cocaine that she cut the phone
line with a butcher knife. Linnie said she grew so desperate for
money that she offered sex to the rent collector, trying to
forestall an eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping work to keep watch at home, Lashanda has found herself
trapped in irreconcilable roles: breadwinner, daughter, confidante,
playmate, social worker, nurse and cop. She wakes her mother and
chides her to eat; buys her beer when she gets the shakes, and
searches the alleys when she disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is not the only obstacle between Lashanda and steady
work. She lost her chance at one job when she tested positive for
marijuana. She quit another because she did not like the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the family, even her talk of mainstream achievements
brings as much resentment as respect. When sober, her mother boasts
that Lashanda is so smart she talks like a secretary. When drunk,
she accuses her of trying to ``act white'' and she mocks Lashanda's
light-skinned son, Jermaine, as ``Casper.'' These are biting words
in an African-American family deeply suspicious of the
predominantly white judges, lawyers and social workers who have
ruled their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was fine until Mama got to talking'' and ``calling
me stupid,'' Lashanda confided to a diary this spring. ``Little do
she know I cry like every three days inside to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, the anger and frustration get tucked away, behind
avowals of ferocious daughterly devotion. ``As long as I see my
mama and know she's safe, that gets me through the day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washington began 1999 at the Academy of Excellence, a
two-week course that tries to prepare poor women for a post-welfare
life. Five months later, its graduates could fill a book with
stories of family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Pettigrew was one of the most earnest students and the
first to find work, as a receptionist at the academy itself. In
class, she mentioned that she was once on the ``way to Doomsville''
with a sister. It was a casual aside and an eerie premonition. A
few weeks later, her sister's body was found in a melting snowbank.
Distraught, Ms. Pettigrew left the job.
</P>
<P>
   Savaria Johnson was one of the quietest students, sharing little
but her smile. No one would have known her house was a battleground
for warring family factions. She said she fought with a brother,
who fought with an aunt, who summoned police. Ms. Johnson and her
children finally fled, but she ignored her work requirements and
lost her welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the academy's most celebrated graduate has faced family
conflicts. After landing her first job in years, Michelle Crawford
was invited by Wisconsin's governor, Tommy Thompson, to take part
in his annual legislative address. Thompson later acknowledged he
had no idea of the conflicts still rocking her home: a jealous
sister, a violent husband, a son arrested for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of her caretaking role, Ms. Washington helped reconstruct
her family saga in unusual detail, sharing letters and diaries and
approving the release of child welfare records normally kept under
court seal. It is a story of incessant worry that still awaits a
happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mama is sick real bad,'' she wrote in her diary last month.
``I hate seeing her like that. And I know my Mama loves all her
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Linnie Washington lost her mother, too. She grew up in a home
with eight children, two violent parents, and a trail of empty
liquor bottles. One night her father came home and beat her mother
until she agreed to have sex. Then her mother got up and shot him
four times as the children looked on. Linnie was 7.
</P>
<P>
   With her mother serving 15 years for murder, she stayed with her
grandmother. She began drinking heavily in her teens, gave birth to
Lashanda when she was 18 and quickly had four more children. She
also got custody of a young nephew, T.J., who was taken from her
sister. Social workers thought she would provide a better home,
though her drinking offered evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Linnie's grandmother had warned child welfare officials early on
about her abuse of alcohol and drugs. Then, left unattended one
summer day in 1987, Lashanda's 2-year-old sister fell from a
second-story porch and suffered a concussion. Ten months later,
T.J. fell. Linnie put him to bed and when she awoke the next
morning, the 5-year-old boy was dead. ``I'm scare, cause I might go
to jail,'' Linnie wrote in a panicked note summoning a sister.
``Help me wake this boy up.'' &UR; ????? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a hostile interview with a social worker afterward, Linnie
denied she had an alcohol problem. Then she burst into tears and
confessed she simply could not stop drinking. The worker found her
``suffering immensely from guilt and shame.'' The state took her
children away.
</P>
<P>
   Lashanda was 9 when she began a harrowing search for a home. She
stayed with an aunt until her father finished a sentence for armed
robbery. She stayed with her father until he went back to prison,
for sexual assault. She went to a foster home in a drug trading
zone, and she was held at gunpoint by robbers threatening rape. The
attack revived the terror she had felt as a young child during
episodes of sexual abuse. She was hospitalized just before her 13th
birthday after several suicide attempts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 15, she had climbed out of the abyss and
onto the eighth-grade honor roll. A social worker speculated on the
key to her growing success: no contact with her mother, sisters or
brother. ``Lashanda copes,'' she wrote, ``by isolating herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lashanda said good grades never quenched the yearning for
her family. ``That's all I ever wanted to do, was to go stay with
my mother, be with my sisters again,'' she said. ``I wanted to be
like everybody else _ they have their mama.''
</P>
<P>
   She had not seen her mother for years when they collided on the
bus. But it took her just two weeks to persuade a court to let her
go home. Soon her sister, Tashanda, then 13, ran away from her
foster home and joined the reunion. Her mother drank. Her sister
fought. Lashanda herself could be quick with her fists. Over the
next three years the Washingtons moved five times, chased by
landlords, neighbors and police.
</P>
<P>
   As a 16-year-old family boss, Lashanda worked long shifts at
McDonald's to pay the rent, and took a second job at a grocery
store. She had a son in the spring of her junior year and left
school that fall. Her son's father left her. Her apartment caught
fire. She ran through four jobs in eight months. Then she took a
step that offended her pride in herself as a worker: She applied
for welfare. ``I was depressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Academy of Excellence'' is two classrooms on Martin Luther
King Jr. Drive, in the heart of Milwaukee's welfare district. It is
the first stop for people seeking benefits from YW-Works, one of
five private agencies hired by the state to run the welfare program
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's strict new system, virtually everyone
receiving cash assistance must join a work program. Before
receiving a work assignment, academy students spend two weeks
studying life's basic arts: negotiating with the gas company,
avoiding domestic violence, securing birth control.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of Milwaukee's welfare recipients are
black, though the county is 73 percent white, and the classroom
often rang with Afrocentric invocations. ``Go down in prayer when
you get scared,'' one of the speakers urged. ``Think about your
chained ancestors'' surviving slave ships and cotton fields and
``declare to yourself, `I can do something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like corralled indigents in similar classes citywide, Lashanda
arrived a skeptic. ``I have to sit here and let these people run
their mouth,'' she said at the time. But she later called the
academy a positive place where ``nobody talked bad'' when she
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my house, there ain't no compromise _ I either do it, or I
get cussed out,'' she told the class. ``That's how my mama is.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Paczesny, a counselor at YW-Works, said family conflicts
were nearly universal among her clients, with a mother's drug abuse
among the most common afflictions. Oldest daughters in particular,
she said, often grow deeply invested in their identity as the
family caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the number of women we see who will stay at
home, essentially to keep their moms under lock and key,'' she
said. ``They know their moms are dope-dating, bringing men into the
house. And if it's not the moms, it's a sister or another close
relative. They feel if they don't take care of them, nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   Though recipients can lose $5.15 for every hour of work or class
they miss, policy is no match for biology. ``The parent-child bond
is more profound than any work program we have,'' Ms. Paczesny
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do try to get ahead, she said, often meet a backlash
from relatives who tell them, ``Either you're down with us _
oppressed economically, spiritually, educationally _ or you're not
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lashanda, an oldest daughter, describes her own identity in
strikingly similar terms. She is proud. (``I can handle it.'') She
is concerned. (``I worry about my mama every day.'') She is angry.
(``I shouldn't have to do this.'') And she is terrified of what
might happen if she stops looking after her mother. (``I feel
responsible,'' she said. ``Can't live with that guilt.'')
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, when she finished the academy, her instructor
put a note in her file: ``Excellent student. Tries hard. Home
situation is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If only the instructor knew.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the academy, Lashanda was sent to sort hangers at
a factory and to study for her high school degree. But her mother's
drinking was on the rise. So were her reprisals when Lashanda
refused to buy beer or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   She cut the phone line. She tried to tear down the bedroom door.
When Lashanda left for work or class, Linnie locked her out. Though
Lashanda was the one paying the rent, she said her mother called
the landlord and tried to have her evicted.
</P>
<P>
   One Friday afternoon, Lashanda raced home from the factory after
her mother collapsed at the stove. On Sunday, Linnie was hit by a
car. On Monday, Lashanda was supposed to start training as a
nurse's assistant. Instead, she spent the morning urging her mother
to sober up and seek care for her untreated bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Then the focus turned to her sister. For months, Tashanda, now
16, had turned the home into a fugitive's lair, hiding from police,
who were trying to arrest her for a fight with a neighbor. That
Wednesday, they finally caught her. Lashanda spent the rest of the
week shuttling to court and parrying her mother's drunken
accusations that she had caused her mother to get hit and her
sister to get arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always my fault,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she is sober, Linnie acknowledges her problems. ``My kids
always tell me to go to treatment, but I'm hard-headed,'' she said.
``They said I might die because I'm drinking myself to death. My
kids love me, and I'm trying to show back the love I lost from
them. I'm playing catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke gratefully of Lashanda's devotion. ``She acts like
she's a social worker,'' she said. ``She'll sit me down and say,
`Ms. Washington, you ain't supposed to ...' Can't hide nothing from
that child.'' Perhaps saying more than she intended, she added,
``She loves me too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she drinks, such boasts give way to bile. Of all the
insults, the words that sting her daughter the most are, ``You're
trying to act like you're white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that hurts me,'' Lashanda said. ``I say, `Mama,
don't call me white! I don't call you names. I don't call you no
ghetto mama, no hood rat. I don't call you no hoochie mama.' She's
just drunk. She can't control herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalized for missing work and class, Lashanda saw her welfare
check dwindle to $286 in May, from a possible $673. She quit
welfare and worked for a few weeks through a temporary employment
agency. She lost the chance at another job when she tested positive
for marijuana. By the end of May, she fell ill with anemia and
stopped working on doctor's orders. She got by on food stamps and
$981 of overdue child support from her son's father.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she faced a new crisis _ the need to get Linnie out of
the house. Child welfare officials were ready to release Tashanda,
but only once Linnie was gone. A social worker helped her find a
residential sobriety program. But first an agonizing and contagious
outbreak of herpes had to be brought under control. In the chaos,
an eviction notice arrived and the family had to move _ unjustly in
Linnie's view, since she said she was promised a rent reduction in
exchange for sex.
</P>
<P>
   As the spring wore on, Lashanda confided her problems in a
prized diary. Among the record of insults and injuries is an
account of the happiest mother-daughter moment of the year. With
Tashanda locked up, the welfare check cut, and the unpaid bills on
the rise, Linnie turned to Lashanda one day and did something that
truly stunned her. She apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me,'' Lashanda said. ``She always just cusses me
out.'' She said she was sorry Lashanda faced so much pressure. She
asked whether she could handle it. She asked whether she ever
cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mama, I cry all the time _ I cry like every other
day.''' For a few days running, a happy young woman exclaimed to
her diary that her mother finally understood. ``She knows that I'm
doing everything,'' Lashanda wrote. ``She is trying. She is in my
heart.''

DONORS' EXTRAORDINARY GENEROSITY ATTRIBUTED TO BUSH'S `WINNING'
CHARISMA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's colossal $36.3 million
campaign treasury was built on three pillars: a home-court
advantage that allowed him to hit up Texas supporters, enthusiastic
support from Republican governors, and the vast fund-raising
network of his father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a fourth pillar that has catapulted him to
fund-raising heights never before seen in presidential politics:
The burning desire of hungry Republicans, made fat by seven years
of economic growth and frustrated by Democratic control, to regain
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with dozens of people who have donated to Bush or
raised money for him, as well as strategists inside and outside the
campaign, the refrain is common: Donors sound practically
breathless with excitement. They said they had showered the Bush
campaign with money because they find the candidate charismatic
and, more important, they view him as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of money available out there
today,'' James E. Gilleran, 66, chairman of the Bank of San
Francisco, said on his way out of a packed Bush fund-raiser in his
city on Wednesday. ``So all a candidate has to do is evidence the
possibility of winning. And this is a guy who exudes the
possibility of winning when we've got a Republican Party extremely
desirous of winning back the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilleran is a veteran Republican donor. But at the same event,
Erik C. Weir, 32, president of a capital management company, said
similar reasons prompted him to attend a political fund-raiser for
the first time in years. ``He's the first candidate in a long time
that has a real chance of making it,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Bush fund-raising breakfast the next morning in Palo Alto,
Gregory W. Slayton, 39, the chief executive officer of MySoftware
Company, put it this way: ``The Silicon Valley is not about losing.
It's about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gable, 34, a product manager for Netscape who was at the
event, gushed, ``I've never written a $1,000 check before. But
there's something to this personal connection when he looks you in
the eye. There's a there there. It's a craving to be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that hunger for Bush, he has not had to spend one
minute on the telephone pleading for donations. ``Pick up the phone
and dial for contributions?'' Bush asked in an interview on Friday.
``Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush simply shows up at fund-raising events. And he rarely
mentions money at them. He doesn't have to; most people who attend
these events have already given $1,000, the maximum individual
contribution allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   In his only mention of contributions, Bush said at the gala this
week in San Francisco, ``I want to thank each and every one of you
for writing a check.'' The campaign has raised some money through
mailings, and plans to begin telephone solicitations within 30
days, said Don Evans, Bush's national finance chairman and best
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his philosophy, Evans, an oil company executive from
Midland, Texas, said, ``This isn't a hard-sell operation. People
tell me this is the easiest money they've ever raised. That is the
universal theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he realized on June 25, on a corporate jet taking the
Bush team from a sold-out fund-raiser in Detroit to another in Fort
Myers, Fla., that the campaign might pass the $30 million mark
because he was buoyed by sold-out, record-breaking events that
entire week.
</P>
<P>
   At an event earlier in Michigan, for example, Gov. John Engler
marveled that the campaign collected $40,000 at the door from
walk-ins _ people who had not bought their tickets in advance.
``That has never happened before,'' Engler said. ``This is a
phenomenon that we haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In something of a victory lap, Evans approached table after
table at the Palo Alto event, telling donors, ``I want to say thank
you. It's history in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   No presidential candidate had ever amassed that much money even
over an entire primary season; Bush did it in four months. And
Bush's money machine is only warming up. He has yet to tap
potential donors in many states, including New York and New Jersey,
which are always vital stops on the money circuit. Evans noted that
the campaign has thus far picked only ``the low-hanging fruit'' on
the finance tree.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall gives Bush an enormous advantage of his Republican
rivals, as well as over Vice President Al Gore, who has taken in
only about half the amount that the governor has. It may also be a
harbinger of what could be the most expensive campaign season in
history, given the open contest for the White House, a tight race
for control of Congress and what appear to be several hard-fought
Senate races around the country, including in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what one Bush aide called the ``spontaneous combustion''
from donors, the operation is all the more potent because of the
critical advantages he has over his rivals. While Bush has not had
to hit up donors, his father, former President George Bush, and
other governors have done some of the work for him.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's father's fund-raising connections helped the
campaign get off to a swift start. President Bush was no slouch at
raising money; he established ``Team 100,'' a loyal network of
$100,000 givers that helped the party and his own presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of the year, the governor's organization
took in roughly 15 percent of its contributions from people who had
donated to his father. The former president has also pitched in by
appearing as the star attraction at fund-raising events for his son
and helping raise money for lawmakers who are backing the governor.
The younger Bush said that on Friday morning he chatted with his
father about the $36.3 million. ``He was proud and amazed,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governors who have played particularly crucial
roles are Engler, Bush's brother, Jeb, in Florida, Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts and John G. Rowland of Connecticut. They have leaned
on their own financial networks to raise money for Bush, something
that the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, did not
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're deeply involved with George Bush,'' Engler said, ``and
they were not with Bob Dole. I don't think Bob, Senator Dole,
understood how you could use governors effectively. It's night and
day _ and makes a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush fund-raising operation has been geared more to
managing the torrent of money than soliciting donors, the Bush
organizers have not been as passive as campaign officials suggest.
The campaign has established an elite group of about 200
supporters, called ``the Pioneers,'' who have each agreed to raise
$100,000 from their friends and associates. (About half have met
the goal, campaign officials say.) The campaign refused to disclose
the names of the Pioneers. ``A lot of people would just as soon not
have their name released,'' Evans said. ``We owe them the courtesy
of keeping that private.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has not had to solicit personally, his minions
have not been shy. ``A pretty amazing thing is that when I first
got asked for money and I told the guy I would do it,'' said one
well-connected donor who spoke on the condition of anonymity, ``the
next day they called me and said, `Can you put your check in
overnight?' It's a mindset. It's one thing to get pledges, but
their turnaround must be impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the financial frenzy seems more grounded in Bush's
personal appeal than in the people pushing his virtues. It is all
the more striking because Bush is not particularly well-known
nationally and his positions on issues are largely a mystery,
although he has presented himself as a ``compassionate
conservative'' who can appeal to a broad swath of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so untested and undefined, but the Republican elite have
in an extraordinary way rallied to this candidate,'' said David B.
Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young University. ``It is
probably in their antipathy to Clinton and their sense that he's
head and shoulders above the other candidates. It's the gap between
Bush and the others that's quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview whether donors were motivated because
they see him as a winner, Bush said, ``I think that's true.'' He
added that ``there's all kinds of reasons we've done well.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a series of fund-raising events in California this week, in
which the Bush campaign drew roughly $5 million, he was met by
overflow crowds at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California team was amazed,'' Bush said. ``The people
involved in the fund-raising were smiling the whole time. Most
people are stressed out at these things. They were joyful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Freeman, the campaign's finance chairman in the state, was
so giddy about the outpouring that when he introduced the governor
at a dinner in Los Angeles, he joked that outside, ``I was
approached by a scalper who offered me a ticket for $3,000'' to the
dinner. He said of Bush, ``Believe me, there's no one I would
rather hang out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Sembler, the national finance chairman of the Republican
Party, emphasized that he had to stay impartial in the primary
races. But he said Bush was helped ``because he `does have a
wonderful personality.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many donors said in interviews that they were drawn to
Bush by what they described as his impressive political skills in
person and on television. At every gathering, Bush's staff has
built in time for him to mingle at each table and try to greet
every donor personally.
</P>
<P>
   The events draw donors from all ideological stripes _ from foes
of abortion to abortion rights supporters _ and even some
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about charisma,'' said Mary Jo Wisely, 54, a donor from
Sonoma, Calif., who owns a restaurant franchise. ``His father just
didn't get it. But his son does. And we have a candidate who can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Ling, who is senior vice president of GTX Corporation
in Phoenix, said he decided to donate to Bush because of ``his
charisma.'' He said, ``One of the driving things that people are
searching for is restoration of the dignity of the office of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ling, who is 39, also said Bush came to the race with
built-in advantages. ``He's very lucky,'' Ling said. ``He has his
father's infrastructure. His contacts in Texas and California are
formidable. All you have to do is work the phones because
Republicans are craving someone who can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ling warned that despite Bush's overwhelming financial
advantage, the honeymoon is bound to end when he begins laying out
his positions. ``He's got to deliver now,'' Ling said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The intake is so beyond what the Bush campaign had expected that
the campaign plans to announce later this month that it will not
need to take federal matching funds _ and therefore can raise and
spend far more money in the primaries. Initially, Bush had said he
would not make the announcement until October or November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was sliding into a nap on a couch in the dark cabin
of a corporate jet at about 1 a.m. on June 25 when Evans told him
the news that would be a turning point for his campaign, not to say
a milestone in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donny came back and said, `I think we can put a three before
the number,' '' he recalled in the interview. ``I was reclining and
I just kind of smiled. I just kind of shook my head. Then I sacked
out. It was a nice note to go to sleep on: a groundswell of support
that I never dreamed would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As the donations continue to pour in, the governor and Evans
insist that they have not pondered what the final figure might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Evans said. ``That's a number I haven't even
dreamed about.''

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo is a huge crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide and arson are at the heart of the charges, and at first
blush the evidence seems obvious, scattered across the landscape in
the form of burned-out buildings and bodies. The bodies keep
turning up, day after day, and are expected now to number 10,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting the exacting standards of a court of law _ even an
international tribunal focused on the highly emotional category of
war crimes _ is a different matter. For there are still specific
criminal acts to be proved, and a chain of evidence to be
established before Yugoslavia's top leaders can be held to account
for the killing that went on here. And these are cold scenes _ the
bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by the departing Serbs to destroy evidence. The sites have
been open to the elements, sometimes for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working a massive homicide,'' said Art Eberhart of
the FBI, ``except usually you have a pristine site. You are there
within 24 hours and nobody has touched anything. You tape it off
and attempt to recreate the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At many of the sites under investigation here, the houses had
been burned to a shell, with rafters, second story and roof tile
now just piles of bits of rubble 6 to 10 inches thick, Eberhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to excavate by hand, tile by tile,'' said Bill
Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist on the FBI team. ``There were
no intact sites because of burning. Everything had collapsed on
itself. Even to get at the evidence you have to excavate very
carefully. You can't go in there willy-nilly or you'll destroy the
evidence. There are hundreds of bone fragments, burned, highly
fragmented. They could be crushed in your hand very easily.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another important difference, said detectives
and other investigators from a half-dozen countries working for the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The
question to be answered in Kosovo is not exactly who pulled the
trigger or struck the match in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, these investigators are trying to corroborate the
accounts of witnesses about the pattern of the killings by Serb
forces, to establish that war crimes and crimes against humanity
did, in fact, occur. That is what would back up the indictment
already issued against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
four other Serbian leaders. They are accused of command
responsibility for a campaign of terror and violence against
Kosovo's Albanians that included deportation, murder and
persecution, all crimes against humanity. A fourth count cites the
commission of murder as a violation of the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic teams have initially been assigned to the six sites
mentioned in the indictment. But they are uncovering new evidence
of mass killings every day; many will not be fully investigated,
officials say. Others might figure in new indictments, possibly of
lower-ranking figures on whom pressure could be applied to obtain
their testimony against Milosevic and others up the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to link, say, shell casings to a specific
individual,'' said Eberhart, who headed one of two FBI forensic
teams investigating sites in Djakovica, where the Serbs
concentrated some of their greatest fury against ethnic Albanians.
``We're trying to show that a crime occurred here, in order to
support the witness statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are normally wary of eyewitnesses, knowing they
can often be contradictory, their stories clouded by emotion or
inaccurate observations. But in Kosovo, the investigators have been
struck, as have journalists, by the accuracy of the refugees'
accounts. On the ground, the crime scenes are precisely what has
been described. ``Everyone you talk to has a story,'' said Chris
Whitcomb, another FBI agent on the team. ``And when you see the
evidence, you know they are not exaggerating.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen miles away, in a field by a stream near the village
of Bela Crkva, John Bunn, chief superintendent of Scotland Yard,
concurred. He is heading a 16-member British team investigating
mass graves in a chain of villages along a 10-mile stretch of
highway between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness accounts are very, very good, and they're true, no
doubt about that,'' said Bunn, a portly figure who prefers to be
called ``detective,'' and looked as if he had stepped out of an
Agatha Christie novel in his shin-high black rubber gardening
boots. He had been camped in a tent by the stream, where executions
had been described by Isuf Zhenigi, a survivor. The detective
pointed out two mounds of earth where, with the help of tearful
villagers, he had exhumed 34 bodies,
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, there is always something for you to find,''
Bunn said, brushing aside the difficulties in matter-of-fact tones.
``We can establish cause of death, we can still work out the last
few minutes of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties abound, among them the proliferation of bodies.
Conversely, the French team went to a remote hillside by the
village of Izbice expecting to find 160 bodies at a well-documented
mass grave _ it had been photographed by satellite _ only to find
that the Serbs had dug it up and made off with the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI mounted one of the most elaborate forensic efforts in
Kosovo, with a 65-person team that included a security patrol from
its hostage rescue unit and 107,000 pounds of equipment, including
humvees, trucks, tents and communications equipment. There were
graphic artists and demolition experts. Each site _ they examined
seven in addition to the two originally assigned _ was photographed
and videotaped at each stage of the investigation. Elaborate charts
that resembled architectural drawings were made, and evidence
collected in grocery store-sized paper bags, labeled by location.
Generators powered an X-ray machine, which was needed because the
victims' flesh had deteriorated. Still, the team had to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to the elements really puts you behind the ball,''
said Rodriguez, one of two experts on loan from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology. ``Trying to play catch-up on something so
old is difficult. Much of the material is literally burned up. The
FBI had some really good improvisers and they scavenged raw
materials, doors, bed frames to create a makeshift morgue. There
was no running water, no ventilation, the smell was staggering,
flies all over you. It was very difficult to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a serial killer, one agent said, kills only a dozen or so
victims. This crime was different; the indictment says it involved
leaders of a nation who issued orders for their army, police and
wild bands of ultranationalists to kill thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved these crimes, I have no doubt about that,'' said
Eberhart as the FBI team packed up last week. ``Unless you've seen
it with your own eyes, you would never believe it.''

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo is a huge crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide and arson are at the heart of the charges, and at first
blush the evidence seems obvious, scattered across the landscape in
the form of burned-out buildings and bodies. The bodies keep
turning up, day after day, and are expected now to number 10,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting the exacting standards of a court of law _ even an
international tribunal focused on the highly emotional category of
war crimes _ is a different matter. For there are still specific
criminal acts to be proved, and a chain of evidence to be
established before Yugoslavia's top leaders can be held to account
for the killing that went on here. And these are cold scenes _ the
bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by the departing Serbs to destroy evidence. The sites have
been open to the elements, sometimes for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working a massive homicide,'' said Art Eberhart of
the FBI, ``except usually you have a pristine site. You are there
within 24 hours and nobody has touched anything. You tape it off
and attempt to recreate the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At many of the sites under investigation here, the houses had
been burned to a shell, with rafters, second story and roof tile
now just piles of bits of rubble 6 to 10 inches thick, Eberhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to excavate by hand, tile by tile,'' said Bill
Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist on the FBI team. ``There were
no intact sites because of burning. Everything had collapsed on
itself. Even to get at the evidence you have to excavate very
carefully. You can't go in there willy-nilly or you'll destroy the
evidence. There are hundreds of bone fragments, burned, highly
fragmented. They could be crushed in your hand very easily.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another important difference, said detectives
and other investigators from a half-dozen countries working for the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The
question to be answered in Kosovo is not exactly who pulled the
trigger or struck the match in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, these investigators are trying to corroborate the
accounts of witnesses about the pattern of the killings by Serb
forces, to establish that war crimes and crimes against humanity
did, in fact, occur. That is what would back up the indictment
already issued against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
four other Serbian leaders. They are accused of command
responsibility for a campaign of terror and violence against
Kosovo's Albanians that included deportation, murder and
persecution, all crimes against humanity. A fourth count cites the
commission of murder as a violation of the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic teams have initially been assigned to the six sites
mentioned in the indictment. But they are uncovering new evidence
of mass killings every day; many will not be fully investigated,
officials say. Others might figure in new indictments, possibly of
lower-ranking figures on whom pressure could be applied to obtain
their testimony against Milosevic and others up the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to link, say, shell casings to a specific
individual,'' said Eberhart, who headed one of two FBI forensic
teams investigating sites in Djakovica, where the Serbs
concentrated some of their greatest fury against ethnic Albanians.
``We're trying to show that a crime occurred here, in order to
support the witness statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are normally wary of eyewitnesses, knowing they
can often be contradictory, their stories clouded by emotion or
inaccurate observations. But in Kosovo, the investigators have been
struck, as have journalists, by the accuracy of the refugees'
accounts. On the ground, the crime scenes are precisely what has
been described. ``Everyone you talk to has a story,'' said Chris
Whitcomb, another FBI agent on the team. ``And when you see the
evidence, you know they are not exaggerating.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen miles away, in a field by a stream near the village
of Bela Crkva, John Bunn, chief superintendent of Scotland Yard,
concurred. He is heading a 16-member British team investigating
mass graves in a chain of villages along a 10-mile stretch of
highway between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness accounts are very, very good, and they're true, no
doubt about that,'' said Bunn, a portly figure who prefers to be
called ``detective,'' and looked as if he had stepped out of an
Agatha Christie novel in his shin-high black rubber gardening
boots. He had been camped in a tent by the stream, where executions
had been described by Isuf Zhenigi, a survivor. The detective
pointed out two mounds of earth where, with the help of tearful
villagers, he had exhumed 34 bodies,
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, there is always something for you to find,''
Bunn said, brushing aside the difficulties in matter-of-fact tones.
``We can establish cause of death, we can still work out the last
few minutes of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties abound, among them the proliferation of bodies.
Conversely, the French team went to a remote hillside by the
village of Izbice expecting to find 160 bodies at a well-documented
mass grave _ it had been photographed by satellite _ only to find
that the Serbs had dug it up and made off with the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI mounted one of the most elaborate forensic efforts in
Kosovo, with a 65-person team that included a security patrol from
its hostage rescue unit and 107,000 pounds of equipment, including
humvees, trucks, tents and communications equipment. There were
graphic artists and demolition experts. Each site _ they examined
seven in addition to the two originally assigned _ was photographed
and videotaped at each stage of the investigation. Elaborate charts
that resembled architectural drawings were made, and evidence
collected in grocery store-sized paper bags, labeled by location.
Generators powered an X-ray machine, which was needed because the
victims' flesh had deteriorated. Still, the team had to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to the elements really puts you behind the ball,''
said Rodriguez, one of two experts on loan from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology. ``Trying to play catch-up on something so
old is difficult. Much of the material is literally burned up. The
FBI had some really good improvisers and they scavenged raw
materials, doors, bed frames to create a makeshift morgue. There
was no running water, no ventilation, the smell was staggering,
flies all over you. It was very difficult to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a serial killer, one agent said, kills only a dozen or so
victims. This crime was different; the indictment says it involved
leaders of a nation who issued orders for their army, police and
wild bands of ultranationalists to kill thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved these crimes, I have no doubt about that,'' said
Eberhart as the FBI team packed up last week. ``Unless you've seen
it with your own eyes, you would never believe it.''

   WASHINGTON _ At a news conference recently in one of the
Capitol's many gilded chambers, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
offered a myriad of reasons why a Democratic proposal to give
patients new rights within their health insurance plans made sense.
She spoke of longer hospital stays, greater access to specialists,
better overall care.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing part of her sales pitch was a
less technical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is a women's issue,'' Ms. Mikulski told an
audience of several dozen reporters. ``Women will do anything to
make sure their children have the kind of health care they need.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few sentences, Ms. Mikulski equated being a woman with
being a mother. She thereby underscored a peculiar paradox in
Democratic politics right now: The party that fought hard to make
sure women were not defined simply as the bearers and rearers of
children is spending an awful lot of energy these days casting
women in those terms, or at least appealing to them along those
lines.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tack evident in the Democrats' continuing debate with
Republicans over how extensively to regulate health maintenance
organizations and other health insurance providers. Democrats, for
example, are insisting on a measure that gives women _ but not men
_ the right to choose a specialist as a primary doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just any specialist a woman can choose. It is an
obstetrician-gynecologist, the caretaker of her reproductive health
and her ascent to motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood was also the backdrop of Democrats' oratory in the
recent debate over gun control. Their plea for new restrictions on
firearms was framed not in terms of slain police officers or
Uzi-toting drug dealers, but in terms of child safety.
</P>
<P>
   While that partly reflected the series of shootings at public
schools that had given the issue new momentum, Democrats conceded
that it also took into account internal polls that showed that
women were more likely to support new gun control measures than men
were.
</P>
<P>
   And it hinged on the thinking that the easiest, most visceral
way to reach women was to tap their maternal instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman may have a unique perspective on how to protect and
nurture our children,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey belonged to a trio of female lawmakers in the House
who held news conferences just about every other day to reiterate
the statistic that 13 children in America die from gun violence
every day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pitch made to women, by women, on the tacit assumption
that they spoke the same language. ``These issues resonate with
women,'' Ms. Lowey said, ``because mothers worry about their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Hoff Sommers is the author of the 1994 book ``Who
Stole Feminism?'' She does not quibble with the assessment. In
fact, she believes there are intrinsic differences between women
and men, and that women are indeed more interested in child
rearing. But Ms. Sommers, now a fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative research center, said she found some
irony in the fact that Democrats were making such arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one moment, they're deploring the stereotypes, and at the
next, they're exploiting them,'' Ms. Sommers said, noting a change
over the last two decades in the thrust of Democrats' appeals to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, there was more of a commitment to the idea that the
sexes were interchangeable,'' she said. ``Now they market all of
their family-friendly policies to women. You don't have to be a
logician to note the inconsistency in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Democrats aren't doing anything that Republicans
haven't done, but Republicans never cried out for women to be
unshackled from the constraints of motherhood with quite the vigor
that Democrats did.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also simply showing themselves to be in synch with
the part of the women's movement that has altered its emphasis from
repelling any reductive, sex-based assumptions about women to
advocating policies that help women balance the demands of career
and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is often portrayed as an inevitable, universal
aspiration, despite the fact that more women than ever are not
having children. For example, in 1995, the most recent year for
which the Census Bureau provides such a breakdown, 17.5 percent of
women between the ages of 40 and 44 had not had children. Two
decades earlier, that figure was just 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers also confirm that the vast majority of women
still indeed become mothers, and while polls show that Democrats
have a pronounced advantage among young, single, childless women,
the competition with Republicans for the votes of married women
with children is unpredictable and keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters tend to become more Republican in their thinking when
blessed with what I like to call the three M's _ mortgage, marriage
and munchkins,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats are waging a particularly spirited fight on that
battleground, and Democratic political consultants noted that the
one thing shared by all these mothers _ richer or poorer, suburban
or rural _ is the responsibility of child rearing, and the worries
that accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many ads we did last year using kids,''
said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant, referring to
both state and national campaigns. That parade of children, she
added, was in pursuit of the women's vote in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that women define themselves only in terms of their
kids,'' Ms. Gorlin said. ``But if you're looking for an
across-the-board touchstone to reach the largest number of women,
this is probably a good way to do it. At a certain point, this is
universal.''
</P>
<P>
   To acknowledge that, Ms. Gorlin said, was not to reduce women
simply to being mothers, but to recognize reality: that the act and
obligations of parenting remained bigger parts of women's lives
than of men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gross generalization,'' Ms. Gorlin said, ``but women
are more preoccupied, regardless of what they do for a living, with
the issue of child-rearing.''

   WASHINGTON _ Even though he has done it faster than anyone else,
Gov. George W. Bush is not the first Texan to raise several
gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the sixth or seventh,
depending on whether you count Lloyd Bentsen.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside Ross Perot, as Bush's father would have liked to do in
1992, because the cranky billionaire's chief fund-raising device
was his personal checkbook. After that, Gov. Bush's broad-brimmed
$36.3 million, even adjusted for inflation, puts most other Texans
in the shade, though not Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush the
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent $10.5 million in 1964, according to Herbert E.
Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern
California and founder of the Citizens Research Foundation, a
nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance. In 1999 dollars
that is about $56 million. But almost all of it went for the
general election, after Johnson had run surrogates against Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace in three Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Gov. Bush has probably raised more money at this
point in the fund-raising cycle than any previous candidate for
president. Even if Bush's pace slackens a bit, he should pass
Johnson's total by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Perot's 1992 total of $67 million, mostly for general
election costs, out of Bush's reach _ not even when adjusted to $79
million in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling comparisons are not with either of those
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Perot spent his own money and Johnson ran before
there were any real limits on campaign financing, especially the
$1,000 cap on individual contributions to candidates _ a limit Bush
said last week he wanted raised, although he didn't specify a
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen ran for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and
spent about $2.25 million ($6.5 million in 1999 dollars) before
giving up as the caucuses and primaries were beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case of a Texan being the political equivalent
of all hat and no cattle is John B. Connally. A former Democratic
governor, he had never been elected to anything as a Republican,
but raised $13.7 million to run in the Republican primaries in
1980. That's $38 million in today's dollars, a figure Bush will
pass sometime in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Connally's blustery campaign never caught on, and he won
only a single delegate, Ada Mills, for many years the treasurer of
the Arkansas Republican Party. Mrs. Mills became known as the ``$10
million delegate'' (a nice round number), and is living in
Clarksville, Ark., no longer active in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996. He raised $13 million
by May 1995 and was eagerly advertising his money-raising skills.
They didn't do him much good; he was spending money almost as fast
as it came in, partly because his message of Republican populism
conflicted with his opulent fund raising and partly because Patrick
Buchanan had a better pitchfork. Gramm ultimately spent $25 million
and won 10 delegates, proving minimally more effective than
Connally.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be hard for Bush to get delegates more cheaply than
Gramm, who paid $2.5 million apiece. Dozens of Republican officials
who are sure to be delegates are already pledged to him.
</P>
<P>
   The money he has raised so far is not more than anyone has ever
spent to win a nomination. Bill Clinton reported spending $36.4
million in 1996 while Bob Dole spent $37.4 million (each amount
supplemented by national committee spending).
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, Dole's spending equals $39.6 million
today, and the Clinton total $38.3 million. Those figures include
federal matching money, which does not become available until the
election year itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think that Bush will stop raising money,
and he has more than a year to do so before the national
convention. Even if he did stop, enough money would probably
trickle in to allow him to exceed his father's standards. The elder
Bush spent $19 million in 1980 and lost the presidential
nomination, $27.6 million in 1988 and won it, and $32.7 million in
1992 and won it.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation those sums equal $38.1 million, $38.5
million and $38.5 million in 1999 dollars. They are similar because
the elder Bush accepted federal matching funds, and that obliged
him to abide by federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger will almost certainly not take the federal
money and will spend as much as he can.

   WASHINGTON _ Even though he has done it faster than anyone else,
Gov. George W. Bush is not the first Texan to raise several
gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the sixth or seventh,
depending on whether you count Lloyd Bentsen.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside Ross Perot, as Bush's father would have liked to do in
1992, because the cranky billionaire's chief fund-raising device
was his personal checkbook. After that, Gov. Bush's broad-brimmed
$36.3 million, even adjusted for inflation, puts most other Texans
in the shade, though not Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush the
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent $10.5 million in 1964, according to Herbert E.
Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern
California and founder of the Citizens Research Foundation, a
nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance. In 1999 dollars
that is about $56 million. But almost all of it went for the
general election, after Johnson had run surrogates against Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace in three Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Gov. Bush has probably raised more money at this
point in the fund-raising cycle than any previous candidate for
president. Even if Bush's pace slackens a bit, he should pass
Johnson's total by Christmas.

   WASHINGTON _ Toward the end of the Balkans air war, rarely a day
passed when NATO did not triumphantly declare that allied warplanes
had destroyed several more Yugoslav tanks or artillery pieces with
precision-guided bombs or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out that perhaps one-quarter of those weapons that
looked fearsome from 15,000 feet up were nothing more than artfully
designed decoys meant to fool allied pilots. Indeed, the Serb
military, outgunned by a technologically superior foe, proved to a
master of camouflage, concealment and deception.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav commanders built ``tanks'' of wood and plastic
sheeting, sometimes draping them with camouflage netting. To trick
thermal sensors, they put metal tape or plates on some decoys and
even set trays of water inside them that heated up in the sun, just
like a real tank would.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspected artillery revetments turned out to be disguised
pits, empty but for a long tube protruding toward the sky. And to
the dismay of the NATO air commanders, several Yugoslav MiG-21
fighter jets emerged from hidden caves once the war was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises was the extent to which the Yugoslav
military was able to use ground decoys to cause us to strike
targets that weren't real,'' said one senior Defense Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the air campaign's overall results were still
devastating and no doubt instrumental in forcing Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to cry uncle and withdraw his forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the phony targets have become a sore point with NATO's
military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, who now says the alliance
destroyed 110 of the roughly 300 tanks that Yugoslavia poured into
Kosovo, not the 150 tanks NATO initially thought it blasted into
scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, our pilots recognized those decoys,'' Clark
bristled last week. ``There is a concerted disinformation campaign
underway by the government of Yugoslavia to protect the reputation
of its armed forces and to diminish the reputation of NATO's air
power campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the emerging lessons from the air war is that
low-technology countermeasures can still fool high-technology
weaponry and sensors enough of the time to make a difference. ``The
history of warfare suggests there are always countermeasures, and
human ingenuity will find its way,'' said Eliot A. Cohen, a
professor at Johns Hopkins who directed the Air Force's definitive
study of the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, even as most of the military pushes the
envelope on futuristic warplanes, warships and battle tanks, and
clamors for more and more accurate cruise missiles and other smart
weapons, a new directorate in the Pentagon's Atlantic Command in
Norfolk, Va., is examining another set of concerns: How do
sophisticated warplanes detect concealed, mobile targets and
distinguish the right targets from mock-ups?
</P>
<P>
   One of the directorate's big efforts over the next two decades
will be to enhance a wide array of existing heat-sensing,
photographic and other sensors that verify a target is really what
it appears to be, and then speed that information to pilots firing
missiles or dropping bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Unmanned surveillance drones, for example, played a new and
important role in Kosovo, instantly sending battlefield images back
to allied command posts and targeting experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think about things like we did 15 or 20 years ago,''
said Maj. Gen. Timothy Peppe, an Air Force officer who heads the
Atlantic Command's new joint experimentation directorate.
``Potential adversaries recognize our dominance in many areas,
especially in precision weapons, so they'll look to thwart that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deception and concealment have been a part of warfare since the
Trojan horse. In the Persian Gulf war, allied pilots hit a lot of
dummy mobile Scud missile launchers, largely because even U.S.
commandoes on the ground couldn't tell actual launchers from fake
ones until they were about 25 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Low technology has also been employed effectively in weaponry to
stymie a more powerful army. Somali militiamen jury-rigged
rocket-propelled grenades to shoot down U.S. helicopters in
Mogadishu. In the Balkans air war, commanders held the Army's
premier tank-killing weapon, the Apache helicopter, out of combat
because they feared the gunships were too vulnerable to
shoulder-fired missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs used a long-shot, low-tech set of tactics to shoot down an
Air Force F-117 stealth fighter, starting with spies monitoring the
plane's takeoffs from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Land mines are the weapon of choice of many developing nations
to thwart more technologically advanced armies. Indeed, one of the
first and most dangerous jobs for NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo has
been to identify and disarm thousands of mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our very sophisticated technology can be easily
upset,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the House
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is fair to say that the United States helped write the
modern book on deception when it used decoys to fool German aerial
reconnaissance in the run-up to D-Day with its mockups of tanks and
landing craft left visible in southeastern England, seeming to
threaten Calais rather than Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question, why are these kinds of ploys still so
effective? ``Most of our sensors can't see inside things,''
explained Michael O'Hanlon, a national security analyst at the
Brookings Institution. ``It's usually cheaper and easier for
someone who's creative to fool a sensor.''
</P>
<P>
   And with U.S. commanders relying more on remote sensors and
long-distance weapons to pinpoint targets and spare pilot
casualties, the likelihood remains that even the best pilots and
most advanced missiles will get duped every now and then.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In announcing last week that the federal budget
surplus would be even more over the next 15 years _ a mind-boggling
$1 trillion _ than anticipated a few months ago, President Clinton
likened the government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed
with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so fiscally
virtuous. Minutes before Clinton said the Treasury might be able to
pay off the most important component of the national debt by 2015,
the Commerce Department released statistics showing that consumers
are headed in the other direction by spending more money than they
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of personal savings turned negative last year; total
personal spending exceeded total after-tax income. Even as the
economy roared along, with jobs plentiful, wages rising and
inflation dormant, the savings rate declined to minus 1.2 percent
in May from minus 1.0 percent in April, the lowest since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The public-private dichotomy may not be quite as stark as it
seems. Reaping huge government budget surpluses and wiping out the
national debt are just a hope at this point. Everything depends on
some sunny economic assumptions and revenue forecasts proving true
(the track record so far is not encouraging), and on Washington's
willingness to keep its appetite for tax cuts and new spending in
check (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the
savings figures suggest. Although they are amassing debt, their
overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part
because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are
making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow
is out of whack. The technical definition of savings includes bank
deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings
_ basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrast between promised government rectitude and
personal profligacy is jarring. And it was not the only discordant
note last week in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Clinton was making the case that one of the
great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower
interest rates, since the government's reduced borrowing needs
leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers. On the
other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any
smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is
already red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus
projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax
cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is
trying to cool it off. (To add to the conundrum, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of
lower taxes. Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in
the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged
stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Greenspan
awake at night for years.)
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, though. These apparent quandaries are the
interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of personal savings and national debt. Arguably,
the government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to
consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and
the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax
revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because
they are confident about their own prospects. By opening their
wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that
leads to innovation and efficiency. And while their credit card
balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are
quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually
declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9
percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London. Rising debt
was more than offset by an increase in assets, especially stocks,
which last year accounted for a quarter of all household assets, up
from 10 percent a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the
long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have
developed over the course of the long business expansion. Should
joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might
quickly find themselves on the financial precipice. The same
dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so
far has been a symbol of the U.S. economy's strength and its
ability to absorb imports. A downturn could expose the deficit as a
weakness of serious proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is
not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national
savings rate _ by far the more important economic indicator _ has
been rising. That is because the government has become a ``saver''
in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have
turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the
best way to use the fiscal windfall. Mainstream economic thought
says yes. That position dovetails with the broad political
consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing
entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the
government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom
generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt
dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent
way of stimulating additional growth. Some liberals fear that
concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed
investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all
issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the
surpluses for real?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that nobody knows. It was only a few years ago
that the problem of budget deficits appeared intractable. Today's
fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In announcing last week that the federal budget
surplus would be even more over the next 15 years _ a mind-boggling
$1 trillion _ than anticipated a few months ago, President Clinton
likened the government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed
with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so fiscally
virtuous. Minutes before Clinton said the Treasury might be able to
pay off the most important component of the national debt by 2015,
the Commerce Department released statistics showing that consumers
are headed in the other direction by spending more money than they
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of personal savings turned negative last year; total
personal spending exceeded total after-tax income. Even as the
economy roared along, with jobs plentiful, wages rising and
inflation dormant, the savings rate declined to minus 1.2 percent
in May from minus 1.0 percent in April, the lowest since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The public-private dichotomy may not be quite as stark as it
seems. Reaping huge government budget surpluses and wiping out the
national debt are just a hope at this point. Everything depends on
some sunny economic assumptions and revenue forecasts proving true
(the track record so far is not encouraging), and on Washington's
willingness to keep its appetite for tax cuts and new spending in
check (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the
savings figures suggest. Although they are amassing debt, their
overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part
because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are
making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow
is out of whack. The technical definition of savings includes bank
deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings
_ basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrast between promised government rectitude and
personal profligacy is jarring. And it was not the only discordant
note last week in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Clinton was making the case that one of the
great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower
interest rates, since the government's reduced borrowing needs
leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers. On the
other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any
smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is
already red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus
projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax
cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is
trying to cool it off. (To add to the conundrum, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of
lower taxes. Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in
the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged
stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Greenspan
awake at night for years.)
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, though. These apparent quandaries are the
interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of personal savings and national debt. Arguably,
the government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Across the United States right now, the
Women's World Cup of soccer is the sports event of high summer,
attracting stupendous crowds and frenzies of attention usually not
seen there for any kind of soccer, or any women's sport, let alone
both.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Brazil meets the United States in the semifinals, but
you would hardly know it from the coverage here in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   While Sissi and Katia (Brazilian soccer players use only one
name) are heading toward their confrontation with Mia Hamm and
Julie Foudy, Brazilian sports pages are focused almost entirely on
the prospects of their men's soccer team winning the Copa America
and the reasons why its coach, Wanderley Luxemburgo, left the top
goal scorers Romario and Edmundo off the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer may be the king of sports here, but only the men's
version of the game seems to wear the crown. Not one of this year's
matches of the Brazilian national women's team has been televised
live, sponsors have shied away from any association with the team,
and hard-core fans who can recite the entire roster of the 1950
men's World Cup squad are hard-pressed to name even one of the
current World Cup women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, women's soccer still doesn't have a chance in
Brazil,'' Armando Nogueira, one of the country's leading sports
commentators, said when asked about the lack of interest here.
``The best woman player in Brazil will never be as popular as the
worst male player, and the main reason is that women have been
idolized as delicate objects of desire, incapable of playing a
physical-contact, body-to-body sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Renata Cordeiro, 29, is one of Brazil's few female
sportscasters, working for the SporTV cable channel as a soccer
specialist. She recalls that when she was a teen-ager, her best
friend asked that soccer be added to their school's physical
education curriculum. ``Absolutely not,'' was the answer that came
back. ``Soccer is not an appropriate activity for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes can be encountered all over Latin America, where
the passion for soccer is exceeded only by the deeply ingrained
machismo that governs the social roles of daily life. And
everything is accentuated in Brazil, which has won four men's World
Cups, more than any other country. Since the days of Pele, it has
prided itself on grooming the world's best players and playing the
most inventive and flashy version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, soccer has a strong gender demarcation that makes
it a masculine domain par excellence,'' said Dr. Roberto da Matta,
a prominent anthropologist and sociologist. ``It is a sport that
contains all of the various elements that are traditionally used to
define masculinity: conflict, physical confrontation, guts,
dominance, control and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the verbs used in popular speech to describe possession
of the soccer ball are also the kinds of words used in the street
to describe sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all nouns in Portuguese have a gender, and the most
common word for ball, ``bola,'' has connotations as feminine as the
voluptuous roundness of the ball itself, which to many Brazilian
males evokes the breasts and buttocks of a woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see players out on the field kissing or caressing the ball
all the time,'' Ms. Cordeiro pointed out. ``There really is an
erotic component to this, and it is all tied up with the idea of
the man subduing the ball just as he would a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The gender taboos extend not only to playing the national game
but also to seeing it performed. The stadium, with all its
ritualized public violence and swagger, both in the stands and on
the field, has traditionally been seen as off-limits to women. On
June 27, as part of a campaign to change that image, free tickets
were distributed to 8,000 women who were among the crowd of more
than 100,000 that attended the national championship between
Botafogo and Juventude at Maracana stadium here. But the notion of
actually going to a game remains anathema to many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Maracana, and there is no way you could
ever get me to go there,'' said Leticia Carvalho de Almeida, a
34-year-old dental technician and mother of two daughters,
wrinkling her nose in disgust at the idea. ``Just to think of all
those stinking sweaty men shouting curse words, fighting and
pouring beer and urine all over each other makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, the assumption at the popular level is
that any female athlete has somehow been masculinized and her
femininity compromised. The basketball star Hortensia got around
that problem by posing nude for Playboy; other basketball and
volleyball players, plagued by rumors that they are lesbians,
prefer to appear with boyfriends or husbands and children, their
faces made up and their hair coiffed, in glossy photo layouts for
gossip magazines like Caras or VIP.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that has held women's soccer back is that
there aren't any beautiful women yet who play the game,'' Nogueira
said. ``The volleyball authorities have made an investment in
sensuality that has really paid off for them, and women's soccer
needs to use those marketing methods. They should be trying to
increase the charm quotient instead of imitating men on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Brazilians are interested in this Women's
World Cup at all, they seem more fascinated by the powerful U.S.
team, which has demonstrated the dominance and mastery they admire,
than by their own. As play was beginning, the weekly newsmagazine
Isto E ran a profile not of the home squad, but of ``the Yankee
girls'' and Ms. Hamm. Taking Brazil's flashiest male player as a
reference point, the article described Ms. Hamm as ``a kind of
Ronaldinho, but with better hips, a more agile game and an ability
to score lots of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   For female fans like Ms. Cordeiro, that focus has led to an
unexpected problem. As a Brazilian who knows and has interviewed
many of her country's top female players, she is naturally hoping
for a championship, or at least a good showing, by Brazil's team.
``It would really help the development of the game for women
here,'' she said. ``Brazilians expect their teams to win it all,
and if we could do that, it would build support and interest and
force the men to take the women's game seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a woman, she is also ``thrilled by the way the Americans
play, the skill and nimbleness with which they dribble and pass the
ball and score goals,'' she conceded. ``They've proven once again
that women are capable of great things if they are just given some
sort of opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Da Matta, though, cautions that no matter who wins the cup,
Americans have no grounds to feel superior. ``The fundamental point
to remember is that all societies, not just Brazil, have these
blind spots, and that such cultural differences persist despite all
the talk of globalization,'' he said. ``For example, in your
country you have lots of women playing soccer, tennis, volleyball
and even baseball. But where are your female football players?''

   Da Matta, though, cautions that no matter who wins the cup,
Americans have no grounds to feel superior. ``The fundamental point
to remember is that all societies, not just Brazil, have these
blind spots, and that such cultural differences persist despite all
the talk of globalization,'' he said. ``For example, in your
country you have lots of women playing soccer, tennis, volleyball
and even baseball. But where are your female football players?''

   DOHA, Qatar _ In millions of homes and offices across the Arab
world, television sets are regularly tuned these days to Al
Jazeera, a hard-hitting Arabic-language news channel that explores
issues long suppressed by the region's rulers, including the lack
of democracy, the persecution of political dissidents and the
repression of women.
</P>
<P>
   From studios in this tiny emirate in the Persian Gulf, Al
Jazeera offers round-the-clock programming based on a principle
revolutionary by the traditional standards of Middle East
broadcasting, that all coverage should be free of censorship or
bias. In another innovation for the Arab world, ordinary Arabs can
air their views on an array of freewheeling phone-in shows.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a sensation in the 22 Arab countries where
Al Jazeera's broadcasts can be seen. In Algiers' Casbah, in Cairo's
slums, in the suburbs of Damascus, even in the desert tents of
Bedouins with satellite dishes, the channel has become a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In its 30 months on air, it has drawn viewers in droves from the
mind-numbing fare offered by the region's state-run networks, whose
news coverage often amounts to little more than a reverential
chronicle of government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even where Al Jazeera cannot be seen live, in countries like
Iraq that ban satellite dishes, videos of its shows are traded
eagerly in bazaars. Sometimes viewer interest has been piqued by
scoops like the lengthy interview the channel broadcast three weeks
ago with Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant who has been
indicted as the alleged mastermind of the bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa last year that killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The interview gave Arab audiences their first opportunity to
hear bin Laden speak uncensored. Ironically, for an enterprise
often accused of acting as a mouthpiece for ``American ideas,'' Al
Jazeera's management faced pressure not to broadcast the interview
from U.S. diplomats who expressed fears that bin Laden's calls for
new attacks could heighten risks for Americans in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Qatar channel has been watched with growing interest by
Middle East scholars, many of whom see it as emblematic of deep
stirrings across the Arab world. Some specialists see its
popularity as evidence that Islamic conservatism, long seen as the
rising force in the Arab world, faces a challenge from a new
generation yearning for societies that are more, not less, tolerant
and democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Al Jazeera shows is that people across the Arab world
want open discussion of the issues that affect their lives, and
that new communications technologies make it impossible for
governments to stop them,'' said Dale Eickelman, a Dartmouth
College professor who recently visited Al Jazeera's studios in
Doha. He added: ``The days have gone when Arab governments can
control what their people know, and what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's rulers, unable or unwilling to take the drastic
steps that would be necessary to deny their people access to the
channel, such as confiscating satellite dishes, have mostly limited
themselves to verbal counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, government spokesmen have dubbed it ``the
suspicious channel,'' and described its programming as
``poisonous.'' In Algeria, an Al Jazeera program exploring the
darker corners of that country's civil war suddenly went off the
air when the government cut electrical power in several major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But among ordinary Arabs, the channel is credited with breathing
much-needed fresh air into the stifling climate in which Arabs have
traditionally debated political, social and religious issues.
Programs have dealt with previously unmentionable topics like the
prevalence of torture in Arab jails, the killing and
``disappearing'' of political opponents in countries like Algeria,
and even the modern relevance of ancient Islamic codes, such as the
right of Muslim men to marry up to four wives.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been glossed over in the channel's readiness to
challenge old taboos, even when the subject touches on the most
sensitive issue of all, the teachings of the Muslim prophet
Mohammed, as embodied in the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jazeera's discussion programs have pitted conservative Muslim
clerics against reformist scholars, and feminists against
traditionalists, in exchanges that have explored the bitter
differences over Islamic doctrine within the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming what visitors to Arab palaces already knew _ that the
channel is widely watched by the powerful, as well as the
disempowered _ one phone-in program was called last year by Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan ruler, offering his views on Arab
nationalism. Other callers, usually from sanctuaries outside their
own countries, have condemned leaders like President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq, and urged their overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the Arab world's most powerful leaders, Al Jazeera's
feistiness is all the more galling for the fact that it is
broadcast from Qatar, a nation of 600,000 people, the smallest in
the Arab world. Eighteen months before Al Jazeera's first broadcast
in November 1996, power passed in a bloodless palace coup from one
of the most conservative Arab rulers to his son, Sheik Hamad bin
Khalifa al-Thani, a graduate of Britain's Sandhurst military
academy.
</P>
<P>
   The new emir of Qatar, who is 47 years old, has proved to be one
of the Arab world's most reform-minded leaders. Shortly after
taking power, he abolished the Information Ministry, and with it a
system of censorship that kept tight control on newspapers and
broadcasting. A few months later, while pondering the possibility
of establishing what some Qataris call ``an Arab CNN,'' a
fortuitous turn of events in London suddenly made the step more
practicable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the BBC, long famed in the Middle East for the
Arabic-language broadcasts of its World Service radio network,
expanded into television in a deal with a Saudi-backed company,
Orbit Communications, which operates several satellite channels of
its own. With an annual payment of about $35 million from the
Saudis, the BBC provided regular Arabic-language newscasts to be
carried on Orbit's main Middle East channel.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 months, the deal foundered when the BBC's insistence on
editorial independence ran headlong into Saudi refusal to tolerate
BBC reporting on issues seen as impugning Saudi Arabia's ruling
family, including executions in the desert kingdom and the
activities of a prominent Saudi dissident in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   When Orbit pulled the plug on the BBC deal, Qatar hired 20 of
the BBC's editors, reporters and technicians, all with Arab
backgrounds, as the nucleus of Al Jazeera's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Qatar government pledged $140 million to finance the channel
for five years, but bound Al Jazeera's managers to make the
enterprise self-sustaining after that with advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years later, despite its popular success, the
channel has been largely shunned by the big multinational companies
that are the major advertisers on the Middle East's tamer satellite
channels, almost certainly because the companies fear a backlash
from powerful countries like Saudi Arabia.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Despite the reaction of Arab governments, Sheik Hamad, the Qatar
ruler, says he intends to stick by Al Jazeera. ``What a headache,''
he said, chuckling, when asked about the satellite channel during
an interview at his sumptuous palace in Doha. ``It's caused no end
of problems, but all the same I think of it as a kind of oxygen,
invigorating our thinking. I tell my children, if you want to know
the issues of real importance in the Arab world, watch Al
Jazeera.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hamad has taken other steps to liberalize life in Qatar.
Earlier this year, Qataris, including women, had their first
election, for a municipal council. The next step will be an elected
parliament, with powers yet to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Qataris applaud the changes, many say the emir's
motives in setting up Al Jazeera and carrying out his reforms have
a logic beyond enthusiasm for democracy: It is a desire to
strengthen Qatar's fragile sovereignty and identity, and
particularly to give his small gulf nation an image distinct from
Saudi Arabia, where the ruling family has shown little appetite for
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very intelligent way of telling the world that
Qatar exists,'' said Dima Khatib, a 28-year-old reporter at the
channel. ``It's put Qatar on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new renown has come at a price, and not only in
relations with Saudi Arabia. Last November, Jordan closed Al
Jazeera's news bureau in Amman after a Syrian commentator on Al
Jazeera, fulminating against Jordan's peace treaty with Israel,
described Jordan as ``an artificial entity'' populated by ``a bunch
of Bedouins living in an arid desert.''
</P>
<P>
   After apologies from Qatar the order was rescinded. But last
month, Kuwait took a leaf from Jordan's book and ordered Al
Jazeera's bureau in Kuwait closed after an Islamic militant calling
an Al Jazeera phone-in program from Europe suggested that Kuwait's
ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Jaber al-Sabah, should be ousted for agreeing
to extend the vote in Kuwaiti elections to women. That dispute
remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But these spats have paled beside the controversies stirred by
Al Jazeera's handling of some of the Muslim world's hottest social
and religious issues. On programs with names bursting with
irreverent intent _ like ``The Opposite Direction,'' ``More Than
One Opinion'' and ``Without Boundaries'' _ the channel has used its
studios to foment debates with a candor unimaginable in a public
forum in the Arab world before Al Jazeera's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular show, ``The Opposite Direction,'' uses a format
similar to CNN's ``Crossfire,'' with two studio guests chosen for
their diametrically opposed views confronting each other in the
Doha studio, or by live video link.
</P>
<P>
   The program has made a star of its presenter, Faisal al-Kasim, a
37-year-old Syrian whose bespectacled appearance and scholarly
background _ he holds a doctorate in English literature _ belie a
Rottweiler-like snappiness that helps give the show its nervy edge.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kasim's most talked-about shows featured two women
debating polygamy among Muslim men. One participant, a leftist
member of the Jordanian Parliament, set the tone for a furious
exchange by saying that a practice authorized by the prophet
Mohammed in the seventh century, when many Arab women had been
widowed in war, had outlived its validity. ``Why should we put up
with this rubbish now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her adversary for the show, an Egyptian woman with strongly
conservative views on matters of Islamic doctrine, stood up, tore
off her microphone and headed for the exit. When a startled Kasim
attempted to dissuade her, noting that the program was ``on air''
across the Arab world, she shot back: ``I don't care if we're on
the planet Mars; I'm not going to tolerate this blasphemy.'' With
that, she slammed the door behind her, and departed for Cairo.

   WASHINGTON _ Midway through announcing his proposal to revamp
Medicare last week, President Clinton seemed to notice that there
were ghosts in the room.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the first time he came face to face with the
suffering of older Americans forced to choose between medicine and
food _ during the rough, recessionary days of the 1992 presidential
campaign, when the plight of the uninsured and the under-insured
burst into the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was almost seven years ago,'' Clinton said, somewhat
ruefully, ``but it still happens today.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Clinton's new proposal for Medicare, the giant
federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, seemed to
be something more than another ritualistic exercise in
policy-making by a waning administration.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with
a nation's contradictory desires on health care, and an
acknowledgment of the hard lessons learned in the past seven years.
There were, indeed, a lot of ghosts in the room, from the
bright-eyed Clintonians who tried, and failed, to reconstruct the
American health care system in 1993, to the confident Republicans
who tried, and failed, to overhaul the Medicare system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ghosts in the room last week was President Lyndon B.
Johnson, the political godfather of Medicare, quoted by Clinton _
and perhaps invoked for his talismanic power.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over health care, in retrospect, was one of the
defining political conflicts of the 1990s. And most of its tensions
were evident again last week as Clinton unveiled his plan to
fortify Medicare's finances, add prescription drugs to its benefits
and spur more competition for its beneficiaries among private
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Congress and the White House faced a debate over how
to hold down costs while still delivering high-quality care. Once
again, the subtext was how much faith to place in the corporate
sector and the power of the marketplace, and how much trust to
reserve for the government.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, politicians were asking how much Americans were
willing to spend to insure that the technological revolutions of
modern medicine _ like the newest, most expensive prescription
drugs _ are available and affordable to those who need them.
</P>
<P>
   In one forum or another, those issues have been debated since a
little-known Pennsylvania Democrat, Harris Wofford, put health care
reform on the political map by riding it to victory in a special
Senate election in 1991. For all the struggle over health care,
though, only the murkiest consensus has emerged. At the end of the
day, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health research group, ``there's a broad sense that nothing's easy
in health policy and there are no magic solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Clinton plan is a sadder-but-wiser guess at what is
still feasible and politically palatable among the grand theories
and principles that have dominated health care thinking over the
past 10 years. It is perhaps most striking for what it doesn't do.
As Marilyn Moon, a health care analyst at the Urban Institute in
Washington, put it, the plan ``doesn't lock us into big-time
structural change before we really know where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal seeks a mixed solution of managed care
(health maintenance organizations and other entities that try to
control costs and coordinate care) and traditional fee-for-service
medicine (in which patients have a free choice of doctors
reimbursed by the government).
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their new plan would protect and
buttress traditional Medicare for anyone who chooses it while
creating new incentives for competition among private health care
plans for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not radical restructuring, but it's not incremental
reform either,'' said Robert Reischauer, an economist at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a sense, another Clintonian compromise, this time
between the ardent defenders of traditional Medicare and the true
believers in the marketplace, who argue that the government has
never really given managed care plans a fair shot at competing for
Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects a more realistic appraisal of ideas that
once looked so promising. In 1993, there was a lot more hubris:
When the administration first attempted to restructure the rest of
the health care system, many of its health planners saw managed
care and a well-organized marketplace as nothing short of wondrous
in their ability to control costs and improve quality.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a private sector revolution that pushed most
working Americans into managed care with mixed results, a lot of
that euphoria is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's hardly anybody left who really believes we're
on the dawn of offering dramatically better service to people at a
lower price,'' said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and
health at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this month the Senate will begin debate on legislation
to create a ``patients' bill of rights'' to protect consumers in
the new world of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Medicare's experience with managed care in the past
few years has hardly been an unalloyed success. Last week, HMOs
announced further pullbacks from the Medicare market as well as
benefit cuts and premium hikes, claiming the government has been
underpaying them.

<P>
   Advocates of making Medicare more like a private health care
market say such difficulties are a result of too much government
regulation. But others say Medicare needs to move cautiously, given
the difficulties of shifting an older, medically vulnerable
population into the private marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan also tries to deal with a longstanding question
of access to health care: It proposes prescription drug coverage in
Medicare, at a time when new pharmaceuticals offer extraordinary
promise to older Americans but confront them with extraordinary
expense. This proposal, too, reflects the sadder-but-wiser approach
to health policy; most expansions of benefits or coverage since the
failure of the Clinton effort in 1993-94 have been discrete,
focused efforts like this, from protections for people changing
jobs in 1996 to coverage for uninsured children in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy, perhaps, that even when the government is
awash in surpluses, there is very little serious discussion in
Washington these days about reducing the vulnerability of the 43
million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever get closer to universal coverage, it'll be through
a hundred incremental programs, because of the legacy of
extraordinary cynicism and distrust of government,'' Blendon
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the health care wars, of course, Clinton
promised to give every American a health security card and the
benefits to go with it. The collapse of his plan was seen as such a
repudiation of government that few politicians dare broach the
subject of universal coverage these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that it will take a crisis _ perhaps a
major economic downturn and an even greater increase in the numbers
of uninsured _ before that issue rises to the top of the agenda
again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be long gone by that time; the Medicare proposal may
be his last on health care. It is almost certainly less than what
he thought he would accomplish when health care first arose in the
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But no one considers passage of his plan, or some equivalent, to
be a sure thing.

market say such difficulties are a result of too much government
regulation. But others say Medicare needs to move cautiously, given
the difficulties of shifting an older, medically vulnerable
population into the private marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan also tries to deal with a longstanding question
of access to health care: It proposes prescription drug coverage in
Medicare, at a time when new pharmaceuticals offer extraordinary
promise to older Americans but confront them with extraordinary
expense. This proposal, too, reflects the sadder-but-wiser approach
to health policy; most expansions of benefits or coverage since the
failure of the Clinton effort in 1993-94 have been discrete,
focused efforts like this, from protections for people changing
jobs in 1996 to coverage for uninsured children in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy, perhaps, that even when the government is
awash in surpluses, there is very little serious discussion in
Washington these days about reducing the vulnerability of the 43
million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever get closer to universal coverage, it'll be through
a hundred incremental programs, because of the legacy of
extraordinary cynicism and distrust of government,'' Blendon
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the health care wars, of course, Clinton
promised to give every American a health security card and the
benefits to go with it. The collapse of his plan was seen as such a
repudiation of government that few politicians dare broach the
subject of universal coverage these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that it will take a crisis _ perhaps a
major economic downturn and an even greater increase in the numbers
of uninsured _ before that issue rises to the top of the agenda
again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be long gone by that time; the Medicare proposal may
be his last on health care. It is almost certainly less than what
he thought he would accomplish when health care first arose in the
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But no one considers passage of his plan, or some equivalent, to
be a sure thing.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A handful of black-robed, full-bearded
Serb Orthodox priests bobbed on the edges of a noisy crowd that
assembled last week in the Serb town of Cacak to demand that
President Slobodan Milosevic resign.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the Rev. Stojan Stokic, a village priest who had
driven more than 150 miles for the rally, showed off the same pious
fury, the same political passion that characterized many Roman
Catholic priests in Poland who more than a decade ago helped the
Solidarity movement topple communism.
</P>
<P>
   To see and hear Stokic was to believe that something fundamental
is changing in the soul of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which
grabbed international attention last month by coming out ahead of
Serb opposition parties and calling on Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But Stokic, who said he would preach his anti-Milosevic politics
in his parish on Sunday morning, is still an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is both bound by and responsible for the
notion that wherever Serbs live and bury their dead should be part
of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the church that 10 years ago welcomed Milosevic's
violent nationalist land grab in the collapsing Yugoslavia and
whose most senior bishops traveled in the war zones of Croatia and
Bosnia, blessing Serb forces shelling towns like Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its head, Patriarch Pavle, said last week in Kosovo
that the Serb leader's policies are criminal, the church continues
to send mixed signals about what its priests should do in toppling
a president who is indicted as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Stokic said the war in Kosovo, where Serbs committed atrocities
against Albanians before losing control of territory his church
regards as sacred to Serbs, had changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so ashamed and I am feeling guilty,'' he said.
``Milosevic never mentions that Albanians were killed. He is only
president of the police. It isn't the job of the Orthodox Church to
speak about politics. But now in this terrible time, we must speak
out against this man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop Atanasije, vicar of the patriarchy in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, and a cleric who often speaks for Pavle, said in
an interview: ``The church is not a political body. If the church
has called for Slobodan Milosevic to resign, it is not because the
church is involved in politics, it is out of her own pastoral care
for the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking pains to deny news stories that parish priests around
Serbia have been instructed to use Sunday's services as the
beginning of a campaign to teach Serbs about atrocities committed
in their name in Kosovo, the bishop said, ``Those reports have
nothing to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It is enough that the church hierarchy has spoken publicly, he
said, adding that in local parishes, priests should stick to the
Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for the priests to speak out,'' said
Atanasije, drawing a clear distinction between what the Serbian
Orthodox Church is willing to do here and what the Catholic Church
did in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roman Catholic Church is allowed to use any means in order
to achieve a good goal,'' the bishop said. ``The Orthodox Church
must always use evangelical means. We cannot say to the people rise
up and throw off your government. We cannot use evil means to
overcome evil. We can say obey the statutes of the law. That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade during which Milosevic has been fomenting ethnic
war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian Orthodox Church has frequently
criticized him and called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, shortly after the start of the Croatian war, Pavle
accused Milosevic of making Serbs ``victims of communist tyranny''
and called for the creation of a government of national salvation.
The patriarch in 1997 led a procession of more than 100,000 people
into central Belgrade and lent his support to months of
demonstrations during which opposition parties demanded that the
president step down.
</P>
<P>
   But until the patriarch began speaking recently of the ``evil''
he has seen in Kosovo, the focus of church criticism has not been
that Milosevic's government committed atrocities in trying to
create a new Serb empire, but that it has been unsuccessful in
building that larger state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blame Milosevic not for trying to defend the nation, but
for failing,'' said Atanasije.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent statements about Kosovo, Atanasije said the
church is not rethinking the support that many of its senior
priests, including the patriarch himself, gave in blessing Bosnian
Serb forces whose leaders have now been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One priest, the Rev. Filaret Micovic, photographed in Bosnia
atop a tank while brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle, was recently
promoted to bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything strange about the presence of a priest
among his troops,'' Atanasije said.
</P>
<P>
   This continuing stream of conflicting messages _ the embrace of
nationalist aspirations but the rejection of Milosevic's savage
means of realizing them _ grows out of the pivotal role that the
church has played for nearly seven centuries in gestating and
defending the idea of what it means to be a Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Serb and being Orthodox mean the same thing,'' said
Mirko Djordjevic, a retired literature professor and the author of
a new book about the church and its ties to Milosevic. ``Our church
itself has generated nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Under centuries of Ottoman occupation, when the state of Serbia
ceased to exist, it was the church and its myth-making senior
clerics who kept the fires of Serb nationalism burning, and made
honored saints of Serb warriors. Prince Lazar, who led Serb forces
against the Turks in the glorious lost battle of Kosovo in 1389,
was reputed by the same church that made him a saint to have said:
``It is better to die in battle than to live in shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The hold on many Serbs of what the church has always described
as a glorious national past has encouraged Serbs to hope for
another Great Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In realizing the church's long-held dream that all Serbs should
live in the same state, the rise of Milosevic in the late 1980s was
the best news the Serbian Orthodox Church had heard for decades,
Djordjevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church believed Milosevic was the messiah who had come to
smile on all Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Bosnia, the bishops openly supported Radovan Karadzic,
blessing his war to lop off part of that former Yugoslav republic
and fuse it to Serbia. Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs during
the 1992-1995 war, has been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of Tito's communism, during which the church was
repressed and controlled by the government and some of its vast
properties were confiscated, Milosevic allowed the church to
reclaim its role in Serb society. Priests appeared on
state-controlled television. He pledged to allow religious
education in schools and to return church property, promises later
broken.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian holidays have again become public celebrations in
Serbia and the church in 1989 was allowed to elect a patriarch,
Pavle, who is from Kosovo, without government interference. As
Yugoslavia unraveled and wars began in the early 1990s, Serb
paramilitary leaders _ many of them responsible for atrocities and
wholesale campaigns of theft in Croatia and Bosnia _ invoked the
church as their inspiration for defending Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The warlord Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan and has
been indicted as a war criminal, said publicly that his ``supreme
commander'' was Pavle. Before Arkan's indictment by the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, but after worldwide publicity
about the brutality and greed of his paramilitary fighters,
Orthodox priests officiated at his lavish and very public wedding
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Djordjevic, regarded as a leading expert on the Serbian church,
says Pavle has been ``shocked'' by the evidence of atrocities that
he has seen in Kosovo since the 11-week war with NATO ended in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   That shock has resulted in what Djordjevic describes as a new
direction for the church, with the patriarch and Bishop Artemije,
the most senior representative of the church in Kosovo, speaking
openly of ``evil'' done by Serbs against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije took part Friday in a U.N.-sponsored meeting with the
leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, and other
Albanian leaders. They signed a joint statement condemning war
crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije has long opposed Milosevic but has not often been heard
inside Yugoslavia. Shortly after the NATO bombing began, he made a
proclamation to be read in every church in Kosovo, criticizing what
he called ``pogroms'' against the Albanians. It condemned the
burning of houses and attacking of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read it in our church,'' said Sava, an assistant to
Artemije and one of the most outspoken liberal priests in the
church. Sava admitted that many priests may have chosen not to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brave, because of the secret police,'' the priest said.
``And you know we have no free media. Artemije was then attacked by
Serb state media and called a madman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is not a monolith, he explained, and priests
do not have to obey the patriarch, as members of the Roman Catholic
Church have to obey the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not unified,'' Sava said. ``People can have their own
political understanding. There are a lot of deluded people in the
church as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade on Friday, Atanasije insisted on steering an
interview away from the matter of the church's new openness about
atrocities committed by Serbs and toward what he described as
foreigners' refusal to give equal time to the abuse of Serbs by
other ethnic groups across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westerners tend to close their eyes when the suffering of
Serbs is concerned,'' the bishop said, emphasizing an abiding
tradition in the Orthodox church that sees Serbs as victims of
foreign manipulation. ``What was done in Kosovo, of course, was
evil. But the next question that has to be asked is who committed
evil. The Serbs were not the only actors.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 8, Dr.
Domenica Vacca, an obstetrician-gynecologist who quit practicing
medicine two years ago when her son was born, arrives for work at a
white-shingled three-story building in Owings, Md. For the next
eight hours, she sits in front of a computer and holds private
electronic conversations with people seeking her advice on
everything from herpes to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   In her part-time job with Ask the Doc, a service offered free by
AmericasDoctor.com, Dr. Vacca traverses delicate legal territory. A
lengthy on-screen disclaimer informs her questioners that the
company's Internet doctors _ it employs more than 100 _ ``will not
engage in any conduct that involves the practice of medicine.''
They will not diagnose illness, prescribe medication, keep a
medical record of the conversation or even reveal their identities.
But they do provide something the callers' own doctors often can't
give: peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of questions on menstrual irregularity,
pregnancy,'' Dr. Vacca says. ``A lot of questions on sexually
transmitted diseases, women coming on saying I have this pain or
that discharge, what could it be? And they will actually say, `I
can't get through to my doctor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when managed care has put greater distance between
doctors and their patients, the Internet is filling the gaps.
According to Scott Reents, an analyst with Cyber Dialogue, a New
York company that tracks Internet commerce, last year an estimated
22 million Americans went online for medical information, mostly
about specific diseases and drugs. That number is projected to jump
to 33 million by next year.
</P>
<P>
   All that growth translates into what Reents called ``a
free-for-all'' on the World Wide Web, where thousands of sites are
offering some type of health information. Investment money is
pouring in; Dr. C. Everett Koop, a U.S. surgeon general in the
1980s, became a 1999 Internet millionaire when his Web site,
DrKoop.com, went public. Healtheon, the medical records giant, has
snapped up WebMd, a small Internet health information company, in a
deal valued at more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. George Lundberg, who as the editor of the Journal of
the American Medical Association, once cautioned that ``science and
snake oil may not always look all that different on the Net,'' has
gone electronic. After being dismissed from the journal in January,
he became editor in chief of Medscape.com, an information site for
doctors. Medscape will launch a consumer site this month, which
Lundberg said would ``set the standard'' for Internet health
information.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money at stake, and so many patients hungry for
information, experts say it was inevitable that doctors would begin
not only offering advice over the Internet but using the Web to
practice medicine. And they have, in ways that make many medical
experts, and even some Internet health entrepreneurs, a little
queasy.
</P>
<P>
   Some have set up Web sites for the sole purpose of prescribing
and selling hot-ticket prescription drugs like Viagra to patients
they have not met _ a practice that has drawn the attention of
state and federal regulators, who regard it as unethical, though
not illegal. The American Medical Association says doctors who
prescribe drugs to people they have never physically examined
should face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to call them a part of my profession,'' said Dr.
Nancy Dickey, a former president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Others are finding novel ways to diagnose and treat over the
Net. Dr. Daniel Carlin, a Massachusetts emergency medicine
specialist, founded WorldClinic to treat people living and
traveling abroad. Carlin, who has worked as a volunteer in Afghan
refugee camps, outfits his patients with kits that include
prescription medication. He keeps their medical records on file,
and patients who need him quickly can send an electronic message
and his beeper will go off. Soon, Carlin said, his Web site will
offer links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
other reliable sources of information. Last year, he drew
international attention when, via e-mail, he helped save the arm of
a Russian sailor who had been injured in a yacht race 1,000 miles
off the coast of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberdocs.com practices medicine at home. For a fee of $50 to
$100, the Web site provides board-certified specialists who engage
in private electronic chat sessions, which the company calls
``virtual house calls,'' to treat minor illnesses. The doctors can
prescribe any drugs except controlled substances, including
narcotics. Dr. Tom Caffrey, who founded the company in 1996, five
years after graduating from medical school, said he has diagnosed a
case of shingles, sent someone to the emergency room for heart
disease and refilled blood pressure medication _ all online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're at work, you're feeling sick,'' said Caffrey. ``Do
you have four hours to go to the emergency room? Can you get an
appointment with your doctor who is jerking you around? Here's a
way for patients and doctors to talk again.''
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey says he wants Cyberdocs to lay the groundwork for the
next technological revolution, when video conferencing becomes
commonplace. The doctors at Cyberdocs, which is insured for
malpractice, work only within their specialties, and only on
patients who live in states the doctors are licensed in. ``We're
trying to do real medicine,'' Caffrey said, ``under the limitations
of the present technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the company is crossing the line. Why have
virtual visits, they ask, when there are plenty of American doctors
available? ``It is difficult for me to imagine that any physician
is doing this for other than monetary return,'' said Dr. David
Rothman, a medical historian at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   And why, some critics ask, would anyone attempt to diagnose a
patient's illness without a physical exam or even the simplest
tests, like blood pressure monitoring?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole contractual relationship between a doctor and a
patient is that you actually see, touch, feel, smell a patient to
get as much data as you can to be accurate in your diagnosis and
treatment,'' said Dr. Bruce Dan, medical director of Medcast, a
private online service for doctors. The telephone is more
productive than an online chat, he says. ``You can hear the tenor
of the patient,'' Dan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no professional standards for doctors working on the
Web, and experts say even those patients who sign on just looking
for a free opinion should be cautious. ``We don't know who's out
there giving the advice,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ``You may
be getting advice on your allergies from a pathologist. On your
psychological problems from a gastroenterologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Caplan predicted, these problems will be erased by
technology. ``We will have certification and standards for doctors,
link-ups to televised images and readouts from microchips that may
be in your body,'' he said. ``I think that world will come, but it
ain't here by a long shot.''

   And why, some critics ask, would anyone attempt to diagnose a
patient's illness without a physical exam or even the simplest
tests, like blood pressure monitoring?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole contractual relationship between a doctor and a
patient is that you actually see, touch, feel, smell a patient to
get as much data as you can to be accurate in your diagnosis and
treatment,'' said Dr. Bruce Dan, medical director of Medcast, a
private online service for doctors. The telephone is more
productive than an online chat, he says. ``You can hear the tenor
of the patient,'' Dan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no professional standards for doctors working on the
Web, and experts say even those patients who sign on just looking
for a free opinion should be cautious. ``We don't know who's out
there giving the advice,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ``You may
be getting advice on your allergies from a pathologist. On your
psychological problems from a gastroenterologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Caplan predicted, these problems will be erased by
technology. ``We will have certification and standards for doctors,
link-ups to televised images and readouts from microchips that may
be in your body,'' he said. ``I think that world will come, but it
ain't here by a long shot.''

STANTON AND ANTHONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest splendid effort from the documentary filmmaker Ken
Burns is about two women who barely register in the consciousness
of late-20th-century America, but whose lives were critically
important to the freedoms most of us take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   If you mention Thomas Jefferson, or Lincoln, or Martin Luther
King, you'll get a sense, at the very least, that people know whom
you're talking about. Mention Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.
Anthony and you're likely to encounter an epidemic of blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think about it,'' said Burns in an interview last week.
``When these two women were born in the early years of the 19th
century, women could not attend college. They were barred from the
professions. They could not keep or invest their earnings. They
could not testify at a trial, were actually considered incompetent
to testify. They had fewer rights than an insane lunatic _ male, of
course _ in an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could not own or inherit property. They could not win
their children in a custody battle. Women were the property of
their husbands. Their bodies were literally owned by their
husbands. And, of course, they couldn't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   That grim 19th-century picture was transformed in large part
through the lifelong revolutionary efforts of Stanton and Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their story is so incredible,'' said Burns. ``When they died
in the early years of the 20th century, all of those rights _ which
seem to us to be self-evident _ had been achieved, with the
exception of the right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the thing Stanton and Anthony wanted most, the
thing they had dedicated their lives to. They drove the women's
suffrage movement. But they were about more than just the vote.
They fought for the abolition of slavery. They embodied the women's
movement, and its radical idea that women are the equal of men and
have the same rights. And their relentless activism in the face of
overwhelming opposition heralded the great civil rights movement of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of Stanton and Anthony, the right of women to
vote, finally was achieved with ratification of the 19th Amendment
to the Constitution in 1920. Stanton had died in 1902 and Anthony
in 1906. The 19th Amendment was known as the ``Anthony Amendment.''
It was, word for word, the same amendment Stanton and Anthony had
been submitting to Congress year after year, beginning in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton
and Susan B. Anthony'' will debut on PBS in November. General
Motors is the corporate underwriter and Burns made the documentary
with the award-winning filmmaker Paul Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Said Burns: ``I don't think I could call myself a documentary
filmmaker interested in surveying the terrain of my country's
history, as I have been doing for the past 25 years, without
expressing artistically my outrage at why this story, the largest
social movement in the history of the United States, is given
essentially a picture and a caption in our history books.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is a compelling piece of work. Stanton and
Anthony were powerful, complex, controversial and often difficult
individuals. They reacted brutally in 1869 when friends they had
worked with in the abolition movement supported the 15th Amendment,
which guaranteed the vote for black men but did not give it to
women.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Anthony felt betrayed, and Stanton erupted in a
racist rant. ``Sambo,'' she said, ``wasn't ready for the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused Frederick Douglass, who had considered himself a
friend of Stanton's, to feel betrayed, and he said so. He also
said, ``There is no name greater than (Stanton's) in the matter of
woman's rights and equal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on that part of the story, Burns said, ``It gets
complicated, and we've tried not to blink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for Ourselves Alone'' is about the perennial struggle to
realize the great idea that is the United States of America. It's
also about a great and complicated friendship.
</P>
<P>
   American women, more than eight million of them, voted for the
first time on Nov. 2, 1920. The narrator of the documentary notes
that the two women who fought the longest and hardest for that
right ``had not lived long enough to cast a ballot themselves.''

   The 1935 Nuremberg Laws of Hitler's Germany surely rank among
the most chilling documents of the 20th century: By legally
excluding Jews from German life, they helped set the Holocaust in
motion. But until the opening last week of an exhibit in Los
Angeles, none of the originals signed in Hitler's hand had ever
been put on public display.
</P>
<P>
   Hastily drafted by German leaders in a Nuremberg police station
in September 1935, the three decrees were found by invading
American GIs in the closing days of World War II in a basement
vault in a suburb of Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   They were turned over to Gen. George Patton, the Third Army
commander. He in turn presented them in 1945 as a gift _ along with
a confiscated limited edition of Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' _ to the
Huntington Library in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Though the laws were widely reprinted, the original Nuremberg
texts remained undisturbed and largely forgotten until the
Huntington, whose focus is primarily Anglo-American research,
loaned them this year to the Skirball Cultural Center in Los
Angeles, which focuses on Jewish matters.
</P>
<P>
   The main anti-Jewish race law is on display there through Sept.
5, along with the volume of ``Mein Kampf'' and Patton's explanation
of how he obtained the texts. The center will exhibit all three
Nuremberg Laws after renovations in December.
</P>
<P>
   Below are translations, followed by Patton's statement.

<P>
   LAW FOR THE SAFEGUARD OF GERMAN BLOOD OF GERMAN HONOR
</P>
<P>
   Certain in the knowledge that the purity of the German blood is
the fundamental necessity for the continuation of the German
people, and endowed with an unflinching will to secure the German
nation for all times to come, the Reichstag has unanimously

</P>
<P>
   Paragraph 1.
</P>
<P>

   (2) Complaints declaring them void can originate only with the
District Attorney.

forced labor.
</P>

   The Secretary of the Interior will, together with the Deputy
Fuehrer and the Attorney General, issue the necessary law and

</P>
<P>
   PATTON'S STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   When he turned the Nuremberg Laws over to the Huntington Library
in 1945, Patton included this explanatory statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Third Army entered the city of Nuremberg there was
quite a fight going on and the city was burning. Some troops of the
90th Infantry Division fighting through the town came to a stairway
which they went down with grenades, in case there were any Germans.
There were no Germans. They found a vault, not open, and persuaded
a German to open it for them. In it they found this thing. That was
all that was in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   These soldiers of the 90th Division were very fond of me and I
was very fond of them. They thought they would like to do something
for me, so they sent for me, and we had a great public
presentation. The former commanding general of the 90th Division,
now commander of the Third Corps, General (J.A.) Van Fleet _ he
actually made the presentation to me. So it is my property. They
have given me a lot of other things but this is the important one.
This (document) was taken the day we captured Nuremberg, about the
14th of March. We captured so many towns I have forgotten just
which day. The presentation must have been about the 27th of May.''
</P>
<P>
   And Patton offered this addendum regarding the rare volume of
``Mein Kampf.'' Here he overstates the importance of Hitler's
publisher, Max Amann, within the Third Reich, while implying with
some bluster that he faced the gallows:
</P>
<P>
   ``That book was alleged by a talkative German to be one of a
limited edition of the unexpurgated text. There were alleged to
have been 100 copies. It was published by a man named Emman (sic).
He is the No. 3 bad man in Germany. I have him in jail now. We'll
stretch him pretty quick!''

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Nearly two months into an armed conflict
over the disputed territory of Kashmir, India and Pakistan _ the
world's newest nuclear powers _ are once again playing the tired
roles of time-tested enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In crowded briefing rooms, the military brass of each country
regularly announces updated tallies of the hundreds who have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   People in both countries say something else has been
irretrievably lost, as well: the fragile efforts begun four months
ago to build trust between neighbors that have fought three wars in
the last half-century, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in February that India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee _ a Hindu nationalist whose political party had always
taken a hard line toward the Islamic state of Pakistan _ rode a bus
to Lahore and embraced his counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. The two men
solemnly pledged to peacefully work out their countries'
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But military analysts in India, Pakistan and the United States
say they now believe _ despite Pakistan's denials _ that, even as
the leaders were signing their names to the Lahore Declaration,
Pakistan's military was planning an audacious operation to take the
craggy peaks in Indian-held Kashmir that overlook a crucial Indian
supply line.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of betrayal now runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may again be dialogue, but I've begun to feel that
friendship between the two nations is impossible for at least a
generation, maybe two,'' said Lt. Gen. Satish Nambiar, the former
director-general of India's military operations who is now retired.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven weeks, the Indians have experienced what it
is like to literally fight one uphill battle after another as they
try to root out about 700 men dug into mountains in the Kargil and
Dras sectors of Kashmir _ men who India says are mainly Pakistani
army regulars and who Pakistan says are Muslim freedom fighters
that it does not control.
</P>
<P>
   The task is Sisyphean. ``When you kill these guys, they take the
bodies back and reinforcements come in so their strength remains
the same,'' said an Indian army spokesman, Bikram Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is the main issue that has poisoned relations between
predominantly Hindu India and overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan since
they were carved from the British Empire at independence in 1947.
Pakistan asserts that Kashmir, with a large Muslim majority, should
have the right to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan.
Secular India claims Kashmir as one of its states.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a new military front in Kashmir, coming so soon
after Pakistani overtures of peace, has led experts on the region
to question whether Sharif or the country's powerful military is
calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says it is being unfairly blamed for the crisis.
According to officials here, Muslim militants have infiltrated
Indian-held territory from the Pakistani side of the 460-mile
cease-fire line without the knowledge or help of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The military has nothing to gain from the Kargil campaign, said
Brig. Rashid Qureshi, chief spokesman for the Pakistani military,
because its forces can already shell the vital Indian highway that
runs between Srinagar and Leh with its long-range guns.
</P>
<P>
   But as Michael Krepon, president of the Washington-based Henry
L. Stimson Center, which studies security issues, said, ``Nobody
believes the Pakistani cover story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard evidence of Pakistan's role is elusive. U.S. officials say
they have intelligence that shows the Pakistanis are behind the
infiltration, but they have not made it public. The Indians say
they have documents from Pakistani soldiers in the battle zone, but
the Pakistanis say the evidence is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the prevailing view is that the militants, who
normally carry out hit-and-run raids, would not have had the
sophisticated training, equipment and support to independently
mount such a large-scale effort to occupy territory.
</P>
<P>
   But why would Pakistan do such a thing after its talk of peace?
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest explanation, experts say, is that the push for the
Kargil operation came from the military, which has ruled the nation
for much of its history, and that Sharif went along,
enthusiastically or not, believing Pakistan could plausibly deny
authorship.
</P>
<P>
   The military's motives are many, the experts say. Some of its
leaders were disgruntled with the peace process that Sharif
initiated and may have seen this as a way to derail it.
</P>
<P>
   Others may have been disturbed by the prime minister's efforts
to establish civilian authority over the military and sought to
reassert control. After a public dispute, Sharif replaced the chief
of army staff, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, with his own man last
October. The prime minister has also drafted the military into
civilian assignments like collecting electricity bills and running
courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, leaders committed to the cause of Kashmir _
concerned that India had in recent years successfully put down a
Kashmiri insurgency _ may have wanted to stir things up, with the
aim of putting Kashmir back on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And the change in military commanders may also have been
pivotal. Karamat, seen as having a thoughtful, almost bookish
style, was replaced by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was born in India
and whose family was among the millions of Muslims who fled the
country after partition in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is a nation of strong regional prejudices, and the
army's hierarchy has customarily come from the state of Punjab.
Musharraf ``had to prove he's as Punjabi as the rest of them,'' a
senior Indian military officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pakistan may have been tempted by the chance to seize
some formidable high ground, as India had done 15 years ago in the
area of the Siachen Glacier. After the Indian army landed soldiers
on the peaks and passes around the glacier, the Pakistani army
quickly learned that the positions were nearly impregnable. The
Indians still dominate Siachen, though remaining there is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kargil will become another Siachen on a bigger scale,'' said
Brahma Chellaney, an analyst at the Center for Policy Research in
New Delhi. ``If Siachen is bleeding India, Kargil will bleed India
profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if India expels every invader or negotiates their
withdrawal, it will still have to choose between a huge, permanent
military deployment or the possibility of one incursion after
another.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials cannot resist gloating at what is portrayed
here as India's military humiliation at the hands of militants.
Qureshi paints a picture of Indian troops struggling up the peaks,
only to be picked off by wily, holy warriors entrenched in
high-altitude bunkers or by Pakistani artillery being fired from
Pakistan's side of the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians come in huge groups of 200 to 300 men,'' he said.
``They make wonderful targets for our artillery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistan's tactical military advantage has isolated it
internationally. The group of the world's major industrialized
nations has voiced concern about the violation of the line of
control, and China, Pakistan's staunchest regional ally, has
maintained a studied neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has openly held Pakistan responsible for
starting the conflict and called on Sharif to withdraw the forces
that U.S. officials say Pakistan is supporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Sharif needs to seize the moment,'' Karl
Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs,
said in an interview last week. ``The Lahore process barely has a
pulse rate. Steps must be taken quickly to revive it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult for Pakistan to withdraw fighters that
it has steadfastly maintained it does not control. And Sharif may
well find resistance from military officials who would view a
pullback as caving in to U.S. pressure and sacrificing a military
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Gen. Javed Nasir, a former director of Pakistan's
Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, wrote in a newspaper column on
Sunday that Musharraf is ``a gift from Allah'' and warned that the
prime minister would be committing ``political hara-kiri'' if he
agreed to have the Kargil area vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India say they will seek a peaceful solution, but
are ready for all-out war. Vajpayee, who faces a national election
in September and whose government has been criticized for India's
failure to foresee the enemy's strategy, needs a victory before the
snows of September and October make further military maneuvers more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   According to several analysts, India and Pakistan's nuclear
parity _ achieved with back-to-back underground tests a year ago _
has apparently emboldened Pakistan to push forward with lesser
hostilities on the assumption that India will not risk the wider
war that would likely follow with a cross of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say they believe the risk of a nuclear exchange is
very low. India has pledged not to use nuclear weapons first.
Neither nation has developed a sophisticated system for launching
such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if Pakistan would make a similar promise of
no-first-use, Mushahid Hussain, Pakistan's minister of information,
shrugged off the notion. ``Well, what do they say, `Que sera,
sera,''' he said. ``What will be, will be. We hope it will not come
to the nuclear thing.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ To outsiders, the solution to Turkey's long
conflict with Kurdish insurgents may seem easy and obvious. Over
the last few weeks, the rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan has made it as
clear as the air that envelops the rugged mountains in the war
zone. Let us Kurds use our language freely, let us have a
television station, and acknowledge our ethnic identity, he said at
his recently concluded treason trial. Then we will stop waging a
war that has cost Turkey more than $100 billion and the lives of
more than 30,000 people over 15 years, in the process tearing the
country apart and blackening its name abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally it is difficult for Turks or their leaders to imagine
negotiating with Ocalan or others who have touched off such
destruction. But the world has become accustomed to watching
governments grudgingly deal with Palestinian, Irish and Basque
groups that engaged in horrific terrorism. In Britain, the
murderers of several police officers and a bomber who nearly
succeeded in assassinating Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were
recently freed from prison as a painful gesture of good will aimed
at resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. Spain has granted
its Basque region almost complete autonomy, and as a result the
assassinations that wracked the region for years have all but
ceased. Why not a similar formula in Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Ocalan, and his subsequent trial and death
sentence pronounced last week, present Turkey with its best chance
in years to test a new approach to Kurdish nationalism. Military
commanders, who hold the final word in such matters, will probably
have many months to reflect on the matter while Ocalan's appeals
proceed through Turkish and European courts. But choosing the path
of conciliation would represent a radical departure for leaders
who, with broad popular support, have for years considered force
the only appropriate response to what they call terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Turkey's implacable resistance to Kurdish
demands lies in history. For 200 years before the the Turkish
Republic was founded in 1923, the Ottoman Empire had been steadily
shrinking. The Republic was formed after a military force led by
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated Greeks and their Western allies who
were trying to slice up even the Anatolian mainland. Fear of losing
more territory consumes many Turks, and when they hear Kurds
demanding autonomy or cultural rights, they sense the start of
secession.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has come a long way from the days when it did not even
acknowledge the existence of Kurds, calling them ``mountain Turks''
and, in 1981, sentencing a former member of parliament to a year in
prison for declaring: ``There are Kurds in Turkey. I am a Kurd.''
But many people here cannot bring themselves to view Kurds, who
constitute at least 15 percent of the population, as a minority.
They still use the definition of a minority as it was used in the
Ottoman Empire. In those days, minorities were given broad powers
of self-government, but only non-Muslim groups qualified. Since
most Kurds are Muslims, the idea that they could be considered a
minority seems absurd to many Turks. These Turks also fear that
conceding special status to the Kurds could lead to claims by other
groups in Turkey, which is far more ethnically diverse than some
admit.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years since the Kurdish war began, emotion has taken
over much of Turkey's reaction to it. Thousands of grief-stricken
parents have buried their sons at funerals that afflict entire
towns. The press is forbidden to question the conduct of the war or
the value of fighting it, and instead whips up popular passion. No
coverage may be given to the grief felt by mothers of slain Kurdish
fighters, nor can writers portray the conflict as Kurdish militants
see it. Ordinary Turks have no idea what is actually happening in
southeastern provinces where the war is being fought. Knowing how
Turkish police and soldiers operate, they realize that things are
not pretty there. Most believe, however, that there is no other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being tough and not giving in is a very important value in
this part of the world,'' said a foreign military officer who
closely follows the Kurdish conflict. ``If you negotiate or
compromise, it's seen as a sign of weakness. That's one of the main
reasons why this thing is such a tough nut to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish ruling elite considers rebellion by Kurds profoundly
illegitimate because in Turkey, Kurds are granted every individual
right. Once a Kurd accepts that he or she is above all Turkish,
anything is possible. Many Kurds, especially those living in
Istanbul and other cities far from the war zone, have accepted this
offer and been successfully assimilated. Some have risen to the
highest ranks of politics, business and entertainment. But others
refuse society's offer. They acknowledge that Turkey gives them
individual rights, but they also want something more: group rights.
They want the right to their Kurdishness, meaning the right to
speak their language without restriction and to maintain a distinct
cultural identity. That is something the state steadfastly refuses
to concede.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it is inconceivable that Turkey will grant
Kurdish provinces any form of autonomy or self-rule. But this is a
highly centralized country, and the southeast is not the only
region clamoring for more power. Some who have studied the Kurdish
problem suggest that one way of resolving it would be to grant
every part of the country more local authority, broadening
democracy for all citizens. Combined with a serious economic
development package for the Kurdish region, much of which is mired
in poverty, such a ``devolution'' package might work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   With Turkey's collective mind so frozen in traditional
approaches to Kurdish nationalism, what can the outside world do to
encourage new departures? Remarkably little, it seems. It is part
of Turks' psychology to believe that the world is constantly
plotting against their nation. Advice from abroad is often
considered naive or ill-intentioned. But that does not rule out
some delicate encouragement from the United States, which is
Turkey's closest ally and supplies much of its weaponry, and from
Europe, whose club Turkey would love to join.
</P>
<P>
   Because military commanders maintain the right of veto over
Kurdish policy, and because most Turks trust their judgment, they
alone can decide on a change of course. That is not such a
discouraging reality, since many senior commanders are
well-educated, worldly and sophisticated. But it seems extremely
unlikely that they could lead the country toward a new Kurdish
policy unless one of two things happens. The military leaders could
decide among themselves that the time is ripe, or they could find
themselves forced to do so by a civilian leader with broad popular
support. The last civilian with such power was President Turgut
Ozal, who died in 1993, and in the splintered political climate of
today's Turkey, no other such figure is on the horizon.

right. Once a Kurd accepts that he or she is above all Turkish,
anything is possible. Many Kurds, especially those living in
Istanbul and other cities far from the war zone, have accepted this
offer and been successfully assimilated. Some have risen to the
highest ranks of politics, business and entertainment. But others
refuse society's offer. They acknowledge that Turkey gives them
individual rights, but they also want something more: group rights.
They want the right to their Kurdishness, meaning the right to
speak their language without restriction and to maintain a distinct
cultural identity. That is something the state steadfastly refuses
to concede.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it is inconceivable that Turkey will grant
Kurdish provinces any form of autonomy or self-rule. But this is a
highly centralized country, and the southeast is not the only
region clamoring for more power. Some who have studied the Kurdish
problem suggest that one way of resolving it would be to grant
every part of the country more local authority, broadening
democracy for all citizens. Combined with a serious economic
development package for the Kurdish region, much of which is mired
in poverty, such a ``devolution'' package might work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   With Turkey's collective mind so frozen in traditional
approaches to Kurdish nationalism, what can the outside world do to
encourage new departures? Remarkably little, it seems. It is part
of Turks' psychology to believe that the world is constantly
plotting against their nation. Advice from abroad is often
considered naive or ill-intentioned. But that does not rule out
some delicate encouragement from the United States, which is
Turkey's closest ally and supplies much of its weaponry, and from
Europe, whose club Turkey would love to join.
</P>
<P>
   Because military commanders maintain the right of veto over
Kurdish policy, and because most Turks trust their judgment, they
alone can decide on a change of course. That is not such a
discouraging reality, since many senior commanders are
well-educated, worldly and sophisticated. But it seems extremely
unlikely that they could lead the country toward a new Kurdish
policy unless one of two things happens. The military leaders could
decide among themselves that the time is ripe, or they could find
themselves forced to do so by a civilian leader with broad popular
support. The last civilian with such power was President Turgut
Ozal, who died in 1993, and in the splintered political climate of
today's Turkey, no other such figure is on the horizon.

THE COST OF MISSING WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WELFARE-FAMILIES) 
(mk) 
 By JASON DePARLE

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Mary Rhoden liked the Academy of Excellence, and she
became one of the most outgoing members of the class. ``They show
you how to keep yourself going,'' she said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping herself going has been hard. She has missed many
days of the work assignment as a clerical aide that followed.
``Sometimes I get to an `I don't care' point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the welfare rolls in Wisconsin down 90 percent, many of
those left behind are accustomed to difficult lives. As a child,
Ms. Rhoden helped her parents pick crops in West Coast fields. She
ran away, married young and had five children. Her ex-husband is in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden, 35, said welfare used to come easier. ``I'm not
going to lie _ I used to play the system to be with my kids,'' she
said. Now her work absences typically cost her half of her maximum
monthly benefit of $673.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ann Watkins, another Academy graduate, fared worse, losing
all her aid. But Tanya Moore has delighted in the part-time
position she found at an AIDS education program, and Cheryl Roeming
quickly left welfare for a full-time clerical job.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden is proud of her children's achievements. Her son,
Alphonso, 14, has a job making hotel beds. Her daughter, Vicie, 13,
was valedictorian of her eighth-grade class. On a resplendent day,
Vicie stood before the school and thanked her family ``for always
being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden beamed. ``To see her accomplish so much, with all the
chaos that goes on around here _ it's a great feeling,'' she said.

<P>
   A few months ago, Seattle Mariners executive Dave Aust was
wracking his brains for a fitting send-off for the Kingdome, the
Mariners' ballpark since 1977, which closed Sunday, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   He had an explosive notion: Sell thousands of detonating
plungers to Mariners fans for a couple of bucks apiece, and let
them take part in blowing the place up when it is scheduled to be
leveled with dynamite next March. ``A lot of people would pay money
to do that,'' Aust said. ``Everyone wants to see it blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some ballparks today don't evoke the same wistful
nostalgia that others did a generation ago. Mention the demolition
of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many Brooklynites, still drying their
eyes over Valentino, begin to tear up again. But with five new
major league stadiums set to sprout in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The Kingdome, an indoor park once known as the Tomb
for all its gray, empty concrete, has been a blight on the baseball
landscape for a generation. And the four stadiums still limping
through their final season _ Tiger Stadium in Detroit, the Houston
Astrodome, County Stadium in Milwaukee and 3Com (formerly
Candlestick) Park in San Francisco _ won't inspire many weepy
eulogies either.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the inside of the Kingdome roof camouflaged
pop flies so well that they often fell among several helpless
fielders. One sure-fire Dave Kingman home run was caught for an out
after it hit a support wire above the field. And in 1994, four
15-pound tiles plummeted from the ceiling a half-hour before game
time, one of them landing 50 feet from the Baltimore Orioles iron
man Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no current ballpark has earned more abuse than San
Francisco's, which by virtue of sitting on the tip of Candlestick
Point in the Bay rivals the climate of arctic tundra. Salty wind
gusts regularly separate players from their caps; during the 1961
All-Star Game, Stu Miller of the hometown Giants was blown clear
off the pitcher's mound. Since 1983, the club has awarded a ``Croix
de Candlestick'' pin to all fans who weather a frigid, extra-inning
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great going there in July and freezing your butt off,''
said New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, who played in Candlestick
throughout his 1960-77 playing career. ``Willie Mays would hit a
lot of balls to left field and, man, they wouldn't go anywhere,''
he recalled. ``I was catching one day, and Felipe Alou hit a ball
that went out of the park _ and came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium, tied with Boston's Fenway Park as the oldest park
in the majors, opened on April 20, 1912 _ five days after the
Titanic sank. More fans would have seen Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg, Al
Kaline and other Tigers legends play there if the view of thousands
hadn't been obstructed by jutting roofs and steel pillars. Players
complain that the dugouts are so deep that when they sit down, they
can't see the outfielders. Then there was the sign long posted
outside a locker room: ``Visitors Clubhouse _ No Visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astrodome has had more than human visitors in its 35
seasons. Once known as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the stadium
that gave America artificial grass now finds cats and rats
scurrying across it. The rodents are so big that Giants manager
Dusty Baker said, ``I've heard stories of cats running from rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come when the team's out of town,'' said one Astros
employee, ``the cats are hanging around first base and the
pitcher's mound. During a stadium tour, the cats were looking at us
like, `What are you doing, invading our home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to improve the fans' experience at County Stadium in
Milwaukee have fallen a little flat. The mascot Bernie the Brewer,
decked in lederhosen, slides down into a huge beer stein when a
Milwaukee player hits a home run, but the team's offense can be so
weak he gets as scarce as the Maytag repair man.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gaggles of gulls from Lake Michigan that
feast on tailgaters' garbage in the parking lot. Roars from a
nearby Harley-Davidson convention in 1993 scared the birds into the
ballpark, where they congregated on the outfield grass during
games. A pooch named Gus the Wonderdog was brought in to chase them
away, but Gus was unconditionally released after leaving some
souvenirs of his own.
</P>
<P>
   These five parks will be replaced by fan-friendly
techno-stadiums that should make fans forget all about their
predecessors. Retractable domes on the new Safeco Field in Seattle,
the Ballpark at Union Station in Houston and Miller Park in
Milwaukee will tip their caps when the weather's nice. At Pacific
Bell Park in San Francisco, fans can marvel at long home runs to
right field plunking into the China Basin Channel. Comerica Park in
Detroit will feature the world's largest scoreboard, not to mention
a barbecue-and-beer garden.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry, fans. Like every other new baseball stadium
these days, the new parks will be packed with so many interactive
doodads for the kids that they couldn't possibly be distracted by
some ballgame.

RUSSIA OUSTS U.S. OFFICER AMID TENSION OVER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a fresh sign of the tensions that have grown between
the United States and Russia since the war in Kosovo, Moscow has
ordered an American military attache to leave the country, U.S.
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The American officer, Lt. Col. Peter Hoffman, the assistant Army
attache at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was declared persona non
grata and left Russia Thursday evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy declined to say why the officer been expelled.
But some American officials suggested that he might have been
caught up in tit-for-tat accusations of spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said he was going about things he was not supposed to,''
a senior Clinton administration official said. ``We don't comment
on intelligence matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was the latest in a series of strains between the U.S.
and Russian militaries that have emerged since NATO's war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's 78-day bombing campaign ended, the Clinton
administration has sought to rebuild ties with Moscow by involving
the Russian military in the effort to enforce the peace.
</P>
<P>
   But that has resulted in new tensions. Hoping to bridge the
differences, U.S. and Russian officials worked out an agreement
last month in Helsinki, Finland, on peacekeeping operations in
Kosovo. But the accord was somewhat vague and the two sides have
interpreted it differently.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for example, acknowledges that Russian
peacekeeping troops will not formally report to NATO commanders.
But Washington says Russia's forces should be prepared to follow
instructions from NATO commanders in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, though, has underscored that its troops will be under a
separate Russian command, and it has never been clear how closely
the Russian military is prepared to cooperate with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO and Russia still differ over where the Russian troops
should be stationed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the wrangling has continued, the United States last week
blocked Moscow from sending additional peacekeepers to Kosovo by
asking Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria not to let the Russians to use
their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the surprise dispatch of 200 Russian troops to
Pristina airport last month, Washington does not want Moscow to fly
in reinforcements until disputes over peacekeeping arrangements are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the only source of tension. Recently the
Russians held a Cold-War-style military exercise in which two old
Bear bombers approached Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was not worrisome in a military sense and appeared
to be an effort by the Russian Defense Ministry to demonstrate that
it was still a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the expulsion of Hoffman, which was reported by The
Washington Times last week.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in Washington, Hoffman was a specialist
in military intelligence, which is not unusual for an Embassy post
that has long been used to monitor Russian military development.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the U.S. delegation that negotiated the Helsinki
accord on peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. One Clinton
administration official speculated that the expulsion might have
been a response to a recent decision by the United States to expel
an official at Russia's Mission to the United States on accusations
of spying.

   New York Pauses for a Tall Tale
</P>
<P>
   On the last leg of what still seems a remarkable journey, Edwin
Daniel Sabillon charmed the city. The 13-year-old Honduran boy told
a heart-rending, though made-up, tale to strangers he met in Miami,
who bought him a bus ticket to New York City. He arrived Sunday,
June 27, and after a few hours of sightseeing, he was picked up by
a taxi driver who was captivated by his smile and touched by his
story. The driver alerted the police, the police alerted the news
media, which naturally alerted the mayor, and Edwin was a
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone believed, perhaps because they wanted to, his tale of
losing his mother to a mudslide and of making his way alone across
3,200 miles and three countries in search of his father in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the essentials of Edwin's narrative are not
true. His mother is alive, although she gave him over to his
paternal grandmother when he was an infant. His father is dead, but
he was far away in the United States for most of Edwin's life. His
relatives say he ran away some months ago from his grandmother's
house in Honduras and showed up one day in Hialeah, Fla., where an
aunt lives. How he got there is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   His future now is uncertain, although perhaps no more uncertain
than it was before he embarked on his grand adventure. Some in New
York seemed as quick to cast him as a villain as they had been to
embrace him as a hero, leaving no room for him to be just a
troubled young boy. Others said they still wanted to adopt him. He
is, for the moment, a ward of the city, thanks to no less a patron
than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was tickled by Edwin's spunkiness.
Edwin, after all, did what many have done before him: He came to
America to reinvent himself.

   Vodka and Water, a Deadly Mix
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is Russian for ``little water,'' a playful diminutive
ludicrously out of place given what it does to those who drink it
before taking a swim. In Moscow alone, 144 swimmers drowned between
May 1 and June 21, and on a particularly brutal weekend in
mid-June, as many as 16 died each day _ three more than the daily
average for the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow coroner's office, which examined June's 89 deaths at
a reporter's request, concluded that 94 percent of the swimmers
were drunk when they drowned. All but 10 were men, usually between
the ages of 20 and 40. Indeed, two in every 10,000 men in that age
group drowned in 1997, a pace that beats even the infamous homicide
rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking as it is, the drowning rate only hints at a broader
connection between alcohol and accidents, especially among men.
From falls to fires to poisonings, Russia has one of the highest
accidental death rates on Earth, and vodka is usually a factor.
More shocking, at least to health experts, is the nation's blase
attitude toward the carnage, which is almost unnoticed among
ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of Russia's larger problem of weak public health
measures, said Martin McKee, an expert on Russian mortality trends
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Alcohol-related accidents are almost entirely preventable, but
preventive medicine is in its infancy in Russia _ and civic
movements like anti-drunk-driving campaigns are unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be worse _ and was. Vodka consumption has been
slowly falling since drinking peaked in 1994. That year, the
drowning rate among men was 30 percent higher than was reflected in
the 1997 statistics.

   New York Pauses for a Tall Tale
</P>
<P>
   On the last leg of what still seems a remarkable journey, Edwin
Daniel Sabillon charmed the city. The 13-year-old Honduran boy told
a heart-rending, though made-up, tale to strangers he met in Miami,
who bought him a bus ticket to New York City. He arrived Sunday,
June 27, and after a few hours of sightseeing, he was picked up by
a taxi driver who was captivated by his smile and touched by his
story. The driver alerted the police, the police alerted the news
media, which naturally alerted the mayor, and Edwin was a
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone believed, perhaps because they wanted to, his tale of
losing his mother to a mudslide and of making his way alone across
3,200 miles and three countries in search of his father in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the essentials of Edwin's narrative are not
true. His mother is alive, although she gave him over to his
paternal grandmother when he was an infant. His father is dead, but
he was far away in the United States for most of Edwin's life. His
relatives say he ran away some months ago from his grandmother's
house in Honduras and showed up one day in Hialeah, Fla., where an
aunt lives. How he got there is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   His future now is uncertain, although perhaps no more uncertain
than it was before he embarked on his grand adventure. Some in New
York seemed as quick to cast him as a villain as they had been to
embrace him as a hero, leaving no room for him to be just a
troubled young boy. Others said they still wanted to adopt him. He
is, for the moment, a ward of the city, thanks to no less a patron
than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was tickled by Edwin's spunkiness.
Edwin, after all, did what many have done before him: He came to
America to reinvent himself.

   Vodka and Water, a Deadly Mix
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is Russian for ``little water,'' a playful diminutive
ludicrously out of place given what it does to those who drink it
before taking a swim. In Moscow alone, 144 swimmers drowned between
May 1 and June 21, and on a particularly brutal weekend in
mid-June, as many as 16 died each day _ three more than the daily
average for the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow coroner's office, which examined June's 89 deaths at
a reporter's request, concluded that 94 percent of the swimmers
were drunk when they drowned. All but 10 were men, usually between
the ages of 20 and 40. Indeed, two in every 10,000 men in that age
group drowned in 1997, a pace that beats even the infamous homicide
rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking as it is, the drowning rate only hints at a broader
connection between alcohol and accidents, especially among men.
From falls to fires to poisonings, Russia has one of the highest
accidental death rates on Earth, and vodka is usually a factor.
More shocking, at least to health experts, is the nation's blase
attitude toward the carnage, which is almost unnoticed among
ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of Russia's larger problem of weak public health
measures, said Martin McKee, an expert on Russian mortality trends
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Alcohol-related accidents are almost entirely preventable, but
preventive medicine is in its infancy in Russia _ and civic
movements like anti-drunk-driving campaigns are unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be worse _ and was. Vodka consumption has been
slowly falling since drinking peaked in 1994. That year, the
drowning rate among men was 30 percent higher than was reflected in
the 1997 statistics.

   Fed Raises Interest Rates Just a Tad, Just in Case
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence of inflation. But there is enough fear
of it that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates a notch, to
make sure the economy does not get derailed by a spiral of rising
wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate, to 5
percent, was enough to bring protests from business, labor and
other critics of tight monetary policy. But the Fed sugarcoated its
decision by suggesting it might not have to raise rates again this
summer.

   Clinton Eases Restrictions On Computer Exports
</P>
<P>
   A month ago it seemed as if reports of Chinese spies and
technology leaks would result in a crackdown on high-technology
exports to China. Wrong. Under pressure from Silicon Valley,
President Clinton announced that he would make it far easier to
ship high-performance personal computers and microprocessors to
China, Russia and other nations. In an era when supercomputer
speeds can be reached on a $2,000 laptop, the president concluded,
it makes sense to control only the most rarified technology. The
Republicans, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, seemed to agree.
The Silicon Valley, by the way, is a wellspring of campaign money.

   Fewer Gay Men in New York Are Contracting AIDS
</P>
<P>
   The largest survey of the sexual health of gay men in New York
City has found a significant reduction in their levels of risky
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Greater use of condoms and safer sex helped explain a sharp drop
in the number of gay men now infected with the AIDS virus (about
one in seven from about one in three in 1985), said officials of
the New York City Health Department who conducted the survey last
year in a partnership with the Gay Men's Health Crisis.

   A Long-Ago Slight And a Murdered Child
</P>
<P>
   It's a staggeringly upside-down tale. By all accounts, Ronald
Shanabarger of Franklin, Ind., married in anger, conceived a child
in anger and looked on in anger as his son was born. As
quick-flaring angers go, his was ancient: Before he married, his
wife-to-be had refused to cut short her vacation cruise when his
father died, and he silently vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The anger burned on, and when his son was 7 months old, he
suffocated him in his crib. Then, haunted by the image of the
child's face, he confessed.

   Clinton Backs 2000 Bill
</P>
<P>
   All spring, President Clinton urged Democrats in Congress to
oppose a Republican bill to limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000
computer failures. Detrimental to consumers, he said, and a
precedent for restraints on litigation. Most Democrats obliged,
despite pressure from the computer industry and other businesses
constituents. After Republicans made some small concessions, the
president changed his mind. The Senate and House quickly approved
the agreement, and Clinton promised to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were furious, feeling the president had cut a
deal behind their backs.
</P>

   ``Maybe,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ``we can dare hope
that this will be the last case of triangulation of the 20th

   An Official Welcome Back For the Resurgent Bald Eagle
</P>
<P>
   The bald eagle, the symbol of American freedom, was officially
removed from the list of animals threatened with extinction. At a
White House ceremony, President Clinton credited efforts under the
Endangered Species Act for the bird's return.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500,000 bald eagles soared in American skies 200 years ago,
but by 1963, only 417 breeding pairs remained in the continental
United States. Hunting and pesticides that weakened eggshells were
among the causes of their decline. The eagles were put on the
endangered species list in 1967, and upgraded to threatened four
years ago, following years of efforts to improve their habitats and
reintroduce eaglets to the wild.

   Mitral Valve Problems Are Not So Serious After All
</P>
<P>
   As many as 28 million Americans who were told they are in danger
of stroke, heart failure and other problems because of mitral-valve
prolapse probably do not have to worry. A new study showed that
about 2.4 percent of the population _ not the 5 percent to 15
percent previously estimated _ have the condition, an abnormally
long, floppy valve that can cause blood leakage in the heart. And
in those who do have it, it was found no more likely to cause the
feared complications than those who do not.

   Independent Counsel Law Dies, and Mourners Are Few
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare and no mourning, the independent counsel law
died after 21 years during which prosecutors appointed under the
statute rummaged through the public and private lives of Republican
and Democratic presidents, and scores of lesser officials.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the statute, first enacted as an important
post-Watergate reform, was widely perceived as an abusive legal
bludgeon that had failed in its purpose of separating politics from
law in investigations of administration officials. Kenneth Starr's
wide-ranging investigation of the Clintons helped create that
perception.

   Responsibility for investigations of high-ranking government
officials now reverts to the Justice Department, where Attorney
General Janet Reno assumes much broader authority over when and

   Webster Hubbell walked out of a federal courthouse last week
with a remarkably good deal; he pleaded guilty to a felony count of
lying to regulators and a misdemeanor count of failure to pay
taxes, and avoided jail time even though he has already served time
for a felony.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who struck the deal,
seemed even more pleased. It brought him closer to the end of his
difficult five-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Also a winner: Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose conduct would have
been explored at a Hubbell trial at the same time she is expected
to begin a Senate campaign in New York.

   MEDICARE-CLINTON-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's new
Medicare proposal seemed to be something more than another
ritualistic exercise in policy-making by a waning administration.
It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with a
nation's conflicted, contradictory needs and desires on the shape
of its health care system _ and an acknowledgment of recent
history's painful lessons. In fact, many of the tensions and

Toner. (`a' category)

   BRAZIL-SOCCER-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ Soccer may be the king
of sports here, but only the men's version of the game seems to
wear the crown. Not one of this year's matches of the Brazilian
national women's team has been televised live, sponsors have shied
away from any association with them, and hard-core fans who can
recite the entire roster of the 1950 men's World Cup squad are hard

   DEBT-REVIEW (Washington) _ In announcing that the federal budget

with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future. The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so
fiscally virtuous. Minutes before Clinton's announcement, the
Commerce Dept. released data showing that consumers are headed in
the other direction by spending more money than they earn. By
Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Democrats are
increasingly portraying health care, gun control and drug abuse as
women's issues on the grounds that mothers worry about their
children. This represents a peculiar paradox: The party that fought
hard to make sure women were not defined simply as the bearers and
rearers of children is now casting women in those terms, or at
least appealing to their maternal instincts along those lines. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DOCTORS-REVIEW (Washington) _ At a time when managed
care has put greater distance between doctors and their patients,
the Internet is filling the gaps. Millions of Americans are going
online for medical information, mostly about specific diseases and
drugs, fueling a free-for-all on the Web, where thousands of sites
are offering some type of health information. Investment money is
pouring in. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   BALLPARKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the ongoing demise of old
baseball stadiums and the advent of new ones. Ballparks don't evoke
the same wistful nostalgia as they did a generation or two ago.
Mention the demolition of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many
Brooklynites still weep. But with five new major league stadiums
set to sprout up around the U.S. in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-FUNDRAISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even though he has done it
faster than anyone else, George W. Bush is not the first Texan to
raise several gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the
seventh. But money doesn't always buy the White House _ of the
seven Texans, only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and George Bush in 1988

with the Honduras teen's hoax and Russia's alcohol-related
drownings.

   _ Also moved in the `i' category:

<P>
   KOSOVO-EVIDENCE-REVIEW (Djakovica, Yugoslavia) _ Kosovo is a
huge crime scene, and the evidence seems obvious. But meeting the
exacting standards of a court of law _ even an international
tribunal _ is a different matter. There are still specific criminal
acts to be proved and a chain of evidence to be established before
Yugoslav leaders can be held to account. And there are cold scenes
_ bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by departing Serbs. The sites themselves have been open to
the elements, sometimes for more than two months. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DECOYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A major surprise of the NATO
air campaign against Yugoslavia Serbia was the extent to which the
Yugoslav military was able to successfully use ground decoys such
as fake tanks to cause NATO to strike targets that weren't real. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-KURDS-REVIEW _ A solution for Turkey's tensions with the
Kurds may seem obvious: reach an accommodation, as done in Northern
Ireland, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and elsewhere. But for
centuries, Turkey's territory has been steadily shrinking. Fear of
losing more worries many Turks, and when they hear Kurds demand
autonomy or cultural rights, they sense the start of secession. By
Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   NAZI-LAWS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nuremburg Laws of Hitler's
Germany rank among the most chilling documents of the 20th Century:
They helped set the Holocaust in motion by legally excluding Jews
from German life. But until the opening last week of an exhibit at
the Jewish-oriented Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, they
had never been put on public display. Some excerpts.

women's issues on the grounds that mothers worry about their
children. This represents a peculiar paradox: The party that fought
hard to make sure women were not defined simply as the bearers and
rearers of children is now casting women in those terms, or at
least appealing to their maternal instincts along those lines. By
Frank Bruni.

<P>
   INTERNET-DOCTORS-REVIEW (Washington) _ At a time when managed
care has put greater distance between doctors and their patients,
the Internet is filling the gaps. Millions of Americans are going
online for medical information, mostly about specific diseases and
drugs, fueling a free-for-all on the Web, where thousands of sites
are offering some type of health information. Investment money is
pouring in. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

<P>
   BALLPARKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the ongoing demise of old
baseball stadiums and the advent of new ones. Ballparks don't evoke
the same wistful nostalgia as they did a generation or two ago.
Mention the demolition of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many
Brooklynites still weep. But with five new major league stadiums
set to sprout up around the U.S. in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers. By Alan Schwarz.

   TEXAS-FUNDRAISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even though he has done it
faster than anyone else, George W. Bush is not the first Texan to
raise several gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the
seventh. But money doesn't always buy the White House _ of the
seven Texans, only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and George Bush in 1988
actually won presidential elections. By Adam Clymer.

   KOSOVO-EVIDENCE-REVIEW (Djakovica, Yugoslavia) _ Kosovo is a
huge crime scene, and the evidence seems obvious. But meeting the
exacting standards of a court of law _ even an international
tribunal _ is a different matter. There are still specific criminal
acts to be proved and a chain of evidence to be established before
Yugoslav leaders can be held to account. And there are cold scenes
_ bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by departing Serbs. The sites themselves have been open to
the elements, sometimes for more than two months. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DECOYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A major surprise of the NATO
air campaign against Yugoslavia Serbia was the extent to which the
Yugoslav military was able to successfully use ground decoys such
as fake tanks to cause NATO to strike targets that weren't real. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-KURDS-REVIEW _ A solution for Turkey's tensions with the
Kurds may seem obvious: reach an accommodation, as done in Northern
Ireland, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and elsewhere. But for
centuries, Turkey's territory has been steadily shrinking. Fear of
losing more worries many Turks, and when they hear Kurds demand
autonomy or cultural rights, they sense the start of secession. By
Stephen Kinzer.

<P>
   NAZI-LAWS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nuremburg Laws of Hitler's
Germany rank among the most chilling documents of the 20th Century:
They helped set the Holocaust in motion by legally excluding Jews
from German life. But until the opening last week of an exhibit at
the Jewish-oriented Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, they
had never been put on public display. Some excerpts.

OFFICER PUTS LITERATURE LESSON TO WORK ON CITY STREETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By night, Los Angeles police Officer Sunil Dutta
reads crooks their rights on some of the meanest streets in
America.
</P>
<P>
   By day, the 35-year-old with a doctorate in biology reads the
verse of renowned Indian poet Ghalib and painstakingly translates
it into English.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta believes poetry and policing are a natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting mix of complex emotions and feelings to be
a police officer and a writer and a poet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm acting as a psychologist, counselor, teacher and a vent
for people who are extremely mad,'' Dutta said. ``You see children
who are victims and children who are vicious criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get many different experiences out on the
streets,'' he said. ``It's so totally flabbergasting.''
</P>
<P>
   His father-in-law, Robert Bly, winner of the National Book Award
for poetry and recognized as America's most influential living
poet, said he was perplexed by Dutta's decision to become a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed myself,'' Bly said. ``But I understand he's an
excellent officer. It would be hard to imagine a well-known
American writer joining a police force. I thought it was a very big
stretch for him to do this, yet I thought it was a brave thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Now after four years of work, the West Valley Division patrol
officer is anticipating the July 1 release of ``The Lightning
Should Have Fallen on Ghalib,'' published by Ecco Press/Harper
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta's fellow officers in the West Valley and Van Nuys
divisions where he's worked have ribbed him about his moonlighting
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the sergeants at Van Nuys used to kid me all the time:
What are you doing when you're a biochemist? You don't belong,'' he
said. ``Some of them made fun of me: What is an artist doing
here?''
</P>
<P>
   West Valley Division Officer Migdalia Rodriguez said in the
Police Academy, Dutta was often teased for standing up for female
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very respectful of British women rulers,'' she said. ``He
would always stand up for women being in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   West Valley Division Sgt. Cory Palka said Dutta has a unique way
of expressing ``life's values outside of police work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful expression because behind every badge is a
person of many great attributes and character,'' Palka said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta grew up and got his bachelor's degree in botany in India,
his master's in plant biology in Florida and his doctorate at the
University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   After hiking in Norway, studying music under Indian masters and
teaching in inner-city and rural schools in the United States, he
came to Los Angeles 18 months ago and joined the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dutta patrols the streets of Van Nuys and the West Valley
area, taking on gang members and street thugs.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls one night when he and his partner were called to a
gang fight, only to find a car had been destroyed, and its owner
chased away.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Dutta encountered a group of men outside a
liquor store and found they were armed. They ran, but Dutta and his
partner quickly caught them, and found one was the same man whose
car had been destroyed earlier. He had been preparing to take
revenge on the gang members who had chased him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get the gun from him without using force and
we prevented a drive-by shooting that night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these experiences, Dutta is writing a book on social
problems in the United States. Among his conclusions is that
political leaders debate issues in black and white or as left or
right politically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American's social and intellectual debates are so narrowly
focused that we miss the big picture,'' he said. ``We don't discuss
issues broadly enough.''

TWO KOSOVO ALBANIANS SLAIN AS PEACEKEEPERS OPEN FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ British peacekeeping troops shot two
Kosovo Albanians dead Friday night, one of them a well-known Kosovo
Liberation Army soldier. Two civilians were severely wounded in the
same incident, which occurred during a wild street celebration
marking the Kosovo Albanians' freedom from Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The dead soldier was identified as Avni Dudi, 19, known as
Liusha, who was said by witnesses to have been standing on top of
the car on which the British opened fire. Dudi had been
sporadically firing an automatic weapon into the air and then
hiding the gun in the car, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Pristina said Dudi was a veteran of several battles
against the Serbs fought by the Albanian militant commander known
as Remi, who commanded the force in territory north of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's celebration was timed for Republic Day, the
eighth anniversary of the founding of an underground parliament by
former Albanian legislators dismissed from their posts by the
Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in his takeover of the
government here.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people swarmed through the center of this provincial
capital on Friday night, cheering, chanting, dancing, hugging one
another and waving at NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, many of the celebrants began firing their
guns into the air, which led to the fatal episode.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the two Albanian men showed the continuing
volatile potential of the NATO peacekeeping mission, as the troops
seek to keep a neutral stance between the returning Albanians, who
feel themselves victorious, and the remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Serbian officials and former local party leaders are
maintaining offices in the Executive Building, the former
government headquarters. British paratroopers are maintaining a
guard at the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the crowd, Maj. Jan Joosten, a NATO spokesman said, the
Serbs asked for extra protection, and the paratroopers sent an
additional patrol, putting about a dozen soldiers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Joosten said that eight men in a car approached the building and
opened fire. Several soldiers, he said, believing their lives to be
in danger, ``aimed fire'' at the car, hitting four of the
occupants. One was killed immediately, and another died in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said, though, that the men in the car were
shooting in the air _ not at the soldiers _ as they had been seen
doing a number of times before as the honking procession of
vehicles moved through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The British military police are investigating the incident,
Joosten said. But he said that any soldier in the peacekeeping
force who feels his life is in danger has the right to fire.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO spokesman said that as the celebration progressed and
an increasing number of gunshots rang out, the British troops did
not attempt to disarm anyone, because they ``recognized that
celebratory fire is normal in this part of the world.'' In
addition, he said, the troops ``did not intervene, because it would
have inflamed a good-natured situation.''

NORTH KOREA READY TO TEST A MISSILE, JAPANESE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea has confirmed that it is prepared to test a
missile, a prominent Japanese visitor to the country said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yasushi Akashi, a former U.N. undersecretary general who has
completed a private trip to North Korea, said at a news conference
in Beijing that a North Korean foreign ministry official had
advised him that the country is ready to fire a missile, Kyodo News
Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea launched a rocket last August, sending it soaring
over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, in what it says was a
satellite launch but just about everybody else says was a test of a
new class of missile. That rocket launch created a wave of alarm
across East Asia and has encouraged Japan to move toward developing
a greater military capability.
</P>
<P>
   Another North Korean launch would have even greater
ramifications, possibly destroying the 1994 ``Agreed Framework''
that is the basis of relations between North Korea and the West.
Fearful of the consequences of another North Korean missile launch
for stability in East Asia, President Clinton and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, who is now visiting the United States,
delivered a joint warning Friday to North Korea not to fire a
missile.
</P>
<P>
   American and Japanese officials have said that they have
detected signs that North Korea may be preparing to launch a
missile, but until now North Korea has not commented. Akashi said
that Song Il Ho, the director of Japanese affairs in the North
Korean foreign ministry, had said that the North was ``ready'' to
fire the missile but did not specifically say that it would launch
it.
</P>
<P>
   Song reportedly said that North Korea was besieged by threats
from surrounding countries, so that there was no reason for other
countries to protest North Korea's taking a ``countermeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   A missile test would also create concern in the United States,
because North Korea is developing its new Taepodong missile, which
eventually may be able to threaten the continental United States.
The test last August was apparently of a Taepodong that might have
the ability to deliver a very small payload just about as far as
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The next test may be of Taepodong-2, which might be able to
reach as far as the West Coast of the United States. Moreover,
Aviation Week and Space Technology, a weekly magazine, has reported
that North Korea is developing a Taepodong-3 that could hit nearly
all parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean missiles are believed to be fairly inaccurate
and thus would not be very useful militarily. But Japan has had the
jitters about being in the sights even of inaccurate North Korean
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A North Korean missile launch would come at a critical time, for
William Perry, a former defense secretary, has been trying to
develop a new Clinton administration policy toward North Korea. The
new approach seems to involve an offer of a considerable expansion
of Western ties with the North if it will curb its missile program
and adopt more conciliatory policies. North Korea has not responded
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a broader conciliation between North Korea and the
West have been in doubt partly because of recent naval battles
between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea. The ill will from
those battles led to the suspension on Friday of talks between
North Korean and South Korean officials in Beijing.

GRAF TO FACE DAVENPORT IN A QUEST FOR 8TH TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Steffi Graf, whose reverence for Wimbledon
and its quaint Center Court lawn is symbolized by her seven titles,
and Lindsay Davenport, who has finally outgrown her disdain for
this ever-mutating surface, dispatched a pair of teen-agers
Saturday in the semifinals and gained a final-round berth in
Wimbledon's Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1989, when Boris Becker and Graf
presented Germany with a daily double in the men's and women's
finales, bad weather has forced the women's final to share the
schedule with the men on Sunday. But neither Graf nor Davenport
were worried about getting equal billing on finals day at the Grand
Slam tournament that steadfastly refuses to give them equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, after all, had pronounced herself ``drunk with success''
after capturing her 22nd career slam last month at the French Open
and Saturday brought herself to the brink of achieving the game's
hardest double with a 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-3 comeback against the
17-year-old Mirjana Lucic. And Davenport, who screamed with joy
after reaching her first Wimbledon final, regained the No. 1
ranking with her 6-1, 6-1 rout of 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Both Graf and Davenport were simply delighted to get to the
final, but they achieved their spots in vastly different fashion.
Davenport's 48-minute power-tennis diatribe showed the qualifier
Stevenson that she was under-qualified for this Center Court
hurdle, and Graf, who dropped the first-set tie breaker to the
Croatian aspiring to replace her someday as the queen of flashy
forehands, prevailed after a 1-hour-50-minute workout.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Davenport, a Wimbledon underachiever who came
into this year's event riding a wave of confidence that seemed
invisible to everyone but herself, pulverized Stevenson, the
strapping Californian who became the first female qualifier to
gate-crash this Slam's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Normally taciturn on the court, Davenport let out a shriek of
relief, and anticipation, after Stevenson soared a forehand return
beyond bounds at triple match point, and later attributed the
outburst to sheer delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to the Wimbledon final, it just means so much to me,''
Davenport said. ``To get the No. 1 ranking back is a great
pleasure, but getting to the Wimbledon final far outshines it.
Getting a chance to play for another Grand Slam title, and getting
to do it on a surface I used to hate in `93 and `94, is what we
play for,'' said Davenport, the 1998 U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, the victor of all seven Wimbledon finals she has contested
since settling for second-best against the nine-time champion
Martina Navratilova in 1987, secured a spot in her ninth career
finale here, the lowest-ranked women's semifinalist at Wimbledon in
the Open Era.
</P>
<P>
   Graf leads her rivalry with Davenport by 8-5, but the two have
never met on grass, Graf's favorite stomping ground and suddenly,
now that she's gotten to the final, a close second to hard courts
in Davenport's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special to be in the finals again; everything I did in
the last few months was for this tournament,'' said the 30-year-old
Graf, who entered the French Open with the aim of honing her
competitive edge for this Slam, wound up winning the Roland Garros
title, and promptly declared her retirement from the clay.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, two Wimbledons shy of Martina Navratilova's record nine
and two Slams short of tying Margaret Court's all-time slam record
of 24, admitted that an 8th Wimbledon championship might whet her
appetite for future competition rather than retirement from the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is pretty tempting,'' said Graf, who gained the final
when Lucic, who appeared to switch to surrender mode midway through
the final set, plopped a disinterested forehand return into the net
at match point.
</P>
<P>
   Graf termed her match difficult because of Lucic's go-for-broke
playmaking, the same hit-or-miss exuberance that carried Stevenson
to the semifinals and then deserted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young girls, they're playing aggressive tennis,'' said
Graf. ``They feel they have nothing to lose, and that's what it
takes to go up, and it's good that they're taking the risk.''

ROADBLOCK TO A PEACE PACT: IRISH MOSTLY SAY `NO'
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ John Hume, a 1998 Nobel Peace Prize
winner who heads the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor
Party, nodded toward the lumpen brick Stormont Castle Buildings
where talks to keep the Northern Ireland peace agreement alive were
in their fifth grinding day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took the word `no' out of the English language,'' he
said, ``there'd be a lot of speechless people in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how much more readily negative responses than
positive ones occur to the quarreling and distrustful politicians
of this conflicted province is the only way to comprehend the
bewildering week that has just passed and the perilous days for the
peace settlement that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary full-time personal involvement in the
marathon negotiations of two prime ministers _ Tony Blair of
Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland _ the future of the peace
accord of April 1998 remains in doubt and subject to rejection. It
was aimed at ending three decades of sectarian violence that has
cost more than 3,200 lives in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to wrest willing compromise from the naysaying political
leaders, Blair and Ahern on Friday night issued their own solution
to an impasse that had been blocking progress and said that if the
Ulster political leaders did not accept it, they would lose their
hard-won right to govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their ultimatum proposed a trade-off that called for the
creation in two weeks of a joint Roman Catholic and Protestant
Cabinet to run the new Northern Ireland Assembly, a Sinn Fein
priority, and a month later the beginning of the dismantling of the
Irish Republican Army arsenal, a Unionist demand.
</P>
<P>
   The take-it-or-leave-it plan was an effort to break a deadlock
that had halted progress in putting the peace accord into place at
a pivotal moment, the time when the British Parliament was supposed
to transfer authority to the new legislature in Belfast. Under the
plan, that will now occur on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   It became embarrassingly evident how Northern Ireland was
falling behind when similar new regional parliaments in Wales and
Scotland received their powers on Thursday as scheduled under
Blair's ``devolution'' constitutional reform policy of distributing
political power to the regions of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers' blueprint offered what it called
``fail-safe guarantees'' to the two warring parties that if either
of the steps did not take place on time, the legislature itself
would be shut down. The two leaders are counting on the fact that
the politicians would be loath to give up the salaries and
amenities they have enjoyed in the year since the assembly
officially opened or to forfeit the chance to repatriate the
legislative powers that reside in London.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments' recommendation is expected to gain the
support of Sinn Fein, but its reception in the Unionist community
is more doubtful. David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader who now
must sell the arrangement to his restive constituency, called it
``fundamentally unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants are already in a resentful mood over the
government's action last Monday banning Sunday's Orange Order march
from Drumcree Church outside Portadown through a Catholic
neighborhood. July is traditionally the most volatile period in
Northern Irish politics since the parades often provoke riots,
bombings and even death.
</P>
<P>
   The five days of talks did succeed in bringing forth from Sinn
Fein its first-ever pledge to seek the full disarming of the IRA by
next May, as envisaged but not spelled out in the peace accord. In
exchange, Sinn Fein won the right to take up its seats in the
cabinet on July 15 without having to meet the Unionist condition of
surrendering IRA arms ahead of time. Their victory was largely
symbolic, though, since the assembly goes into summer recess four
days later and returns only in September after the date by which
some arms are to be turned in.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, such an arrangement might be viewed as artful
face-saving compromise. But not here. Ken Maginnis, the Ulster
Unionists' security spokesman, told the BBC Saturday morning that
in his party ``there is general unanimity that Tony Blair has
betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake is an already far advanced process that has
brought Northern Ireland a level of peace, a promise of prosperity
and a climate of cross-community cooperation it has not known for
most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the peace accord, paramilitary groups have been on
cease-fire for more than two years and parties representing them,
like Sinn Fein and the Protestant Progressive Unionists, have
chosen politics over war.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of prisoners convicted of sectarian crimes have been
given early release, add British troops have left the streets of
Northern Ireland to return either to their barracks or to England.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution of Ireland has been changed to drop its claim
on the North, a power-sharing government representing Northern
Ireland's two religious traditions has been started, commissions on
policing and human rights are at work, a council linking Ulster
with England, Wales and Scotland is planned and new all-island
governmental agencies bringing together ministers from Belfast and
Dublin are to be created.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining steps are the ones addressed by Friday night's
directive from the prime ministers _ disarmament and devolution.
With them, the peace settlement becomes irreversible. Without them,
it slides back toward a history that can unite Catholics and
Protestants only in their common desire not to relive it.

 &HT;    For Jordan, river of return closed
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All those rumors originating in Los Angeles about
Michael Jordan returning to the NBA to be reunited with new Lakers
coach Phil Jackson? Well, forget 'em. Jordan said so himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing basketball again,'' Jordan said last week.
``Ninety-nine point nine (percent).''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Jackson plotting the return?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's not,'' Jordan said. ``Haven't talked to Phil at all.
But he knows I'm happy with his decision, and I wish him the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said Jackson, the Lakers' talent and the vaunted triangle
offense he will install can create a championship-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great team to work with _ If they listen to him,''
Jordan said. ``(The triangle offense) is not something you can just
do over a year's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boo-hoo at No. 2
</P>
<P>
   One of the memorable visions of Wednesday night's NBA draft was
the less-than-joyful look on the face of former Maryland star Steve
Francis when he was selected with the No. 2 pick by Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   He was a strong candidate at No. 1, which went to Duke forward
Elton Brand with the Bulls. He knew Charlotte, which picked third
and isn't too far from his hometown area of Washington, coveted
him. And with the Grizzlies already with Mike Bibby in place at
point guard, Frances had every right to believe he would not be
selected by them.
</P>
<P>
   But he was, which means he either will be traded after Aug. 1,
when NBA franchises can resume trading, or will team with Bibby to
make up a small backcourt. Either way, Francis said the Bulls just
might rue the day they passed on the high-flying, flashy 6-foot-3
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a great gamble by not picking me,'' Francis said.
``I'm happy to be selected, and I'll continuously play basketball
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   How upset was he that he went to Vancouver?
</P>
<P>
   After being picked, he said, referring to his Grizzlies cap,
``As soon as I get a chance, I'm going to take it off.... This will
give me incentive all season to prove to everybody that I'm the
best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said he has not ventured north of the border and knows
little about Vancouver. And what he does know was not comforting to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far from home,'' he said. ``It's cold. It rains a lot,
and they take a lot of your money (via Canadian taxes).''
</P>
<P>
   A Nugget of truth
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly for a team of poor shooters, the Denver Nuggets
contend they were happy that Duke guard Trajan Langdon was taken by
Cleveland with the 11th pick.They knew then that, with the 18th
pick, the Nuggets would get one of a group of forwards they
coveted.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be James Posey, who played at Xavier. General
manager Dan Issel said there was lots of cheering during the draft
at the team's headquarters. ``I think the loudest one was when
Trajan went where he did. That meant for sure we would get one of
the players that we liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Quotable
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtic coach Rick Pitino on the rumors that he was
considering resigning because of stress: ``Today, the way the
Internet is, it's like a grocery-store publication, people landing
from different planets. That story is in line with that. We're
having a blast. I'm very excited with the dedication of our
players.''
</P>
<P>
   High-schooler Jonathan Bender, refreshingly candid about what it
will take for him to be successful in the NBA: ``How fast things
happen depends on how well you adapt to the new organization, how
well you listen, your attitude and how you play. You have to play
hard all the time. I plan to do a lot of listening. I'm very
patient. I'm willing to work. If I listen, I can succeed.

 &HT;    Cement plant plans may sink river pleasures
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANFORD, Fla. _ It's one of those simple, Deep-South pleasures
that country folk take for granted and city folk may drive hours to
enjoy: floating down an ice-cold, spring-fed river in the dead of
summer on a rubber tire tube.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands flock each summer to North Florida's Ichetucknee
Springs State Park to do just that, drinking in the unspoiled
natural splendor of a crystal-clear river winding beneath a canopy
of gorgeous overhanging trees.
</P>
<P>
   But a proposal to build a large cement plant a few miles away
from the river has triggered a divisive controversy, splitting the
small communities that dot the rural countryside near the
Ichetucknee.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Environmental Protection two weeks ago
denied an air-quality permit for the plant, citing the poor
environmental record of an affiliated company. But company
officials said they will go to court to try to overturn the
decision, and some community leaders have indicated they will
support that effort.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is a familiar one in Florida and other booming
Southern states, where development and preservation, growth and
environmental concerns, butt heads with increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all for the plant,'' said Lori Frierson, town clerk in
Branford, a sleepy village of 700 a few miles from the park.
``There is no work here and I want my children to be able to grow
up with the chance to stay here instead of having to move away to
find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the environmental risk is too great. They want the
plant moved to a more industrial setting such as Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any question mark, we shouldn't allow this next to
such a fragile resource,'' said Bill Ogle, a Gainesville lawyer
representing nearby landowners who oppose the plant. ``We've
learned the hard way with the Everglades and other Florida
ecosystems that things we were told wouldn't have an impact did
have an impact. And we only found out too late.''
</P>
<P>
   A company called Suwannee American wants to build the
80-employee, $130 million plant in Suwannee County about 40 miles
northwest of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida. The
principals are owners of one of Florida's largest road-paving
firms, Anderson Columbia Inc., which has been embroiled in several
political and environmental controversies in other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Suwannee County commissioners and Branford's town council have
voted in favor of allowing the plant, citing the jobs and tax base.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent weekend, Gov. Jeb Bush and DEP Secretary David
Struhs joined some of the 200,000 people from North Florida and
South Georgia who annnually visit the river, canoeing through the
park with a heavy local media contingent on hand. A recent National
Geographic profile brought international attention to the
Ichetucknee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raved about the river's beauty, and Struhs' agency examined
Anderson Columbia's environmental record before denying the
proposed plant's air-quality permit.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Yagel, vice president of Suwanee American, said in a
statement responding to the DEP decision that although the two
companies have common ownership, they are under separate
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also are confident that DEP's denial of our permit request
based on a list of minor environmental violations over a 12-year
period by the Anderson Columbia company will not be sustained in
the courts,'' Yagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Plant officials have seemed frustrated by the scrutiny and the
media attention, refusing to speak with most reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Project engineer Frank Darabi, a Gainesville consultant who has
emerged as the chief spokesman for Suwannee American, insists the
plant would violate no pollution regulations and that critics have
managed to stir up opposition based on emotion instead of facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plant is 3.5 miles from the spring itself and there is
zero water discharge,'' he said. ``It's a dry process, and the air
emissions will be much less than from your car exhaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has promised to continuously sample the river for
pollution and to install sophisticated air monitoring devices that
would feed data directly to environmental regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much misinformation,'' Darabi said. ``Some
of the people against the plant live next to the river and have
septic tanks. When the river floods, their raw sewage washes
directly into the river. There are also farms with cow pastures
that are damaging the river more than the plant ever will.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists doubt the claims, and cite their own engineers
who say the plant would rain a fine dust containing mercury and
even highly-dangerous dioxin onto the river and surrounding
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what the impact will be,'' Ogle said.
``What they're asking us to do is put at risk an environmental
treasure enjoyed by millions of people from all over the world for
80 jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point to Anderson Columbia's frequent skirmishes
with regulators at its asphalt plant in the Florida Panhandle, as
well as the huge cash gifts it gave to two high-ranking Florida
politicians recently convicted of income tax violations stemming
from alleged influence-peddling schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a scandalous record, and we're hoping they will
deny the permit based on their reputation,'' said Virginia
Seacrist, head of a citizens group that opposes the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Ogle's lawsuit challenges the plant's county approvals, which he
says were illegal because they allowed an industry on land zoned
for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're euphoric that they denied the permit, but Anderson
Columbia is an adversary to be taken very seriously,'' he said.
``We've got to remain vigilent and keep our guard up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the controversy has revealed a rift in
rural Suwannee County that isn't likely to heal soon: Many longtime
locals who want some of the prosperity that's come to the rest of
Florida, while others want to curb development in one of the
state's few remaining pristine areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love the Ichetucknee because we grew up with it,'' said
Lori Frierson, a supporter of the plant. ``What we really resent is
these people from Gainesville and the outside coming in and telling
us what's best for us and how to run our town and our county.

 &HT;    Soft free-agent market counter to expectations
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NHL might have found a partial cure to
skyrocketing payrolls and the rising tide of red ink in front
offices.
</P>
<P>
   A dead free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, every NHL owner either complained about salaries or
spent millions on a free agent. Some, apparently suffering from
amnesia, did both. Among the players who secured financial security
for future generations were Brett Hull ($17 million), Curtis Joseph
($24 million), Doug Gilmour ($18 million), Ron Francis ($20.8
million), Steve Duchesne ($11.25 million). But because of a thin
market and some gun-shy general managers, who have been burned by
big-buck busts, few players figure to hit it big in the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams spent a lot of money and didn't get any
better,'' Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier said. ``There
were lessons learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The only player who figures to strike a major deal is winger
Theo Fleury, expected to sign with the New York Rangers for $8
million to $9 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But even Fleury will be hurt. His desire was either to re-sign
with Colorado, which swung a late-season deal with him, or go to a
team on the West Coast. But the Avalanche dropped out of the
bidding when Fleury went goal-less in the last nine playoff games,
then demanded a no-trade clause in negotiations. Los Angeles, which
had been interested, was burned by Duchesne, then swung a major
deal for New York Islanders forward Ziggy Palffy. San Jose directed
its resources into re-signing goalie Mike Vernon ($3.2 million for
one year) and Vincent Damphousse ($18 million for four). Vancouver
is more interested in signing Daniel and Henrik Sedin.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi doesn't think Fleury will
be too hurt by geography: ``For $10 million, he might play in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Word has circulated that the biggest reason the Avs won't
re-sign Fleury is because the sale of the team from Ascent
Entertainment to Bill Laurie has been held up. Don't believe it.
Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix was upset about Fleury's
playoff fizzle and upset that the forward sat out a game with a
stomach virus, somewhat verboten in the NHL. Add to that what
Lacroix gave Calgary to land Fleury: top prospect Robyn Regehr, two
players and the rights to a compensatory second-round draft pick if
Fleury signed elsewhere in free-agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury will land in New York because the Rangers need a big name
to replace Wayne Gretzky. And given the unrestricted free agents
available _ Joe Murphy, Valeri Kamensky, Pat Verbeek _ Fleury's the
only one with marquee value.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers update
</P>
<P>
   General manager Don Waddell could name his coach as early as
later this week, but next week is more likely. It is believed that
Orlando coach Curt Fraser, whom Waddell hired four years ago, and
former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan are the top two candidates. Waddell
has held out the possibility of interviewing one more candidate,
but that person is not expected to be any of the names that have
circulated, including Buffalo assistant Don Lever, Colorado
assistant Bryan Trottier.... Waddell would like to sign about three
forwards during the free-agency period, although it won't happen
quickly. The Thrashers will not pursue any of the big names
available. More than likely, they will wait to see what market
develops for some of the mid-to-lower range unrestricted free
agents and also survey the restricted free agents who aren't
re-signed by their teams.... Finnish forward Tomi Kallio, an
unsigned Colorado draft pick acquired in the expansion draft,
probably will spend one more season in Finland before playing in
Atlanta. But Waddell hopes Swede Andreas Karlsson can step into the
lineup this season. Karlsson, a former Calgary draft picked
acquired for ``future considerations'' on draft day, had 18 goals
and 15 assists for Leksands, his team in Sweden. ``He's a big
centerman _ I think he'll play for a long time,'' Waddell said....
Waddell said he is not upset that a deal that would have sent
defenseman Jamie Pushor, claimed from Anaheim, to Phoenix fell
through. ``We also had a trade with another team that we walked
away from because we thought we could do better,'' Waddell said.
``We like Jamie. I know him pretty well. He's an asset.''... No. 3
goalie Corey Schwab has come up in trade rumors, but Waddell says
he wants three goalies with NHL experience in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   Chicago general manager Bob Murray shot down a rumor that the
Blackhawks are about to deal free-agent bust Doug Gilmour to the
New York Rangers. But Murray is shopping defenseman Dave Manson (23
points, 155 penalty minutes and winger Bob Probert (21, 206)....
Detroit center Steve Yzerman is close to signing a three-year,
$25.5 million.... Colorado forward Peter Forsberg, who ended up
being the leading scorer in the postseason (24 points), despite the
Avalanche's elimination in the Western Conference finals, will have
to live off that feat for a while. Forsberg could miss as much as
the first three months of the season rehabbing from shoulder
surgery _ necessitated by a check from Dallas defenseman Richard
Matvichuk. Forsberg got a second opinion from his doctor in Sweden
before going ahead with the surgery. ``This was the right thing to
do in order to avoid any complications in the future,'' he said.
``I have complete trust in the advice I received along the
way.''... How concerned is Ottawa over finances? In addition to
getting winger Rob Zamuner, a second-round draft pick and a $1
million payment from Tampa Bay as compensation for losing general
manager Rick Dudley, the Senators insisted on _ and received _ all
of the gate receipts for three exhibitions to be played between the
teams in September.... The Senators weren't crying too much over
losing forward Andreas Johansson in the deal. He scored 21 goals
last year, but only four of those came in the second half....
Everybody always wants to look younger in Los Angeles, so the Kings
have decided not to offer contracts to Dave Babych (38), Ray
Ferraro (34), Russ Courtnall (34) and Doug Bodger (33).

REASONING THE FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   It has been 223 years since the first Fourth, the one
commemorated on this anniversary, and in that time Independence Day
has been celebrated in just about every possible way, with emotions
ranging from a throb of sanctity to irate mockery, with fireworks,
parades, doubleheaders, hot dogs, speeches, demonstrations, John
Philip Sousa and long afternoon naps on what feels delightfully
like the second Saturday in the week. This is still the least
commercial holiday in the American holiday roster. No one has
figured out a way to sell the public on exchanging Independence Day
presents, and you can only use so much red, white and blue bunting
before the front porch and the eaves start to look overdressed. The
few things that always sell well for the Fourth _ explosives _ are
illegal in most states. One good flag lasts a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   In some celebrations of the Fourth _ not many _ there still
exists an attractive vein of rationalism, a recognition that what
is being celebrated is both an event and an idea. Rationalism does
not sound like a very patriotic emotion, or much like an emotion at
all, but it is the spirit in which the Declaration of Independence
was written, and it reflects a historic part of the American
character, a brusque, native skepticism that is rarely honored
enough these days. In the phrasing of the document, in the way it
was promulgated, there was an assurance that reason was preferable
to sentiment and that the reason embodied in the Declaration of
Independence would be sufficient to dissolve whatever feeling still
bound Americans in that era to England.
</P>
<P>
   You hear it said repeatedly that the Fourth is America's
birthday, which is true but not true enough. The emotion the
holiday most often summons is patriotism, love of country, which is
good but not good enough. A sequined rodeo queen races into the
arena in a Western town, circling the crowd on a fast horse,
standing in her stirrups, the American flag she holds snapping in
the wind while the announcer lets his voice overflow with feeling.
All the people in the grandstand rise and their hearts rise too,
mostly. This is a fine thing, but it is not what has carried us all
these years, not this alone, no matter what form it takes.
</P>
<P>
   By now, 223 years later, it is almost impossible to read the
words of the Declaration of Independence _ especially the
unequivocal statement of self-evident truths _ without emotion,
without, at least, acknowledging that the rhythms ring with a
familiarity next door to emotion. But the Declaration does not
adjure its signers or the people they represented to strong feeling
or, for that matter, to patriotism. It adjures them to a sober
consideration of causes and first principles based on the laws of
nature. It speaks not only to the idealism of its first audience,
but also to its pragmatism, its sense of justice. These are the
qualities, arid though they may sound, that have preserved the
fundamental idea with which this country began. We speak as though
conviction were always an emotion and as though emotion were the
deepest experience a human could know. The authors of our freedom
knew better.

   A few months ago, Seattle Mariners executive Dave Aust was
wracking his brains for a fitting send-off for the Kingdome, the
Mariners' ballpark since 1977, which closed Sunday, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   He had an explosive notion: Sell thousands of detonating
plungers to Mariners fans for a couple of bucks apiece, and let
them take part in blowing the place up when it is scheduled to be
leveled with dynamite next March. ``A lot of people would pay money
to do that,'' Aust said. ``Everyone wants to see it blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some ballparks today don't evoke the same wistful
nostalgia that others did a generation ago. Mention the demolition
of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many Brooklynites, still drying their
eyes over Valentino, begin to tear up again. But with five new
major league stadiums set to sprout in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The Kingdome, an indoor park once known as the Tomb
for all its gray, empty concrete, has been a blight on the baseball
landscape for a generation. And the four stadiums still limping
through their final season _ Tiger Stadium in Detroit, the Houston
Astrodome, County Stadium in Milwaukee and 3Com (formerly
Candlestick) Park in San Francisco _ won't inspire many weepy
eulogies either.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the inside of the Kingdome roof camouflaged
pop flies so well that they often fell among several helpless
fielders. One sure-fire Dave Kingman home run was caught for an out
after it hit a support wire above the field. And in 1994, four
15-pound tiles plummeted from the ceiling a half-hour before game
time, one of them landing 50 feet from the Baltimore Orioles iron
man Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no current ballpark has earned more abuse than San
Francisco's, which by virtue of sitting on the tip of Candlestick
Point in the Bay rivals the climate of arctic tundra. Salty wind
gusts regularly separate players from their caps; during the 1961
All-Star Game, Stu Miller of the hometown Giants was blown clear
off the pitcher's mound. Since 1983, the club has awarded a ``Croix
de Candlestick'' pin to all fans who weather a frigid, extra-inning
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great going there in July and freezing your butt off,''
said New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, who played in Candlestick
throughout his 1960-77 playing career. ``Willie Mays would hit a
lot of balls to left field and, man, they wouldn't go anywhere,''
he recalled. ``I was catching one day, and Felipe Alou hit a ball
that went out of the park _ and came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium, tied with Boston's Fenway Park as the oldest park
in the majors, opened on April 20, 1912 _ five days after the
Titanic sank. More fans would have seen Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg, Al
Kaline and other Tigers legends play there if the view of thousands
hadn't been obstructed by jutting roofs and steel pillars. Players
complain that the dugouts are so deep that when they sit down, they
can't see the outfielders. Then there was the sign long posted
outside a locker room: ``Visitors Clubhouse _ No Visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astrodome has had more than human visitors in its 35
seasons. Once known as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the stadium
that gave America artificial grass now finds cats and rats
scurrying across it. The rodents are so big that Giants manager
Dusty Baker said, ``I've heard stories of cats running from rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come when the team's out of town,'' said one Astros
employee, ``the cats are hanging around first base and the
pitcher's mound. During a stadium tour, the cats were looking at us
like, `What are you doing, invading our home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to improve the fans' experience at County Stadium in
Milwaukee have fallen a little flat. The mascot Bernie the Brewer,
decked in lederhosen, slides down into a huge beer stein when a
Milwaukee player hits a home run, but the team's offense can be so
weak he gets as scarce as the Maytag repair man.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gaggles of gulls from Lake Michigan that
feast on tailgaters' garbage in the parking lot. Roars from a
nearby Harley-Davidson convention in 1993 scared the birds into the
ballpark, where they congregated on the outfield grass during
games. A pooch named Gus the Wonderdog was brought in to chase them
away, but Gus was unconditionally released after leaving some
souvenirs of his own.
</P>
<P>
   These five parks will be replaced by fan-friendly
techno-stadiums that should make fans forget all about their
predecessors. Retractable domes on the new Safeco Field in Seattle,
the Ballpark at Union Station in Houston and Miller Park in
Milwaukee will tip their caps when the weather's nice. At Pacific
Bell Park in San Francisco, fans can marvel at long home runs to
right field plunking into the China Basin Channel. Comerica Park in
Detroit will feature the world's largest scoreboard, not to mention
a barbecue-and-beer garden.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry, fans. Like every other new baseball stadium
these days, the new parks will be packed with so many interactive
doodads for the kids that they couldn't possibly be distracted by
some ballgame.

   A few months ago, Seattle Mariners executive Dave Aust was
wracking his brains for a fitting send-off for the Kingdome, the
Mariners' ballpark since 1977, which closed Sunday, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   He had an explosive notion: Sell thousands of detonating
plungers to Mariners fans for a couple of bucks apiece, and let
them take part in blowing the place up when it is scheduled to be
leveled with dynamite next March. ``A lot of people would pay money
to do that,'' Aust said. ``Everyone wants to see it blown up.''

BRITAIN AWAITS ROGUE TRADER WITH INTEREST IN THE LOOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For a while, he was the kid from nowhere whose Midas
touch made millions for his patrician overlords. Then, when it all
turned sour, he was the Rogue Trader whose breath-stopping losses
epitomized the dizzy excesses of the markets in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday, as Nick Leeson was set to fly back to Britain
after almost four years in a Singapore jail, the 32-year-old former
trader who brought down Britain's oldest merchant bank faced a
bittersweet homecoming, his assets reportedly frozen, his future
unclear and his freedom flawed by the same question as undid him:
What happened to the money?
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating his release from Singapore's Tanah Merah prison,
tabloid newspapers have been quoting some of Leeson's former fellow
prisoners as saying he told them of millions stashed away from the
days when he traded fast and loose in Singapore, racking up a
staggering $1.4 billion in losses. His lawyers have denied those
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But another newspaper, The Daily Mail, has reportedly clinched a
$160,000 deal for exclusive interview rights. Questions have been
asked, too, about what happened to the $700,000 advance for his
memoirs in a ghostwritten book titled ``Rogue Trader.'' A film
based on the book _ starring Ewan McGregor, who has the role of
Obi-Wan Kenobi in the latest episode in the ``Star Wars'' saga _
was just released here to awful reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the movie rights may have earned Leeson money that
Barings' creditors might think is due to them. And so, according to
the British Broadcasting Corporation, Barings' liquidators obtained
a High Court order Friday night freezing Leeson's assets, including
income from movie rights, to prevent him from cashing in on his
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are monitoring the situation very carefully,'' said Judith
Dow, a spokeswoman for the accountancy firm Ernst &AMP; Young, the
Barings' liquidators, before the court order was granted.
</P>
<P>
   But his lawyer, Stephen Pollard, insisted that Leeson was not
trying to garner huge wealth from his misdeeds. ``Mr. Leeson has
never intended in anything he has done or I have done for him to
try and create a situation where he can come out and lord it as a
wealthy man,'' Pollard told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as his return to England approaches, there are some
prepared to tout another side to the story _ the side that mimics
Aristotelian theory of hubris and downfall, pride and pain, the
tragic error that leads to a catharsis and relief that seems to
have eluded Leeson to this day.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in prison, his wife, Lisa, divorced him to marry a
fellow trader. Last fall, he was found to have colon cancer and
physicians say he has a 30 percent chance of dying in the next five
years, despite treatment in Singapore last year. His father, too,
has cancer, said Edward Whitley, the ghostwriter of Leeson's 1996
memoir. Even with time off for good behavior, he has served four
years of a six-and-a-half year jail term for fraud and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson's story, Whitley said in a newspaper article, is ``the
story of one naive and foolish man's life being slowly and
catastrophically smashed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see him next weekend, it will be a very different Nick
Leeson,'' the article said. ``Among all his other blows, Leeson has
had six months of chemotherapy for cancer. Most of his hair has
gone. His weight has plummeted. His complexion is the color of wax.
If he manages a smile, it will be a triumph of the human will.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is not how he is remembered here. As the son of a lowly
plasterer from down-market Watford, whose formal education was
limited, Leeson seemed to embody the chutzpah of a new generation
of traders taking risks on the open-outcry trading floors of
derivatives exchanges. His baseball cap and cocky grin seemed a
symbol of the markets' break with a tradition of bowler-hats,
pin-stripe suits and upper-crust accents. Yet, to his superiors at
Barings _ the 232-year-old British merchant bank that had financed
governments and banked for royalty from the Napoleonic Wars onward
_ he was a rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two years before the bank collapsed, Peter Baring,
chairman of Barings at the time, famously remarked that, ``It was
not actually terribly difficult to make money in the securities
business'' _ a comment that has entered the annals of banking as
denoting what Whitley called the arrogance and incompetence with
which Barings allowed Leeson to run up huge debts.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson worked for Barings' Singapore office and had been
considered a highly successful derivatives trader, remembered for
big bonuses and for setting fire to high-denomination bank notes at
Harry's Bar in Singapore. Even now, a cocktail commemorating him at
Harry's Bar is known as the ``Bank Breaker.'' Only a few of his
former colleagues gathered for a party there Friday before his
release Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But in February 1995, Leeson and his wife fled Singapore after
running up huge debts in trades on the futures and options markets
in Singapore and Japan. Leeson had been frantically trying to bid
up the market to cover his losses, but the Japanese market,
hammered by the Kobe earthquake, continued to fall. By his own
admission in ``Rogue Trader,'' he had tallied his losses on a
secret account, numbered 88888, which he hid from his superiors.
When he fled, he said in his memoir, he stuffed details of the
account into a desk drawer, switched off his cellular phone and
walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   His escape _ and his freedom _ ended when he was arrested at
Frankfurt airport while in transit between Asia and England.
Despite efforts by his lawyers to prevent it, he was subsequently
sent back to Singapore to face trial and was sentenced in December
1995 _ the last time he was seen in public before Saturday.
Photographs taken of him at the time show a smirking young man in a
baseball cap who apparently thought there was still a way to trade
his way out of the mess he had made.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, 1995, Barings collapsed under the huge debts and was
sold for one pound sterling, or $1.60, to the Dutch ING Groep NV.
The new owners seem to want nothing to do with him when he lands in
London early on Sunday. ``We have no interest, nothing to pursue,
that's it,'' said Edward Naylor, a spokesman for ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the bank's creditors. Singapore-based lawyers
representing Barings' liquidators say they will continue to
investigate whether Leeson has hidden ill-gotten gains in a secret
account someplace. Simon Forster, a spokesman for the Barings
Preference Shareholders Action Group, said any sums paid to Leeson
by newspapers ``should be going to those people who lost out'' in
the bank's collapse, not to finance his considerable legal and
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly Leeson will be able to do remains uncertain. The
markets will likely be out of bounds. Leeson was not licensed to
trade on the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange, a Liffe official said, ``and I wouldn't think he would be
allowed to now.''

All files MOVED TUESDAY:
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-MAIN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He was 21 when, in a flash of
anger, he slammed his 9-month-old niece to the floor because she
was crying. A cracked skull silenced her forever. Involuntary
manslaughter, the jury called it, and gave the man 18 years in
prison for his crime. He has done 10 and, because of ``good time''
laws that speed up the clock on sentences for good behavior, he is
scheduled to walk out of prison in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, three members of the state Board of Pardons
and Paroles sat inside a cluttered conference room in Northwest
Austin, deciding under what conditions the convicted baby-killer
will get his freedom. Same for a rapist with a preference for
14-year-old girls, a trigger-happy gangster who almost killed two
people, a longtime burglar who beat his girlfriend, a schizophrenic
arsonist and more than 100 other imprisoned criminals with
penchants for violence or sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Protect the public
</P>
<P>
   But the public is nowhere to be found. The deliberations take
place behind closed doors in an increasingly controversial process
by which Texas decides which criminals should be freed early from
prison, under what rules those convicts must live, even whether
execution-bound convicts should receive clemency.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Texas' biggest state secret. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-FILES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Not only are the meetings
secret where Texas paroles are decided, but so are the case files
that guide those decisions. Listing of information that would be
available. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-MEMBERS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles has 18 members, including the chairman. Annual salary
for the full-time job is $62,500; $65,000 for the chairman. All are
gubernatorial appointees who serve six-year terms. List of the
board members. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-COMPUTERS _ HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ It's just a laptop
computer, parole board member Rissie Owens says, ``and I haven't
really even learned how to use it yet.'' But officials hope it will
soon take Texas' archaic record-keeping system for parole and
clemency cases into the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been repeatedly criticized for its antiquated
and, at times, sloppy record keeping and is poised to go online
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-FIGURES _ Stats on numbers of prisoners released.
(Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-CASES _ Thanks to the lock of secrecy on Texas' parole
files, law-abiding Texans normally can't see what parole board
members consider in deciding which criminals to free early from
prison _ and which ones to keep in. In an exclusive glimpse behind
those closed doors, parole officials recently allowed the
American-Statesman to review several case files _ with names
deleted so as not to violate state law. We culled through the files
and listed the information parole board members said was pertinent
to their decision. Read the facts. Cast your vote and then see how
the real board members decided each one. Your options are to
parole, deny parole, make convict serve all time remaining, or
review the case again in several month. (Ward, Austin

KUWAITIS VOTE IN WHAT COULD BE LAST ALL-MALE ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ Kuwaitis voted Saturday in what may be the country's
last all-male elections, after a campaign dominated by a heated
national discussion of whether it is time to allow women political
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates for seats in Kuwait's 50-member Parliament have
vowed to block an emiri decree that would allow Kuwaiti women to
vote in the next election, expected in 2003. The decree must be
approved by the new Parliament, which is expected to convene by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Some women, including Masoumah al-Mubarak, a leading political
activist, have already declared their candidacies for the next
election, and most believe that the all-male Parliament that was
being elected Saturday will ultimately bow to the emir's wishes.
But many experts also warn that the parliamentary battle could be
fierce, with most of Kuwait's powerful Islamic political groupings
and the leaders of the country's traditional tribes already on
record as opposing the idea of women voting and holding office.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait is the only Arab Gulf state with an elected Parliament,
and a move to allow women to vote and hold office would put it even
further ahead of its neighbors in allowing equal political rights.
While the royally appointed government maintains the upper hand,
politics in Kuwait are traditionally free-wheeling and raucous.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mubarak, who with other Kuwaiti women convened a news
conference last week to address the issue, said she was ``hopeful
that sufficient positive-thinking males who support women's rights
fully will be elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The emir's decree came as a surprise to most people here, and
its announcement has energized support for Islamic and tribal
candidates who form the country's largest opposition bloc. Some
candidates have pointed to the decree by the emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, as an indication that Kuwait's government may be
out of step with the more conservative sentiments of most ordinary
Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
   The emir dissolved the last Parliament in May, 17 months ahead
of schedule, after its relationship with the government became so
distressed that little political business could be done. But if the
predictions of most experts here hold true, Saturday's election is
unlikely to heal the rift. Most people expect that opposition
candidates will once again dominate the Parliament, and a report by
the independent Al-Shall Economic Consultants has predicted that
the opposition will emerge from the election with an even stronger
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontation is certain, and it will occur very early,'' said
Jasem al-Saadoun, an economist and political analyst. Many people
believe that the tensions could grow if the government, led by
Sheik Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, names a
woman as a government minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti women have been lobbying for political rights for more
than three decades, and most Westernized Kuwaitis have welcomed the
emir's decree with enthusiasm. But many other Kuwaitis say they
have reservations about women voting and holding office, because
conservative mores do not permit unrelated men and women to mix in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians, including those who represent two main Islamic
movements, have contended that allowing women to vote and hold
office would violate the tenets of Islam. Many others, however,
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   More than 280 candidates were competing in Saturday's election.
Out of Kuwait's population of more than 1.8 million, only about
113,000 men were eligible to take part; under Kuwaiti law, most
male immigrants as well as women are not allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout was high, even in weather with temperatures that
exceeded 110 degrees. The results were expected to be announced
late Saturday or early Sunday, but experts said it would probably
be several weeks before it became clear whether opponents of the
emir's decree could muster the strength to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were the third in Kuwait since the United States
and its allies liberated the tiny country from seven months of
Iraqi occupation in 1990 and 1991. The emir, who had dissolved the
Parliament in 1987, restored the institution in 1992 under Western
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the contest has been the focus of Kuwaiti life, with
streets lined with candidates' placards, and election tents filled
to overflowing each night with men who gather to sip coffee, accept
lavish meals provided by the candidates, and listen to speeches
that typically denounce the government for what is seen as
irresponsible overspending.
</P>
<P>
   In Parliament's absence, the government has turned up the
temperature by ruling by decree _ not just on the question of
women's voting rights, but in other controversial areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates have denounced that high-handedness, and one
powerful opposition figure, Ahmed al-Saadoun, the speaker of the
last Parliament, has said that he will fight to block all the
edicts, including several that have instituted economic reforms in
hopes of making Kuwait more attractive to foreign investors.

REPORTS OF COERCION IN A MEXICAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ECATEPEC, Mexico _ Battling to maintain control over Mexico's
most populous state, the governing party has been testing the
limits of electoral legality, buying or coercing the votes of poor
Mexicans who are to cast ballots in elections for governor on
Sunday, according to electoral watchdog groups and interviews with
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mexico vote is the country's most important
electoral face-off before presidential balloting next year. Waging
a carrot-and-stick campaign that appears to be a rehearsal for the
presidential race, the governing party has been handing out
groceries and building supplies, and threatening to cut off
subsidized milk rations to nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews conducted in the final days of the hard-fought
race in the horseshoe-shaped state that cradles the nation's
capital, voters described numerous irregularities in what appears
to be a systematic campaign to deploy government resources and
influence on behalf of President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The party's candidate for governor, Arturo Montiel Rojas, denied
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that in Ecatepec, a sprawling working-class
suburb of Mexico City controlled by the party, municipal
authorities have been allowing men in party uniforms to use city
trucks to clean streets and sewers even as they distribute party
campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   In one neighborhood, party leaders have been giving poor
housewives boxes of rice, beans and other foodstuffs purchased by a
government charity headed by Zedillo's wife, residents reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tactics may constitute crimes, although most appear
to be abusive but not illegal, voting experts said. The campaign
resembles other recent state contests in which extensive
vote-buying by the governing party has provoked angry postelectoral
protests by opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Election watchdog groups and polling organizations reported
similar irregularities in cities all across the state, a polyglot
region of industrial suburbs and hardscrabble farms with a
population of 13 million people and the country's single richest
electoral cache, 7 million votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we don't think the fraud will occur on Election
Day,'' said Silvia Alonso Felix, executive secretary of the Civic
Alliance, a private organization that investigated reports of
campaign abuses in 36 of the state's 122 counties. ``It's been
forged throughout the campaign by purchasing and coercing the votes
of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday with foreign
journalists, Montiel portrayed the charges as lies invented by the
opposition parties. ``Our party doesn't have to rely on those kinds
of activities,'' Montiel said. ``We condemn them. They're not
authorized. They're not our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet residents interviewed in several neighborhoods of Ecatepec
described a variety of questionable campaign tactics. Several
government dispensaries that channel milk subsidized by the federal
government to destitute mothers have announced that recipients who
fail to attend rallies for Montiel will be cut off, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders have told market vendors that they will lose their
market licenses, issued by the governing-party-controlled city
government, if Montiel loses the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that if Montiel wasn't elected, we'd face the
consequences,'' said Maria del Socorro Garcia, an Ecatepec street
vendor.
</P>
<P>
   In the final pre-election poll published by the Mexico City
newspaper Reforma, Montiel, a former president of the party's state
organization, was backed by 43 percent of potential voters. In
second place with 34 percent was Jose Luis Duran, who took a leave
as mayor of Naucalpan, a large Mexico City suburb, to become the
candidate of the center-right National Action Party, known as the
PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Higinio Martinez, the candidate of the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution, was in third place with 23 percent. Other
polls showed Montiel's lead over Duran to be narrower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governing party has carried out a systematic campaign to
collect photocopies of thousands of voters' electoral credentials,
the photo identification cards that look like a driver's license
and are a requisite for voting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coercion mechanism,'' Martinez, the Democratic
Revolution candidate, said in an interview on Friday. ``When they
ask the humblest people for their election-card number, people feel
like they've been identified, that the authorities will now know
how they vote. It's one of the ways they pressure people to vote
for the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the credentials have been collected in many different
ways. In some cases, Montiel campaign workers simply go
door-to-door; some governing party workers said the party has
promised them 150 pesos, about $16, for each voting credential they
copy. In other cases, teachers in primary and high schools
administered by the state, whose current governor is a PRI member,
have urged students to bring photocopies of their parents'
electoral credentials to school.
</P>
<P>
   The party has also organized several giant raffles in which cars
and stereos are to be given away after Sunday's vote; tens of
thousands of tickets, bearing Montiel's name and the party logo,
have been distributed to state voters in exchange for copies of
their voting credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In the hillside shantytown of Ecatepec, known as Lomas de San
Carlos, the governing party's campaign has developed on multiple
fronts. The local party chief, Pedro Perez Munoz, has boosted the
party's popularity by distributing to poor mothers low-cost
groceries subsidized by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Party workers have gone from adobe hut to adobe hut, asking to
see residents voting credentials and distributing party literature.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, dozens of neighborhood women were summoned to
Perez's home, where a governing-party worker told them that if they
would bring their electoral credentials, the party would give them
each a free raffle ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting with reporters on Wednesday, Montiel denied that
the party had organized any campaign raffle, and he accused his
opponents of printing the tickets with his name and the party logo.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, in an interview, said the party's raffle had been
organized by Jorge Hernandez Hernandez, Ecatepec's municipal
director of social development.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Hernandez's municipal office said Hernandez had taken
a leave to work in the Montiel campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a form of vote coercion,'' said Miguel Angel Juarez, a
member of the State Electoral Institute, the autonomous state
agency that is organizing Sunday's vote. ``This is outlined as an
electoral crime, it's using a form of remuneration, in this case
raffle tickets or gifts, to try to commit voters to cast their
ballots in favor of a party or candidate.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I met Alexandra Stevenson, in the late '80s, she
was a merry child in San Diego splashing through swimming lessons
and slamming a tennis ball over the net. She was big and strong for
her age, and her paternity _ all I knew then was that her father
was a famous former professional athlete _ promised major jock
genes. Her mellow sweetness was a contrast to her mother's
intensity. Later, I thought it might also be a result of it.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson, a friend and colleague, is always tenacious
as a freelance reporter, frequently for The New York Times, and
often tendentious as her daughter's protector. She once told me
that she had decided early that Alexandra, as a dark-skinned child
in a pale sport, needed to be armed with a skill to combat the
obstacles people would throw in her way. Early in the Wimbledon
tournament, Stevenson kicked up a fuss over prize money _ officials
were slow acknowledging Alexandra's professional status _ and this
was followed by her recounting racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled parents often inject their children with some of the
rages that fuel them. But Stevenson seemed to use her energy to
create a kind of psychic bubble, neither hothouse nor bunker, in
which Alexandra could find her personality and talents, and let
them flower. It was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Watching and listening, usually from a safe distance along a
telephone line, I don't remember a time in the last two decades
when Stevenson was not railing at some school, coach, official, or
other tennis parent for sexist or racist slights _ usually real,
though often subtle. Yet she usually managed to place herself
between Alexandra and the hit. Stevenson's access to the news media
_ including her candid diaries of the junior tennis life published
in World Tennis magazine and The Times _ seemed to antagonize and
intimidate the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked. To reach the Wimbledon semifinals at age 18, a
qualifier, unheralded yet highly schooled, and still an endearing
person, is a tribute to Mom. Alexandra is a rarity in sports these
days, a fine wine that was not uncorked before its time. For
Alexandra, the timing was critical, and beyond tennis; the factoid
frenzy over her paternity began early last week when The
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., published a copy of her
birth certificate listing Julius Winfield Erving 2nd as her father.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, the basketball Hall of Famer, now an Orlando Magic
executive, acknowledged paternity in a statement in which he also
said, ``I applaud her mother's efforts and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than money, which came through a lawyer, there was very
little contact between Erving and the Stevensons. Mother and father
knew each other in 1980, while he was playing for the Philadelphia
76ers and she was a sportswriter. Erving said he had met Alexandra
once, when she was 3. He has been married since 1972, and has four
children with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Stevenson has been circumspect, although
sometimes coy, about Alexandra's father. Stevenson always knew that
when Alexandra showed up on the back pages, her father would show
up on the front pages. The fact that she chose not to press the
issue or write about it _ even though her financial circumstances
have always seemed tenuous _ was a clear message to others to mind
their own business.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a valid news story now? Beats me. By the time I found out,
in recent years, that Erving was the father, it seemed only
genetically interesting. What was the point of disrupting the lives
of a dignified, thoughtful businessman and a shining young woman?
</P>
<P>
   Outing is usually done for the sake of a journalist's ambition
under the banner of the public's right to know, be it about Arthur
Ashe's AIDS or Greg Louganis' homosexuality, a story in which I
participated, for my own ambition.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting story, and one I hope Stevenson writes
herself, is the successful raising of a multiracial child by a
single white mother in one of the harshest sports environments.
Even nuclear families explode in tennis. The relationships between
parents and children are a study in dysfunction and sometimes
white-collar crime, and the addition of such parental figures as
coaches is frequently volatile.
</P>
<P>
   One of Alexandra's earliest coaches was Pete Fischer, who is
credited with outfitting Pete Sampras with his rocket serve.
Alexandra has a version of that serve. Fischer is in jail after
being convicted of molesting boys at his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, whom Alexandra beat in the
quarterfinals, knocked off Martina Hingis in an earlier round.
Jelena's father was recently arrested for disorderly conduct at a
tournament. Martina's longtime coach, her mother, was mysteriously
absent from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   My own fantasy was to see Alexandra and Steffi Graf in the final
_ Steffi made it; Alexandra didn't _ for a number of reasons, the
least of which had to do with theories on the importance of dads:
Herr Graf was jailed for tax evasion.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will cover a large area from the eastern Rockies to
the Atlantic Seaboard as a strong and expansive area of high
pressure stretches from the central Atlantic Ocean to the
Mississippi Valley. Very warm air aloft near the center of the high
pressure zone will discourage thundershowers over much of the
Eastern states. However, disturbances traveling along the periphery
of the high will promote clusters of thunderstorms from the
northern Plains to the interior Northeast and from the southern
Rockies to portions of Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Dissipating thunderstorms will drift across the eastern Great
Lakes into the interior Northeast early Sunday. By midday, most of
the Northeast will be hot and humid with hazy sunshine. Winds from
the Southwest will be warmed further as they descend from the
Appalachians. As a result, afternoon temperatures in the middle and
upper 90s will be common from metropolitan New York to eastern
Virginia. A few strong thunderstorms will erupt over the interior
Northeast during the heat of the afternoon. The storms will drift
toward the coast Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will produce local flooding over parts of Florida,
especially near the eastern coast. A few afternoon thunderstorms
will form near the Gulf Coast. Otherwise, the Southeast will be
very warm and humid with little chance for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will develop from the northern Plains to
the western Great Lakes as a cool front approaches. Meanwhile, the
Northwest will stay unseasonably cool.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Aphelion
</P>
<P>
   Although this is hottest time of year, the Earth will reach
aphelion, its farthest point from the sun, on July 6th. But now,
the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, accounting for
the greater energy that is reaching the northern latitudes than
when the Earth makes it closest approach in January. Although in
the current era, the Earth is farther from the sun during the
Northern Hemisphere summer, that is not always the case. The Earth
wobbles on its axis like a spinning top. As a result of the slow
wobble, 11,000 years from now the Earth will be closest to the sun
during the northern summer.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Apologies to organized religion, but surely any candid
clergyman would concur: The most widely revered shrine in Boston is
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   So the fight brewing here stands out from the slew of stadium
battles that have cropped up around the country. To hear some talk,
at stake is the legacy of Babe Ruth, the cream of all sports-fan
experiences, yea, the very Valhalla of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Plus a lot of money. And a city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   One would think Bostonians would be fed up with stadium issues
after the recent months of ``will they, won't they'' drama over
whether the New England Patriots would move from Massachusetts to
Hartford. (They won't.)
</P>
<P>
   But this one has some new twists. A group of Fenway purists
contends that the old park can and should be saved and a group of
long-suffering Fenway-area residents denounce plans for the new
park as downright stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the sacred nature of 87-year-old Fenway, one of the
two oldest major league ballparks, and this sports-mad city is
embarking on its newest stadium saga with a much higher wattage of
emotional electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Already, John Harrington, the Red Sox chief executive, has
repeatedly choked up when speaking publicly about leaving old
Fenway Park. And many Bostonians have a Fenway Park reflex that,
when triggered, unleashes a maudlin speech that begins, ``I first
went there with my Dad, when I was 5 years old ...''
</P>
<P>
   Some details about the new $350 million stadium that the Red Sox
are proposing to build next to the old one remain unclear, in
particular, how much public money the state and city would be asked
to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But since the unveiling of the stadium plan in May, the outlines
of the project have emerged, as have the battle lines.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, the consensus is near-total: Fenway Park, the
smallest in the Major League, is obsolete. Fans love its intimacy,
and talk about being close enough to the players to catch a whiff
of their sweat, but its seats, aisles, and concourses are narrow,
it has flooding troubles, obstructed views, and other physical
problems. And from the Red Sox point of view, it is too small to
bring in enough money to make the team more competitive. (Read:
Maybe with more money, they could win a World Series, which they
have not done since 1918.)
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox plan to keep the best of old Fenway _ part of the
famed Green Monster fence, the infield and left field _ but in a
park next to the new stadium, a sort of museum version of Fenway.
The new stadium would include replications of the best _ the fence
and intimate layout _ but include over 10,000 more seats, bringing
capacity to 44,000, and an array of improvements, from wider seats
and concourses to a better sound system and more bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox officials say that fan reaction has been strongly
positive, and a team brochure even quotes former Red Sox great Ted
Williams: ``I want Boston to have the best. If any city needed a
new ballpark they need it. I won't shed a tear.'' City and state
officials, too, have been making positive noises, though largely
withholding final judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Old Fenway loyalists called Save Fenway Park is
proposing an alternate stadium plan that would involve renovating
the current stadium, and have been meeting in recent days with top
politicians. The loyalists argue that by adding an upper deck of
seats and other improvements to Fenway, they could preserve a
national landmark while increasing income.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the neighborhood opposition, from residents who
say that the Red Sox have been a bad neighbor and a new park would
make them an even worse one. Air quality, already terrible, would
get worse, as would traffic and parking. Perhaps, they say, an
already congested neighborhood in the center of the city is not the
best place for a ballpark, and a more serious search should be
undertaken for a site that would not involve 2-hour traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gridlock now,'' said Jim Morgan, a member of the Fenway
Action Coalition, on a noisy street corner near Fenway. ``There's
no way they can get a million more people a year in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked what the greatest hurdle remaining for the new
Fenway was, Harrington of the Red Sox mentioned neither neighbors,
some of whom the Red Sox say are on board for the project, nor Save
Fenway. The big challenge, he said, is lining up the financing for
the project, which has an estimated price tag of $545 million: $350
for the stadium, $65 million for land purchases, $80 million for
two parking garages and $50 million for ``infrastructure'' like new
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Sports commentators in Boston tend to describe the Red Sox
proposal as a juggernaut, with strong initial momentum and backing
from big money, big sentiment and a phalanx of fixers.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Boston, a city of politicians even fiercer than its
sports stars. Under the Red Sox best-case scenario, the new park
would open in 2003. Sox fans may want to stay tuned. But very, very
patiently.

SOUL-SEARCHING FOR SWISS AFTER THEY LOSE OLYMPIC BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Like chocolate, cheese, precision watches, the Red
Cross, skiing and banking, the Olympic movement has been linked for
decades with Switzerland. The city of Lausanne has long been
headquarters for the International Olympic Committee and home to
its spectacular lakeside museum.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been doubly infuriating for the Swiss to endure what
is widely perceived as the latest blow to their national pride: the
decision to award the 2006 Winter Olympics not to the front-running
Alpine resort of Sion, but to an upstart Italian rival, the
industrial city of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected and very public blow came when Switzerland was
climbing out of a lengthy economic downturn and beginning to come
to terms with the painful revelations of recent years that Swiss
actions during World War II may well have been concerned less with
self-preservation than with profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sion's loss to Turin sparked street protests and and nationwide
accusations that the vote was an act of revenge for the Swiss
member of the International Olympic Committee who blew the whistle
late last year on widespread corrupt practices within the Olympic
movement. That led to resignations and expulsions of members of its
clubby committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sion's bid for the Winter Games enjoyed widespread popular
support and Olympic rings in the red and white Swiss national
colors adorned everything from toilet paper to trains. So the
rebuff was felt nationwide, and the fury enhanced by knowledge that
the committee's formal evaluation gave the edge to Sion, while the
52-36 vote went heavily against the Swiss resort.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection prompted a wave of self-examination. One
mass-circulation daily, Blick, published a survey of foreigners'
views of the Swiss, ranging from what it described as the Israeli
view that the Swiss are anti-Semitic, to the French observation
that they are racist and the American perception of the Swiss as
colorless and out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pedantic and humorless,'' Blick concluded. ``We are
greedy profiteers. We are arrogant. We are bad losers _ that's how
the world sees us.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has long prided itself on what is nationally seen as
self-sufficiency, which in foreign affairs translated into
neutrality and choosing not to join either the United Nations or
the European Union. Today, however, that attitude is increasingly
seen as perilously insular.
</P>
<P>
   Federal minister Adolf Ogi, who oversaw the unsuccessful bid for
the 2006 Games, said afterward in published remarks that despite
Switzerland's healthy international economic position, it is
``politically alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogi, who was photographed visibly shaken when he heard the news
announced in Seoul, South Korea, said later: ``I heard delegates
say they wanted the Swiss to lose. People don't like Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the disheartened Ogi's interview published when
reports surfaced that the country's role in seeking the Games may
not have been squeaky clean. A Swiss news weekly, L'Hebdo, said
Swiss tax officials had overlooked past Olympic Committee tax fraud
to smooth the way for Sion's bid. L'Hebdo printed what it said was
a secret government memo that Olympic Committee workers declared
lower salaries than they received, to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Committee has denied any wrongdoing, saying that tax
arrangements, often murky in Switzerland for the rich and famous,
were longstanding and legitimate. Swiss officials also denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, a rare alliance of conservative and left-leaning
political parties blocked a constitutional amendment that would
have enabled Switzerland to sell some of its gold reserves to
finance the Solidarity Foundation, designed to help victims of
poverty, disaster and human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that any benefits from gold sales should go
to Switzerland's sagging state pension fund, not to the special
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ogi, who oversees Swiss defense and sports matters, saw the
recent controversy over the country's role during World War II and
the Olympic corruption disclosures as part of a ``mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has to do with our attitude,'' he added. ``We think we
are the best, we play at being schoolmasters, we give lessons, we
wish to profit but not to get involved. We overestimate
ourselves.''

FIRST LADY AND MAYOR TRY TO TURN DOWN THE GLARE ON THEIR SENATE
BIDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Hillary Rodham Clinton shows up at Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's upstate New York farm on Wednesday, offering
herself as his potential successor after his retirement next year,
it will be a full 482 days until the election. Nevertheless, as of
Saturday, nearly 200 reporters and other media representatives from
around the world had signed up to record the event, and then to
chase the first lady across central New York for four days of
``listening to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates for U.S. Senate would revel in that kind of
attention, particularly in a state like New York, where campaigns
rarely draw serious notice until well after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing perception among New York's political
leaders that the 16-month campaign for Senate that begins with Mrs.
Clinton's appearance in Pindars Corners will pose an extraordinary
challenge for the Democratic first lady and Rudolph Giuliani, the
Republican New York City mayor, who is also likely to run for the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have actually begun
talking about turning down the volume on this contest, as difficult
as that may be in this superheated media environment, with both
sides concerned about overexposure or making mistakes under such
close scrutiny and over such a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides said she intended to avoid making major
news over the course of her visits to New York this summer. She
plans no major speeches and will spend most of her time
``listening, listening, listening and listening'' at small meetings
with voters, said her senior political adviser, Harold Ickes. And
Giuliani has been attempting to lower his Senate candidacy profile
as well, one adviser said, concentrating on activities like raising
money while turning down invitations to appear on network
television shows devoted to the race.
</P>
<P>
   The race for senator from New York for 2000 is, given the likely
presence of a sitting first lady, upending the rules by which
politics are played in New York. It has pushed all the players into
unfamiliar territory, from the strategists who are trying to plan a
campaign unlike any they have seen before, to the television news
directors and newspaper editors who are faced with decisions about
how many staff members they should devote to a Senate race that is
effectively beginning more than a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions could prove to be nearly as significant in
shaping the public perception of the race in the next 12 months as
what the candidates themselves do.
</P>
<P>
   Against that unsettled background, there is a sense among the
first lady's associates that a long run on a high-profile stage
could present unwanted complications for a novice candidate who is
trying to learn a new career and get to know a new state. While
Mrs. Clinton's stature carries obvious advantages _ this is one
candidate who never has to worry about walking into a room filled
with empty chairs _ the concern has colored much of the planning
Mrs. Clinton's aides have done for her inaugural campaign visit.
</P>
<P>
   How, asked one of her friends, is Mrs. Clinton going to learn
about the concerns of everyday New Yorkers when she is being
shadowed by a press corps so huge that its numbers are filling
hotels from Oneonta to Albany? Will she be able to walk down the
street, talking to shop owners or buying a quart of milk, with
reporters and Secret Service agents packed around her?
</P>
<P>
   A critical aspect of Mrs. Clinton's effort to become grounded in
New York is the discussions with small groups of New Yorkers that
will begin on Wednesday in Oneonta. ``She wants them to be as
intimate as possible,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a longtime adviser to
Mrs. Clinton. ``She wants to speak to people, listen to people, and
not have 200 cameras there to make it more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But those events are, so far, shaping up as something less than
private. Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's new press secretary, said
he had processed requests for press credentials from television
crews from Japan and Britain. While Wolfson said the campaign would
try to restrict coverage of some of the events to a small,
representative group of pool reporters, Mrs. Clinton will arrive at
Moynihan's farmhouse in the rolling hills of Delaware County to
find a huge wooden platform constructed to accommodate the
television crews and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases,'' Wolfson said, ``a large press corps may not
be helpful to facilitating this.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Mrs. Clinton, and to a lesser extent
Giuliani, will not have the luxury of traveling the state, learning
the issues and making unnoticed mistakes in the process, a luxury
most new candidates have. Mrs. Clinton's friends say this will not
be a problem for this particular first lady, given her husband's
skills. ``She knows what it takes, having been through numerous
campaigns throughout her husband's career,'' said Lisa Caputo, who
served as Mrs. Clinton's press secretary in the White House. ``I
would argue she's pretty seasoned.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer length of the campaign invites opportunities for
high-profile errors by any candidate, particularly one who is
inexperienced. That became distressingly clear to the first lady's
friends when she donned a New York Yankees baseball cap at a White
House ceremony and declared herself a Yankee fan, a moment that
even her closest associates described as clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer, at a similar
point in his own campaign to unseat Alfonse M. D'Amato last year,
was traveling the state constantly, with a single aide and largely
unnoticed. Schumer, a Democrat who had served in the House, said he
had used that time to raise money, educate himself on state issues
and build political support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense it was easier, because no one was paying attention
to me, and I could focus on what I had to do,'' Schumer recalled.
``And in a sense, it was harder because no one was paying attention
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has far more experience campaigning than Mrs. Clinton.
However, even his friends say his bellicose manner, particularly in
the environment of Gracie Mansion, invites mistakes as well. And
even Giuliani's friends do not dispute that he lacks the kind of
personality that wears well with voters over time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani may get more attention if Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long
Island Republican, keeps his promise to challenge the mayor in the
primary. In the meantime, Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of the mayor's
political action committee, said Giuliani had no intention of
conducting the kind of explicit campaigning now that would focus
attention on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really focusing on things we need to do _ and much less
on what the media thinks, or the attention the media is paying on
the things that are happening,'' Teitelbaum said. ``We are
concentrating on the things that we need to get ourselves ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers are trying to remedy the problem of
having too many reporters following her by, in effect, trying to
bore them out of town. ``I hope that over time the novelty will
wear off and she'll be able to get out there and really travel
without the full circus that will travel with her at the
beginning,'' Ms. Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But there are indications that this is one race where
there will be a continual media presence. Steve Paulus, the general
manager of New York 1, the all-news cable station in New York City,
said his station was gearing up to enthusiastically cover every
turn of the campaign, no matter how long it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be following the candidates wherever they go,''
Paulus said. ``I think the interest is just going to be so high
that we can't miss covering it like a glove. It'll sustain itself
and it'll be that interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC News, said he
expected the networks to cover a Clinton-Giuliani race, assuming it
shapes up that way, much the way they cover the candidates for
president. ``It is safe to say that from September 2000 through the
elections, the networks will cover her every day,'' Halperin said.
``And all the networks will likely assign full-time off-air
reporters to cover her, as early as this week.''

 &HT;    Trying on several bra styles essential to finding good fit
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If your bra slips, slides or sags, causing you to
bounce and bulge, you're probably one of the 85 out of 100 women
wearing the wrong bra size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of women are wearing the wrong size bra
because they don't know the proper size of bra they should be
wearing,'' said Corene Hennig, an international executive director
with Jeunique International, who sells custom-fitted Sculptress,
Pennyrich and Jeunique bras.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Nutritional Research Foundation, many women
wear ill-fitting garments that give little or no support or that
redirect the breast tissue, impeding circulation and lymphatic
drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Many women squeeze themselves into a bra that's too small,
reasoning that going up a size is a sign of gaining weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeezing into a smaller bra is not only uncomfortable, it can
cause unsightly bulging and spilling out in the front,'' said Cyndy
Shirey, who worked for three years in the lingerie department at JC
Penney. ``That can be OK if you're going out in the evening and
you're wearing a low-cut dress and you want to show, but not when
wearing a T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only unflattering to wear the wrong-size bra, it's also
unhealthy, Hennig added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bust should be held at a 45-degree angle to your chest
wall to allow for proper circulation and lymphatic drainage,'' she
said. ``Then they don't have that old matronly look where they're
going down, down ... When they are held up, it takes pressure off
the diaphragm and you can breath a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsupport bras and gravity work together causing the woman's
breasts to sag, stretch downward and lose prominence and firmness.
</P>
<P>
   With a supportive bra and the proper-fitting clothes, a
well-endowed woman can have a great-looking chest, said Hennig, who
has been selling custom-fitted bras for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't notice your breasts if you're wearing
proper-fitting clothing. What they notice is if you're flopping,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a proper fit, the bottom of the bra should fit on the rib
cage, not on the breast. In the back, the bra should come down
below the shoulder blades. All of the breast tissue should be
contained inside the cup and the bra should hold the breasts firm
with no or little give when you jump in the air. The bust should be
supported from underneath the breast, not from the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bras are just like blue jeans. Most of the time you have to
try on several kinds of bras,'' Shirey said. ``Every bra fits
differently and it will fit differently on every person.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips for finding a bra that fits:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get measured. Some department stores have a fitting consultant
or fitting specialist that can help you.
</P>
<P>
   To measure for most store bras, put the tape measure around your
back and directly above the breasts to get a band size. For the cup
size, measure directly over the fullest part of the breasts.
Subtract the band size from the cup size and the difference
determines what letter your cup size will be.
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers are the same, the cup size is AA; if the
difference is 1 inch, the cup size is A; for 2 inches, the cup size
is B; 3 inches, the cup size is C; 4 inches, the cup size is D; 5
inches, the cup size is DD; 6 inches, the cup size is DDD.
</P>
<P>
   Custom-fit bras are sized differently than most store-bought
bras. Corene Hennig, who sells custom-fitted Sculptress, Pennyrich
and Jeunique bras, measures customers before fitting them with a
bra.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you try on a bra, bend at the waist to make sure the
entire bust stays in the bra. Stretch every way and do several
jumping jacks to make sure the bra doesn't ride up in the back or
front, which would mean it was too big or too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to fit against your breast bone, but you still need
to be able to get a finger under there,'' said Cyndy Shirey of JC
Penney.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cinch bras up if they sag in the front or if straps tend to
fall off the shoulders. Or look for a T-back bra.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small chested women should avoid sheer bras or bras with no
fiberfill. Such bras tend to bunch up or pucker. A contour cup
offers a more rounded, even look.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go bra shopping only when you're in a good mood and aren't
tired. First thing in the morning is a good time because you
probably will have to try on multiple bras to find that perfect
one, Shirey said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just because a bra is the size you normally wear doesn't mean
it will fit you, especially since there are many types of bras made
for different lifestyles, outfits and coverage, including push-up,
contour, seamless, front hook, padded, full-coverage, sports,
underwire and strapless bras.
</P>
<P>
   Often when women try on bras, they'll go from an underwire to
something without an underwire or from a fiberfill to a sheer.
Switching styles can make it more difficult to find a bra that
fits.
</P>
<P>
   Well-endowed women need to look for a bra that supports them
well. A lot of people think underwire bras are the best, which
isn't necessarily the best bra for well-endowed women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the minimizer bras,'' said Shirey. ``They lift and
separate, which gives you a lot more support. A piece of material
in the middle separates and keeps the breasts from appearing to
stretch all the way across the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   A crisscross performs similarly.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have trenches in your shoulders where your bra has been
digging, try selecting a bra with wide shoulder straps or padded
straps, also called comfort straps.
</P>
<P>
   _ For daily wear, avoid bras that don't give a natural fit, such
as push-up bras and sports bras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wear sports bras 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. That's not good for you because it compresses you and it's
not really healthy,'' Shirey said.
</P>
<P>
   Save push-up bras for special occasions, like dances and a night
out on the town, when a little more cleavage is desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it makes you feel better to wear one of those little
ditties on a Saturday evening out, go for it. But on Monday
morning, put back on your good support bra,'' Hennig said.
</P>
<P>
   Bra types:
</P>
<P>
   Soft cup _ An everyday basic that works well with any wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Padded _ When you want to add an inch, while maintaining a soft,
natural shape.

 &HT;    Playing that tune with jukeboxes
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A large man in a yellow shirt stands in the middle
of Chapter 11 with a dollar bill in his hand and an intent look in
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Like a moth to a flame, he is drawn toward the brightly lit
jukebox hanging on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention _ I could be a disc jockey,'' the anonymous man
shouted to the crowd gathered at the bar. He then proceeded to
point out, to anyone who would listen, his favorite bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Doors _ now this is my music,'' he said. ``Man, I love
AC/DC, ooh, and Bob Seger, too. And ZZ Top is always going to be
around.''
</P>
<P>
   As his music selections start to play, he settles in at the bar
and starts to groove.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the yellow shirt is not alone in his love for
jukeboxes, just ask around your local bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in a place, you want to hear good music not
twiddle your thumbs,'' said Clark Williams, a customer at Charlie's
Corner. ``When you get off work, you want to have a few drinks,
listen to the jukebox and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie's Corner bartender Peggi Shepard admits that the
atmosphere can get downright playful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play something they don't like, they beat a trail to the
jukebox to play something else,'' Shepard said. ``We often have
jukebox wars. Someone will get up and play songs that they know
another person doesn't like, and then that person will get up and
play songs that they know the other person doesn't like. We have a
lot of fun going back and forth like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that favorite music can be from a local artist like
Texas singer-songwriter Pat Green, who grew up in Bosqueville and
Waco. His song ``George's Bar,'' which is about all the time he
spent at George's Restaurant in Waco, appears on a few of the
jukeboxes here in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not some mega star, so guys like me appreciate being put
on their jukebox,'' Green said. ``We're not the kind of guys who
get played on the radio all the time, so we have to depend on other
avenues for people to hear us. Jukeboxes are a good way. It's
satisfying to know there's several places in town where you can
listen to my music on jukeboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   George's owner Sammy Citrano said Green's music and songs by
other Texas artists are often the most played in his establishment.
In fact, he said, most of the customers know their selections by
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a free jukebox, and people pay to hear their
favorites. So we keep up with the Baylor kids and the older
people's requests,'' Citrano said. ``It's amazing that a lot of
people have their favorites memorized. You can often hear them call
out four numbers to a friend standing at the jukebox, and sure
enough that's the song they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   However, what one person wants to hear on the jukebox is not
necessarily what everyone else in the place wants to hear. But
Green concedes that's part of a jukebox's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the basic concept of being able to choose your own
music,'' Green said. ``With that dollar, you can dictate to
everyone in the bar what they're going to hear, and that's pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ellis, co-owner of Ellis Music Co., has serviced
jukeboxes for more than 40 years. He has seen the requests for
certain artists come and go through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always request certain records. It just depends on where
you're at,'' Ellis said. ``Some of it's The Dixie Chicks, some of
it's Ricky Martin and some of it's B.B. King. It just depends on
the location you're in.''

 &HT;    Patriotism came alive on Freedom Train
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Bicentennial may have been the
grandest Fourth of July since 1776. It was certainly the longest;
it lasted a whole year.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost impossible to go anywhere in America on any day in
1976 without being reminded of the country's 200th birthday.
Restaurants served meals on red, white and blue place mats;
normally staid businessmen sported red, white and blue ties and
Liberty Bell socks.
</P>
<P>
   Stores advertised Spirit of '76 sales and Bicentennial Bonanzas.
McArthur Dairy even offered red, white and blue ice cream. After so
many years of assassinations, Vietnam and Watergate, it was
suddenly fashionable again to be patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was ready to come together,'' recalls Ruth
Dukkony, who helped organize one of the biggest Bicentennial
celebrations of all, the Freedom Train.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds everywhere packed platforms and sidings to catch a
glimpse of the rolling exhibition that mixed history, popular
culture and odd bits of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Inside were 510 works of art, historical artifacts or other
exhibits from 35 states (plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.). It
had been Dukkony's job to persuade the owners to turn them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody turned me down,'' says Dukkony, who now lives in
Jupiter. ``It was wonderful. There was such a spirit in this
country. The problem we had was turning things away. Everyone who
heard about it wanted to be a part.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two years as a vice president of the nonprofit American
Freedom Train Foundation were her first and last experience as a
paid executive. She got the job through friends who knew how
persuasive and well-organized she could be from her many years of
volunteer work in Washington, D.C., where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Dukkony, then Ruth Adams Packard, was also active in Republican
circles, helping to organize President Nixon's 1968 inaugural
celebration. Her contacts, and her experience as a docent at the
Smithsonian, helped open doors at museums and private collections
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among her prize catches: George Washington's copy of the
Constitution, John Kennedy's rocking chair and Alan Shepard's
Apollo mission practice suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many places, I had carte blanche to pick whatever I
wanted,'' she says. ``I went to Universal Studios and came back
with Alfred Hitchcock's director's chair. I came back on the plane
with an Emmy in one hand and an Oscar in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukkony made many calls out of the blue to famous people, asking
each to suggest something that represented an important
achievement. A few needed help narrowing the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Bing Crosby what he got for recording `White
Christmas,''' Dukkony says. ``He said, `Rich.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also got a gold record, which he lent for the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Dukkony persuaded Coretta Scott King to lend her late husband's
vestments and Bible; golfer Arnold Palmer, his 1964 Master's
trophy; track star Jesse Owens, his Olympic gold medals. Sometimes,
she persuaded people to lend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Mamie Eisenhower to ride the train from Washington to
Gettysburg,'' she says. ``People lined the tracks on both sides to
see her. Mamie was trying to wave from both sides. She was so
dear.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a quarter century, Dukkony is still visibly excited
about the project. She pops in a video showing the silver train
emblazoned with red, white and blue stripes. As it rushed through
white clouds pouring from its old-fashioned steam engine, Porter
Wagoner and Dolly Parton warbled the Freedom Train's theme song.
</P>
<P>
   The line was 3 miles long when the train made its first stop at
Wilmington, Del., on April 1, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Between then and the train's 140th and final stop in Miami on
Dec. 31, 1976, more than 11 million visitors paid $2 each ($1 for
children) to climb aboard. Each car offered a different theme: our
immigrant ancestors, western pioneers, legends of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate displays included animatronic patriots, a
recreation of Ben Franklin's print shop and a peek into Thomas
Edison's laboratory. Visitors were transported through two
centuries and 10 converted baggage cars on airport-style moving
walkways.
</P>
<P>
   In each town, a handful of VIPs got a more leisurely tour, plus
lunch, for $25. Dukkony hosted these special gatherings whenever
the guest list topped 50. ``That happened 79 times,'' she says.
``That meant 79 cities, and 79 lunches of Kentucky Fried Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   So many faces in so many cities sometimes left Dukkony facing an
embarrassing blur. On one stop in Minnesota, she spotted Hubert
Humphrey, one of the featured guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to have both senators,'' she blurted to the man
next to her. ``Where's the other one?''
</P>
<P>
   The man smiled and introduced himself. He was Walter Mondale,
the other senator.
</P>
<P>
   Dukkony recalls many of the stops in detail _ including
Harrisburg, Pa., on July 4, 1976. The festivities were loud, long
and emphatic. Visitors that day could stop at a special Freedom
Train post office to get a Bicentennial postmark on almost any
souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller, more subdued gathering marked the end of the train's
journey. Dukkony rode the train back from Miami to Washington and
made sure all the exhibits were returned. Every two years since,
she's joined her Freedom Train friends for a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have such a good feeling about it,'' she says. ``You
know how it feels when you throw a party and everybody has a good
time? I threw a party and 11 million people had a good time. It's a
thrill.''

 &HT;    Creativity drives Mall of America
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What I loved about my first visit to the Mall of
America in Minneapolis this week wasn't that it has 500 stores and
22 sit-down restaurants. Or that there's no sales tax on clothing
in Minnesota, or even that it includes some of my favorite stores:
Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   What I loved is that the powers-that-be who created the giant
mall have allowed themselves to think creatively about what an
American mall might be rather than lock themselves into stereotypes
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about that subject a lot because I'm worried
about the future of my neighborhood's mall. I keep asking myself
why a mall can't look at innovative ways to attract customers,
especially families.
</P>
<P>
   The Mall of America has done just that, and it seems to be
working. Since opening in 1992, the mall has become a destination
spot, attracting 43 million people a year, 40 percent of them
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mall owners is the Melvin Simon Group out of
Indianapolis, a company that also serves as mall managers. And the
indoor amusement park, Camp Snoopy, is run by Ohio's Cedar Point.
</P>
<P>
   I toured the mall with Maureen Cahill, associate director of
public relations. Here are a few examples of creative thinking and
programming that go way beyond the tons of shoe and clothing
stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ An alternative high school, the Metropolitan Learning
Alliance, is located in the mall. The off-site campus targets
students in five Minneapolis-area school districts. It gives
high-school and post-secondary technical college credits. The
school has seven classrooms and a technology computer lab and also
is used by the University of St. Thomas for courses in retail
management.
</P>
<P>
   _ National American University is the first college campus in a
mall. Cahill says it's especially valued by mall employees who want
to take accounting, marketing, computer and business courses. Day
and night classes are offered three days a week and on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Couples can get married at the ``Chapel of Love.'' The unusual
wedding spot has attracted more than 2,000 couples from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Greek Bodyline Mediterranean Spa offers services ranging
from body wraps and massage to nonsurgical face lifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daily guided walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   _ A youth liaison program was started in 1995 to develop
relationships, trust and respect with kids both inside the mall and
in their communities. Youth Liaisons are security officers who
focus on issues that are important to teens. They organize
youth-targeted events, visit schools and volunteer at community
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mighty Moms and Dedicated Dads is a team of real-life moms
and dads who work side-by-side with mall security officers on
Friday and Saturday evenings. They welcome kids, encourage them to
behave and follow the rules, and act as a first level of
intervention if the need arises. The program is part of the mall's
innovative approach to dealing with unsupervised youth and making
the mall safer for all guests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kid's Quest, a day-care center where parents can leave
children while they shop.
</P>
<P>
   _ The SHAPE program offers classes in adult basic education and
English as a second language. The classes are free and the schedule
is flexible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help phones are located throughout the mall to assist
shoppers. There's also a ``One Call for the Mall'' line that
answers questions about reaching any store, restaurant or
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   _ You've probably read about the more glitzy attractions such as
Camp Snoopy, the full-scale, indoor amusement park. When the
Minneapolis winter gets rough, kids can still have an
almost-outdoor amusement-park experience. There's a 500-seat
theater beside Camp Snoopy and a new climbing wall with three
levels of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   _ A more recent addition is UnderWater World, a full-scale, 1.2
million-gallon aquarium. Acrylic tunnels equipped with a moving
walkway lead visitors through the aquatic adventures.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I passed the four-story Lego Imagination Center, I saw
lots of families huddled around tables building Legos together.
There's no purchase required and they're welcome to stay as long as
they like.
</P>
<P>
   The mall, which has a lot of the stores you'd expect, also has
some unique shops, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A magnet store.
</P>
<P>
   _ A NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway store with simulated racing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Great Cars Great Trucks store, which showcases Chrysler's
latest models and concept cars. There are interactive Sega games, a
life-sized Jeep simulator and a theater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Postmark America is a one-of-a-kind postal retail store. You
can buy stamps as well as a complete line of post-office
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Basic Brown Bear Factory, kids can help make a teddy
bear. You select a bear and then assist in stuffing, sewing,
bathing and dressing the bear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Custom Foot uses a computer to take three-dimensional
measurements of a shopper's feet. Measurements are sent to Italy
and custom-made shoes arrive at your home within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oshman's Supersports USA lets you try before you buy. You can
sink a jump shot, lace up roller blades and skate, or drive a
three-wood deep into an in-store golf simulator.
</P>
<P>
   _ The LifePlace celebrates life even when an illness is
involved. The store offers items that make living with an illness
or disability easier. There's a collection of soft dolls that have
their own ``illness'' and can be used as teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much this mall doesn't offer. Cahill says its
success is due to the fact that it provides something for everyone
and families can spend days there. The mall also includes bars open
till 1 a.m. You can learn more at www.mallofamerica.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I left believing that there's no reason our area malls couldn't
come up with innovative uses for mall space and create complexes
that will attract those from neighboring cities as well. It's
certainly worth some thought.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ There's no real police force here yet,
which may explain why children have been seen driving cars. No one
agrees who owns what, so people are staking their claims to the
tractor next door, the house down the street and the factory in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   There are no trials, elected officials or tax collectors.
Official records -- those that remain -- are under guard to prevent
their being destroyed by retreating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, aid groups started confronting a new question:
Who is responsible for removing human and livestock corpses that
are contaminating hundreds of water wells?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to U.N. Country, also known as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Government institutions are nonexistent in this Serbian province
torn apart by ethnic hatred and war. In the absence of any central
authority, it's up to a few hundred U.N. workers to set up a
government for a divided public that craves structure.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed Bernard
Kouchner, France's health minister and a founder of the Doctors
Without Borders aid group, to decide which laws and people rule the
land. The 59-year-old Kouchner, an outspoken proponent of
humanitarian measures during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, will run the
show from a badly looted Yugoslav army building, where doors don't
lock and employees are urged to take their computers home with them
at night.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a Kosovo that will hold elections and govern itself
as an autonomous region within Yugoslavia. The United Nations will
oversee the slow transfer of institutions and property from the
hands of ethnic Serbs to the majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   But, whether and just how that will be done is still under
contention between the two enemies. The NATO bombing has stopped,
but the battle for Kosovo, which had an estimated 1.8 million
people before the massive refugee flight started in March, will
continue with each ministry, company, house or cow that is
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has run parts or all of countries before,
from Bosnia to Cambodia to Rwanda. But, it has never started with
such major issues unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major complication is that, in other U.N. peacekeeping
operations, you had an agreed upon settlement,'' Eric Morris, a
senior official overseeing the formation of the U.N. Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) said. ``Here, you will be dealing on a daily basis
with questions of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is a recipe for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a race, if you don't have some fundamental rule
of law and institutions operating, that (chaos) could be the
result.'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   For help, the United Nations is delegating reconstruction duties
to the European Union. Democracy-building tasks, such as organizing
elections and training police, fall to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees asked for $106 million
for its work in June and UNMIK, with about 400 staff and rising,
needs $60 million to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The actual reconstruction of the country, with thousands of
homes and businesses burned, will take billions of dollars and
possibly 10 years. At least 50 private aid agencies are at work.
</P>
<P>
   But, the United Nations is already running to catch-up. Last
week, Annan urged foreign ministers and officials from 18 nations
and three regional organizations to provide the manpower they have
promised. For example, only half the 55,000 NATO troops planned
have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is worse for police, which U.N. officials say is
the top priority. But Annan secured promises for 1,938 of the 3,110
civilian police needed from U.N. countries.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, only 36 had arrived. But the United States
pledged 450 officers, the first 100 of whom would be sent by July
15, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. The United States
also offered another 100 police trainers.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue still dividing countries and delaying the police
deployment is whether the civilian police should be armed. The
Netherlands and Britain, for example, prefer the police to be
unarmed as most U.N. civilian police are. But Albright agreed with
U.N. officials that at least some of the police would have to be
armed and have the authority to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In their race to construct a civil society, U.N. officials have
one major advantage: The desire among most Kosovars -- both
Albanian and Serb -- for order.
</P>
<P>
   It may be volunteerism, more than U.N., EU and NATO muscle, that
will rebuild Kosovo. Last week, as shops were starting to re-open
and the first signs of normalcy appeared on the streets of
Pristina, ethnic Albanian Jakup Mehmeti strapped two traffic lights
to the top of his old Opel.
</P>
<P>
   He picked them up from NATO officials running the municipality
and was on his way to install them at an intersection. That was his
job 10 years ago, before the Serbs took over and fired him. He
volunteered to do it again while the United Nations gets organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody is going to pay me, I just want to do
it,'' said Mehmeti. ``I want to see my city safe and the traffic
better.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of ethnic Albanians taking the law into their
own hands, most are ready to find their justice in due course. All
you have to do is go to the provisional police station set up by
British troops, and you can see patient Albanians lined up for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs stole the inventory from Selim Gravalla's building company
and burned his house. But, he waited hours in line to report the
crimes last week, rather than take a match to the abandoned house
of the Serb he knows burned his.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says. ``I do not want to be on their level. I had a
chance to do that a hundred times, but I have not broken even one
little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, relief for people like Gravalla will come slowly.
Currently, NATO forces are so stretched thin that they are slow to
arrive to even life-threatening crimes in progress. At times,
looting has occurred before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They pull suspected criminals into a legal system with no trials
or uniform laws. American, British, French, Italian and German
troops follow their own countries' procedures for temporary
detention.
</P>
<P>
   As for courts, Kosovo's interim U.N. administrator Sergio Vieira
de Mello has appointed nine judges -- including five ethnic
Albanians, three Serbs and one ethnic Turk -- that began clearing
the backlog of more than 150 detainees on Saturday by hearing three
murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   The judges will be operating under a modified version of the
Yugoslav penal code, except when it conflicts with international
human rights standards. For example, the United Nations will scrap
Yugoslav laws that allow long detentions for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In straightening out non-criminal disputes, the United Nations
is forming seven committees, made-up of Serbs and Albanians, that
will advise and mediate. Of immediate concern are the nearly
violent altercations taking place over employment.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians were purged of their government jobs from
universities, hospitals, factories and ministries when the Serbs
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989. They were also summarily
fired from private sector businesses such as major hotels and
restaurants. Since NATO came into Kosovo, the workers have been
gathering like ghosts at their old job sites demanding their jobs
back.
</P>
<P>
   Among other sites, NATO troops have had to seal off Pristina's
giant Grand Hotel and the government television complex to keep
violence from erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get back our offices and jobs,'' said Mehmet
Mehmeti, a-52-year-old former mining executive who has been driving
taxis since he was fired with 2,400 ethnic Albanian mine workers in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Their old mining office is now the arts building of a Serb-run
university, but that's where Mehmeti and about 30 other men have
been waiting daily while negotiations determine who gets to go back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to those owed pensions in the
public jobs, up until now controlled by the Serb-led Yugoslav
government. Also, the Serbs systematically destroyed identification
documents. U.S.-based Microsoft Corp. has donated computer
equipment to begin a re-identification program for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will also be the final authority on education
in Kosovo, another issue that was contentious long before the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Since a Serb curriculum was imposed in 1990, most ethnic
Albanians have sent their children to the Albanian ``shadow''
school system. It was financed by Albanian donations.
</P>
<P>
   The system was hit hard during the Serb campaign of ethnic
cleansing this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Only halfway through an assessment of the 1,000 elementary
schools for ethnic Albanians, UNICEF officials have found that at
least 170 schools have been damaged by burning and looting.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are destroyed. Some are booby-trapped, or worse. In
the United States, officials worry about guns near schools. In
Kosovo, two British soldiers were killed by unexploded NATO cluster
bombs near a schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is a shortage of the estimated 18,000
teachers needed, as many are missing or refugees. UNICEF's Flaka
Surroi said it is unknown at this point who will pay teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   After the schools are repaired, it's likely that the United
Nations will monitor curriculum and textbooks to make sure the
schools are not teaching ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi would like to see some schools eventually integrated,
with Serb and Albanian children using the same buildings, as they
have infrequently in the past. An ethnic Albanian herself, Surroi
said she hopes someday they can even share bilingual education. In
that case, the United Nations would have surpassed all
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do that as an experiment within five years, but not
now,'' she says. ``It was partly segregation that brought us to
this situation now.''

<P>
   THORNTOWN, Ind. _ It is simple, Clarence and Maryann Cornell
said. Financially secure, they wanted to travel and they wanted to
do it in comfort and style, their two yelping dachshunds in tow.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Cornells, owners of two stationary homes _ one in
Minnesota, the other in Florida _ explained their latest
acquisition: a $112,000 Fleetwood Southwind motor home they had
just eased into a spot at Old Mill Run Park, a 67-acre campground
with a stream and fishing ponds, amid corn and soybean fields here
in central Indiana, 35 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Over a long weekend, they will lounge on leather upholstery in a
plushly carpeted living room with expandable walls, cook in a
kitchen complete with four-door refrigerator-freezer and bathe in a
big tub in their bedroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the dogs,'' said Mrs. Cornell, who is 40, ``the only way
to do it is with a motor home.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, 69, outside lowering the motor home's built-in awning,
shrugged and agreed. ``That's the gist of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In these days of unparalleled affluence, the Cornells can
splurge more than most. He is a semiretired executive; their
children are grown. But in their taste for luxury on the road, they
are far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chariots like that of the Cornells _ and bigger ones, costing up
to $1 million, with washers, dryers, tile-walled baths,
surround-sound stereos and storage compartments beneath the wheels
known as basements _ pull into Old Mill Run Park every day. The one
thing that does not often pierce this middle-class campground's
horizon of metal boxes on wheels is the peak of a spartan camper's
tent, though there are sites for them.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a place in America that captures how the waning
century's longest stretch of prosperity has fogged over memories of
recessions, unemployment, inflation, gasoline rationing and sinking
stock markets, the American campground is as sure a contender as
the thriving marinas of Florida or the shoulder-to-shoulder big
houses of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   While roughing it with bugs, Sterno stoves and sleeping bags in
the thick of the bush still lures many of the hardy and fit, the
old conventional campground now more often means trailers with
window screens, three-burner stoves, air-conditioning and
queen-sized beds.
</P>
<P>
   Motor homes, many of them 300- and 400-horsepower ``diesel
pushers,'' as they are called, pull the family car to the campsite,
or ``duallies,'' big muscular, $40,000 pickups with four wheels in
the rear, haul in the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   It all costs money, far more than the gains in income that most
Americans have realized over the last decade. But like the boats
and the extra-large houses, a deluxe home on the road is something
that many of them will stretch themselves thin to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying more now than they ever did in their life,''
said John Shufflebarger, who as a salesman at the Indy RV Center
near Indianapolis supplies some of the vehicles that come here. ``I
don't believe people in the United States are going to let money or
gas prices interfere with their entertainment. As long as the
economy is as good as it is now, they're going to go out and have a
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Mary Kay Baker, 36, a cheery preschool teacher,
her husband, John, 39, a farmer and water-well driller, and their
children, Bradley, 11, and Kristen, 15, have been spending weekends
and summer vacations here. A year ago, Mrs. Baker's parents, Bill
and Ferne Ferrel, started coming, too, in a trailer of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakers, who earn something under $60,000 a year, put 10
percent down from their savings to buy their $21,000, 35-foot
Innsbruck trailer. Unlike many Americans, the Bakers do save
something, about 10 percent of their income, but they save to
spend, not for the rainy days of unemployment or plunging stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the recession,'' Mrs. Baker said, sitting at
the family picnic table.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association says
the booming economy induced Americans to spend $8.4 billion for
nearly 300,000 recreational vehicles, from $3,000 pop-up camping
trailers to self-propelled motor-home behemoths, most of which cost
$50,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s through last year, the association says, the
industry sold two million vehicles, almost half a million more than
in the 1980s. All together, the association says 9.3 million are in
service and that one in 10 households has one.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after many years of camping with their children,
Ralph Christman, 47, a former farmer and automobile assembly line
worker, and his wife, Sandy, formerly the activities director at a
veterans' home, bought Old Mill Run Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park has 347 campsites, with 197 of them renting for $950
for the season that runs from April to October. All of these are
taken. Most of the other sites, renting for an average of $21 a
day, except for those for tents, are at least two-thirds full on
weekdays and tend to fill up on weekends. The vehicle sites have
small lawns and easy hook-ups to water and electricity and many to
cable television and telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   People come for the swimming, fishing, the five-hole golf course
and volleyball, bingo and horseshoe tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's carefree,'' Mrs. Christman said. Children come
into the campground store with $20 bills to buy candy and trinkets
and spend it all, she said, adding, ``Then they go back and get
some more.''
</P>
<P>
   As production of RVs has climbed, so have the features on which
consumers splurge. Many are equipped with one to three expandable
sides, known as slide-outs. These are sections of wall, floor and
ceiling that with the push of a button pop out from a vehicle's
aluminum hide to create more space inside.
</P>
<P>
   Driven or towed, the bigger vehicles require a gallon of
gasoline or diesel oil to travel 7 to 10 miles. But relatively
inexpensive fuel, $1 a gallon for gasoline or diesel oil at at a
station near this campground, has erased memories of the oil crisis
in the mid-1970s, when rationing and soaring prices put the
recreational vehicle business in mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   The lush economy has blessed Jack Andres, 65, who retired last
year as a utilities engineer at Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind., and his wife, Janet, 59, who was an administrative
secretary there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last working years, our salaries were higher, and our
investments made more money,'' Mrs. Andres said. ``It's allowed me
to retire before I was 62.''
</P>
<P>
   They sold their home last year and, with savings and profits,
have settled into a 28-foot, single-slide-out trailer that they
keep here. They also bought a camper that fits into the bed of
their pickup that they take on visits to 11 children from two
marriages and to Naples, Fla., the site of their modular home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, camping was your cheap summer vacation,'' Mrs.
Andres said. ``Camping is a lifestyle for us now.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   With the growth of motorized camping, the age of the motorist
has dropped. Almost entirely retirees before the 1990s, the average
trailer and motor home owner today is 48, said Jeff Beddow, the
industry association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Mill Run Park, the Christmans' clientele is blue
collar and white collar. Postal workers and construction workers
reside lot to lot with doctors and executives. They seem
universally affluent, in outlook and attitude if not in all cases
in assets and income.
</P>
<P>
   Judee and David Duncan, both 58, parents of five children, have
a 38.5-foot Fleetwood Avion fifth-wheeler, a trailer that hitches
into bed of a pickup. It is the Duncans' only home.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan retired from the Navy, having risen to lieutenant
commander from seaman, and went to work for the Raytheon Co. Five
years ago, at 53, while working 70 hours a week managing a missile
assembly plant, he had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to chuck it all,'' Duncan said. ``We sold our
3,000-square-foot home, bought a fifth-wheeler and have been on the
road since. I have owned everything a person could want. Boats.
Woodworking equipment. And I do not miss it a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-inflation economy, Duncan said, protects the buying
power of his $35,000 annual pension from the Navy that he and his
wife are living on. ``Sometimes I think of getting a part-time
job,'' Duncan said, ``but it doesn't last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   When the campground closes in the fall, he said he and Mrs.
Duncan would drive to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to fish and
then roll on to Florida for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   For some other campers here, mostly young, but older ones, too,
the decade's prosperity has inspired revisionist thinking about the
notions of spending, saving and borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rumery, 71, basks under his awning, wearing a T-shirt
that says, ``I'm a two-steppin' country western dancer.'' He and
his wife, Nancy, 68, used to share driving of a Mayflower moving
van, and then he became the company's supervisor of driver
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Depression,'' Rumery said. ``I was born in 1927.
I grew up dirt poor.'' Gesturing from his patio, he said, ``We just
bought that '99 Chrysler this year,'' with 10 percent down. ``We
had a '96 Mercury. But it was gray and she wanted red, so we just
bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Rumery is his 1999, 36-foot, $22,000 Nomad trailer with
two slide-outs. ``We just bought it, too,'' he said, again with 10
percent down. ``I don't believe in paying cash. Why should I take
it out of the market where it's working for me and put it in
something that's going to start depreciating the day I buy it?''
</P>
<P>
   With pensions, Social Security, Medicare, consulting fees, and a
lively stock market, Rumery said, ``We believe we've got the
ability to do what we want to do.''

BARBECUE SUBCULTURE FLOURISHES OUTSIDE THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Phyllis Norton-Towers, a real estate broker in
Brooklyn Heights, enjoys a charmed urban life. She lives in a
brownstone apartment with a garden where turtles swim in a
makeshift pond and plump roses climb a wooden trellis. Her dinner
guests relish the cloth-covered garden furniture, the sauvignon
blanc and especially the cuisine made possible by the barbecue: a
Weber grill fueled by a 20-pound propane tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it all takes place,'' said Ms. Norton-Towers
contentedly as she described the stuffed chicken and even the peach
cobbler she had grilled one recent evening. ``My dream was: I want
to be able to cook outside.''
</P>
<P>
   With her headband, her gold bracelets and a drink in hand, Ms.
Norton-Towers hardly fits the image of a law breaker. Yet she is
among an entire class of New Yorkers engaged in an illicit
activity: barbecuing with compressed gas.
</P>
<P>
   Two single-spaced pages of municipal regulations make it almost
impossible for most city dwellers to grill within the law.
Barbecues on residential property, using either propane or
charcoal, cannot be operated within 10 feet of any combustible
material, like Ms. Norton-Towers' wooden trellis and her
cloth-covered furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Propane, the most highly regulated fuel, cannot be transported
into the city via tunnels or the lower levels of bridges, and tanks
cannot be refilled anywhere in the city. Also, it is illegal to
carry more than a pound of propane through a house or apartment.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to comply with the regulations and maneuver a
20-pound tank onto a terrace? ``You'd have to bring it in by
helicopter,'' said Brian Dickson, a spokesman for the Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although the department regards propane as a serious potential
fire hazard and has confiscated illegally stored propane used for
commercial purposes, officials acknowledge that any crackdown on
residential barbecuing has been minimal. The city does not keep
lists of offenders, and it has no record of having caught one. The
penalties on the books range from a citation to a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   As they fire up their grills this holiday weekend, many New
Yorkers have only a hazy sense of the prohibitions. Some, like Ms.
Norton-Towers, believe they are following the laws. Others, like
Brad Grossman, a chiropractor who recently grilled filet mignon for
guests on the silvery rooftop of his Christopher Street building in
Greenwich Village, know the regulations but choose to ignore them,
the hunger for barbecued meat being more powerful than the fear of
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one die-hard barbecuer, a television producer
who lives in a brownstone on the Upper West Side, ``Some laws are
meant to be broken.'' And broken they are with impunity, on the
city's terraces, patios, fire escapes and sidewalks and in its
gardens and alleys, as New Yorkers grill everything from sliced
cauliflower to marinated bratwurst.
</P>
<P>
   The rare law-abiding barbecue lover, like Debra Duchin, a
private investigator who lives on the Upper East Side, so feared
the possibility of a fine that she turned her propane grill into a
planter and packed it with petunias.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Wing, a former executive food editor of Country Living
magazine who grills year-round at her West 71st Street brownstone,
says she uses charcoal instead of propane to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a confrontation with neighbors she described as
``cantankerous,'' who doused her with water as she grilled in her
garden, she moved her equipment to the roof. But there she is
courting trouble, too, because the grill sits on a potentially
combustible plastic mat.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, the boards of many of the city's large co-op
apartment buildings send out stern letters telling tenants to put
down their tongs. But as Bob Plant, president of the board of his
co-op on East 24th Street, acknowledged, grilling continues. ``It's
a very abused regulation,'' he said. ``I can remember spotting a
dozen propane barbecues myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many New Yorkers regard the laws as little more than a
nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Friday night, as Grossman presided over his
propane-fueled grill, flipping stalks of asparagus and chicken
breasts for a score of dinner guests, he offered a typically
caustic assessment of the city's barbecue regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really ruining the quality of life up here in New York
City,'' he said, snorting derisively, when asked about those who
ignore the rules. ``We are menaces to society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His guests, equally uninterested in the regulations, were all
too willing to discuss their own barbecuing habits, like driving
tanks of propane through tunnels and carting them through French
windows leading to apartment terraces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, we have a good fire department around the corner,''
said Gerard O'Brien, an actor who uses a propane barbecue on his
wooden roof deck in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman chimed in: ``We can see 10 other roofs from here, and
people are barbecuing all the time. My neighbors don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cavalier attitude of many New Yorkers, propane can
pose a real threat. A Fire Department official said that the
average tank of propane used for a grill has the force of four
sticks of dynamite, and that even an empty canister has enough
residual gas to blow up a house.
</P>
<P>
   A number of accidents related to propane barbecuing have
occurred on Long Island. In 1991, a propane blaze at Caumsett State
Park in Suffolk County left a child in critical condition. In 1994,
two teen-agers in Coram flicked a cigarette lighter near a propane
barbecue, causing an explosion. The boys survived, but only barely.
</P>
<P>
   Even legal activity connected with city barbecuing has a furtive
quality to it, as was evident one recent Saturday at T.W. Smith
Welding Supply Corp. on West 59th Street near the West Side
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   This desolate spot, adorned with signs reading ``Danger:
Compressed Gas,'' is one of two stores in Manhattan that exchange
empty propane tanks for full ones. Especially on summer weekends,
the store is thronged with New Yorkers unloading empty tanks from
the trunks of taxis, willing to abide by the law but annoyed at
having to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Others drive out to New Jersey to refill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a place somewhere on one of those anonymous routes,''
said one city barbecuer, who had borrowed a car in order to make
the trip. ``They told me they were out of propane. I said, `How can
you do that? I rearranged my whole life.'''
</P>
<P>
   The company finally rustled up enough gas to make possible a few
hamburger dinners. Then the New Yorker drove home through the
Lincoln Tunnel and walked the tank through his front door.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Wilson, a creative consultant to Donna Karan, once
dispatched a friend to New Jersey to refill her propane tank before
a dinner party in her Upper West Side garden. But the friend, who
had secured the tank in her car with a seat belt, became stuck in
traffic, and as an hour ticked by and she failed to telephone as
promised, Ms. Wilson began to regret having made the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, all for a barbecue,'' she said. ``A little
bump from another car and, like, she could blow up.''

LONG ISLAND STRUGGLES TO FIND SPACE FOR DAY LABORERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y. _ The sun was barely up when the
immigrant day workers began to gather here along New York Avenue,
waiting curbside to be hired by the landscapers, carpenters and
other contractors who would drive up in vans and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The daily ritual, which starts in May and continues through
September, has gained a number of participants over the last
several years, upsetting local residents and merchants who say the
laborers create traffic hazards and scare away shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The vans and trucks began arriving Saturday morning around 6:30
and were quickly surrounded by as many as 30 men, who jostled for
position to bargain for the promise of an average of $60 in
exchange for a long day's hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is a job,'' said one of the workers, who came here
a year ago from El Salvador. ``We just hope we get our money at the
end of the day.'' He identified himself only as Eduardo, 20, saying
he was an illegal immigrant who feared deportation.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 a.m., nearly 125 workers had converged on this busy
commercial strip, some of them arriving by train at the Long Island
Rail Road Station a few blocks away. At times the traffic came to a
screeching halt as the workers darted back and forth across the
avenue, chasing down any vehicle that might be driven by a
contractor or a local resident looking for a couple of men to help
with yard work.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of hostility and resentment began to surface
around 8 a.m. as the local store and business owners arrived to
open shop. They chased the workers, three to four deep, from the
sidewalk in front of their stores, picked up the discarded coffee
cups and breakfast leftovers and waited for customers, most of whom
no longer come, the shop owners said, because of the crowds of day
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get someone driving up in a station wagon, they get
mobbed, even if there are kids in the back seat,'' said the owner
of a small shop in the middle of the block. ``The workers think it
might be a job offer. But the drivers get frightened. I'm afraid
someday someone's going to get run over.''
</P>
<P>
   He would speak only on condition of anonymity, he said,
``because I don't want a brick through my window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I begrudge any of them a job,'' he added. ``My
own parents were immigrants. I know what these men are feeling. But
all this is ruining my business, and no one seems to want to help
solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Town of Hempstead, which includes this small middle- and
low-income suburban community, tried three years ago to set up a
hiring station on a parking lot at a nearby public park that has
public rest rooms. But residents living near the park resisted the
move, and town officials backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Town Supervisor Frank P. Petrone tried again last year to
convert a parking lot into a hiring station, but that effort, too,
was defeated. He has said he has another site in mind, but several
calls to his office seeking details were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The curbside hiring problem has repeated itself in scores of
communities across Long Island with growing immigrant populations,
officials said. Most of the day laborers are Hispanic, and the
officials say the number of Hispanic residents may have doubled
since the 1990 census, which showed 200,000 Spanish speakers in a
total population of 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County Legislature tried recently to resolve the
issue with a proposal that would have made it illegal for
contractors to solicit the workers on public roads between 5 a.m.
and 11 a.m. under penalty of up to $1,500 in fines and three months
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was defeated at a meeting of the Legislature in
Riverhead on Tuesday attended by nearly 100 Latino protesters.
Among those who voted against the bill were Maxine Postal, the
Democratic majority leader, and Paul Tonna, a Republican whose
district includes Huntington Station.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cohen, a legislative aide to Tonna, said that all the towns
in Suffolk were keeping an eye on Huntington. ``If they can work
out a solution, perhaps it can be applied elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Postal was among the lawmakers who questioned the bill's
constitutionality. ``No one wants to put these men out of work,''
she said. ``The best way to solve this is for the workers, the
employers and leaders of the local communities to come together and
set up a hiring hall.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that such a location had been set aside by the city of
Glen Cove in Nassau County. A similar solution has been in place in
Inwood for more than three years, according to Nadia Marin-Molina,
a lawyer and the executive director of the Workplace Project, a
support group in Hempstead for Hispanic workers. She said that she
had offered to help officials in other towns, but that none had
gotten in touch with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem that affects all those involved, including the
workers. They, like everyone else, would like to work out a
solution,'' she said. ``It's a matter of working together and
overcoming distrust and fears.''

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Lashanda Washington was a street-smart,
fight-hardened girl of 16, riding a city bus home from school, when
she saw the face that she had been dreaming about for years.
</P>
<P>
   The woman boarding the No. 14 looked older than the one who had
long stalked her fading childhood memories. She was thin like an
addict and bloated like a drinker. She was scarred like a fighter
and worn like a pauper. She was as beautiful as anyone Ms.
Washington had ever seen. The girl's heart nearly exploded from the
rush of fear and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my mama?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my daughter?'' the woman replied.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Ms. Washington traded a foster mother she had
never liked for the troubled mother she scarcely knew. She helped
her mother find an apartment, worked two jobs for a while to pay
the rent and worried her way through the alcoholic storms that
battered her mother each day.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Ms. Washington is a single mother herself,
swept up in the vast migration off the nation's welfare rolls. And
like countless other young central-city women, she has found her
efforts to build a new life complicated by family bonds more
powerful than many policy-makers understand.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, her mother, Linnie Washington, remains in her care, where
she is at once a cherished matriarch, a wellspring of solace and a
source of almost daily sabotage. She mocks her daughter's attempts
to work, blames her for her own drinking, and locks her out of the
house. Yet nothing seems to diminish the fidelity she receives in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama is like everything to me,'' the younger Ms. Washington
said. ``I love my mama to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving a troubled relative to death, a struggle often forgotten
in policy forums, is one of the most common situations poor women
face when leaving the welfare rolls. Loyalties to the job often
conflict with loyalties at home. Addicted sisters, imprisoned
brothers, needy cousins and aunts _ the great national drive from
welfare to work winds through a forest of familial distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Now 20, Lashanda is an energetic, resilient woman who weds
earnestness with streetwise flamboyance. She said she was eager to
escape ``all that ghetto stuff'' that has followed her all her
life, and sometimes she tries to break free. She can land jobs
quickly. She can charm people in positions of authority. She talks
of becoming a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   As Lashanda has landed and lost jobs over the last five months,
her mother, by her own account, has staggered drunk in the street
and been hit by a car; checked into a psychiatric ward; weathered
immobilizing outbreaks of herpes; and started many days crying
aloud that she fears she is dying. Lashanda said her mother grew so
angry when she refused to buy her cocaine that she cut the phone
line with a butcher knife.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping work to keep watch at home, Lashanda has found herself
trapped in irreconcilable roles: breadwinner, daughter, confidante,
playmate, social worker, nurse and cop. She wakes her mother and
chides her to eat; buys her beer when she gets the shakes, and
searches the alleys when she disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is not the only obstacle between Lashanda and steady
work. She lost her chance at one job when she tested positive for
marijuana. She quit another because she did not like the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washington began 1999 at the Academy of Excellence, a
two-week course that tries to prepare poor women for a post-welfare
life. Five months later, its graduates could fill a book with
stories of family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Pettigrew was one of the most earnest students and the
first to find work, as a receptionist at the academy itself. Then
her sister's body was found in a melting snowbank. Distraught, Ms.
Pettigrew left the job.
</P>
<P>
   Even the academy's most celebrated graduate has faced family
conflicts. After landing her first job in years, Michelle Crawford
was invited by Wisconsin's governor, Tommy Thompson, to take part
in his annual legislative address. Thompson later acknowledged he
had no idea of the conflicts still rocking her home: a jealous
sister, a violent husband, a son arrested for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Lashanda Washington had not seen her mother for years when they
collided on the bus. But it took her just two weeks to persuade a
court to let her mother go home. Soon Lashanda's sister, Tashanda,
then 13, ran away from her foster home and joined the reunion. Her
mother drank. Her sister fought. Lashanda herself could be quick
with her fists. Over the next three years the Washingtons moved
five times, chased by landlords, neighbors and police.
</P>
<P>
   As a 16-year-old family boss, Lashanda worked long shifts at
McDonald's to pay the rent, and took a second job at a grocery
store. She had a son in the spring of her junior year and left
school that fall. Her son's father left her. Her apartment caught
fire. She ran through four jobs in eight months. Then she took a
step that offended her pride in herself as a worker: She applied
for welfare. ``I was depressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ``Academy of Excellence'' is two classrooms on Martin Luther
King Jr. Drive, in the heart of Milwaukee's welfare district. It is
the first stop for people seeking benefits from YW-Works, one of
five private agencies hired by the state to run the welfare program
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's strict new system, virtually everyone
receiving cash assistance must join a work program. Before
receiving a work assignment, academy students spend two weeks
studying life's basic arts: negotiating with the gas company,
avoiding domestic violence, securing birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Paczesny, a counselor at YW-Works, said family conflicts
were nearly universal among her clients, with a mother's drug abuse
among the most common afflictions. Oldest daughters in particular,
she said, often grow deeply invested in their identity as the
family caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the number of women we see who will stay at
home, essentially to keep their moms under lock and key,'' she
said. ``They know their moms are dope-dating, bringing men into the
house. And if it's not the moms, it's a sister or another close
relative. They feel if they don't take care of them, nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   Though recipients can lose $5.15 for every hour of work or class
they miss, policy is no match for biology. ``The parent-child bond
is more profound than any work program we have,'' Ms. Paczesny
said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, when Lashanda finished the academy, her
instructor put a note in her file: ``Excellent student. Tries hard.
Home situation is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the academy, Lashanda was sent to sort hangers at
a factory and to study for her high school degree. But her mother's
drinking was on the rise. So were her reprisals when Lashanda
refused to buy beer or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One Friday afternoon, Lashanda raced home from the factory after
her mother collapsed at the stove. On Sunday, Linnie was hit by a
car. On Monday, Lashanda was supposed to start training as a
nurse's assistant. Instead, she spent the morning urging her mother
to sober up and seek care for her untreated bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Penalized for missing work and class, Lashanda saw her welfare
check dwindle to $286 in May, from a possible $673. She quit
welfare and worked for a few weeks through a temporary employment
agency. By the end of May, she fell ill with anemia and stopped
working on doctor's orders. She got by on food stamps and $981 of
overdue child support from her son's father.
</P>
<P>
   When she is sober, Linnie acknowledges her problems. ``My kids
always tell me to go to treatment, but I'm hard-headed,'' she said.
``They said I might die because I'm drinking myself to death. My
kids love me, and I'm trying to show back the love I lost from
them. I'm playing catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke gratefully of Lashanda's devotion. ``She acts like
she's a social worker,'' she said. ``She'll sit me down and say,
`Ms. Washington, you ain't supposed to ...' Can't hide nothing from
that child.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps saying more than she intended, she added, ``She loves me
too much.''

JOHN STEARS, 64, SPECIAL-EFFECTS DESIGNER FOR FILMS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Britain)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Stears, the father of James Bond's lethal Aston Martin, the
Jedi Knights' light sabers, the endearing robots R2-D2 and C-3PO,
and a host of other ingenious movie gadgets and special effects,
died on Monday at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was
64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Brenda. He had homes in
Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire,
England, where the couple raised cattle and bred show dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded in the movie industry as the dean of special-effects
artists, Stears added his inventions and calamities to the first
eight James Bond thrillers, won an Oscar in 1965 for
``Thunderball,'' and shared a special-effects Academy Award in 1977
for ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Stears was chosen to create the special effects for
``F/X'' (shorthand for special effects), which dealt with the
adventures of a special-effects artist much like himself.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Klein, a professor at California Institute of the Arts
who is working on a history of special effects, said Stears played
an important role in the transition from industrial to computer
technology in the making of films.
</P>
<P>
   ``He continued the spark that started the technological wizardry
that gave birth to cinema itself,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   A master of fiery car crashes, ear-splitting detonations and
miraculous escapes, Stears created some of the most famous scenes
in the movies. He blew up the villain's Jamaican hideout at the end
of ``Dr. No'' (1962), and for ``Goldfinger'' (1964) he created
Agent 007's celebrated Aston Martin DB5, featuring bulletproof
windows, revolving license plates, forward-firing machine guns, a
rear oil-slick dispenser and a passenger-side ejector seat.
</P>
<P>
   He also touched off an avalanche for ``On Her Majesty's Secret
Service'' (1969), built flying cars for the musical film ``Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang'' (1968) and the Bond film ``The Man With the
Golden Gun'' (1974). For George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' (1977), he
dreamed up R2-D2 and C-3PO, Luke Skywalker's land-speeder
hover-car, laser-powered light sabers and the Death Star spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   In ``F/X,'' a special-effects man who works on tawdry,
low-budget movies with titles like ``I Dismember Mama'' is
commissioned to fake an assassination. When the character (played
by Bryan Brown) finds his own name on the schedule for elimination,
he fights back with the tools of his trade, including smoke bombs,
a tidal wave of lobsters and an explosive charge wired to an
electric detonator embedded in the walls of a set.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult effect in ``F/X,'' Stears said at the time,
``was having a character who was standing at a window get shot by a
sniper.'' He added, ``The difficulty came because the audience must
see the bullet go through the window and then hit the actor, and
the actor was wearing virtually no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain how the trick was accomplished, he said: ``It
took a long while to work out, and you don't give away secrets.
When you're at the top, you want to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, Stears was critical of both the film industry
and his fellow special-effects practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he declared, ``the whole thing of special effects has
gone too far. In the '50s, special effects patched up a movie as
cheaply as possible. Now, with technicians and directors trying to
outdo previous technicians and directors, things are getting very
unsafe. There have been some horrendous accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Stears noted that even when he made ``F/X,'' he had only one
assistant, while special-effects teams now could have as many as
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much specialization _ miniatures, motion control,
animatronics, prosthetics,'' he continued. ``Old-timers like myself
do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stears was born on Aug. 25, 1934, in Uxbridge, England.
After attending Harrow College of Art and Southall Technical
College, he served in the Air Ministry as a draftsman.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he joined a firm of architects, where he made scale
models of buildings for the firm's clients.
</P>
<P>
   His work brought him to the attention of the film
special-effects expert Bill Warrington, who commissioned him to
build model aircraft for Lewis Gilbert's ``Reach for the Sky''
(1956).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Stears worked for the Rank Organization,
building model boats and aircraft for films like ``The One That Got
Away'' (1957) and ``A Night to Remember'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Stears is survived by two daughters,
Jacqueline and Janet, both of Pacific Palisades and Beaconsfield,
and three brothers, Peter and David, who live in England, and
Andrew of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While Stears was working on the James Bond films, where he
enjoyed having a free hand in dreaming up gadgets to get Bond out
of trouble, at least one of his inventions never left the drawing
board. He designed a mechanism for Bond's super-automobile that
would fling three-pronged nails behind it to discourage pursuers.
Scotland Yard officials asked that the device not be used in the
film for fear that it might inspire real-life criminals.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ There it is, in my T-shirt drawer, one of my
favorite gamers. Some artist did a fine job reproducing both the
Stars and Stripes and the Brazilian flag with that other-worldly
white globe, and a soccer ball floating in between.
</P>
<P>
   In bright red capital letters it says: ``STANFORD WORLD
SOCCER,'' and the date is July 4th _ 1994, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I bought the T-shirt at a stand operated by one of the Stanford
clubs or teams. I wear it only for quality outdoor workouts in good
weather; it's much too beautiful to waste under a sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day Tab Ramos' eye socket was bashed in by an ugly
elbow from Leonardo, an otherwise reputable Brazilian regular. That
was the day the United States could not mount an offense even after
Leonardo was banished with a red card, and was beaten, 1-0, in the
men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that fledgling capitalists at Stanford will be
vending more T-shirts Sunday just like my precious souvenir. All
they would have to do is change the year to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Stanford will be jumping, and the T-shirts will
commemorate the semifinal of the Women's World Cup, an event
gathering momentum every hour, now that Americans are getting a
glimpse of the four semifinalists, their skill, their charisma.
</P>
<P>
   There is one major difference between 1994 and 1999, however:
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Americans are Brazil, and the Brazilians are
America.
</P>
<P>
   By that I mean the American women are the core of their sport _
the first World Cup champions in 1991, the gold medalists at the
1996 Summer Games, and now the magnet for the 600,000-plus tickets
the organizers have hawked.
</P>
<P>
   They are the center of the universe, at least until kickoff
against the Brazilian women, who are being plucked from the
hillside slums, who are learning the national game, who are the
face of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have been at this sport seriously for only a
decade, but they now have the backlog of instinct and technique
just like the Brazilian men. The way it is with dynasties, they
kill you with their depth.
</P>
<P>
   The early Brazilian men's champions were slightly more dependent
on Pele than this American women's team is carried by Mia Hamm, but
soccer is a total team game, with superb players controlling their
own sector, making the stars look good.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of gigantic corporate marketing hype, Ronaldo was
set up to be the star of the 1998 World Cup, but the most
indispensable player on that runner &UR; - &LR; up Brazil team was Roberto
Carlos, the chunky dynamo with his powerful kicks from offensive
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   This American women's team is as deep, as subtle, as those good
Brazilian men's teams. Hamm was badgered by an excellent German
defender Thursday night; that is part of her job description. For
all the soap opera of the goal scorers, we have not yet mentioned a
player who helped turn around Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Just as grim, flat-topped Dunga was the glue to the 1994
Brazilian men, so Michelle Akers, she of the lion's mane and
similar nature, is the ferocious core of the American women.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about Akers' injuries and her continuing
struggle with chronic fatigue syndrome. She has been moved back, a
logical move for a weary 33-year-old, but on Thursday, when the
Yanks fell behind early, she insinuated her tall, reconstructed
body in the scrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to bang some heads _ get more physical and take
control of the game _ so I took it upon myself to make some
statements in hopes of firing up the team,'' Akers said Friday,
feeling refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th minute, Akers took a header that sailed high, a
warning that the old lady was up front. A minute later, her hard
shot was deflected by a defender, the ball squirting to Tiffeny
Milbrett (who really grows on you, game by game), who directed it
into the net. In the 30th minute, Akers was back on defense,
booting a dangerous ball into the sixth row, to buy some time. A
minute later, she headed the ball upfield. Akers was also whacked
around a few times, nothing new there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have to take her out at halftime,''
coach Tony DiCicco said Friday, ``but it got a little cooler, and
she is an incredible competitor. I thought she was stronger in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   That night he had said, ``If you want to see guts personified,
there's Michelle Akers.'' And he added, ``One word that comes to
mind every time I think of Michelle Akers, and it's `Champion.'''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Akers will be a literal champion
again. The Brazilian men do not win all the time, and besides,
either Norway or China will be in the women's final.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, it is Brazil against the United States, five years
later. All you vendors on the Stanford campus, I want to buy an XL
T-shirt, one with the Stars and Stripes and that Brazilian globe on
it.

ADMIRAL ISAAC KIDD, 79, EXPERT ON MARITIME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio, Md., Ore., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. Isaac Campbell Kidd Jr., who capped a 40-year Navy career
by becoming an authority on the law of the sea, died on June 27 at
his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said a spokesman for the John M.
Taylor Funeral Home in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd retired in 1978 as commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet
and supreme commander of NATO forces in the Atlantic. He then put
his expertise to work for various public agencies in Washington,
lectured widely on maritime law in the United States and abroad and
taught a course on the subject at the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 years of sea duty, he commanded destroyers, destroyer
divisions and Navy fleets in the Mediterranean, the Pacific and the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of materiel at the Pentagon in the early 1970s, he
oversaw Navy procurement, logistics and labor relations and
supervised 350,000 uniformed and civilian personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, who was known as Ike, was born into a Navy family
in Cleveland and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, at
Annapolis, in 1942. His father, Rear Adm. Isaac Kidd Sr., was
killed in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941,
aboard his flagship, the battleship Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As a newly commissioned officer, Kidd was assigned to convoy
duty in the North Atlantic. He later served as a gunnery officer
aboard a destroyer in the Allied landings in Sicily and Italy, and
finished the war in the Pacific theater.
</P>
<P>
   He received his first destroyer command shortly after the war
ended, and then alternated between sea and shore assignments before
becoming a full admiral in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd led an inquiry into the Israeli attack on the U.S.
intelligence ship Liberty in the Mediterranean off the Sinai
Peninsula during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, an attack that killed
34 officers and men and wounded 171 others. Israel said the Liberty

SPORTS COLUMN: SAMPRAS, WHO NEVER WENT AWAY, VS. AGASSI, WHO'S BACK
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The pigeon appeared just about the time Tim
Henman was trying to prove he wasn't one himself. Pete Sampras,
down a set, on serve at 4-3 in the second, was beginning to find
the range. Naturally, the bird landed on Henman's side of the
scarred lawn, and scampered about, like a bouncing volley, from the
ball boy's clutches.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Court partisans thought this funny, failing to note
the ominous sign, that Henman was about to assume the role. He
barely held serve in the eighth game. He double-faulted on set
point in the 10th game. He lost his first service game in the third
set and Sampras was soon back in his accustomed position, the
Wimbledon final, where he will find Andre Agassi, that strangest of
tennis birds.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits have had to endure English pigeons for decades, which
is why the local sports pages have been overdosing on Henman, along
with the cricket results against New Zealand. Forget the Women's
World Cup _ unfortunately, it's only a rumor here.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the stunning news regarding Alexandra Stevenson and
her newly identified biological father, we might as well be talking
about Dr. Kevorkian. The tabloids prefer the local hook, and
Michael Douglas happens to be running around town with a British
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevenson angle died, anyway, when Lindsay Davenport crushed
the 18-year-old qualifier Saturday in straight sets, to set up a
women's final against the seven-time champion, Steffi Graf. That's
three Americans, including an all-Yank men's final, on the fourth
of July. ``An experience, a good scene,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge for American tennis,'' Agassi said, in a serene, almost
dream-like state, after wearing out Pat Rafter from the baseline in
straight sets. ``It was starting to get discouraging not having the
American guys at the end of these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is going for a men's record sixth Wimbledon and a
record-tying 12th Grand Slam title against Agassi, the all-time
champion of reinvention. Until Agassi appeared in maybe the best
shape he's ever been in and won the French Open last month, people
had every right to believe he was done as a serious Grand Slam
threat. Now the baseline slugger with the happy feet, long known by
some colleagues as Andre Boy, seems, at 29, to have finally become
a man.
</P>
<P>
   His athletic bar mitzvah occurred two years ago on the
Challenger Circuit, or the tennis bush leagues. That's where Agassi
went to re-learn the art of competing, of caring, at the time his
career was a boulder on the edge of a cliff. The results are
present and accounted for in his media guide profile, right there
with his victories in each of the Slams: runner-up in Las Vegas, to
Christian Vinck. Winner in Burbank, over Sargis Sargsian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of great memories throughout my career and I have
to say playing the Challengers are some of them,'' Agassi said.
``It reflected a time in my career that I was making a statement,
not only to everyone, but to myself that it was something really
important to me, that I still wanted to play. In hindsight, I'm
proud I went through it, but I don't advise it to anybody. It's a
long way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the role of the villainous gunslinger against Henman is
one thing. But it has to rankle Sampras how Agassi has been able to
drop in and out and back into contention, with people always so
doggone thrilled to have him back. Sampras, meanwhile, has kept his
nose to the grindstone, dropping Grand Slam victories into his
tennis bag as he would his racquets. He's finished the last six
years as No. 1 in the ranking, but it was as if Agassi turned the
light back on in American men's tennis by winning the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else to say outside I have a hard time
believing it still,'' Agassi said, playing right into the
myth-makers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   What Agassi's latest emergence suggests is that the computer
rankings _ Sampras starts Sunday as No. 1 but won't be after it's
over, win or lose _ should be junked. Before departing Wimbledon
for the rest of his life, Boris Becker said the one thing he would
most want changed is the indecipherable system that makes
globetrotting drones of players, more concerned with compiling
points than with entertaining fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander, among others, did most of their winning before 25. These
aren't team-sport athletes, who began serious play at 14 or 16.
Bouncing on and off the tour, the way Agassi has for years, makes
perfect sense for a man in his 20s whose life has been spent
``striking the ball with conviction,'' to borrow an Agassi-ism from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, it turns out, wasn't wasting his talent as much as he
was unwittingly preserving it. Is it really seven years since he
won this tournament and fell face down in the grass, apparently on
his brother's cue? The Agassi who dismissed Rafter and takes aim at
Sampras' serve on Sunday is better than the one who outlasted Goran
Ivanisevic. Good as Sampras is on grass, there have been recent
signs of slippage, though he hasn't quite sunk to the level of his
first pro match against Agassi, a decade ago in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-one, 6-1, he couldn't hit a ball in the court,'' Agassi
said. ``I thought he stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' Sampras agreed. ``Believe me, I wasn't very good at
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   They've come a long way since then, on different paths, and here
they are. The Wimbledon final, on the fourth of July. No pigeons on
Center Court on Sunday.

JOSEPH WHEELWRIGHT, 93, A DISCIPLE OF JUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Maine)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Wheelwright, a driving force behind the spread of Jungian
psychoanalytic teaching, died on June 22 at a convalescent home in
Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Wheelwright asked Jung for his blessing in establishing
an institute to teach and certify Jungian analysts. In a story that
has become part of the lore of the profession and that was often
told by Wheelwright, Jung, who deplored overorganization, replied,
``If you have an organization, make it as disorganized as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wheelwright had his own ideas. In San Francisco, he founded
a well-structured, democratic Jungian institute, which preceded
similar teaching institutes in London, in Zurich, Switzerland, and
elsewhere around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a major figure in the dissemination of Jung's ideas,''
said Dr. John Beebe, the president-elect of the C.G. Jung Institute
of San Francisco, who was a student and close colleague of
Wheelwright.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst who died in 1961, began his
career as a Freudian but broke with Freud when Jung emphasized that
basic human drives are rooted not only in sex but also in the
emotionally charged symbols, images and themes in fantasies,
dreams, delusions and myths.
</P>
<P>
   It was while traveling the world in the early 1930s that
Wheelwright and his wife, the former Jane Hollister, met Jung in
Zurich. In 1932 they both entered analysis with Jung.
</P>
<P>
   That experience led Wheelwright to attend St. Bartholomew's
Medical College in London. He graduated in 1939, meanwhile
remaining in analysis with Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in San Francisco, Wheelwright taught for 30 years at
the Langley-Porter Psychiatric Institute at the University of
California San Francisco Medical Center, which became a leading
psychiatric training institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelwright, who was born on June 6, 1906, in Boston, graduated
from the Milton Academy and dropped out of Harvard College after
his third year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Wheelwright was elected president of the International
Association for Analytical Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelwright is survived by his wife, who lives on the
Wheelwright ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.; a daughter, Lynda
Schmidt, of Brooklin, Maine, and a son, John, of Point Reyes
Station, Calif.

CONSTANCE SHACKLOCK, 86, MEZZO-SOPRANO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Constance Shacklock, an English mezzo-soprano who made more than
500 appearances at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden between
1946 and 1956, and then undertook a second stage career in musical
theater, died on Tuesday. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shacklock was born in Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham, and
studied voice at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She made her
debut at Covent Garden in a 1946 production of Purcell's ``The
Fairy Queen,'' and quickly proved herself an invaluable member of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly renowned for her portrayal of Brangaene, in
Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' a role she first sang at Covent
Garden in 1948. Her performances as Amneris in Verdi's ``Aida,''
Queen Elizabeth I in Britten's ``Gloriana,'' Herodias in Strauss'
``Salome'' and Magdalene in Wagner's ``Meistersinger'' were also
highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   She also made frequent concert appearances, and was known both
for her rendering of the Angel's music in Elgar's ``Dream of
Gerontius,'' and for her rousing performances of ``Rule Britannia''
and ``Jerusalem'' at the annual summer music festival called the
Proms. The highlight of her career in musical theater was a
six-year run as the Mother Abbess in the London production of ``The
Sound of Music,'' starting in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shacklock was a professor at the Royal Academy of Music from
1968 to 1984, and became president of the Association of Teachers
of Singing in 1995. Among her awards was the Order of the British
Empire, which she received in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Jean Tredaway.

FOR ENGLAND'S BOARDMAN, RAIN IS THE ENEMY AS TOUR BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE PUY DU FOU, France _ The eight other riders in his Credit
Agricole team were out training on back roads all over the Vendee
region, but Chris Boardman was interested in only a small stretch
of pavement. It measures 6.8 kilometers, or about 4 miles, and he
pronounced it acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as bad as I thought,'' Boardman, an English rider, said
Friday after he had returned from his reconnaissance of the course
for the prologue that opened the 86th Tour de France on Saturday.
``Apart from one climb, one hurdle to get over, it's perfect.
Beautiful surface, too, no real hard turns, nothing technical.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Unless, of course, it rains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman is the king of the prologues, both in the Tour and
other races. The world record-holder in the one-hour race against
the clock (35 miles), he has the perfect aerodynamic position, the
focus and the power to dominate these solitary races _ unless it
rains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he went all out in a rainy Tour prologue in Brittany,
skidded on a turn and crashed, fracturing his right leg and heel
and ending his season. The next year, when the race started in rain
again, this time in the Netherlands, he rode conservatively and was
happy with a top 10 placing.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for the prologue is possible rain, which
would be welcome to everybody roasting in 90-degree heat except
Boardman. ``That crash left definite scars on my time-trialing
ability in the rain,'' he said. In dry conditions, he won the Tour
prologues, and the overall leader's yellow jersey at the start, in
1994, 1997 and 1998. ``On paper I'm the favorite,'' he said, not
immodestly. ``But I'm trying not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boardman has often been accused of overthinking a race. Last
year, at the start in Dublin, Ireland, he spoke despairingly of his
chances beforehand, then won easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprised everybody,'' he said, ``myself most.''
</P>
<P>
   The course here, in farm country just outside the medieval town
of Le Puy du Fou, was used in the prologue of the 1993 Tour, a race
Boardman missed because he had not yet turned professional. The
winner that time was Miguel Indurain, the Spaniard who won five
consecutive Tours from 1991 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On a dry course, Indurain, known then as Big Mig, stormed to a
clocking of 8 minutes 12 seconds 67 hundredths, or 49.8 kilometers
an hour (31 mph). He was 8 seconds faster than his runner-up, Alex
Zuelle, a Swiss then with the ONCE team in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Zuelle is a starter this year under new colors. He moved from
the Festina team and a seven-month suspension for doping to Banesto
in Spain, replacing as its leader Abraham Olano, who moved to ONCE.
(A hefty pay raise comes with each step in these musical chairs and
both men are now near the top salary of $2 million annually.)
</P>
<P>
   Olano and Zuelle are among the favorites in the overall Tour and
the prologue, too, since they perform in time trials almost as well
as Boardman and climb much better than he does. Others with good
chances in the prologue include Lance Armstrong and Bobby Julich,
two Americans who are also among the overall favorites in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   That list does not include Boardman, whose weakness in the high
mountains is well documented. He has other goals. One is the time
trials, 56.5 kilometers (35 miles) in Metz on July 11 and 57
kilometers in Futuroscope on July 24, the day before the Tour ends
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are flat,'' he said, ``and could suit me.'' Both are also
almost exactly the distance he covered in setting the world hour
record in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to make the scene. Last year he crashed and
dropped out with injuries on the second daily stage in Ireland, and
he has not finished a Tour since 1996. ``That's one of my goals
this year,'' he said. ``Finishing.''

ALBANY DEBATES PLAN TO FORCE TREATMENT ON THE MENTALLY ILL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Spurred by a succession of violent attacks
committed by people with schizophrenia, lawmakers are moving closer
to an agreement on a plan that would give the courts new powers to
force the mentally ill into treatment against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The plan being considered by legislative leaders from both
parties would allow judges to hospitalize people temporarily if
they have a history of violence or have been hospitalized before
for mental illness and have refused to follow their prescribed
treatment, aides involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 states have involuntary treatment statutes. The plan
being considered in Albany could affect as many as 4,000 people a
year, mostly those who are able to function well while being
treated in a hospital but who fail to take their medicine once they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been attacked by some advocates for the mentally
ill, but negotiators for Gov. George Pataki and Democratic
legislative leaders say they have reached agreement on the general
outlines of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the officials say two main questions are still in
dispute. The first is whether the state would oversee and pay for
medicine, counseling and other treatment ordered by the courts. The
second is whether judges would have the power to fine or send to
prison a mental patient who refused to follow a court's orders for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have been delayed by a protracted fight over the
state budget, which is now nearly 100 days late. Legislative
leaders have said there will be little movement on other issues
until a new budget is passed. ``A lot of progress has been made,''
said James McGuire, the counsel for Pataki. ``We're hopeful that
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to enact an involuntary treatment law has been prompted
by years of concern among some mental health experts and ordinary
citizens about mentally ill people on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have been heightened by several recent incidents,
particularly two instances of strangers being shoved in front of
New York City subway trains this year. In each case, the defendant
is a schizophrenic man who had not taken medication. In one case
the victim died, and in the other his legs were cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the legislative proposal say it does nothing to
address a more fundamental problem. They contend that the state has
failed to provide adequate finances for community-based programs,
such as supervised housing and intensive case management, which
they say would help the most seriously mentally ill and also
protect the public. The critics note that the defendant in the
fatal shoving incident, Andrew Goldstein, had tried to get help
before the attack occurred, only to be turned away repeatedly by
the state's mental health system.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal contend that it is often the only way
to deal with mental patients who are so gravely ill that they
refuse to follow treatment orders. ``The solution we are seeking
keeps the streets safer and keeps the mentally ill safer,'' said
D.J. Jaffe, a board member of the Treatment Advocacy Center in
Manhattan, which supports the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Under current New York law, mentally ill people can be
involuntarily committed briefly in hospitals or longer in mental
institutions only if a judge deems they are a danger to themselves
or others. That standard has been applied in a variety of ways,
though; one person might be committed for neglecting his basic
needs, and another might be committed for a violent act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the outlines of the proposal, a limited list of people _
including a treatment provider, a family member or roommate of a
mentally ill person _ could ask a judge to order a patient to
comply with treatment or be hospitalized, aides involved in the
negotiations said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Negotiators generally agree on the criteria that must be met
before a court can compel mentally ill people to undergo treatment
or commit them to a hospital temporarily. The proposal would apply
to a mentally ill person who has been hospitalized twice in the
last 36 months or has a history of violence.
</P>
<P>
   It would also allow judges to hold patients who refuse to comply
with treatment orders in a hospital for up to 72 hours to determine
whether they need commitment in an institution. The duration of the
commitment would be the same as what current law provides.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pressing for the legislation to make the state pay
for any court-ordered treatment, a concession to critics of the
bill who say the problem is not so much that mental patients refuse
treatment but that the state's mental-health system is inadequately
financed.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiators for the governor disagree, saying the point of
the legislation is not to provide additional services to mental
patients but to get them to follow the treatment that has already
been prescribed. The governor proposes to make local governments
responsible for overseeing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators also disagree about whether a mental patient should
be held in contempt of court for failing to abide by a treatment
order issued by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan would allow a judge to fine or even imprison a
mental patient who refused to follow a treatment order. Democrats
say that approach essentially makes mental illness a crime.

BRAZIL'S SISSI WILL PUT U.S. ON DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see BRAZIL-SOCCER-REVIEW) 
 (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It did not discourage Sisleide Lima do Amor
when the boys in the streets of Salvador, Brazil, did not want her
to play in their pickup games. Inevitably, she got her way. ``I
owned the ball,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had learned to play soccer using rolled-up socks, oranges,
bottle caps, even the heads of dolls that her parents had bought
for her. Buy her a ball, her father told her mother. Maybe, then,
she will leave the dolls alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 32, she is the leading scorer in the Women's World Cup,
a player of liquid grace and stirring precision on free kicks who
has put Brazil into the semifinals on Sunday against the United
States at Stanford Stadium. China will face Norway in the other
semifinal in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Brazilian players, as her reputation has grown
her name has shrunk. She is known simply as Sissi, a wraithlike
figure who has shaved her head in emulation of her country's
dominant star, Ronaldo, and who wears the No. 10 of her other hero,
Romario.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen minutes into overtime of Thursday's quarterfinal, Sissi
was presented with a free kick 25 yards from the Nigerian goal.
Brazil had lost a 3-0 lead and all of its energy on a muggy night
in suburban Washington, while Nigeria played with a relentless
momentum, its confidence building with each of its three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's playmaker in midfield, Sissi had delivered two assists
in the first half, but she was nowhere to be found in the second.
This is her game, a rhythmic ebb and flow, moments of brilliance
followed by long silences, followed by breathtaking re-emergence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with her left foot, Sissi stopped in a moment of stunning
accuracy what had seemed to be inevitable triumph for Nigeria. Her
free kick curved and dipped wickedly and nicked the upper inside of
the left post, landing in the one spot where the Nigerian
goalkeeper was vulnerable. Brazil had won, 4-3, and Sissi, her
spirit renewed, sprinted around Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, gesturing
for the cameras, pulling her jersey over her head in weary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was her seventh goal of the World Cup _ ``The goal I will
remember most the rest of my life,'' Sissi said.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Brazilian coach, Wilson Oliveira Rica, said: ``For
Brazil, Sissi is the best in the world. For us, Sissi is the queen
of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sissi began the tournament with a hat trick in a 7-1 victory
over Mexico, then added two more goals in a 2-0 victory over Italy.
She even scored one of the goals with her less-reliable right foot,
refuting a coach who had told her ``the only thing my right foot is
good for is getting on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   She contributed her sixth goal in a 3-3 draw with Germany, then
brought salvation for Brazil in the quarterfinals. In a country
where soccer is a secular religion, Sissi's game is built on a kind
of faith that she will be able to deliver what is needed. A
feathery pass, an inexorable goal. She controls the ball as nimbly
as a magician handles quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not feel her for a while, but then she'll make a
dangerous pass or a free kick,'' said Lauren Gregg, an American
assistant coach. ``She doesn't have to be involved in every play.
She's got a great sense of what the game needs. Her free kick
ability is among the best in the world. She can win a game with one
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain, an American defender, said: ``Sissi is doing
for this World Cup what every World Cup needs, providing great
skill and flair. It's something girls can look at and emulate. You
don't have to be an American for young girls to look at her and see
that she's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Fourth of July semifinal comes five years to the day
after Brazil defeated the United States, 1-0, in the second round
of the 1994 men's World Cup at Stanford Stadium. This time,
however, it is the Americans who have the tradition and the favored
status, while emerging Brazil is the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware of the significance of this date,'' Sissi said.
``We are hoping we can achieve the same result as the men did.''
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, she said, she sometimes grew frustrated with the
resistance of the boys and took her ball and ran home. But soccer
remained her game, indoors and out. ``Just about anything in the
house, I was able to break it,'' Sissi said.
</P>
<P>
   By 14, she had moved away from home, living in the dormitory of
a professional club team. Since Sissi joined the national team in
1988, women's soccer has catapulted cultural barriers to social
acceptability. Brazil has a women's league, corporate support from
Nike and salaries of up to $8,000 a month for its top stars.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring one goal at the inaugural Women's World Cup in
1991, Brazil finished fourth at the 1996 Summer Olympics and is
considered the most improved team in the world. Still, the interest
in women's soccer does not approach the hysteria surrounding the
men's team.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zagallo, the coach of the 1998 men's team that lost in the
World Cup final, was ``sitting on a missile,'' said Oliveira Rica,
coach of the women's team. ``I am sitting on a firecracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup is serving as a redemptive tournament for
Sissi, whose future was in doubt after ankle surgery and who was
dumped from her club team, Sao Paulo, after it finished only third
in the 1998 Brazilian championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will shut a lot of people up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was surprised by the attention she has been
receiving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the Brazilian team walked past the White House while in
Washington for the quarterfinals, she said a Chinese man recognized
her and called out her name. It was beginning to rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me his umbrella,'' she said.

BRAZIL'S SISSI WILL PUT U.S. ON DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see BRAZIL-SOCCER-REVIEW)

 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It did not discourage Sisleide Lima do Amor
when the boys in the streets of Salvador, Brazil, did not want her
to play in their pickup games. Inevitably, she got her way. ``I
owned the ball,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had learned to play soccer using rolled-up socks, oranges,
bottle caps, even the heads of dolls that her parents had bought
for her. Buy her a ball, her father told her mother. Maybe, then,
she will leave the dolls alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 32, she is the leading scorer in the Women's World Cup,
a player of liquid grace and stirring precision on free kicks who
has put Brazil into the semifinals on Sunday against the United
States at Stanford Stadium. China will face Norway in the other
semifinal in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Brazilian players, as her reputation has grown
her name has shrunk. She is known simply as Sissi, a wraithlike
figure who has shaved her head in emulation of her country's
dominant star, Ronaldo, and who wears the No. 10 of her other hero,
Romario.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen minutes into overtime of Thursday's quarterfinal, Sissi
was presented with a free kick 25 yards from the Nigerian goal.
Brazil had lost a 3-0 lead and all of its energy on a muggy night
in suburban Washington, while Nigeria played with a relentless
momentum, its confidence building with each of its three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's playmaker in midfield, Sissi had delivered two assists
in the first half, but she was nowhere to be found in the second.
This is her game, a rhythmic ebb and flow, moments of brilliance
followed by long silences, followed by breathtaking re-emergence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with her left foot, Sissi stopped in a moment of stunning
accuracy what had seemed to be inevitable triumph for Nigeria. Her
free kick curved and dipped wickedly and nicked the upper inside of
the left post, landing in the one spot where the Nigerian
goalkeeper was vulnerable. Brazil had won, 4-3, and Sissi, her
spirit renewed, sprinted around Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, gesturing
for the cameras, pulling her jersey over her head in weary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was her seventh goal of the World Cup _ ``The goal I will
remember most the rest of my life,'' Sissi said.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Brazilian coach, Wilson Oliveira Rica, said: ``For
Brazil, Sissi is the best in the world. For us, Sissi is the queen
of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sissi began the tournament with a hat trick in a 7-1 victory
over Mexico, then added two more goals in a 2-0 victory over Italy.
She even scored one of the goals with her less-reliable right foot,
refuting a coach who had told her ``the only thing my right foot is

SAMPRAS-AGASSI OFFERS A GLAMOUROUS WIMBLEDON FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Two men on a history-seeking mission
Saturday chose Wimbledon as the storybook stage to rekindle a
riveting rivalry that had been in remission.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time Wimbledon monarch Pete Sampras, one Grand Slam
title away from catching Roy Emerson's career record dozen, and his
perennial nemesis, Andre Agassi, who zoomed out of oblivion to
capture last month's French Open and Saturday seized Sampras' No. 1
ranking, successfully negotiated their semifinal hurdles Saturday.
They thus earned the privilege of crashing head-on in the final of
the most prestigious Grand Slam tournament in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's an experience I'll never forget, win or lose,''
Sampras said of his imminent clash with the charismatic but erratic
rival he credits with pushing him to become the player who can, if
he stays on track, break virtually every record in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the top-seeded Sampras, who has lost only one
Wimbledon match in seven years and is one victory away from passing
Bjorn Borg to become the only man in this century to collect six
Wimbledons, throttled Britain's Tim Henman, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
After a stiff start, Sampras limbered up his forehand weapon, the
one Agassi irreverently praises as ``obnoxious,'' and took
advantage of a double fault from Henman at set point in the second
set. From then on, he was in control.
</P>
<P>
   In a rematch of last year's semifinal, Sampras again manhandled
his golfing and doubles partner and denied the host nation _ whose
Center Court fans seemed poised to rush the court and smother the
American ingrate with their Union Jacks as the fourth set faded
away _ its first homespun champion since Fred Perry, immortalized
by the statue that guards Center Court, ruled the roost in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the home country will have to settle for statuary while
the United States, which last monopolized Wimbledon's final in
1993, can thrill to the sight of Sampras and Agassi, who have not
squared off in a Grand Slam final since 1995, locking horns for the
first time in a Wimbledon final. And doing it at the respective
ages of 27 and 29, proof positive that at Wimbledon, it's not just
the pampered grass that's evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Sampras, with a raised fist and a meaningful glint
in his eye, put himself in position for the Wimbledon
``three-peat'' he so covets, particularly since his stock at the
three other slam venues has failed to keep pace with this one, than
Agassi continued to stampede through the draw like a raging bull
and used his vaunted return of serve like a vise to crunch
second-seeded Patrick Rafter in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rafter, the U.S. Open's two-time defending champion,
wore his signature white war paint and ponytail, it was Agassi, now
brandishing a 13-match unbeaten streak in majors, who did all the
menacing in their 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was on for him today; he was very powerful with
everything he did,'' said Rafter, who not only failed in his bid
for a first Wimbledon final but also lost his chance to snag the
No. 1 spot. ``It's the best I've seen him serve, very strong from
the baseline, never really gave me a chance to control the points:
I felt like I was never in those points.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the entrepreneur, Agassi promised he and Sampras would
deliver their own special brand of Fourth of July fireworks when
Wimbledon plays host to its first all-American men's final since
Sampras defeated Jim Courier, then the reigning French Open
champion, to win the first of his five titles six years ago. The
way Agassi sees it, both he and Sampras, who leads their rivalry by
13-10, would probably have an extra fistful of major titles had
they not gotten in each other's way over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate each other; we caused a lot of grief for the other
one's career,'' said Agassi, joking, who is 1-2 against Sampras in
Grand Slam finals with a victory at the 1995 Australian Open and
losses at the 1990 and 1995 U. S. Opens. In their only previous
Wimbledon confrontation, Sampras dethroned Agassi, then this Grand
Slam's defending champion, in their 1993 quarterfinal, 6-2, 6-2,
3-6, 3-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who seems to have used the dissolution of his marriage
to Brooke Shields to light a flame under his competitive instincts,
was quick to enumerate the selling points of a Sunday
Sampras-Agassi match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get the luxury of seeing a number of things,''
said Agassi, who thrives on his differences, on and off the court,
from Sampras. ``You get to see contrasts in play, contrasts in
personality, you get to see two guys who have basically grown up
together and have somehow managed to bring out the best in each
other's game. The stage is set: It's time to go out there and not
miss our cue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Agassi missed being a part of occasions like this one,
he demoted himself to the Challenger Circuit in 1997 after falling
to Rafter in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. His ranking dipped
below 100, but his competitive mettle was restoked after he came in
second in a tiny event in his hometown, Las Vegas, and then took
home a title in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advise it to anybody, dropping to 142 in the world,''
Agassi said. ``It's a long way back.''
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to Agassi, who is nothing if not mercurial, to
savor the climb. Last month at the French Open, Agassi's validation
effort became complete when he won his fourth career major at the
only Grand Slam he had never won before. The victory made him the
first man since Rod Laver, and the fifth man in history, to win all
four Grand Slams. Agassi also went into the record books as the
only man to win his slams on three separate surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hung over my head a lot more than just history,'' Agassi
said about his decade of disappointment at the French, where he was
twice a disgruntled runner-up in 1990 and 1991. Here at the All
England Club, where the top world ranking is already his, Agassi
has set his sights on a second Wimbledon title, a feat that would
make him the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to negotiate the
treacherous transition from a championship on red clay to a title
on the most famous lawn in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said, ``Tomorrow is a great day for many reasons, and I
guess I need to stop thinking about the history and start thinking
about what an obnoxious forehand that guy has.''

PRO FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AL; LAWRENCE PHILLIPS
RECONSIDERED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Davis, the Oakland Raiders' managing general partner, turns
70 Sunday. And the NFL is thoughtful enough to have already given
him a birthday present: the league's toughest schedule in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders open at Green Bay and then play at Minnesota. Home
against Chicago. At Seattle. Home against Denver. At Buffalo. Home
vs. the Jets, Miami and San Diego. At Denver. Home against Kansas
City and Seattle. At Tennessee. Home against Tampa Bay. At San
Diego and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Playing four of your first six games on the road is bad enough.
But if the Oakland A's make the baseball playoffs _ unlikely, but
not an impossibility _ the first Broncos game might be played at
Denver and would require five of Oakland's first six games to be on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a nice gesture: Oakland's last two games, both on
the road, will be sandwiched around Christmas and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's 1999 opponents had a .570 winning percentage last
season. The Jets and Tampa Bay face teams with the second-highest
average, .539. Denver, which won the Super Bowl, ranks fourth in
strength of schedule, with its opponents averaging .535. Atlanta,
which lost the Super Bowl, ranks 18th (.492 opponents' average).
</P>
<P>
   For Oakland, an 8-8 team a year ago, it's a very rough road.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday, Al.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Isn't Through
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Phillips is back from Europe and on the minds of a few
NFL teams. Phillips, a running back, had his troubles with the Rams
and Dolphins and was cut before last season. His reputation as a
problem child persists in and out of football.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, though, played well in NFL Europe this spring and NFL
teams are considering whether to give him another shot to see if he
can be the productive, slashing, exhilarating runner he was in
college at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay, whose new coach, Ray Rhodes, could scare Phillips
straight. Baltimore, whose offense under new coach Brian Billick
will be suited for Phillips. Kansas City, which is running-back
starved. Oakland, which has always cradled talented, controversial
players. New England (there is a need, but is there a will?).
Detroit (what if Barry Sanders never shows?) And Minnesota, whose
coach, Dennis Green, collects good players and gets them to produce
for him.

METS MUST MAKE DO WITHOUT FRANCO
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been so long since John Franco was seriously
injured that even his wife, Rose, didn't understand what he was
talking about late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I phoned her and said, `I got hurt tonight,' '' said Franco,
who was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday for the first
time since 1993. ``She thought I blew a save. I said, `No, I'm
really hurt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Franco strained the flexor tendon in the middle finger of his
left hand while delivering a pitch in the ninth inning of a game in
which the Mets trailed the Atlanta Braves by 12-0. He was in the
game only because he had not pitched since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine replaced Franco with infielder Matt
Franco once the pitcher had to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have had Matty start the ninth, as it turns out,''
Valentine said. ``I had the wrong Franco start the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Franco did not second-guess the decision to use him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to pitch,'' he said. ``I pitched Monday in a 10-4
game. It could have happened in a 2-1 game, too. It's just bad
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing is especially bad considering that the Mets were
facing two more games with the Braves, four games with the Expos
and then three with the Yankees next weekend leading into the
All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-throwing Armando Benitez will assume Franco's role as
closer. Dennis Cook, Turk Wendell and Greg McMichael will probably
share Benitez's setup role. And the left-handed Rigo Beltran was
called up from Class AAA Norfolk to take Franco's place on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who has 416 saves in his career _ second in major league
history _ had converted 19 of 20 save opportunities this season and
was tied for third in the league at the time of the injury. That
performance had given him the hope that he would be named to the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had an outside chance,'' said Franco, a four-time
selection, the last time in 1990. ``But I thought I had an outside
chance the last four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco will wear a splint on the finger for the next four or
five days. He will also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test,
probably Tuesday, once the swelling goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Franco said the injury was similar to one Bret Saberhagen had
with the Mets in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I cracked my knuckle,'' Franco said. ``It was a
pop like that. I can't bend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been worse,'' he said. ``It could have been my
arm or my elbow. But it's still part of pitching. It's still my
pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' he said. ``It's frustrating. You
just scratch your head. The doctors said it will be seven to 10
days before I can pick up a ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   Or sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Franco said he had to turn down a number of fans' requests late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `What about your other hand?' '' Franco said. ``I
said, `I'm left-handed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So is Beltran, who arrived at Shea shortly before game time
Saturday _ with a shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will move up a little toward the end of the game,''
Valentine said, meaning his other relievers.

<P>
   The first three years with them, the Colts went 9-7, 4-12 and
8-8. Dark days. No playoffs. By 1995 Emtman was gone due to injury,
but Coryatt remained and the Colts saw some sunshine. They scooted
to a 9-7 record and a spree in the playoffs that put them in the
American Football Conference championship game. Indianapolis lost
to Pittsburgh, 20-16, a gnawing defeat one game away from the Super
Bowl. But finally, it seemed, Coryatt and the Colts seemed on the
verge of becoming contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 1996 season, Coryatt tore 20 percent of the muscle
around his left pectoral. Later in the season he ripped his right
pectoral muscle off the bone. In 1997, he injured his left
shoulder, and before last season the Colts released him. Over these
three seasons, the Colts were 9-7 (losing by 42-14 in the playoffs
to Pittsburgh), 3-13 and 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt gained tryouts with Chicago and Dallas last year after
his release. No luck. The shoulder simply was not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   So, Coryatt spent last season out of football. He underwent
reconstructive surgery on his shoulder on Sept. 30 and spent the
fall and off-season in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt turns 29 on Aug. 1. He has played six NFL seasons. And
now, finally, he is ready for his seventh, in Dallas, where he has
already been anointed as the Cowboys' starter at strong-side
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with fortitude,'' Coryatt said recently.
``I've had a rash of injuries and this should be my eighth year. It
will be my seventh if I'm blessed to stay healthy. I have a love
for the game. I've missed it. I was a winner in college and then we
didn't win much with the Colts. And now I'm with a franchise that
is used to playing in Super Bowls. I'm in a place with great
tradition. There is an energy and an attitude here that is
different from most places. I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, Dallas' head coach, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought him in last year, he just couldn't do it,''
Gailey said. ``But then this year we liked what we saw and signed
him right before the draft and now he has been in two minicamps. He
has shown excellent quickness, good instincts to the ball and an
understanding of the game. He is giving us a pass rusher as well as
a nickel pass rusher. He gives us speed at linebacker and we've got
a fast group now that can shrink the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the sidelines don't move. The faster a guy you get, the
more he can overcome mistakes with his speed and get to the ball
carrier and get to loose balls. Quentin is showing all of that and
the intangibles of leadership. We expect him to be here
contributing this year and many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds, said that the way
Dallas wants him to play linebacker allows him to ``get on my horse
and ride.'' At Indianapolis, he played more of an in-the-gap style
on defense. With the Cowboys, he and linebackers Dexter Coakley
(weak side) and Randall Godfrey (middle) will be more mobile,
either in a contain style (the ball carriers are forced to remain
inside the defense) or an underneath style (the linebackers pursue
quickly enough to force the ball carriers to run laterally).
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys report to training camp on July 25. Their first
preseason game is Aug. 9, a Monday night affair against the
Cleveland Browns in the Hall of Fame game at Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey sees questions. When will Deion Sanders, hampered by a
toe injury, be ready? What about Leon Lett: Does the indefinite
suspension he received for violating the league's substance-abuse
policy mean he will be out for the season? Will the offensive line
work now that it has been shuffled, with Larry Allen moving to left
guard and Flozell Adams in his place at left tackle? Will Raghib
Ismail, the free-agent receiver the Cowboys signed, hit the ground
in full stride?
</P>
<P>
   Also, can Coryatt produce another season like the one he had in
Indianapolis in 1995 when he made 163 tackles? And will his
shoulder hold up?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get positive answers to those questions, I like our
team,'' Gailey said. ``If it all falls in place, this is really
going to be a good team with a fun offense to watch. I'm going to
take them that Monday morning before our first preseason game to
the Hall of Fame. I want them to see what has been done and what's
possible. Some of them already know. I'm anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt is more anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that stays away from the game for a year can't wait to
get back,'' he said. ``If you get the chance, especially for a
second time, to enjoy what you do, well, that's what life is all
about.''

HERSHISER'S BEST PITCH: FOR NOW, HIS BRAINBALL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until he joined the Mets this season, the lasting
memory of Orel Hershiser in Shea Stadium was seeing him warm up in
the Dodgers' bullpen as the fourth game of the 1988 National League
Championship Series stretched past midnight into extra innings.
With a record streak of 59 scoreless innings that season, he was
baseball's best pitcher, but the Mets had a 2-1 series lead,
winning both games that Hershiser had started.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers would have waited until their next start, but
there was Hershiser out there in the bullpen that Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Howell had just been suspended,'' he said, referring to
the closer who had been ejected from the third game for having pine
tar on his fingers in a chilly rain. ``I told Tommy Lasorda, `If
you need me tonight, I'll be your Jay Howell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' manager told him, ``No, Bulldog,'' In the
dugout during the 10th inning of a 4-4 tie, Hershiser again
volunteered to go to the bullpen, but Lasorda again told him,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, Hershiser went to the bullpen on his own, warmed up
and told Mark Cresse, the bullpen coach, to inform Lasorda that he
was ready, And in the 12th inning, with two out and the bases
loaded, he preserved a 5-4 victory that squared the series.
</P>
<P>
   When Hershiser blanked the Mets, 6-0, in the seventh game in Los
Angeles, the Dodgers went to the World Series, where his two
victories dominated the Oakland Athletics in five games.
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher has ever had a year quite like Hershiser did then _
23-8 with a 2.26 ERA and those 59 consecutive scoreless innings,
surpassing Don Drysdale's 1968 streak of 56 innings. He had eight
more consecutive scoreless innings in his 3-0 post-season record.
</P>
<P>
   What did he have then that batters couldn't hit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sinking fastball that they knew was coming, but they'd
swing and miss it, or hit it softly,'' he was saying now in the
Mets' clubhouse. ``I had a curveball that was very sharp and was an
above-average major league pitch by itself. I had a four-seam
fastball that didn't sink that I threw to low-ball hitters. And I
had a change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   He had so much faith in his sinking fastball that he threw it
nine out of 10 pitches for ground-ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one went through the hole for a single,'' he said, ``I knew
the next one would be for a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night Hershiser, who was with the Indians and the
Giants the four previous seasons, will take his 8-5 record to the
mound at Shea Stadium in the finale of a three-game weekend series
with the Atlanta Braves. What does he have now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a brain,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   And his brainball is now his best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all those old Dodger pitchers used to come to Vero Beach
for spring training _ Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Johnny Podres,
Larry Sherry, Ron Perranoski _ I'd hear them say, `If I only knew
then what I know now, how good would I have been?' The more I heard
that, the more I wanted to be the youngest, smartest pitcher. I
knew I had to learn myself and learn the game. Some learn one, but
not the other. The combination is where success lies.''
</P>
<P>
   If a pitcher's art is painting the corners of the plate,
Hershiser spoke like an artist selecting colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a palette of pitches,'' he explained. ``From 65 miles
an hour to 100 miles an hour. Extreme movement to erratic movement.
Same speed to changes of speed. And you find winning and losing at
every level. But why do some guys win and some lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll hear pitchers say, `I had great stuff and got shelled,'
but you never hear them say, `I had great location and got
shelled.' So you've got to ask yourself, `Who am I today and how do
I use what's on the palette?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But location isn't the only thing,'' he continued. ``If your
pitches are straight with the same speed, you're going to get hit.
Movement and location are more important. I still have that
knowledge, and I still have the guts to evaluate myself honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do his pitches as a Met compare with his 1988 pitches?
</P>
<P>
   ``My sinking fastball still exists,'' he said, ``but it's not as
dominant. They hit it softly on good days; they hit it hard on bad
days. My curveball is still there, but it's not as precise and
sharp. And now I throw a slider. I still throw the four-seam
fastball, but I need to throw it more to set up the sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the same pitcher, but at 40, he's a winning pitcher
who needs only two victories for 200 as a Hall of Fame candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants, Cubs, Phillies and Marlins talked to me, and some
of them offered me way more than the Mets did,'' he said, alluding
to his $2 million salary with another $500,000 in incentives. ``But
the Mets were the best fit. And the Mets were a good club with a
chance to win, and with a good infield for my sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   And for his brainball.

FORMER COACH KILLED, ATTACKER MAY BE TIED TO STRING OF SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A lone white gunman cruising the streets Friday
evening in a light blue car shot and killed a black former
Northwestern University basketball coach, wounded six Orthodox Jews
and fired upon a car carrying Asian-Americans in what the police
are investigating as possible hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In all, beginning about 8:30 p.m., the authorities said, the
gunman fired at more than a dozen people in six locations within
about 12 miles of one another, beginning in the northern Chicago
neighborhood of Rogers Park and ending in the suburbs of Skokie and
Northbrook.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, described as between 25 and 30 and about six feet
tall, with short brown hair, had not been arrested by midday
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're not jumping to the conclusion that it's a
hate crime,'' said Patrick T. Camden, a spokesman for the Chicago
Police Department. ``All of the elements appear to be there, but
until we get the offender we won't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The former coach, Ricky Byrdsong, 42, was fatally shot in the
town of Skokie, as he was walking near his home with two of his
children. As the family reached an intersection, a blue car drove
by and seven shots were fired. Byrdsong was hit once in the lower
back. His children were not hit.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks had begun south of there about 20 minutes earlier in
Rogers Park, at Chicago's border with Evanston, just west of Loyola
University, with three Orthodox Jews being shot as they left
Sabbath services.
</P>
<P>
   Then two blocks to the north, a fourth was shot.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a fifth victim was shot a few blocks south,
and finally a sixth was injured nearby. One of the wounded was a
15-year-old boy; the rest were adults.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shootings one man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting the same vehicle description,'' said Lt.
Barry Silverberg of the Skokie Police. He described the car as a
light blue Ford Taurus with a large scratch on the rear door on the
driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong died Saturday after surgery at Evanston Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other victims, the 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old
man were hospitalized in serious condition. Two men, ages 31 and
34, were in fair condition. And the other two victims, both age 31,
were treated at a hospital and released. A bullet went through the
clothing of another man, who was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Park is known for its eclectic mix of religions, ethnic
groups and races. It is home to Hispanics, Asians and
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After many years of economic hardship, the economy there is on
an upswing, with a new shopping center and condo conversions in one
of the last affordable neighborhoods along the city's north
lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Park has experienced anti-Semitic attacks before. On a
Friday night in 1994, a Jewish institute was burned and four
synagogues were vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong was fired in 1997 after four seasons with Northwestern,
where he had a record of 34-78, including 10-62 in the Big Ten
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Before Northwestern, Byrdsong was an assistant coach at Arizona,
Eastern Illinois, Western Michigan and Iowa State, where he played
college ball.

CHINA AND NORWAY RENEW SOCCER RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The goalkeeping of China's Goa Hong and the
scoring prowess of Norway's Ann Kristin Aarones will be the key
factors in Sunday's semifinal between the two powerhouses in
women's soccer. The leaping ability of these two players, who were
both doubtful to be in the tournament because of illness and
injury, could very well determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the 10th game between the two teams in a series
that Norway leads by one victory. The game at Foxboro Stadium is
expected to feature China's speed and quickness against Norway's
physical strength and style of long crosses into China's penalty
area with the head of Aarones the target of the long floating
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Aarones had a viral infection that didn't clear up until May and
made the team at the last moment. Goa hurt her back in the 1996
Olympics, which threatened to put an end to her career; but she is
playing with help from a brace she wears around her waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubted whether I was going to be here,'' Aarones said. ``I
played only a couple games before the team was selected. I'm
extremely happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Aarones is the tallest player in the Women's
World Cup. At 6 feet, she has dominated action in the air, scoring
several goals on headers. The 31-year-old Goa has been the best
goalkeeper in the tournament, having allowed just two goals in four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and opponents said Goa's best attribute is her
quickness, but her coach had a lot more to say about Goa, who is
single and envious of her two younger sisters, who are married with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not just the quickest,'' Ma Yuanam, the coach of China,
said about Goa. ``Quickness is just one dimension. She is the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with her quickness and tremendous reflexes, Goa can jump
very high, a trait she cultivated as a youngster because she wanted
to be a point guard in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play basketball because I was not afraid of high
balls,'' Goa said after Friday's practice at nearby Babson College
for the clash against Norway. ``I wanted to be a point guard,'' she
said through an interpreter, ``but I ended up as a goalie in
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the presence of the towering Aarones around her
goal area on set plays like corner kicks would be a distraction to
her, Goa laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can jump high, also,'' she said. ``It's not dangerous for
me,'' she said with a louder laugh before she got serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're physically a strong team,'' Goa said about Norway.
``But we have a defensive system from midfield to defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway has been the most productive team in the tournament with
16 goals in the four games. It is a very well balanced and
experienced team, having reached the semifinals in all three World
Cup tournaments. The Norwegians were also the silver medalists in
the 1966 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Aarones has been the most productive of the Norwegians in this
tournament with four goals, with only Brazil's Sissi and China's
Sun Wen ahead of her with seven and five goals, respectively.
Aarones seems to get the big goal at the most crucial time for
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the timing of Aarones' goals better than the
Americans. She scored the only goal in the 1995 World Cup semifinal
against the Americans, who failed to defend the title they won in
China four years earlier because of that goal by Aarones.
Naturally, the precious goal came on a header.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aarones who also scored the precious first goal in the
elimination of Sweden in the quarterfinals last Wednesday that sent
the Norwegians to their third semifinal in as many World Cup
tournaments. That goal by Aarones also came on a header.
</P>
<P>
   China's coach did not hesitate for a moment to answer the
question as to what makes Norway a dangerous team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 6, and then No. 9 and No. 11,'' Ma said, referring to Hege
Riise, Aarones and Marianne Pettersen, who wear those numbers,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Aarones and Pettersen form a formidable duo of strikers in the
middle of the Norwegian attack. Each can hold the ball well and
wait for the other to make a move into space. Pettersen is right
behind Aarones in scoring with three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Norway has allowed three goals in the tournament, but this time
the Norwegian defense will have to deal with Sun Wen and Jin Yan,
who have combined for eight of China's 14 goals, with Sun scoring
five.

 &HT;    Bush pioneers his way to unprecedented fund raising
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Southern California crowd buzzed into the
Century Plaza ballroom for an evening of coq au vin, chocolate
ecstasy and a less-than-intimate 2,000-person encounter with a
Texan who had their money and wants their votes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bo Derek and Pat Boone. It was many men with women who
might have been their wives but could have been their daughters. It
was a ballroom packed with people who probably could afford more
than the $1,000 price of admission if allowed by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said George W. Bush fund-raising guru Jack Oliver as
the crowd filed in, ``is going to be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   And a fitting end to a wild four months of fund raising that put
Bush, Oliver and campaign finance chairman Donald Evans in the
record books. No candidate has ever come close to raising this kind
of money _ at least $36.25 million since March 7 _ so quickly, so
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   What's the secret, governor?
</P>
<P>
   ``A wonderful personality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joking, but there's no doubt that his charisma and
skill as a campaigner have helped the dollars flow. Even though he
hasn't articulated positions on many issues, many Republicans are
so desperate for a winner after eight years of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore that they are willing to open their checkbooks for a candidate
who is likable, attractive, and good on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other factors. Bush not only inherited his
father's famous name _ no small asset in the fund-raising game _
but his donor lists, as well. That valuable information has helped
him build a fund-raising infrastructure that is sucking up so much
cash that he may skip federal matching money and the spending
limits that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   But some are troubled by the governor's vast sum of money, the
way it was raised, and the possibility that he won't be bound by
spending limits designed to limit the influence of money in
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has raised so much more than everybody else that we face
the specter of the real decision on who the nominee will be is
being made by funders, not by voters. We've never seen that
before,'' said Larry Makinson of the Washington-based Center for
Responsive Politics, which tracks contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is speaking so loud, so early, that it may speak
louder than voters. This thing may be decided long before Iowa and
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising juggernaut is fueled in large part by the
``pioneers,'' supporters who have committed to raising at least
$100,000 apiece, no mean feat considering the $1,000 per person
contribution cap. The Bush campaign won't say how many pioneers
there are, but it has said that 2,500 people promised to raise
$10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush isn't the first to use a pioneerlike system _ the
members of his father's ``Team 100'' each raised $100,000 for the
Republican Party in 1988 _ he has employed it more effectively than
any presidential candidate before him. Democratic front-runner Al
Gore is using a system similar to the pioneers, but his
fund-raisers are aiming to collect $50,000 each, Gore campaign
spokesman Roger Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush folks, wary of having their fund-raising champion
portrayed as the candidate of big money, downplay the importance of
the pioneers. They note that contributions have come from 75,000
people in all 50 states, and that the average donation was $480,
less than half of the $1,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't dollars,'' Evans said of the contributions.
``These are from the hearts of people who love this country and
care about this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is clear that the pioneers are raising vast
sums of money for Bush _ and government watchdog groups fear the
pioneers aren't all doing it to fulfill their patriotic duty.
Meredith McGehee of the Washington chapter of Common Cause said
many Washington lobbyists are eager to ``bundle'' for Bush so that
if he is elected they can call in their chips for special interest
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is you have powerful Washington insiders who
use their Rolodex and say, `George W. is going to be next
president, so you'd be wise to pony up,' '' McGehee said. She also
noted that the group of Americans that can realistically expect to
raise $100,000 from family and friends is an extremely exclusive
one.
</P>
<P>
   So what sort of person is a pioneer? People like Edison Electric
Institute President Thomas Kuhn, who represents the electric
utility industry in Washington. Kuhn, a classmate of Bush's at
Yale, has helped rally many Washington lobbyists behind the
governor. He said some of the lobbyists, and the CEOs of the
companies they represent, have become pioneers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn dismissed the idea that the fund-raisers he has recruited
are expecting political influence or access in exchange for their
services. Kuhn said they are impressed with Bush's ``record of
success'' and the broad appeal he demonstrated in two gubernatorial
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a unifier. I think he's proven that he can work on
bipartisan basis,'' Kuhn said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Bush pioneers are oldtimers with long-standing
family ties. For the first three-month reporting period, the
largest single chunk of cash, more than $172,000, came from donors
with ties to the Houston-based law firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneer at work there is Thomas Marinis, a partner at the
firm and a longtime Bush friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a friend of George Bush since we were little boys,
and a number of our partners here are close friends of his. We, on
our own, got together and raised a lot of money among our partners,
'' he said. ``It is not anything the firm did as a firm.''
</P>
<P>
   An Austin American-Statesman computer analysis of Bush's
contributions during the first three months of 1999 suggests that
longtime family friends are liking the family more and more. As
many as 750 people who gave money to Bush's father in 1992 have
donated money to the governor. But they're being more generous with
the son than they were the father: The elder Bush raised $815,000
from those donors during the entire 1992 campaign, while the
younger Bush was able to collect $712,000 in just three months.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the pioneers have Bush family ties. Gerald Issa of San
Diego, who makes his money making car alarms, is also a Bush
pioneer. An unsuccessful candidate for the GOP U.S. Senate
nomination in California last year, Issa is now dedicating much of
his time to raising money for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled a satisfied smile as the crowd filled the ballroom at
the Hyatt in La Jolla last Tuesday for a Bush breakfast. This, he
said, is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling me up and saying, `How do I get involved.'
I've never had an easier job,'' he said, noting there were about 80
people in the crowd who were on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly lucky,'' said Issa. ``I have 300 members of a
Lincoln Club who are Republicans, Probably 200 of those have
given.''
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the Bush money also are folks who claim to be
making their first go-round in big-time politics. People like
Robert Herbold, who sees life from the lofty perch of executive
vice president and chief operating officer of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush backers were finding their seats at a Silicon Valley
breakfast in Palo Alto last week, Herbold was not shy about talking
about pioneering above and beyond the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   How much did he bring in for Bush?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of what's been reported in the paper this
morning of $36 million, the answer is a fair amount at this
juncture,'' said Herbold, who tags himself as ``a champion in the
northwest part of the country as regards to fund raising'' for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Herbold is among the well-connected whose link to Bush began
before the governor was acknowledging he wanted to be president.
Herbold, who says he has never been politically active, was invited
to Austin by Bush last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an incredible thing to see the public jump so
quickly behind a candidate,'' Herbold said.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, high-techster Steve Papermaster is a pioneer for
Bush. He's been working his business community for nine months as
Bush moved toward a White House race.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster said he has moved ``several hundred thousand
dollars'' Bush's way. It's a simple matter of networking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system works by grass-roots spreading the word, talking to
people, calling people on the phone, sending e-mails,'' said
Papermaster, a host of the Palo Alto event. ``We use a lot of
e-mail. It's a great way to spread the word very, very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   And, so far, very successfully. More than 100 people at the Palo
Alto and San Francisco fund-raisers were there at Papermaster's
invitation. Many committed only to paying the $1,000 entry fee to
give Bush a listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over half of them walked away saying he's our guy,''
Papermaster said. ``He closed the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster is spending a good deal of his time on the Bush
campaign, an effort he said is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like if these other intensely busy executives in
the technology industry are willing to spend the time and energy
that they must feel pretty strongly about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not multilevel marketing, but he said Bush backers tend to
beget more Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Amway,'' said Papermaster. ``It's Bushway.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The American League will announce its starting all-star team
Monday. Do not look for any members of Tom Kelly's kindergarten to
be on it.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is the dean of major league managers, and in his 13-year
tenure with the Minnesota Twins he has won a pair of World Series
championships. But this year he is saddled with his most
inexperienced team, one that has had 10 to 12 rookies on the 25-man
roster at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Teams with a dozen rookies do not think about events like the
All-Star Game or the World Series. They just try to survive and
improve a little while they're at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Kelly said, assessing his team, ``I believe a few
of those young fellas are getting better. They're starting to show
some progress and an understanding of the game. So I'm happy about
that. There's a few who are maybe not showing the progress we would
like to have seen. You'd be very naive to think they're all going
to improve. That's ridiculous. We're not miracle workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has so many rookies that he often fills the outfield and
three-fourths of the infield with them. In the outfield he has Chad
Allen, Torii Hunter and Jacque Jones; in the infield he has Doug
Mientkiewicz at first, Cristian Guzman at shortstop and Corey
Koskie at third.
</P>
<P>
   None of those names has appeared among the top 10 vote-getters
at any position in the all-star voting. The only member of the
Twins who has received enough votes to make the top 10 is Terry
Steinbach, their veteran catcher and chief babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any of the Twins' rookie pitchers be selected for the
game. Mike Lincoln, Dan Perkins, Joe Mays and Benj Sampson can use
the three-day hiatus next week to become bigger names in their own
households.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins are loaded with rookies because their owner, Carl
Pohlad, directed the front office to lower the payroll. Kelly could
have opted out after last season and most likely have moved to a
competitive club, but he chose to remain out of loyalty to his
employer and a desire to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably none of the rookies should be in the big leagues,''
Kelly said in response to a question. ``You could probably make an
argument for Koskie because he played Triple-A last year and did
well. But he wasn't ready to play major league baseball this year
when the season started.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and his coaches are literally providing on-the-job
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The in-depth type stuff that we have to instruct on is
something I probably felt we wouldn't have to do,'' he said. As an
example, he mentioned a session he planned to have with one
outfielder to see ``if we can help him throw the baseball better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once I've heard some coaches comment to former
players, `Come on, this is the big leagues,''' he went on. ``But
it's not the case. I keep explaining to the coaches you have to
instruct them like they're in Triple-A or Double-A; you have to
lower your sights a little.''
</P>
<P>
   In the educational process, Kelly said, he himself has learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that I've made a few mistakes,'' the 48-year-old
Minnesota native said. ``Sometimes I fall into the trap of trying
to get more out of them than maybe they're capable of giving. I
tried hitting and running with a fellow and he didn't hit the ball
five times. He's just not capable of doing it at this time. Maybe
I'll try again later. You have to keep trying as we go along to see
what they can do and can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, not surprisingly, have the worst record in the
American League, but they have not dropped completely out of sight
in the Cleveland-dominated Central Division. They also can point to
their defense, which has committed the fewest errors in the league,
and their pitchers, who are among the leaders in giving up the
fewest walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season seems to be moving along fairly quickly so it must
be good,'' Kelly said. ``When it drags and goes slow, you feel that
kind of effect. So there have to be some good things going on at
times.''
</P>
<P>
   How those good things translate into progress and improvement
for next season could be another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think the Double- and Triple-A players are going to
gain enough knowledge in one year that they're going to be set to
go next year, that's foolish,'' the stoic manager said. ``I don't
think that's going to be the case. I'm sure there will be different
things that happen in the course of a game that we'll have to
learn. You can't have a false sense of security. We'll have to wait
and see what happens, but I don't think it will be all ice cream
and cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least this kind of experience builds character, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' Kelly said. ``It builds gray hair
and ulcers. No, I don't think so. Someone said that a long time ago
and it sounded good so people repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds' Top 10 List
</P>
<P>
   By knocking the Houston Astros out of first place in the
National League Central last week, the Cincinnati Reds were
responsible for abbreviating their own remarkable run. The Reds
played a first-place team in 10 consecutive games, and they won
every game.
</P>
<P>
   Research by the Elias Sports Bureau found that the best previous
run against league or division leaders was six successive
victories, achieved several times, most recently by the Florida
Marlins in 1995, when they beat Colorado and Cincinnati three times
each in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who defeated Arizona three times, Houston four times
and Arizona three times again, ran out of first-place teams to
play. When they began a four-game series Friday night, the Astros
were no longer in first place, courtesy of the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Padres Holding Their Own
</P>
<P>
   Any resemblance between the 1998 Florida Marlins and the 1999
San Diego Padres is purely imaginary. These Padres are not those
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   When the National League champion Padres let Kevin Brown, Ken
Caminiti and Steve Finley leave as free agents last winter, then
traded away Greg Vaughn, they were likened to the Marlins, who in
the interest of money shredded their team beginning a couple of
weeks after winning the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Padres officials argued that the circumstances were not similar
at all and that their players have bolstered their contention. A
franchise-record and major league-high 13-game winning streak has
helped make the Padres' record respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The only streaks the Marlins had that came close to 13 were a
pair of 11-game losing streaks, the first beginning with the second
game of the 1998 season. Their longest winning streak was four
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did not win as many as three games in a row until the
first three games of their remarkable winning streak. Their longest
losing streak has been five games, a number they have reached
twice. The Marlins also had three losing streaks of five games and
one each of six, seven and nine games.
</P>
<P>
   With their 13th consecutive victory last Thursday, the Padres
achieved a .500 record at 38-38. The only time the Marlins reached
.500 last season was in their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Take a Deep Breath
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in the mile-high air of Denver is an undesirable
assignment for most pitchers, but the Colorado Rockies have
suffered another atmospheric ailment.
</P>
<P>
   They obviously could not stand the rarefied air of a winning
record. They climbed above .500 two weeks ago for the first time
this season since their opening game, then proceeded to lose nine
of their next 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring in Double Figures
</P>
<P>
   Runs and home runs are up this season over last, but the figures
are almost exactly the same as for the corresponding period in
1996. In games through June, teams averaged 10.29 runs and 2.28
home runs a game compared with 9.58 and 2.04 last season. But in
1996, teams averaged 10.22 runs and 2.26 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day goes by this season without the scoreboard's
registering at least one huge score. In the past week, the Chicago
Cubs beat Philadelphia, 13-7, then lost to Milwaukee by 17-6 and
19-12. Boston crushed the Chicago White Sox by 17-1 and 14-1, then
lost to Tampa Bay, 11-10 and 12-3.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Randy Johnson about high-scoring games, though. In a
six-day period, Johnson allowed three runs and struck out 31
batters in two games, but lost both because his Arizona teammates
managed a total of one hit _ none against Jose Jimenez of St. Louis
and one against Ron Villone of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   30 Homers? Oh, Well
</P>
<P>
   Had this been a year ago, much fuss would have been made out of
the fact that Sammy Sosa ended June with 30 home runs. Now? It's
ho-hum. Everything is relative, so Sosa's hitting his 30th home run
in the Cubs' 74th game is viewed less excitedly than it was when he
did the same thing last season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago 30 was just about halfway to the home run record. Now
it's five away from being halfway to the home run record. In
addition, Sosa caught everyone's attention last season by hitting a
record (for any month) 20 home runs in June. This June he hit a
mere 13.
</P>
<P>
   Triple Kudos for Frascatore
</P>
<P>
   John Frascatore of the Toronto Blue Jays has gained a spot in
the record book of oddities.
</P>
<P>
   Frascatore relieved in all three games the Blue Jays played
against Baltimore last week. He was also the winning pitcher in
each game, pitching the last inning of the 10-inning first game,
the last two-thirds of an inning of the 10-inning second game and
two-thirds of the eighth inning of the third game.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a pitcher performed such a triple, according to
research by the Elias Sports Bureau, was in 1996, when Chuck
McElroy was the winning pitcher in relief three times for the
Angels against Kansas City.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Hillary Rodham Clinton shows up at Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's upstate New York farm on Wednesday, offering
herself as his potential successor after his retirement next year,
it will be a full 482 days until the election. Nevertheless, as of
Saturday, nearly 200 reporters and other media representatives from
around the world had signed up to record the event, and then to
chase the first lady across central New York for four days of
``listening to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates for U.S. Senate would revel in that kind of
attention, particularly in a state like New York, where campaigns
rarely draw serious notice until well after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing perception among New York's political
leaders that the 16-month campaign for Senate that begins with Mrs.
Clinton's appearance in Pindars Corners will pose an extraordinary
challenge for the Democratic first lady and Rudolph Giuliani, the
Republican New York City mayor, who is also likely to run for the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have actually begun
talking about turning down the volume on this contest, as difficult
as that may be in this superheated media environment, with both
sides concerned about overexposure or making mistakes under such
close scrutiny and over such a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides said she intended to avoid making major
news over the course of her visits to New York this summer. She
plans no major speeches and will spend most of her time
``listening, listening, listening and listening'' at small meetings
with voters, said her senior political adviser, Harold Ickes. And
Giuliani has been attempting to lower his Senate candidacy profile
as well, one adviser said, concentrating on activities like raising
money while turning down invitations to appear on network
television shows devoted to the race.
</P>
<P>
   The race for senator from New York for 2000 is, given the likely
presence of a sitting first lady, upending the rules by which
politics are played in New York. It has pushed all the players into
unfamiliar territory, from the strategists who are trying to plan a
campaign unlike any they have seen before, to the television news
directors and newspaper editors who are faced with decisions about
how many staff members they should devote to a Senate race that is
effectively beginning more than a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions could prove to be nearly as significant in
shaping the public perception of the race in the next 12 months as
what the candidates themselves do.
</P>
<P>
   Against that unsettled background, there is a sense among the
first lady's associates that a long run on a high-profile stage
could present unwanted complications for a novice candidate who is
trying to learn a new career and get to know a new state. While
Mrs. Clinton's stature carries obvious advantages _ this is one
candidate who never has to worry about walking into a room filled
with empty chairs _ the concern has colored much of the planning
Mrs. Clinton's aides have done for her inaugural campaign visit.
</P>
<P>
   How, asked one of her friends, is Mrs. Clinton going to learn
about the concerns of everyday New Yorkers when she is being
shadowed by a press corps so huge that its numbers are filling
hotels from Oneonta to Albany? Will she be able to walk down the
street, talking to shop owners or buying a quart of milk, with
reporters and Secret Service agents packed around her?
</P>
<P>
   A critical aspect of Mrs. Clinton's effort to become grounded in
New York is the discussions with small groups of New Yorkers that
will begin on Wednesday in Oneonta. ``She wants them to be as
intimate as possible,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a longtime adviser to
Mrs. Clinton. ``She wants to speak to people, listen to people, and
not have 200 cameras there to make it more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But those events are, so far, shaping up as something less than
private. Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's new press secretary, said
he had processed requests for press credentials from television
crews from Japan and Britain. While Wolfson said the campaign would
try to restrict coverage of some of the events to a small,
representative group of pool reporters, Mrs. Clinton will arrive at
Moynihan's farmhouse in the rolling hills of Delaware County to
find a huge wooden platform constructed to accommodate the
television crews and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases,'' Wolfson said, ``a large press corps may not
be helpful to facilitating this.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Mrs. Clinton, and to a lesser extent
Giuliani, will not have the luxury of traveling the state, learning
the issues and making unnoticed mistakes in the process, a luxury
most new candidates have. Mrs. Clinton's friends say this will not
be a problem for this particular first lady, given her husband's
skills. ``She knows what it takes, having been through numerous
campaigns throughout her husband's career,'' said Lisa Caputo, who
served as Mrs. Clinton's press secretary in the White House. ``I
would argue she's pretty seasoned.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer length of the campaign invites opportunities for
high-profile errors by any candidate, particularly one who is
inexperienced. That became distressingly clear to the first lady's
friends when she donned a New York Yankees baseball cap at a White
House ceremony and declared herself a Yankee fan, a moment that
even her closest associates described as clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer, at a similar
point in his own campaign to unseat Alfonse M. D'Amato last year,
was traveling the state constantly, with a single aide and largely
unnoticed. Schumer, a Democrat who had served in the House, said he
had used that time to raise money, educate himself on state issues
and build political support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense it was easier, because no one was paying attention
to me, and I could focus on what I had to do,'' Schumer recalled.
``And in a sense, it was harder because no one was paying attention
to me.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has far more experience campaigning than Mrs. Clinton.
However, even his friends say his bellicose manner, particularly in
the environment of Gracie Mansion, invites mistakes as well. And
even Giuliani's friends do not dispute that he lacks the kind of
personality that wears well with voters over time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani may get more attention if Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long
Island Republican, keeps his promise to challenge the mayor in the
primary. In the meantime, Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of the mayor's
political action committee, said Giuliani had no intention of
conducting the kind of explicit campaigning now that would focus
attention on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really focusing on things we need to do _ and much less
on what the media thinks, or the attention the media is paying on
the things that are happening,'' Teitelbaum said. ``We are
concentrating on the things that we need to get ourselves ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers are trying to remedy the problem of
having too many reporters following her by, in effect, trying to
bore them out of town. ``I hope that over time the novelty will
wear off and she'll be able to get out there and really travel
without the full circus that will travel with her at the
beginning,'' Ms. Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But there are indications that this is one race where
there will be a continual media presence. Steve Paulus, the general
manager of New York 1, the all-news cable station in New York City,
said his station was gearing up to enthusiastically cover every
turn of the campaign, no matter how long it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be following the candidates wherever they go,''
Paulus said. ``I think the interest is just going to be so high
that we can't miss covering it like a glove. It'll sustain itself
and it'll be that interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC News, said he
expected the networks to cover a Clinton-Giuliani race, assuming it
shapes up that way, much the way they cover the candidates for
president. ``It is safe to say that from September 2000 through the
elections, the networks will cover her every day,'' Halperin said.
``And all the networks will likely assign full-time off-air
reporters to cover her, as early as this week.''

FREE AGENTS: WOOING BEGINS IN EARNEST 
JUST BUSINESS WITH THE CBA 
UP FOR A PROMOTION 
MEMORIES OF THE DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the next three weeks or so, Charles Oakley will be a
popular man. Maybe not in the vein of Anfernee Hardaway, Mitch
Richmond and Vin Baker _ All-Stars looking for their next
multimillion-dollar contract. But as one of 187 free agents who
cannot sign a deal until Aug. 1, Oakley is expected to be courted
by several franchises seeking that special, nasty disposition for
their playoff-bound team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning on taking as many trips as possible,'' said
Billy Diamond, the veteran forward's business manager. ``Charles is
looking at it like a high school senior being wooed by colleges.
The nice thing about the NBA is, there's no limit on the amount of
trips you can take. We figure 29 visits is about right. Or 28 _ if
you don't count the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Oakley is not even counting the Knicks out. He would
not mind being a role player in Marcus Camby's shadow, although
that would require working out a sign-and-trade deal with Toronto
because of the Knicks' salary cap situation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the next month will be hectic for people in
the league trying to build a better team. Teams were permitted to
begin negotiating with free agents as of last Thursday. Chicago,
Toronto and the Los Angeles Clippers are the only teams with
significant room under the salary cap to sign quality free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the league's sign-and-trade clause _ in which the player's
current team can re-sign the player to a lucrative contract with
the idea of moving him for another player or players with similar
salaries _ will most likely be employed often over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway, warts and all, is still the biggest catch.
Babied to no end in Orlando, he drove Magic officials mad with his
petulant ways the past few years. He and Baker are the most
prominent players to exercise escape clauses in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With the Magic giving up Horace Grant while acquiring one
quarter of Seattle's roster on draft night _ Duke's Corey Maggette,
whom the Sonics chose 13th, plus Dale Ellis, Billy Owens and Don
MacLean _ it appears Orlando is preparing for life after Penny.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic insist Hardaway is still in its plans. Most
likely, he is in the franchise's sign-and-trade plans. Orlando does
not plan to lose Hardaway for nothing the way it did Shaquille
O'Neal to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers has gone about building a relationship with
Hardaway after Rivers was named coach last month. The Magic
entertained deals before the draft from Phoenix (Danny Manning, Pat
Garrity) and Minnesota, which was thinking about parting with point
guard Terrell Brandon and its sixth pick.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has also reportedly separately offered Rasheed Wallace
and Isaiah Rider, but it's unclear what the Blazers wanted other
than Hardaway in return.
</P>
<P>
   As for Baker, the Sonics have said they want to re-sign him, but
he is expected to test his market value after a miserable season in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek, John Stockton and Karl Malone are also free
agents, but they all appear locked up in Utah for however long they
want to play together. Same goes for Charles Barkley in Houston,
where the Rockets plan on rewarding Barkley generously in perhaps
his farewell season.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jaren Jackson and Malik Rose are role players for the
Spurs, it seems likely that San Antonio will pay whatever it must
to bring both players back to the championship team.
</P>
<P>
   After drafting Connecticut's Richard Hamilton seventh, the
Wizards will most likely let Calbert Cheaney go and may even move
Richmond in a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds in the rough: Shandon Anderson, Michael Curry, Derek
Fisher, Gary Trent and Hersey Hawkins. Hawkins is getting to be
ancient, but he can still fill it up from the perimeter. And as his
former teammate Dale Ellis has proved for a while now, old shooters
don't retire; they just keep on chucking.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the Heat keeps Dan Majerle and
Terry Porter, two reliable veterans who could not keep up with the
Knicks' guards in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   As for Oakley, it does not appear he is headed back to Toronto _
especially after the Raptors acquired Antonio Davis from Indiana.
Beyond Chicago or the Clippers, the most obvious places where he
would end up would be the Lakers, Seattle, Miami or Atlanta, all
teams with title aspirations in need of another solid veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not ruling out the Nets, either,'' said Diamond, who
noted that Oakley was not heavily recruited while in high school.
``Hey, Charles is just sitting back and enjoying the attention. The
usual process is they send the company jet out, you tour the
facilities, the arena and the city. Before he went to Virginia
Union, he didn't get a whole lot of interest. This kind of makes up
for it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Just Business With the CBA
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, Isiah Thomas was busy in his Detroit
offices trying to close a deal that would give him outright
ownership of the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's merely a former player and current
broadcaster making a huge investment. But beyond the business
ramifications, Thomas' purchase could also be viewed as the first
major step toward the NB A forming a partnership with the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership would not only include using the CBA as an
NBA-sponsored developmental league for potential NBA players, but
it would also help the league implement an age requirement for
players entering the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and the deputy commissioner, Russ
Granik, have expressed a desire to address the proliferation of
teen-age players entering the league, and Stern has mentioned 20
years old as a possible age limit for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing their concerns, though, they also indicated the
league was contemplating some sort of minor league system for
players who chose not to attend college, a system that would not
only include basketball opportunities but also nurture young
players about to embark on a pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Thomas, the NBC analyst and former Pistons All-Star who
has spoken to Stern about using the CBA as an exclusive farm system
for NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the CBA become the NBA's official
developmental league and mirror baseball,'' Thomas said. ``It's a
place where you can develop players, referees, coaches and
experiment with rule changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-team CBA season runs from November through March. While
it bills itself as the official development league of the NBA,
there is no business connection between the two. Last season, 137
former CBA players appeared on NBA rosters in training camp and the
regular season. Sixty-three players were called up during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on whether the NBA will go along with it, but
I'd like to present options for them that make the CBA a viable
business opportunity,'' Thomas said. ``I would like to see that
relationship more cemented, so the NBA becomes more of a partner
and we combine all our resources to make basketball better.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Stern's desire to create some sort of league-sponsored
alternative to the NBA before he continues the process of
implementing an age requirement, a joint announcement between both
leagues in the next few weeks would not be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Up for a Promotion
</P>
<P>
   After handling draft-day duties and being the front man for the
Knicks organization the past week, it would almost be a slight not
to promote Ed Tapscott to the vacant general manager position.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott, who is the assistant general manager, worked under
Ernie Grunfeld before Grunfeld was relieved of his duties in April.
He knows the college game better than anyone in the organization
and has dealt with many of the league's other general managers the
past few years. Everything points to Tapscott's getting the job.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the Madison Square Garden president, Dave Checketts,
were to go another direction, the organization could easily
splinter again.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the Draft
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak had his family in attendance for draft night
Wednesday at the MCI Center when he was selected sixth by the
Minnesota Timberwolves. The contingent included his father, Walter,
who once starred for Real Madrid in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Walter's last night at the NBA draft? He attended the 1984 event
as a guest of a friend who worked for the Portland Trail Blazers,
the night the Blazers selected Sam Bowie second and passed on the
greatest player in history.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Lashanda Washington was a street-smart,
fight-hardened girl of 16, riding a city bus home from school, when
she saw the face that she had been dreaming about for years.
</P>
<P>
   The woman boarding the No. 14 looked older than the one who had
long stalked her fading childhood memories. She was thin like an
addict and bloated like a drinker. She was scarred like a fighter
and worn like a pauper. She was as beautiful as anyone Ms.
Washington had ever seen. The girl's heart nearly exploded from the
rush of fear and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my mama?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you my daughter?'' the woman replied.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Ms. Washington traded a foster mother she had
never liked for the troubled mother she scarcely knew. She helped
her mother find an apartment, worked two jobs for a while to pay
the rent and worried her way through the alcoholic storms that
battered her mother each day.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Ms. Washington is a single mother herself,
swept up in the vast migration off the nation's welfare rolls. And
like countless other young central-city women, she has found her
efforts to build a new life complicated by family bonds more
powerful than many policy-makers understand.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, her mother, Linnie Washington, remains in her care, where
she is at once a cherished matriarch, a wellspring of solace and a
source of almost daily sabotage. She mocks her daughter's attempts
to work, blames her for her own drinking, and locks her out of the
house. Yet nothing seems to diminish the fidelity she receives in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama is like everything to me,'' the younger Ms. Washington
said. ``I love my mama to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving a troubled relative to death, a struggle often forgotten
in policy forums, is one of the most common situations poor women
face when leaving the welfare rolls. Loyalties to the job often
conflict with loyalties at home. Addicted sisters, imprisoned
brothers, needy cousins and aunts _ the great national drive from
welfare to work winds through a forest of familial distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Now 20, Lashanda is an energetic, resilient woman who weds
earnestness with streetwise flamboyance. She said she was eager to
escape ``all that ghetto stuff'' that has followed her all her
life, and sometimes she tries to break free. She can land jobs
quickly. She can charm people in positions of authority. She talks
of becoming a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   As Lashanda has landed and lost jobs over the last five months,
her mother, by her own account, has staggered drunk in the street
and been hit by a car; checked into a psychiatric ward; weathered
immobilizing outbreaks of herpes, and started many days crying
aloud that she fears she is dying. Lashanda said her mother grew so
angry when she refused to buy her cocaine that she cut the phone
line with a butcher knife. Linnie said she grew so desperate for
money that she offered sex to the rent collector, trying to
forestall an eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping work to keep watch at home, Lashanda has found herself
trapped in irreconcilable roles: breadwinner, daughter, confidante,
playmate, social worker, nurse and cop. She wakes her mother and
chides her to eat; buys her beer when she gets the shakes, and
searches the alleys when she disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is not the only obstacle between Lashanda and steady
work. She lost her chance at one job when she tested positive for
marijuana. She quit another because she did not like the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the family, even her talk of mainstream achievements
brings as much resentment as respect. When sober, her mother boasts
that Lashanda is so smart she talks like a secretary. When drunk,
she accuses her of trying to ``act white'' and she mocks Lashanda's
light-skinned son, Jermaine, as ``Casper.'' These are biting words
in an African-American family deeply suspicious of the
predominantly white judges, lawyers and social workers who have
ruled their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was fine until Mama got to talking'' and ``calling
me stupid,'' Lashanda confided to a diary this spring. ``Little do
she know I cry like every three days inside to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, the anger and frustration get tucked away, behind
avowals of ferocious daughterly devotion. ``As long as I see my
mama and know she's safe, that gets me through the day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washington began 1999 at the Academy of Excellence, a
two-week course that tries to prepare poor women for a post-welfare
life. Five months later, its graduates could fill a book with
stories of family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Pettigrew was one of the most earnest students and the
first to find work, as a receptionist at the academy itself. In
class, she mentioned that she was once on the ``way to Doomsville''
with a sister. It was a casual aside and an eerie premonition. A
few weeks later, her sister's body was found in a melting snowbank.
Distraught, Ms. Pettigrew left the job.
</P>
<P>
   Savaria Johnson was one of the quietest students, sharing little
but her smile. No one would have known her house was a battleground
for warring family factions. She said she fought with a brother,
who fought with an aunt, who summoned police. Ms. Johnson and her
children finally fled, but she ignored her work requirements and
lost her welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the academy's most celebrated graduate has faced family
conflicts. After landing her first job in years, Michelle Crawford
was invited by Wisconsin's governor, Tommy Thompson, to take part
in his annual legislative address. Thompson later acknowledged he
had no idea of the conflicts still rocking her home: a jealous
sister, a violent husband, a son arrested for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of her caretaking role, Ms. Washington helped reconstruct
her family saga in unusual detail, sharing letters and diaries and
approving the release of child welfare records normally kept under
court seal. It is a story of incessant worry that still awaits a
happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mama is sick real bad,'' she wrote in her diary last month.
``I hate seeing her like that. And I know my Mama loves all her
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Linnie Washington lost her mother, too. She grew up in a home
with eight children, two violent parents, and a trail of empty
liquor bottles. One night her father came home and beat her mother
until she agreed to have sex. Then her mother got up and shot him
four times as the children looked on. Linnie was 7.
</P>
<P>
   With her mother serving 15 years for murder, she stayed with her
grandmother. She began drinking heavily in her teens, gave birth to
Lashanda when she was 18 and quickly had four more children. She
also got custody of a young nephew, T.J., who was taken from her
sister. Social workers thought she would provide a better home,
though her drinking offered evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Linnie's grandmother had warned child welfare officials early on
about her abuse of alcohol and drugs. Then, left unattended one
summer day in 1987, Lashanda's 2-year-old sister fell from a
second-story porch and suffered a concussion. Ten months later,
T.J. fell. Linnie put him to bed and when she awoke the next
morning, the 5-year-old boy was dead. ``I'm scare, cause I might go
to jail,'' Linnie wrote in a panicked note summoning a sister.
``Help me wake this boy up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hostile interview with a social worker afterward, Linnie
denied she had an alcohol problem. Then she burst into tears and
confessed she simply could not stop drinking. The worker found her
``suffering immensely from guilt and shame.'' The state took her
children away.
</P>
<P>
   Lashanda was 9 when she began a harrowing search for a home. She
stayed with an aunt until her father finished a sentence for armed
robbery. She stayed with her father until he went back to prison,
for sexual assault. She went to a foster home in a drug trading
zone, and she was held at gunpoint by robbers threatening rape. The
attack revived the terror she had felt as a young child during
episodes of sexual abuse. She was hospitalized just before her 13th
birthday after several suicide attempts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 15, she had climbed out of the abyss and
onto the eighth-grade honor roll. A social worker speculated on the
key to her growing success: no contact with her mother, sisters or
brother. ``Lashanda copes,'' she wrote, ``by isolating herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lashanda said good grades never quenched the yearning for
her family. ``That's all I ever wanted to do, was to go stay with
my mother, be with my sisters again,'' she said. ``I wanted to be
like everybody else _ they have their mama.''
</P>
<P>
   She had not seen her mother for years when they collided on the
bus. But it took her just two weeks to persuade a court to let her
go home. Soon her sister, Tashanda, then 13, ran away from her
foster home and joined the reunion. Her mother drank. Her sister
fought. Lashanda herself could be quick with her fists. Over the
next three years the Washingtons moved five times, chased by
landlords, neighbors and police.
</P>
<P>
   As a 16-year-old family boss, Lashanda worked long shifts at
McDonald's to pay the rent, and took a second job at a grocery
store. She had a son in the spring of her junior year and left
school that fall. Her son's father left her. Her apartment caught
fire. She ran through four jobs in eight months. Then she took a
step that offended her pride in herself as a worker: She applied
for welfare. ``I was depressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Academy of Excellence'' is two classrooms on Martin Luther
King Jr. Drive, in the heart of Milwaukee's welfare district. It is
the first stop for people seeking benefits from YW-Works, one of
five private agencies hired by the state to run the welfare program
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's strict new system, virtually everyone
receiving cash assistance must join a work program. Before
receiving a work assignment, academy students spend two weeks
studying life's basic arts: negotiating with the gas company,
avoiding domestic violence, securing birth control.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of Milwaukee's welfare recipients are
black, though the county is 73 percent white, and the classroom
often rang with Afrocentric invocations. ``Go down in prayer when
you get scared,'' one of the speakers urged. ``Think about your
chained ancestors'' surviving slave ships and cotton fields and
``declare to yourself, `I can do something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like corralled indigents in similar classes citywide, Lashanda
arrived a skeptic. ``I have to sit here and let these people run
their mouth,'' she said at the time. But she later called the
academy a positive place where ``nobody talked bad'' when she
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my house, there ain't no compromise _ I either do it, or I
get cussed out,'' she told the class. ``That's how my mama is.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Paczesny, a counselor at YW-Works, said family conflicts
were nearly universal among her clients, with a mother's drug abuse
among the most common afflictions. Oldest daughters in particular,
she said, often grow deeply invested in their identity as the
family caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the number of women we see who will stay at
home, essentially to keep their moms under lock and key,'' she
said. ``They know their moms are dope-dating, bringing men into the
house. And if it's not the moms, it's a sister or another close
relative. They feel if they don't take care of them, nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   Though recipients can lose $5.15 for every hour of work or class
they miss, policy is no match for biology. ``The parent-child bond
is more profound than any work program we have,'' Ms. Paczesny
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do try to get ahead, she said, often meet a backlash
from relatives who tell them, ``Either you're down with us _
oppressed economically, spiritually, educationally _ or you're not
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lashanda, an oldest daughter, describes her own identity in
strikingly similar terms. She is proud. (``I can handle it.'') She
is concerned. (``I worry about my mama every day.'') She is angry.
(``I shouldn't have to do this.'') And she is terrified of what
might happen if she stops looking after her mother. (``I feel
responsible,'' she said. ``Can't live with that guilt.'')
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, when she finished the academy, her instructor
put a note in her file: ``Excellent student. Tries hard. Home
situation is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If only the instructor knew.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the academy, Lashanda was sent to sort hangers at
a factory and to study for her high school degree. But her mother's
drinking was on the rise. So were her reprisals when Lashanda
refused to buy beer or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   She cut the phone line. She tried to tear down the bedroom door.
When Lashanda left for work or class, Linnie locked her out. Though
Lashanda was the one paying the rent, she said her mother called
the landlord and tried to have her evicted.
</P>
<P>
   One Friday afternoon, Lashanda raced home from the factory after
her mother collapsed at the stove. On Sunday, Linnie was hit by a
car. On Monday, Lashanda was supposed to start training as a
nurse's assistant. Instead, she spent the morning urging her mother
to sober up and seek care for her untreated bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Then the focus turned to her sister. For months, Tashanda, now
16, had turned the home into a fugitive's lair, hiding from police,
who were trying to arrest her for a fight with a neighbor. That
Wednesday, they finally caught her. Lashanda spent the rest of the
week shuttling to court and parrying her mother's drunken
accusations that she had caused her mother to get hit and her
sister to get arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always my fault,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she is sober, Linnie acknowledges her problems. ``My kids
always tell me to go to treatment, but I'm hard-headed,'' she said.
``They said I might die because I'm drinking myself to death. My
kids love me, and I'm trying to show back the love I lost from
them. I'm playing catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke gratefully of Lashanda's devotion. ``She acts like
she's a social worker,'' she said. ``She'll sit me down and say,
`Ms. Washington, you ain't supposed to ...' Can't hide nothing from
that child.'' Perhaps saying more than she intended, she added,
``She loves me too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she drinks, such boasts give way to bile. Of all the
insults, the words that sting her daughter the most are, ``You're
trying to act like you're white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that hurts me,'' Lashanda said. ``I say, `Mama,
don't call me white! I don't call you names. I don't call you no
ghetto mama, no hood rat. I don't call you no hoochie mama.' She's
just drunk. She can't control herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalized for missing work and class, Lashanda saw her welfare
check dwindle to $286 in May, from a possible $673. She quit
welfare and worked for a few weeks through a temporary employment
agency. She lost the chance at another job when she tested positive
for marijuana. By the end of May, she fell ill with anemia and
stopped working on doctor's orders. She got by on food stamps and
$981 of overdue child support from her son's father.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she faced a new crisis _ the need to get Linnie out of
the house. Child welfare officials were ready to release Tashanda,
but only once Linnie was gone. A social worker helped her find a
residential sobriety program. But first an agonizing and contagious
outbreak of herpes had to be brought under control. In the chaos,
an eviction notice arrived and the family had to move _ unjustly in
Linnie's view, since she said she was promised a rent reduction in
exchange for sex.
</P>
<P>
   As the spring wore on, Lashanda confided her problems in a
prized diary. Among the record of insults and injuries is an
account of the happiest mother-daughter moment of the year. With
Tashanda locked up, the welfare check cut, and the unpaid bills on
the rise, Linnie turned to Lashanda one day and did something that
truly stunned her. She apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me,'' Lashanda said. ``She always just cusses me
out.'' She said she was sorry Lashanda faced so much pressure. She
asked whether she could handle it. She asked whether she ever
cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mama, I cry all the time _ I cry like every other
day.''' For a few days running, a happy young woman exclaimed to
her diary that her mother finally understood. ``She knows that I'm
doing everything,'' Lashanda wrote. ``She is trying. She is in my
heart.''

COMMENTARY: RUMBLING OF REVOLUTION IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Interest in local history is not only alive
and kicking here, it's yelling, calling names and bringing
lawsuits, just in time for Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of this fight is a band of insurgents who are trying
to wrest control of the 98-year-old Stamford Historical Society
from leaders they liken to King George III _ old, hidebound,
autocratic and dismissive of new ideas. Without a revolution, they
say, the society will go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like dropping tea into Boston Harbor,'' said Patricia
Kane, 56, a lawyer and the leader of the insurgents, who has been
on the society's board for a year, ``because if you push people too
hard, they start to push back. And if we don't start pushing, we
won't have a historical society.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbug! the society's leadership says. ``This is really nothing
but an effort by a group to take control because they think that
this board of, well, fairly senior-citizen leadership is old and
will be a pushover,'' said Ishier Jacobson, 77, a retired
utility-company chairman and a member of the society's powerful
executive committee. ``I think we have shown that we are not
pushovers.''
</P>
<P>
   George Washington may or may not have slept here but, according
to the society, he did have breakfast at Webb's Tavern, on what is
now Bank Street, in 1789. And although Stamford patriots never
threw tea in Stamford's shallow harbor, they did protest the Stamp
Act by burning a consignment of bohea tea in Atlantic Square.
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides in the historical-society fight agree on
anything, it is that history from the Revolution on is a big deal
to New Englanders, and that control of its repository is worth
fighting for, especially in an old city that is rapidly changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a community of new people, new people coming every
day,'' Jacobson said, ``and the one thing we can do as a society is
give children a feeling of roots, whether they came from Nevada or
Honduras or wherever. If you do enough of that, then you help give
people the feeling that they are part of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kane owns the third-oldest house in Stamford, an immaculate
colonial from 1721 on High Ridge Road, and she has no argument with
the society's mission, only with its management. The $1.2 million
the society had in its general fund six years ago has shrunk to
$640,000, she notes. If the trend continues, she says, the society
will go broke, but Jacobson maintains that new contributions will
keep the balance up.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement broke out into open catcalls and chaos on June
14, when Ms. Kane and several dozen allies took over the annual
nominating meetings and, by offering nominations from the floor and
voting on them, added 18 new members to the board of directors,
doubling its size. Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
   Walter H. Wheeler III, 76, the president of the society,
maintained that floor nominations were illegal, and that most of
the rebels, having joined only recently with cut-rate, $10
six-month memberships, were ineligible to vote anyway. He adjourned
the meeting, but the rebels maintain they are the new board, or
part of the old one, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Now the city of Stamford has frozen a $10,000 donation to the
society until some sort of peace is made, and Pitney Bowes, an
office-equipment company founded in Stamford by Wheeler's ancestors
that is a longtime supporter of the society, is also critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bylaws or no bylaws, I have a general distrust of any
organization that isn't willing to consider nominations from the
floor,'' Polly O'Brien, the company's director of community
affairs, wrote to Wheeler last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, a yachtsman, was said to be teaching sailing in the
Adirondacks and could not comment, but Jacobson did. ``She doesn't
know what she's talking about,'' he said. Now the old board has
brought a lawsuit against the new board to force it to stop calling
itself a board, and the whole thing has gone personal. ``Ms. Kane
is ambitious, but she's not very successful as a lawyer,'' Jacobson
said. ``I think this is just something she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kane said, ``I can leave the historical society tomorrow and
I'll still have a life, but a lot of people there, it's the single
thing they have, and they're trying to hold onto their niche.''

NEWARK HAILS BASEBALL'S RETURN, BUT HIGH COST IS RAISING DOUBTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (rk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ Groundskeepers painstakingly leveled the clay-orange
dirt around home plate this week, and masons grouted between the
earth-hued blocks at the entrance to the new Riverfront Park
stadium, which is bringing minor league baseball to New Jersey's
largest city for the first time in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here proudly predict that the soldout opening game on
July 16, between the Newark Bears and the Lehigh Valley Black
Diamonds, will be the first of many sellouts that will draw
thousands to the city and enliven its downtown.
</P>
<P>
   They say the park will accelerate Newark's renaissance, which
began in 1997 with the opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts
Center nearby and will continue with a proposed new stadium for the
Nets and the Devils, New Jersey's pro basketball and hockey teams.
</P>
<P>
   What could be wrong this picture?
</P>
<P>
   For one, the 6,000-seat stadium cost $34 million, about 50
percent more than planned. People familiar with the economics of
minor league baseball say it is by far the most expensive minor
league park in the country, built when minor leagues and their
teams are coming and going at a rapid pace. A potential baseball
glut, some industry experts say, makes Newark's expensive ballpark
far from a sure economic bet.
</P>
<P>
   With opening day just two weeks away, city and Essex County
officials are discounting warnings of traffic nightmares as they
work to pin down contracts to provide several thousand parking
spaces, at rates of $3 to $4, near the stadium. Without such
agreements, parking rates within four blocks of the stadium could
easily surpass the $6 to $7 charged during business hours. That
would leave officials hard-pressed to keep their promise of an
affordable trip to the ballpark, where seats cost $6 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from Mayor Sharpe James to County Executive James
W. Treffinger dismiss the gloomy predictions, saying that the
parking will be in place and the streets equal to the traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
   They said the cost overruns were largely the fault of local
opponents who forced the city to move the stadium from its original
site, a landmark park, to a combination of city-owned and private
parcels at the northern edge of downtown Newark, off McCarter
Highway. This plunged city and county planners into tough
negotiations with the owners of the once-depressed and neglected
properties, who extracted $7 million for the land.
</P>
<P>
   One million dollars was added to the ballpark's cost because
about 15 underground oil storage tanks at the new site had to be
cleaned up. And the regional boom in construction has made labor
more expensive, adding $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost overruns have been overblown and misinterpreted,''
said James, a Democrat, ``and they haven't hurt this investment in
affordable, family entertainment that will change the image of
Newark forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, a Republican, said he believed that the investment
in the stadium would increase the value of more than 2 million
square feet in nearby office space. If the value of those buildings
rises by a mere 20 percent, county studies have shown, tax revenues
would increase by $1.2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city and county, under a 10-year contract with
the Bears, will get 25 percent of the income from advertising and
concessions, 75 percent of the price of luxury box seats and $1
from every ticket sold.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly run Essex County Improvement Authority, which
financed the stadium, will also get all the proceeds from the sale
of the right to name it. The authority will get 5 percent of the
gross revenues after the team's first $4.75 million, and could get
as much as 20 percent depending on how much more the team makes.
</P>
<P>
   For Treffinger, the stadium also solves a political problem. As
part of the arrangement to move the stadium to the downtown site,
the city allowed construction of a much-needed county jail within
city limits. This not only spared Treffinger the onerous task of
putting the jail elsewhere in the county, but it also eliminated
the imminent threat of a $300 million fine and penalties from a
federal court ruling requiring a plan to relieve overcrowding at
the current jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These benefits alone make it worth it to build the stadium for
the Bears,'' Treffinger said. ``But beyond that, when we talked
with the New Jersey Nets about their moving from the Meadowlands
and building an arena here, the minor league stadium was a crucial
part of the attraction for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's cost overruns and the additional burden it places
on taxpayers have drawn fire from the editorial pages of the The
Star-Ledger, which once supported it. Some elected officials who
once backed the stadium have turned critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do a project like this anywhere in the country
without recognizing the possibility of additional costs, but not 50
percent additional,'' said state Sen. Ronald L. Rice, a former city
councilman who unsuccessfully challenged James' re-election effort
last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bears' owner, former New York Yankees catcher Rick
Cerone, such complaints are background noise as he climbs into the
unfinished skyboxes of the stadium. On clear days he can see the
World Trade Center just over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 17 years as a player, this was a way to stay in the
game,'' said Cerone, 45, who grew up in Newark and remembers his
late father, Aldo, telling him stories about the Newark Bears and
the Newark Eagles of the old Negro Leagues, which shared Newark's
25,000-seat, Ruppert Stadium until 1950. ``My father saw me start
on this effort before he died three years ago,'' Cerone said, ``and
while they say don't go into business where it is personal, this is
personal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cerone said that the early tense days and their uncertainties
have given way to fretting about getting the seats installed in
time and whether the shimmering Kentucky bluegrass sod will root
deeply enough before opening day. He said he was less worried now
about the marketing of the team and the stadium, which will draw on
5.4 million people within a 15-mile radius, because he has a
waiting list of corporate customers for advertising signs,
promotional nights and sky boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Riverfront Park has incorporated some of the city's baseball
lore into the design. For example, a bleacher section that
Hallmark, a real estate company, has subsidized as seating for
youth groups from around the city has been called the ``Knothole
Gang'' after the children who used to peer through the holes
drilled in the wooden fence that lined the left field of Ruppert
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the nostalgia the stadium may evoke, there is no
guarantee that it will be an economic home run. Andrew Zimbalist,
an economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who
specializes in the sports business, said public investments in
stadiums, even in well-heeled major league sites, often falter.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, a stadium winds up taking entertainment
dollars that had been going to locally owned bowling alleys,
restaurants and movie theaters. Zimbalist said stadiums also
involve maintenance, sanitation and security costs that, along with
the debt service, can mean ``a negative bottom line year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the real risk is the independent minor league, where more
of the teams fail than succeed,'' he said. ``Plus there are six
other independent minor league teams in New Jersey, some from
different leagues, pulling on their market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are part of a boomlet in minor league baseball. They
belong to the independent, six-team Atlantic League, one of the
current crop of five independent minor leagues nationwide with a
total of 48 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Wolf, founder and commissioner of the Northern League, and
president of the company that publishes the minor league baseball
trade magazine Baseball America, said that major league baseball
enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s with the construction of new
stadiums as economic development vehicles for many cities,
including Baltimore and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The desire for new-stadium buzz filtered down to the 160 cities
that were homes to the minor league farm teams that are affiliated
with major league teams. As a result, he said, in the last decade
80 new minor league stadiums had been built around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf said that there are more cities interested in minor
league baseball than there are major league-affiliated farm teams.
Since 1993, he said, 14 leagues have been started with a total of
66 teams. But Wolf noted that those numbers have been winnowed by
mergers and the tough economics of baseball in small cities.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said that he hoped Newark's team would not suffer because
of the cost of the stadium. ``This is far and away the most
expensive minor league stadium, major league-affiliated or
unaffiliated,'' he said. ``It is too expensive and certainly sets a
new standard for a 6,000-seat stadium that shouldn't be more than
$19 million, not counting land.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stadium's backers say its prospects look good. A
smiling Cerone on a recent day was visited by people seeking
autographs and business people seeking to discuss deals. Among them
were a group from NorCrown Bank, which has just six branches in
Livingston and South Orange. The bank is trying to decide whether
the stadium will be the site of its first stand-alone ATM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a lot of people from Essex County will come this way
and from an advertising point of view, a corporate presence here
for us will be significant and good advertising,'' said Monte
Ehrenkranz, vice president and branch coordinator. ``We just have
to decide whether it's worth the investment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A handful of black-robed, full-bearded
Serb Orthodox priests bobbed on the edges of a noisy crowd that
assembled last week in the Serb town of Cacak to demand that
President Slobodan Milosevic resign.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the Rev. Stojan Stokic, a village priest who had
driven more than 150 miles for the rally, showed off the same pious
fury, the same political passion that characterized many Roman
Catholic priests in Poland who more than a decade ago helped the
Solidarity movement topple communism.
</P>
<P>
   To see and hear Stokic was to believe that something fundamental
is changing in the soul of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which
grabbed international attention last month by coming out ahead of
Serb opposition parties and calling on Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But Stokic, who said he would preach his anti-Milosevic politics
in his parish on Sunday morning, is still an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is both bound by and responsible for the
notion that wherever Serbs live and bury their dead should be part
of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the church that 10 years ago welcomed Milosevic's
violent nationalist land grab in the collapsing Yugoslavia and
whose most senior bishops traveled in the war zones of Croatia and
Bosnia, blessing Serb forces shelling towns like Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its head, Patriarch Pavle, said last week in Kosovo
that the Serb leader's policies are criminal, the church continues
to send mixed signals about what its priests should do in toppling
a president who is indicted as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Stokic said the war in Kosovo, where Serbs committed atrocities
against Albanians before losing control of territory his church
regards as sacred to Serbs, had changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so ashamed and I am feeling guilty,'' he said.
``Milosevic never mentions that Albanians were killed. He is only
president of the police. It isn't the job of the Orthodox Church to
speak about politics. But now in this terrible time, we must speak
out against this man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop Atanasije, vicar of the patriarchy in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, and a cleric who often speaks for Pavle, said in
an interview: ``The church is not a political body. If the church
has called for Slobodan Milosevic to resign, it is not because the
church is involved in politics, it is out of her own pastoral care
for the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking pains to deny news stories that parish priests around
Serbia have been instructed to use Sunday's services as the
beginning of a campaign to teach Serbs about atrocities committed
in their name in Kosovo, the bishop said, ``Those reports have
nothing to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It is enough that the church hierarchy has spoken publicly, he
said, adding that in local parishes, priests should stick to the
Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for the priests to speak out,'' said
Atanasije, drawing a clear distinction between what the Serbian
Orthodox Church is willing to do here and what the Catholic Church
did in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roman Catholic Church is allowed to use any means in order
to achieve a good goal,'' the bishop said. ``The Orthodox Church
must always use evangelical means. We cannot say to the people rise
up and throw off your government. We cannot use evil means to
overcome evil. We can say obey the statutes of the law. That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade during which Milosevic has been fomenting ethnic
war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian Orthodox Church has frequently
criticized him and called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, shortly after the start of the Croatian war, Pavle
accused Milosevic of making Serbs ``victims of communist tyranny''
and called for the creation of a government of national salvation.
The patriarch in 1997 led a procession of more than 100,000 people
into central Belgrade and lent his support to months of
demonstrations during which opposition parties demanded that the
president step down.
</P>
<P>
   But until the patriarch began speaking recently of the ``evil''
he has seen in Kosovo, the focus of church criticism has not been
that Milosevic's government committed atrocities in trying to
create a new Serb empire, but that it has been unsuccessful in
building that larger state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blame Milosevic not for trying to defend the nation, but
for failing,'' said Atanasije.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent statements about Kosovo, Atanasije said the
church is not rethinking the support that many of its senior
priests, including the patriarch himself, gave in blessing Bosnian
Serb forces whose leaders have now been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One priest, the Rev. Filaret Micovic, photographed in Bosnia
atop a tank while brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle, was recently
promoted to bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything strange about the presence of a priest
among his troops,'' Atanasije said.
</P>
<P>
   This continuing stream of conflicting messages _ the embrace of
nationalist aspirations but the rejection of Milosevic's savage
means of realizing them _ grows out of the pivotal role that the
church has played for nearly seven centuries in gestating and
defending the idea of what it means to be a Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Serb and being Orthodox mean the same thing,'' said
Mirko Djordjevic, a retired literature professor and the author of
a new book about the church and its ties to Milosevic. ``Our church
itself has generated nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Under centuries of Ottoman occupation, when the state of Serbia
ceased to exist, it was the church and its myth-making senior
clerics who kept the fires of Serb nationalism burning, and made
honored saints of Serb warriors. Prince Lazar, who led Serb forces
against the Turks in the glorious lost battle of Kosovo in 1389,
was reputed by the same church that made him a saint to have said:
``It is better to die in battle than to live in shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The hold on many Serbs of what the church has always described
as a glorious national past has encouraged Serbs to hope for
another Great Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In realizing the church's long-held dream that all Serbs should
live in the same state, the rise of Milosevic in the late 1980s was
the best news the Serbian Orthodox Church had heard for decades,
Djordjevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church believed Milosevic was the messiah who had come to
smile on all Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Bosnia, the bishops openly supported Radovan Karadzic,
blessing his war to lop off part of that former Yugoslav republic
and fuse it to Serbia. Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs during
the 1992-1995 war, has been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of Tito's communism, during which the church was
repressed and controlled by the government and some of its vast
properties were confiscated, Milosevic allowed the church to
reclaim its role in Serb society. Priests appeared on
state-controlled television. He pledged to allow religious
education in schools and to return church property, promises later
broken.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian holidays have again become public celebrations in
Serbia and the church in 1989 was allowed to elect a patriarch,
Pavle, who is from Kosovo, without government interference. As
Yugoslavia unraveled and wars began in the early 1990s, Serb
paramilitary leaders _ many of them responsible for atrocities and
wholesale campaigns of theft in Croatia and Bosnia _ invoked the
church as their inspiration for defending Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The warlord Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan and has
been indicted as a war criminal, said publicly that his ``supreme
commander'' was Pavle. Before Arkan's indictment by the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, but after worldwide publicity
about the brutality and greed of his paramilitary fighters,
Orthodox priests officiated at his lavish and very public wedding
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Djordjevic, regarded as a leading expert on the Serbian church,
says Pavle has been ``shocked'' by the evidence of atrocities that
he has seen in Kosovo since the 11-week war with NATO ended in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   That shock has resulted in what Djordjevic describes as a new
direction for the church, with the patriarch and Bishop Artemije,
the most senior representative of the church in Kosovo, speaking
openly of ``evil'' done by Serbs against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije took part Friday in a U.N.-sponsored meeting with the
leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, and other
Albanian leaders. They signed a joint statement condemning war
crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije has long opposed Milosevic but has not often been heard
inside Yugoslavia. Shortly after the NATO bombing began, he made a
proclamation to be read in every church in Kosovo, criticizing what
he called ``pogroms'' against the Albanians. It condemned the
burning of houses and attacking of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read it in our church,'' said Father Sava, an assistant to
Artemije and one of the most outspoken liberal priests in the
church. He admitted that many priests may have chosen not to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brave, because of the secret police,'' the priest said.
``And you know we have no free media. Artemije was then attacked by
Serb state media and called a madman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is not a monolith, he explained, and priests
do not have to obey the patriarch, as members of the Roman Catholic
Church have to obey the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not unified,'' Father Sava said. ``People can have
their own political understanding. There are a lot of deluded
people in the church as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade on Friday, Atanasije insisted on steering an
interview away from the matter of the church's new openness about
atrocities committed by Serbs and toward what he described as
foreigners' refusal to give equal time to the abuse of Serbs by
other ethnic groups across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westerners tend to close their eyes when the suffering of
Serbs is concerned,'' the bishop said, emphasizing an abiding
tradition in the Orthodox church that sees Serbs as victims of
foreign manipulation. ``What was done in Kosovo, of course, was
evil. But the next question that has to be asked is who committed
evil. The Serbs were not the only actors.''

bliss is settling over the Shenandoah Valley. The smell of frying
onions drifts out from the concession stand as the Eagles sing
``Take It Easy'' over the PA system. With Massanutten Mountain
looming behind the outfield fence, college players from across
America warm up on the dusty diamond that has become their field of

dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity
College. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.'' But the Shenandoah Valley League offers more than it's
advertised ``Gateway to the Majors.'' Living with families in the
valley's tiny towns, the players get a glimpse of a life they
didn't know existed. ``It's kinda like Mayberry here,'' said
Charlie Wentzky, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the College of
Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like this left in

   AUSTIN PAROLE PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman has prepared a package that looks
into the secret workings of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
All files MOVED TUESDAY:
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-MAIN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He was 21 when, in a flash of
anger, he slammed his 9-month-old niece to the floor because she
was crying. A cracked skull silenced her forever. Involuntary
manslaughter, the jury called it, and gave the man 18 years in
prison for his crime. He has done 10 and, because of ``good time''
laws that speed up the clock on sentences for good behavior, he is
scheduled to walk out of prison in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, three members of the state Board of Pardons
and Paroles sat inside a cluttered conference room in Northwest
Austin, deciding under what conditions the convicted baby-killer
will get his freedom. Same for a rapist with a preference for
14-year-old girls, a trigger-happy gangster who almost killed two
people, a longtime burglar who beat his girlfriend, a schizophrenic
arsonist and more than 100 other imprisoned criminals with
penchants for violence or sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Protect the public
</P>
<P>
   But the public is nowhere to be found. The deliberations take
place behind closed doors in an increasingly controversial process
by which Texas decides which criminals should be freed early from
prison, under what rules those convicts must live, even whether
execution-bound convicts should receive clemency.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Texas' biggest state secret. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-FILES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Not only are the meetings
secret where Texas paroles are decided, but so are the case files
that guide those decisions. Listing of information that would be
available. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-MEMBERS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles has 18 members, including the chairman. Annual salary
for the full-time job is $62,500; $65,000 for the chairman. All are
gubernatorial appointees who serve six-year terms. List of the
board members. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-COMPUTERS _ HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ It's just a laptop
computer, parole board member Rissie Owens says, ``and I haven't
really even learned how to use it yet.'' But officials hope it will
soon take Texas' archaic record-keeping system for parole and
clemency cases into the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been repeatedly criticized for its antiquated
and, at times, sloppy record keeping and is poised to go online
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-FIGURES _ Stats on numbers of prisoners released.
(Ward, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-PAROLE-CASES _ Thanks to the lock of secrecy on Texas' parole
files, law-abiding Texans normally can't see what parole board
members consider in deciding which criminals to free early from
prison _ and which ones to keep in. In an exclusive glimpse behind
those closed doors, parole officials recently allowed the
American-Statesman to review several case files _ with names
deleted so as not to violate state law. We culled through the files
and listed the information parole board members said was pertinent
to their decision. Read the facts. Cast your vote and then see how
the real board members decided each one. Your options are to
parole, deny parole, make convict serve all time remaining, or
review the case again in several month. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman)

MAN ADMITS KILLING TWO GIRLFRIENDS, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn man who phoned the police on Friday to say
that he had killed his girlfriend and his ex-girlfriend has been
charged with one of the murders and will be charged with the other,
law-enforcement officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives arrested the man, Lionel Michael King, 41, around
10:30 a.m. Friday at his home shortly after he called a 911
operator to report the crimes, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   They added that he has been charged with second-degree murder
and criminal possession of a weapon in the stabbing death of Patsy
Niles, the mother of his 5-year-old daughter, in her home in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Mary DeBourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney's
office, said that King would face similar charges in the killing of
Dionne DeSouza, 29, who was found stabbed to death at her home in
Queens. Ms. DeBourbon said King would most likely be arraigned
there on Monday or Tuesday after arraignments were completed in the
Brooklyn case.
</P>
<P>
   According to law-enforcement officials, King went to Ms.
DeSouza's home around 6 a.m. on Friday and began to argue with her
about their relationship. At some point he became violent, grabbing
a knife and stabbing her repeatedly in the neck and chest before
running out to his car and driving off, they said.
</P>
<P>
   King then drove to Brooklyn to the home of his former
girlfriend, Ms. Niles, 29. He confronted her around 7 a.m. near the
front door of the building where she lived, stabbed her repeatedly
and fled, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niles' sister-in-law, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that she and Ms. Niles' three children were
awakened by banging on the front door of the family's second-story
apartment. When the door was opened, the woman said, Ms. Niles fell
to the ground, saying: ``Mikey stabbed me. Please don't let me
die.'' She died of her wounds moments later, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody and confused, King then went to the apartment of another
woman he knew in Brooklyn and demanded to be let inside, the
officials said. When she refused his request, King started
confessing to the murders while sitting outside her door, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the woman was phoning a 911 operator to report the incident,
King took off again, this time returning to his apartment and
calling 911 himself. According to the police, he told the operator
about the murders and indicated that he wanted to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   The police found him inside his apartment, bleeding from several
wounds on his hands and arms. He was treated at Kings County
Hospital, where the police took him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   King had been charged 18 months ago with assaulting Ms. Niles,
but the charges were dropped when she refused to testify, the
police said.

SPORTS COLUMN: STEVENSON SAGA SHOWS THE INITIATION OF A RISING
STAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete photo note; there is no photo with this
story)   (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I met Alexandra Stevenson, in the late '80s, she
was a merry child in San Diego splashing through swimming lessons
and slamming a tennis ball over the net. She was big and strong for
her age, and her paternity _ all I knew then was that her father
was a famous former professional athlete _ promised major jock
genes. Her mellow sweetness was a contrast to her mother's
intensity. Later, I thought it might also be a result of it.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson, a friend and colleague, is always tenacious
as a freelance reporter, frequently for The New York Times, and
often tendentious as her daughter's protector. She once told me
that she had decided early that Alexandra, as a dark-skinned child
in a pale sport, needed to be armed with a skill to combat the
obstacles people would throw in her way. Early in the Wimbledon
tournament, Stevenson kicked up a fuss over prize money _ officials
were slow acknowledging Alexandra's professional status _ and this
was followed by her recounting racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled parents often inject their children with some of the
rages that fuel them. But Stevenson seemed to use her energy to
create a kind of psychic bubble, neither hothouse nor bunker, in
which Alexandra could find her personality and talents, and let
them flower. It was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Watching and listening, usually from a safe distance along a
telephone line, I don't remember a time in the last two decades
when Stevenson was not railing at some school, coach, official, or
other tennis parent for sexist or racist slights _ usually real,
though often subtle. Yet she usually managed to place herself
between Alexandra and the hit. Stevenson's access to the news media
_ including her candid diaries of the junior tennis life published
in World Tennis magazine and The Times _ seemed to antagonize and
intimidate the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked. To reach the Wimbledon semifinals at age 18, a
qualifier, unheralded yet highly schooled, and still an endearing
person, is a tribute to Mom. Alexandra is a rarity in sports these
days, a fine wine that was not uncorked before its time. For
Alexandra, the timing was critical, and beyond tennis; the factoid
frenzy over her paternity began early last week when The
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., published a copy of her
birth certificate listing Julius Winfield Erving 2nd as her father.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, the basketball Hall of Famer, now an Orlando Magic
executive, acknowledged paternity in a statement in which he also
said, ``I applaud her mother's efforts and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than money, which came through a lawyer, there was very
little contact between Erving and the Stevensons. Mother and father
knew each other in 1980, while he was playing for the Philadelphia
76ers and she was a sportswriter. Erving said he had met Alexandra
once, when she was 3. He has been married since 1972, and has four
children with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Stevenson has been circumspect, although
sometimes coy, about Alexandra's father. Stevenson always knew that
when Alexandra showed up on the back pages, her father would show
up on the front pages. The fact that she chose not to press the
issue or write about it _ even though her financial circumstances
have always seemed tenuous _ was a clear message to others to mind
their own business.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a valid news story now? Beats me. By the time I found out,
in recent years, that Erving was the father, it seemed only
genetically interesting. What was the point of disrupting the lives
of a dignified, thoughtful businessman and a shining young woman?
</P>
<P>
   Outing is usually done for the sake of a journalist's ambition
under the banner of the public's right to know, be it about Arthur
Ashe's AIDS or Greg Louganis' homosexuality, a story in which I
participated, for my own ambition.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting story, and one I hope Stevenson writes
herself, is the successful raising of a multiracial child by a
single white mother in one of the harshest sports environments.
Even nuclear families explode in tennis. The relationships between
parents and children are a study in dysfunction and sometimes
white-collar crime, and the addition of such parental figures as
coaches is frequently volatile.
</P>
<P>
   One of Alexandra's earliest coaches was Pete Fischer, who is
credited with outfitting Pete Sampras with his rocket serve.
Alexandra has a version of that serve. Fischer is in jail after
being convicted of molesting boys at his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, whom Alexandra beat in the
quarterfinals, knocked off Martina Hingis in an earlier round.
Jelena's father was recently arrested for disorderly conduct at a
tournament. Martina's longtime coach, her mother, was mysteriously
absent from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   My own fantasy was to see Alexandra and Steffi Graf in the final
_ Steffi made it; Alexandra didn't _ for a number of reasons, the
least of which had to do with theories on the importance of dads:
Herr Graf was jailed for tax evasion.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 49-year-old Brooklyn man casually walked into a Bay
Ridge hospital room on Saturday, killed his ailing father by
slashing his throat, and then struck both his sister and another
patient in the head with a hammer, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the attack occurred after the man, Joseph
Ranieri Jr. arrived at Victory Memorial Hospital to visit his
74-year-old father around noon.
</P>
<P>
   After killing his father, Joseph Ranieri Sr., Ranieri struck his
sister, Linda, 49, who was already visiting, and his father's
88-year-old roommate, Michael Dambrose, said Officer Chris
Cottingham, a police spokesman. Dambrose was taken to Lutheran
Medical Center in Brooklyn with serious head injuries, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cottingham said that hospital security officers stopped the
younger Ranieri as he was leaving the room. The police arrived
moments later and took Ranieri into custody. Cottingham said
Ranieri had not been charged, and investigators were questioning
him at the 68th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Ms. Ranieri was still at Victory Memorial
in serious condition, suffering from head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the telephone at the hospital on Saturday
said, ``There is no comment, and there is no one available at the
moment.''

NEW YORK YACHT CLUB PUTS BOSTON ON ITINERARY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It sounds like that Yankee-Red Sox thing again. But
this is about boats, not bats and balls. For the first time in more
than a century, the New York Yacht Club has included Boston as a
port of call during its annual cruise. The visit isn't going to
fill a grandstand with fans. But it is apt to elicit some of that
Fenway kind of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Bruce Berman, spokesman for Save the
Harbor/Save the Bay, a nonprofit Boston environmental group.
``We've invested $3.6 billion in cleaning up our harbor, but it
wasn't just for the seals and the porpoises. It was for the people,
too. We thought we could make Boston a destination port, and New
York's visit validates that.''
</P>
<P>
   To include Boston was a surprising move for a club known to be
more at home along the posh waterfronts of Newport, R.I., or
Nantucket, Mass. But even the most idyllic seaports can begin to
feel alike after a while. For all their New England charm, a
weathered clapboard house in Edgartown, Mass., takes on the same
gray tone as a sea-buffed porch in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Neither
has the look of the Boston skyline along commercial waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you can't keep going back to Edgartown and
Nantucket,'' said George ``Dooie'' Isdale Jr., commodore of the New
York Yacht Club. ``Boston Harbor has improved so much ecologically.
And it's an interesting, historic place for us to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Isdale persuaded his colleagues to include Boston in the cruise
itinerary. After all, a club with its home base on West 44th Street
in New York has a certain attachment to city life. That being said,
the club also has a popular waterfront annex in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's first annual cruise, from New York to Newport
in 1844, took place the year the club was founded. But commercial
traffic and increasing pollution in New York's waterways forced
members to seek purer and quieter passages after the turn of the
century. Now habits are changing as the city's harbor gets cleaner.
The club organized a weekend regatta in New York Harbor in 1994,
and the annual cruise next summer is scheduled to begin there.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston connection is far more remote. The last time the New
York Yacht Club sailed to Boston was in 1871. But these days,
Boston, too, is on the mend as city beaches become suitable for
swimming. A decade ago, its bays were infamous for the telltale
brown scum left along a yacht's waterline.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say all the murkiness is gone. After a heavy
rainfall, city sewers temporarily force a tributary stream into the
47-mile stretch of Boston's island perimeter. But on a good day,
the sea can be clear to 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 120 boats, both power and sail, are expected to
participate in the cruise to Boston. Ranging in size from 30 feet
to 135 feet, the yachts are being assigned dock accommodations all
along Boston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The yacht club trip begins in Newport July 16. The schedule then
calls for single-night stops in Massachusetts ports that include
Hadley Harbor, Marion, Provincetown, Plymouth and Marblehead. The
sojourn here in Boston, from July 21-23, is a two-night affair.
Local marina owners, ferry operators, restaurateurs and tour guides
are scurrying to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncommon thing is the number of boats,'' said Tom Cox,
general manager of Constitution Marina, a yacht harbor next to the
Boston Navy Yard in the Charlestown section of the city. ``Last
summer, we had 17 different flotillas here from yacht clubs within
100 miles of Boston. But this is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of yachts and commercial vessels is
particularly graphic at the Navy Yard. Sharing the skyline with
slender, twitchy sailboat masts is the USS Constitution, a
slumbering giant of a hull that Americans know as Old Ironsides.
Who among the visiting yacht skippers can envision standing watch
on an 18th-century sailing vessel that had a 500-man crew and
43,000 square feet of sail?
</P>
<P>
   Might the New York Yacht Club not be so noticeable in Boston
after all? ``When you see that many yachts traveling in company, it
will create a little stir here,'' said Lt. Eric Hahn, Boston's
harbor master. ``But they'll be assimilated into the city very
quickly.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT IS THIS, THE TAMMY WYNETTE STRATEGY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I made the major pitch, but Mrs. Clinton chimed in.'' _ Sen.
Charles Schumer on Hillary Clinton's role in a White House meeting
about aid to New York hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is making a pilgrimage to Oneonta, N.Y., this
week to ``visit'' with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she hopes
to replace in the Senate. If establishing an exploratory committee,
renting office space and hiring staff are not enough proof that
Mrs. Clinton is a serious candidate, this trip ought to do it.
Nobody travels to Oneonta without a really, really good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, last week there were signs that Mrs. Clinton has
not quite made the mental shift to candidate mode. She is stuck in
political limbo, with one foot on the campaign trail and the other
in the safe-house world of first-ladydom.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schumer, who will be the senior senator from New York
when Moynihan retires, set up a White House meeting last Thursday
on the effect of the president's Medicare plan on teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a number of these facilities, which spend a lot of
money caring for poor people and training new doctors. In the old
days, the teaching hospitals paid for these worthy but not
particularly remunerative activities by overcharging the patients
who were able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the health-care system has allegedly become efficient,
the hospitals are in danger of losing their shirts. Naturally,
Schumer is concerned. So is Dennis Rivera, the head of the hospital
workers union and a major player in New York Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   This was an excellent opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to
demonstrate that she is a politician separate and distinct from her
husband. The issue at hand, after all, is a pricey but technical
detail in a general policy that Schumer, and virtually every other
Democrat, endorses.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's aides wanted everybody to know that she came
to the meeting at Schumer's invitation, and that her interest in
teaching hospitals was longstanding and not at all restricted to
the ones in New York. They described, in a word, the attitude of a
first lady, not a Senate candidate steeped in the parochial
interests of the state where she may someday buy a home and
register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   And what did Mrs. Clinton do during the meeting itself? She
chimed in. Chiming is not as degrading as pouring tea or baking
cookies, but it does not exactly convey the impression of
forcefulness you want to give as a potential U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   The White House meeting had several purposes, including a
perfectly natural desire to pander to the powerful Rivera. The
participants may also have wanted to exchange information on the
problems of the teaching hospitals, although to tell the truth
everybody in the room was already pretty well grounded.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing it did not need to do was to make Schumer look
good. The man is not up for re-election for more than five years.
In the six months he has been in office, he has been on the evening
news about as often as Tom Brokaw, thanks to his position as a
leading advocate of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he tills his political truck garden so diligently
that Democrats in the remotest corners of upstate New York see him
more regularly than they see their dentists. ``Tell him enough
already,'' one of them pleaded recently.
</P>
<P>
   Why then, was Schumer describing himself as the star of the
meeting and putting Mrs. Clinton in a subsidiary role as yes-woman?
Granted, anybody who knows Schumer knows that it is frequently
difficult to get a word in edgewise. But if Mrs. Clinton had wanted
to be depicted as the chief champion of New York's interests, he
and the other participants would have said as much, even if she had
actually done nothing more than nod her head and order sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first lady went because she's concerned and she conveyed
those concerns in the meeting,'' said Howard Wolfson, press
secretary for the exploratory committee. Asked whether Mrs. Clinton
was participating in the meeting as first lady or Senate candidate,
he added, ``She's always the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's White House spokeswoman, agreed
that her employer attended the meeting in first lady mode, but
noted that she would trek up to Oneonta as a potential candidate.
As for the teaching hospitals, Ms. Berry said, ``she was glad to
come and hear what she knew to be grave concerns on these
institutions' part.'' You will note that Mrs. Clinton has now been
assigned a purely auditory role in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Deconstructing descriptions of a routine White House meeting
would be picky indeed if Mrs. Clinton's whole history was not one
of confusion over where her identity of wife ends and her own
political persona begins.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of women who originally liked the idea of first lady as a
policy-driven political partner were chagrined when Mrs. Clinton
turned out to be most popular and successful when she played the
role of supportive wife. No doubt Hillary Clinton felt pretty much
the same, and she may be frightened of letting go of that
restrictive but comfortable identity.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the political big time we are talking about, and if
Mrs. Clinton wants to run for office, she had better let go and
strike out on her own. Senators are not supposed to chime in.

OUTDOORS COLUMN: A THOUSAND-MILE SEARCH FOR STRIPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER KAMINSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In angling there are few second chances _ for the angler or the
fish. The striped bass, the supreme flyrod gamefish of the shallow
waters of the Northeast, is a happy exception.
</P>
<P>
   Like most marine resources, stripers were, until recently,
treated as if they were a harvest-at-will species that would
naturally replenish itself. Under the right circumstances that is
true, but only if female stripers are allowed to reach sexual
maturity at the age of 8 years.
</P>
<P>
   When low size limits and unlimited bag limits led to a depletion
of these crucial Year 8 stripers, the Chesapeake Bay fishery, by
far the region's largest, nearly disappeared. In response, strict
controls designed to insure that the Chesapeake females were able
to reproduce sparked a dramatic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   This policy had a halo effect on Hudson River fish because they
experience their greatest mortality when they descend to the ocean
in late spring (the same protected waters that the Chesapeake fish
migrate to in the warmer months). According to Kathy Hattala, a New
York state fisheries biologist, the striper population boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the cleaning up of New York Harbor waters and with
it, the removal of the pollution block that kept young stripers
from moving to nurseries in Jamaica and Raritan Bays, as well as
the western Long Island Sound, and you have the current bumper
crop.
</P>
<P>
   I saw living, breathing, breeding proof of this in a
thousand-mile striper pilgrimage that I made this season. It began
in early May when my brother Don and I drove down to the tidal
flats where the Susquehanna River empties into Chesapeake Bay and
ended last week on Long Island's Great South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That first trip, on a windy, cast-defeating day on the
Chesapeake, we joined the flyrod guide Joe Evans for an
experimental one-week window during the spawning season. Lured by a
friend's report of a 30-pounder sighted, hooked and landed in
shallow water, we had no such luck although we did catch and
release a dozen smaller stripers along the rocky shores of the bay.
But for the most part, the stripers were more interested in
spawning than eating.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was a wadeable flat 300 miles north, just upriver from
the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge in New York state. The Catskills
flyrod guide Ray Ottulich had spent a good part of the off-season
researching the striper possibilities in the river.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm late May day we tramped through woods full of new
leaves and flowering dogwood. The Adirondacks guide Tom Akstens
joined us, and we waded out into the river and began casting
Clouser Minnows. We spent about five hours fishing the end of the
swing in the tide without a hit. I was losing faith.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Hattala showed up leading a two-boat expedition of
scientists and volunteers. Would we mind, she asked, if her team
set out their haul seine where we were fishing? We offered to help
and within 10 minutes we had pulled stripers up to 25 pounds from
the same water we had fished. One big female had bloody sides as a
result of insistent males rubbing up against her _ a sure sign of
spawning activity.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to head for the ocean, I figured. Surely, the
Chesapeake fish had begun to make their move to their summer range
along the mid-Atlantic coast. And on a hot, early June day, I drove
to Staten Island and joined Franck Crescitelli and Dino Torinos on
their flyfishing boat out of Great Kills Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Brigades of screaming gulls slashing and diving along a tidal
rip opposite Coney Island caught our attention. We eased into the
feathery mayhem and were soon fast to bluefish. We backed off from
the school and put on sinking lines. Stripers, especially big ones,
are often found on the periphery of schools of blues. It's nice
when angling logic and reality move in tandem. Within an hour we
had caught a half-dozen stripers _ the largest a 29-incher.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it wouldn't be long before I heard reports of big
stripers showing up on the white sandy flats of Long Island, my
favorite place for striper flyrodding. Last week Barry Kanavy
called from his bay house in the Great South Bay to confirm my
intuition. I invited Alan Harding, a Carroll Gardens chef, to come
along and to bring his spices.
</P>
<P>
   I had hoped for a sunny day that would allow for sight fishing.
Of course, heavy overcast and fog enveloped us. Still, we were
there and so were the fish. A bayman _ his buckets full of clams _
gestured that there were fish farther down the channel between two
grassy islands. We quickly caught two bluefish, assuring dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I tied on a popping bug as Kanavy poled us along a productive
flat. A striper lunged at my fly, looking like a large linebacker
about to engulf a small quarterback. When I missed, Kanavy
chastised me for lifting the rod rather than striking with my line
hand first.
</P>
<P>
   I double-hauled hard and put the fly back in the same spot and
gave it a few loud pops. The striper came for it again. I drove the
hook home and he was on. That's what I mean by stripers being a
second-chance fish. Once you interest them, you can tease them back
for a another look if they haven't felt the point of the hook.
Then, Harding, who hadn't been fishing since he was a boy, hooked a
beautiful 30-inch striper on spinning tackle. We kept that one for
the chef.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the bay house we opened a cold chablis, Kanavy put Van
Morrison on the boom box and we set about making a meal. Harding
took the helm at the stove, while Kanavy's brother-in-law Phil
Potak, a playwright, filled two buckets with salt water so the
clams could purge themselves of mud. As an appetizer, Harding
dusted the bluefish with crushed peanuts and wrapped the cooked
meat in rice crepes filled with fresh savoy cabbage, lemongrass
pickle and cellophane noodles. It was to my knowledge the world's
first South Vietnamese-style summer rolls made with bluefish.
</P>
<P>
   We dunked them in a mix of fermented fish sauce, chili paste and
sugar cane juice that could wake the dead. More wine followed, then
the striper, which was simply pan-fried. After dinner, Phil read
from his plays and I dozed off to sleep which, I realized the next
morning, was the first time that I had fallen asleep to the sound
of a man reading stories since I was 5 years old.

REAL ESTATE: TWO WATERFRONT BUILDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO TO BE
RENOVATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Next month, almost 10 years after public
officials removed part of an elevated freeway in the Embarcadero
district here, private developers plan to start rehabilitating the
first of two historic waterfront buildings that had been largely
hidden from view by the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Work on both structures, Pier One and the historic Ferry
Building, is part of a plan to reclaim large parts of San
Francisco's waterfront that were difficult or uninviting to walk to
when the freeway existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a real opportunity to rehab these buildings,
which are just gems,'' said Jennifer Sobol, development project
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   First to be renovated will be the 90,000-square-foot Pier One, a
building that served as a sugar warehouse. The developer is the AMB
Corp., which has leased the building from the Port of San Francisco
and plans to redevelop it as office space. The port agency, which
occupies space in the Ferry Building, has agreed to be a tenant in
the rehabilitated warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the developer itself plans to occupy another part
of the building. The building's character complements the business
of the developer, a real estate investment trust that invests in
transportation-related industrial properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is unique and very symbolic of our business,''
said Janice Thacher, regional manager for asset management at AMB.
</P>
<P>
   The $38 million project is expected to be completed in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1931, the Pier One building, with its fortress-like
facade, was the last structure to be completed in a City Beautiful
plan for the San Francisco waterfront. The City Beautiful movement
promoted classical architecture and formal, European-inspired
planning in the first two decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The building recalls San Francisco's largely vanished role as a
commercial port. During its heyday into the 1950s, ships deposited
refined sugar at the warehouse, where workmen then loaded freight
cars of the Southern Pacific Railroad that lined up on a rail spur
along the southern side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The building also accommodated ferry passengers with a
second-story gallery for disembarkation from the upper decks of the
ferryboats of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Pier One stopped being a warehouse in the 1960s because the
building could not accommodate the cargo containers that have
become the dominant mode of shipping goods. In recent years, Pier
One has been a parking garage for downtown business commuters.
</P>
<P>
   The old warehouse has a high central space that runs the length
of the building. To convert the warehouse into modern office space,
the San Francisco-based architectural firm of Simon Martin-Vegue
Winkelstein Moris plans to leave the central section of the office
building open, while providing mezzanine-like ``partial floors''
that will flank the open section on both sides. The partial floors
will add 50,000 square feet of floor space to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The openness of the plan, according to Dan Cheetham, the project
designer, preserves the abundant natural light that is one of the
building's most attractive features.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitated Pier One building will include a
2,100-square-foot ``history walk'' that will have metal inlays in
the floorway indicating the original path of the rail tracks that
guided trains inside the building. The original tracks will not be
removed, but will be hidden by a new floor. The trains had entered
the building on a floor that was several feet lower than the rest
of the building.
</P>
<P>
   To provide more access to the waterfront, the architects have
also designed a so-called apron around the building that allows
pedestrians to walk out on the 700-foot length of the pier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cathy J. Simon, a principal of Simon
Martin-Vegue Winkelstein Moris, said she did not want to erase the
rough edges of the building's warehouse years entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to keep the building's industrial character,
as well as making it a people place, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for a large-scale planning effort in the Embarcadero
started in 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake caused widespread
damage throughout the Bay Area, including the structure of the
elevated Embarcadero Freeway in front of the ferry building.
</P>
<P>
   The freeway was so severely damaged in the earthquake that state
highway officials soon dismantled it in 1991. The Port Commission
of San Francisco, the city agency that has jurisdiction over the
city's waterfront, created the Port of San Francisco Waterfront
Land Use Plan for a 7.5-mile stretch that covers much of the city's
bay front from Fisherman's Wharf to India Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1997, the plan calls for historic preservation of a
number of buildings, including the Ferry Building, Pier One and
others on or along the Embarcadero's outmoded ``finger piers.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Embarcadero Freeway restored the Ferry
Building, with its distinctive tower, to its prominence as a
landmark in the San Francisco skyline. That prominence is all the
more important because it stands at the visual end point of Market
Street, the city's ``main street.''
</P>
<P>
   Renovation of the 250,000-square-foot Ferry Building, by
Cornerstone Properties, is expected to begin in January 2001. The
building, said Ms. Simon, the architect who is designing the
renovation, is ``the diamond in the necklace'' on the San Francisco
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The two upper stories of the century-old building will be
rehabilitated as office space, while the first level will be a
market hall devoted largely to food. The developers are studying a
proposal to remove parts of the second floor, recreating a
continuous ``nave'' similar to the one that that once ran the
600-foot-length of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its prominence as a landmark, the building is meaningful
to San Francisco because it is one of the few major buildings to
have survived the 1906 earthquake and the subsequent fires that
ravaged much of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Under construction in front of the Ferry Building is a large
plaza that features two ``light cannons'' capable of projecting a
pair of column-like shafts of light into the night air. The
designer is ROMA Design Group of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials see the Ferry Building's renovation as a way to
re-establish it as a transportation hub. For the first time in
decades, the Muni light-rail system is being rerouted to stop
directly in front of the Ferry Building.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 earthquake ``was a tragedy, but it also opened up the
whole city,'' said Ms. Sobol, the port official, adding that it
``allowed us to connect the waterfront with the city again.'' The
removal of the freeway ``opens up the view of the water,'' she
said, ``and has reactivated interest in the waterfront.''

   MOLD-ILLNESSES-2TAKES (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Stachybotrys atra is
a greenish-black, slimy mold that thrives on water and construction
materials such as wallboard that contain cellulose. Evidence is
mounting that the mold might be a health threat responsible for a
host of hard-to-diagnose medical problems. Researchers have
identified the mold as the likely cause of potentially fatal lung
bleeding in infants. They've linked it to asthma and other
respiratory problems. And they've named it a suspect in
sick-building and chronic-fatigue syndromes. By ALAN BAVLEY. Story

   SMALL-CLASSES (Undated) _ Kansas and Missouri together will

more than 700 teachers in a new federal effort to reduce the size
of first-, second- and third-grade classes. The Class Size
Reduction Program is mainly aimed at districts with high levels of
poverty, although suburban and rural districts will receive a cut,
too. By JIM SULLINGER. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

   FISHER COLUMN (MEXICO, Mo.) _ Last weekend this community
saluted its angel _ grayish-white muck that turns into a
semi-gelatinous goop when damp, much to the delight of children and
the fuming of back-road motorists. Mexico honored clay. Clay is
common as dirt, maybe more so since it's usually what's under dirt.
Except in Mexico a particular type of clay is king, a substance
that's brought wealth to this part of the state; provided jobs for
generations of residents; helped hurl men into space; and, on a
more down-to-earth note, meant youngsters here have all the clay
they want to play with. By JIM FISHER. Story will move in the ``a''

NEWS MYSTERY ILLNESSES LINKED TO A WATER-LOVING MOLD

 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened suddenly last December to 1-month-old William Rippy
of Kansas City, Mo. His mother, Jodie Atherton, found him crying in
pain. She picked him up. His breathing sounded funny. He began to
pant.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton got William to the Children's Mercy emergency room,
where doctors saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was drowning in his own fluids,'' hospital pediatrician Ken
Wible said. ``They were sucking blood from his endotracheal tube.''
</P>
<P>
   William remained in the hospital for a week. Meantime, Flappan
visited his home and discovered the likely cause of William's
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Above the closet of the baby's room was a leak in the roof.
Stachybotrys was growing on the closet wall and ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   William's father scrubbed out the closet and the roof leak was
repaired. William has been healthy since.
</P>
<P>
   Many buildings harbor Stachybotrys, said David Straus, a
professor of microbiology at Texas Tech University who investigates
complaints of sick-building syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome refers to a collection of maladies in people,
including runny eyes and noses and flulike symptoms caused by
indoor air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last year of sick-building syndrome in 48
schools along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, Straus found that most
had problems with either Penicillium mold, which can cause allergic
reactions such as hay fever, or Stachybotrys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we find Stachybotrys in a school, it correlates very
nicely with sick-building syndrome,'' Straus said.
</P>
<P>
   Stachybotrys forced the Missouri Division of Youth Services last
year to close the program at an office for children who have had
run-ins with the law. Those children now attend a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   The mold appeared after the building was flooded by rains last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was growing 12 to 15 inches up the wall. In the cabinets.
It was everywhere,'' said Gail Mumford, the division's regional
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members weren't very concerned at first. Then came the
headaches, runny noses and itchy eyes.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the mold, the state moved its employees from the first
floor to the second floor, which was Stachybotrys-free.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say Stachybotrys doesn't deserve to be called a
lethal mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been well known that mold in general is related to
respiratory symptoms...,'' Mannino said. ``Virtually no one at CDC
says anymore that toxic molds kill babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who investigated cases of infant lung bleeding in
Chicago and Detroit were unable to find the same link to
Stachybotrys discovered in Cleveland, Mannino said.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between Stachybotrys and deadly illness remains
controversial among some scientists because it's very difficult to
prove, said Berlin Nelson, a professor of plant pathology at North
Dakota State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there's enough evidence that if you inhale enough
of it you're going to get sick. But we don't know how much you have
to inhale,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Removing Stachybotrys can be an expensive and laborious process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary when they come out in their full-body suits
and respirators,'' said Laurie Chubb about the workers who removed
Stachybotrys from the basement playroom of her Overland Park house
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Workers pulled up carpet and padding, ripped apart a built-in
cabinet, and tore out insulation and wallboard. Anything that
couldn't be removed was bleached. The bill was $765, although the
cost can range from $1,000 to $1,500 per room.
</P>
<P>
   But Laurie and her husband, Steve, consider that money well
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, their son Brian, now 3, had a constant runny
nose, wheezing and a cough like a smoker's hack every morning and
evening. Just after his second birthday, he was diagnosed with
asthma. His doctor prescribed four kinds of inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chubbs had Flappan inspect their house. She found
significant amounts of airborne mold spores in Brian's room and the
playroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Chubbs moved Brian into his older brother's bedroom. They
had the air ducts and carpets cleaned and installed an electronic
furnace filter.
</P>
<P>
   Mold levels declined, but Brian still had asthma attacks.
Flappan made another visit. Laurie Chubb pointed out discolored
wallboard from a basement leak: It tested positive for
Stachybotrys.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Chubbs had their playroom ripped out. Brian's
symptoms have disappeared. He no longer needs asthma medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in our minds that Stachybotrys was the cause
of the problem,'' Laurie Chubb said.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners are choosing to litigate when faced with water
damage and Stachybotrys.
</P>
<P>
   Jan and Anita Fichman became the talk of south Leawood last year
when they wrapped blue plastic sheeting around their $500,000
Hallbrook house to keep out water.
</P>
<P>
   They sued Hallbrook Realty, their builder and others, saying
faulty construction let water into the house and allowed
Stachybotrys to grow inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said the mold caused them and their two young sons to
have recurring eye irritation, sinus infections, headaches and
other allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Fichmans eventually removed the plastic and settled their
lawsuit, but they are prohibited by terms of the settlement from
discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Research into Stachybotrys is under way at several medical
centers to discover how the mold causes illness.
</P>
<P>
   Dearborn of Case Western Reserve has found that newborn rats
will die of lung bleeding when quantities of Stachybotrys spores
are put into their lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But he still is trying to explain how human infants might die by
inhaling small amounts of spores.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for doubts about Stachybotrys' role in illness is
that the mold often does not turn up in cultures from air samples.
That's because the airborne spores die quickly, Dearborn said, even
though their toxins remain dangerous for years.
</P>
<P>
   Dearborn is working with the EPA on new genetic tests to
identify molds from spores in air samples.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence against Stachybotrys is strong enough already
to warrant caution, said Efross of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait for the definitive answer of how it gets from
point A to B,'' he said. ``There is obviously a connection between
Stachybotrys and bad health effects. The thing to do is avoid it.''

NEWS MYSTERY ILLNESSES LINKED TO A WATER-LOVING MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For about six months last year, the McGuire
household in Lee's Summit, Mo., was under siege by a little-known
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Amy, 15, was sidelined by chronic bronchitis and abdominal
pains. Her mother, Julie, was knocked out by fever and chills. Her
father, Steve, suffered bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a home inspection by Children's Mercy Hospital last
summer discovered the culprit: Stachybotrys atra, a greenish-black,
slimy mold that thrives on water and construction materials such as
wallboard that contain cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   Mold spores had been released into their house, the McGuires
realized, when a handyman replaced a leaky shower in their
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told people, they thought I was crazy. ... People just
don't want to believe mold can do that,'' Julie McGuire recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence is mounting that Stachybotrys might be a health
threat responsible for a host of hard-to-diagnose medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have identified the mold as the likely cause of
potentially fatal lung bleeding in infants. They've linked it to
asthma and other respiratory problems. And they've named it a
suspect in sick-building and chronic-fatigue syndromes.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists remain skeptical, saying Stachybotrys isn't more
harmful than other molds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a huge overreaction,'' said Dave Mannino, a lung
specialist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. ``Cynics say it's a chance to make money by charging
for remediation the way asbestos is removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stachybotrys (pronounced ``stacky-botris'') has been found in
houses, schools and office buildings nationwide. It can lurk inside
walls, behind wallpaper, under carpets or on ceiling tiles where
water leaks offer a breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, the mold has slowed construction of a
federal courthouse in St. Louis and forced the closing of a public
library in New York City. In the Kansas City area, Stachybotrys
recently was implicated as the cause of illnesses in an aging state
office building downtown and in a Hallbrook mansion in Leawood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a missing link to a lot of questions we've had,''
said Sue Flappan, a Children's Mercy industrial hygienist. ``We've
had patients go from doctor to doctor without any explanation of
what is wrong. Once they get rid of the Stachybotrys problem, their
life gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   Flappan inspects the homes of children like Amy McGuire whose
respiratory ailments aren't responding to treatment. Flappan also
has been called to schools, offices and nursing homes where there
have been unexplained illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 of 69 buildings Flappan has examined in the past two
years, she has found Stachybotrys. Where the mold was cleaned up,
health problems have lessened or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been surprised,'' Flappan said. ``This mold is supposed
to be very infrequent, very rare. It's a lot more common problem
than we ever thought it would be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many other molds, Stachybotrys can trigger runny noses,
sneezes and other allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But it also produces toxins that can cause memory and mood
changes or flulike symptoms that include fatigue, sore throats,
headaches and difficulty breathing, said Eckardt Johanning, a
physician and environmental health specialist with Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stachybotrys also might be responsible for some cases of
chronic-fatigue syndrome, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In medical school we didn't learn this. Among my colleagues,
this mold stuff is brand new,'' Johanning said. ``But I would rate
it higher than solvents or lead or asbestos'' as an indoor
environmental hazard. ``It's a big public health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no indoor air-quality standards to limit exposure to
Stachybotrys or other molds, said Sidney Efross of the indoor air
section of the Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the general consensus is mold doesn't belong inside,''
Efross said. ``There's probably nothing we can call a safe level''
of Stachybotrys.
</P>
<P>
   Stachybotrys began receiving national attention in 1997 after
researchers in Cleveland linked the mold to serious and
occasionally fatal lung bleeding in 21 infants. The infants lived
in inner-city homes that had water damage from flooding or plumbing
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged doctors to
try to ensure that infants were not be exposed to chronically
moldy, water-damaged environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Stachybotrys can produce severe
toxins. If people don't remediate (water damage), they can get very
severe illness,'' said Dorr Dearborn, a pediatrician at Case
Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, who
helped discover the connection between the illnesses and
Stachybotrys.
</P>
<P>
   Infants might be particularly vulnerable to Stachybotrys because
their lungs are growing fast, Dearborn said.
</P>
<P>
   As their lungs develop, capillaries grow to supply the lungs
with blood. Stachybotrys produces toxins called trichothecenes,
which inhibit production of a protein called collagen that makes
capillaries strong.
</P>
<P>
   If a baby's lungs are stressed by illness or secondhand tobacco
smoke, capillaries weakened by trichothecenes could burst, Dearborn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cleveland cases, lung bleeding in infants has been
reported throughout the United States.

IN MEXICO, THEY TAKE QUIET PRIDE IN THEIR FIREBRICK CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO, Mo. _ Name a product _ sorghum, pumpkins, outhouses _ or
a person _ Mark Twain, Jesse James, Harry S. Truman _ and likely as
not somewhere in Missouri it or they are marked by a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend this community saluted its angel _ grayish-white
muck that turns into a semi-gelatinous goop when damp, much to the
delight of children and the fuming of back-road motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico honored clay.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, that may sound nuts. Clay is common as dirt,
maybe more so since it's usually what's under dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Mexico a particular type of clay is king, a substance
that's brought wealth to this part of the state; provided jobs for
generations of residents; helped hurl men into space; and, on a
more down-to-earth note, meant youngsters here have all the clay
they want to play with.
</P>
<P>
   An even closer look might suggest clay _ the kind that formed in
this part of Missouri 300 million years ago _ could be honored by
more than just residents of this small town. Without it, modern
life would be vastly different _ the mass production of steel,
aluminum, cement, glass and a host of other goods would be nearly
impossible or far more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, what received recognition here were the huge beds
of fire clay that underlie Mexico and a good part of the
surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Mined from open pits, then molded, formed, cast, even sprayed
pneumatically, the fire clay is transformed at plants here into the
refractories that direct and control the tremendous heat needed by
the ```furnaces of industry'' _ from blast furnaces to ships'
boilers, cement kilns to aluminum smelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away fire clay, and society as we know it goes poof,''
said Charles R. Stribling III, chairman of the board of the
Missouri Military Academy at Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely basic. But most people have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Stribling was walking across the lawn of Presser Hall southeast
of downtown, where the third annual Clay Days U.S.A. was in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Tents were on the grounds, and inside them were pottery artists'
creations. There was a demonstration where people could use several
pottery wheels to make bowls and jars and plates on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The only local potter of about a dozen on hand was John
Tsikalas, a native of Greece who taught high school English here
for almost three decades. ``Mr. T.,'' as he is known locally, said
on retirement he jumped into pottery with both feet. His creations
have a Grecian style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is great,'' Mr. T. said. ``All these people. And
clay. Clay is our heritage here in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   On the northeast corner of the lawn a group of young people were
building a demonstration kiln out of bricks contributed by Harbison
Walker, formerly A.P. Green Industries, which along with Mexico
Refractories, now National Refractories, made Mexico into the
``Firebrick Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The potters were the best attractions organizers could think
of to tout the observance,'' said Sue Caine, executive vice
president of the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, fire clay isn't exactly sexy. It's just clay.
And most ordinary people aren't out in their back yards
constructing kilns out of firebrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted was clay to be the centerpiece. And who else
does clay? Potters. So this is about as close as we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Which apparently was close enough. About 2,000 people showed up
over two days, wandered among the booths and bought some of the
pots, statuary and other wares _ plus souvenirs _ and had a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the youngsters who were elbow-deep in a huge box of
the fire clay sent over by Harbison Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not as good as what you'd buy at a hobby shop,''
said Becky Erdel, an art teacher at Mexico High School. ``Not for
molding. It's just different. See, there are little grains of rock
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But kids don't care. Clay is clay to a kid. Just look.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is Erdel's contention that more clay makes happier
kids. Name a better way, she said, to get children absolutely
involved than when they're kneading, pummeling, molding and forming
something out of clay. Clay busies idle hands, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stack, the geologist for Harbison Walker, says the clay
in Audrain and surrounding counties is of an unusual purity that,
once turned into firebrick and its cousins, can sustain extreme
heat and reactive chemical compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the veins are almost on the surface, some of it is
several feet down,'' said Stack. ``What we take is usually within
20 feet of the surface. Deeper than that and the cost goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, clay has been our oil or gold,'' said Leta Hodge, a
local historian who recently wrote a history of Audrain County.
</P>
<P>
   Fire clay was discovered here in the 1870s, but the industry of
refining and processing it into a salable product began fitfully.
It did not reach its stride until A.P. Green _ who incidentally was
the grandfather of Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri _ bought out an
existing firebrick plant in Mexico. The industry soon copied his
methods of mechanization, use of electricity and new manufacturing
processes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, J.B. Arthur, one of Green's lieutenants, broke away and
started Mexico Refractories Co. Competition between the two
companies was fierce. For years there was an informal rule against
Mexico Refractories employees dating, let alone marrying, an A.P.
Green worker, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said the long haul from mined clay to finished fire bricks
in naval ship boilers, on the Saturn rockets' launch pads or any of
a thousand other uses seemed to cultivate a conservative streak in
folks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here don't flaunt things,'' Hodge said. ``I think in
the last 20 years people have started to look and see what's been
important to their town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known about the fire clay. We've always
appreciated it. But it's not something broadcast or played up. It
was just here.''

GOALS OF FEDERAL EDUCATION DOLLARS ARE MORE TEACHERS, SMALLER
CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When school starts in a couple of months, little Johnny's
teacher might be in the classroom on Uncle Sam's dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Missouri together will receive $30 million from the
U.S. Department of Education to hire more than 700 teachers in a
new federal effort to reduce the size of first-, second- and
third-grade classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Class Size Reduction Program is mainly aimed at districts
with high levels of poverty, although suburban and rural districts
will receive a cut, too.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say smaller classes result in more individual
attention for students and improved reading skills _ a foundation
for future learning. The goal is an average national classroom size
of 18 students in those early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas education officials said the $9.5 million they expect
should put between 200 and 250 additional teachers into
primary-grade classrooms. Educators in Missouri said the $20.5
million slated for that state should produce about 500 new
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Moe, director of communications for the Missouri State
Teachers Association, said that number wasn't much when you
consider that 60,000 teachers currently work in Missouri public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spread out over 12 grades, the numbers are not that
significant,'' he said. ``But apply those teachers to the early
grades and the impact looks more significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by President Clinton, the Republican-led Congress
approved a spending bill last year that included $1.2 billion for
30,000 new teachers nationwide. Clinton eventually wants 100,000
new teachers at a cost of $11 billion over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies cited by the Department of Education have shown
that a pupil-teacher ratio of 18-to-1 or less improves a student's
ability to learn in the early grades. Those studies are presented
in more detail at the department's Web site, www.ed.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The money appropriated last year began flowing to state
treasuries Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the metropolitan area, schools in Jackson, Clay, Platte and
Cass counties will be eligible for almost $3.5 million, or 17
percent of Missouri's total. The biggest share of area money _ $1.6
million _ will go to the Kansas City, Mo., School District.
</P>
<P>
   Alsia Cunningham, interim director of consolidated federal
programs for the Kansas City, Mo., district, said one new
third-grade teacher would be added in each of 24 schools this fall.
She said efforts to find and hire those teachers began in April.
</P>
<P>
   She said that would reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 18-to-1 in
those classes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a national teacher shortage, Cunningham said she was
optimistic the new teachers could be found.
</P>
<P>
   The district plans to set aside 15 percent of the money for
staff development and extensive training, because many of these
teachers will be new to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to throw them into a situation and leave them
there,'' Cunningham said. ``We want to prepare teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the district wouldn't get to use all of the $1.6
million. She said about $300,000 to $400,000 would have to be set
aside for new teachers in charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the Kansas side, the Kansas City, Kan., School District will
receive $929,000 of the $1.86 million scheduled to go to schools in
Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Murray, assistant superintendent of personnel in Kansas
City, Kan., said the district planned to add 28 teachers with the
money _ 26 at the elementary level and two in middle school.
</P>
<P>
   She said class sizes in the early grades there currently
averaged about 20 pupils. She said the new teachers should reduce
that number to about 18.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Dennis, assistant education commissioner in Kansas, said
putting a teacher in a classroom took an annual average of $37,000
in salary and benefits. Missouri educators said that was close to
the average cost there.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said that average cost dropped when applied only to
elementary teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas, officials
estimate they will add eight to 12 teachers using their $353,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee Mission has 2,100 teachers. The pupil-teacher ratio in
elementary grades there is 17.7 students for each teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Bartkowski, a district spokeswoman, said the goal was to
reduce that ratio to 17-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us reach that goal,'' she said. ``Every little
bit helps.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit is the amount many rural districts will be getting.
</P>
<P>
   East Lynne School District in rural Cass County, for example,
has one school building, about 200 children and a principal, Dan
Doerhoff, who doubles as the district superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The district is scheduled to receive $3,760, which won't even
come close to adding a teacher. The school's largest class is
kindergarten, with 20 students projected for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there was enough money for another teacher, would I
divide the 20 by two and end up with two classes of 10?'' Doerhoff
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said the money for East Lynne would be used for staff
development and training.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said that Kansas lawmakers had talked about using state
money to reduce class sizes but that no measure had passed the
Kansas House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and educators worry that the federal money will
flow for a few years and then stop _ leaving state and local
taxpayers with the responsibility of paying for the federal
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the intent of providing more teachers is on target,
there are challenges facing many schools,'' Missouri Education
Commissioner Robert Bartman said. ``School people are reluctant to
commit to this as their budget item, for example, by hiring a new
staff member during the first year, without some level of comfort
that the money will also be there next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for those school districts scrapped for space, it's also
more difficult to hire teachers anyway. Where are you going to put
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Snowbarger, an Olathe, Kan., Republican, was a member of
Congress last year when the appropriation was approved. Snowbarger
said he voted for the bill, which included many other spending
measures but opposed the money for class-size reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Kansas City, Kan., which benefits from any federal
program based on a socioeconomic criteria, the rest of the (3rd
Congressional District in Kansas) wasn't likely to gain that much
from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current congressman from Kansas' 3rd District, Democrat
Dennis Moore, said he supported the president's efforts to put more
teachers in the classroom and expected a move this year in Congress
to appropriate money for even more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be difficult to predict, however, whether the
U.S. government would continue funding these teachers in future
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's required to take this money,'' he said. ``They have
the option of picking it up or letting it lapse. It's not like an
unfunded mandate. If it proves effective, then I'd be hopeful the
school boards would do everything they could to continue it in the
future.''

 &HT;    Millwood mystifies New York
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was two years ago this month that Kevin Millwood
found himself on a plane to Atlanta, a minor-league pitcher of
uncertain pedigree wondering if baseball really had a place for
him. As the Braves' season reached the midway point Saturday
afternoon, the same young man was utterly unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood became the Braves' first 10-game winner with a two-hit,
eight-inning performance that compares with anything this staff has
produced this year as the Braves shut out the Mets for the third
consecutive game, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   New York attempts to avert the sweep tonight against John Smoltz
but the second-place Mets have lost four of five to the Braves this
year and stand 4-13 against them the past two seasons. The Braves
lead the division by five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said when we started playing these guys that we wanted to
try and keep them down,'' said Millwood, who has lost just once in
his past 10 starts. ``We don't want to give them any games or let
them get some wind in their sails.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Millwood guy,'' opposing starter Al Leiter said, ``is
definitely nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan made the difference with a two-out, two-run home
run in the fifth, his 16th of the season and 100th of his career.
Eddie Perez added an insurance RBI in the sixth. John Rocker
replaced Millwood after a leadoff walk in the ninth and recorded
his 17th save, stranding two men.
</P>
<P>
   The loss marked the first time in Mets' history they have been
shut out by the same team in three consecutive games. Since New
York's 10-2 win last Friday at Turner Field, the Braves have held
them at a .125 average while outscoring them 27-5.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (10-4) struck out six while winning his fourth in four
starts. Of his past 40 innings, opponents have gone hitless in 26.
He leads the club in strikeouts with 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best pitching performances I've seen
anywhere this year,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``Anywhere. Against
us, for us, on TV, American League. Anywhere.

 &HT;    Rocker's chances diminished
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker figures he needed one, perhaps two more
saves and drop his ERA a couple of points. The word from San Diego
is it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Though he readily admits his five-run implosion in Montreal on
Tuesday night cost him a chance at making the National League
All-Star team, Rocker has not given up hope. Nor has his manager,
Bobby Cox, who has spoken in his behalf several times in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, San Diego's Bruce Bochy, who will manage the NL team,
has intimated John Smoltz is the only Braves pitcher he has under
consideration. That holds even if Smoltz is selected and opts not
to go to save wear on his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before (the Montreal loss), I thought my chances were pretty
good,'' said Rocker, who picked up his 17th save in Saturday's 3-0
victory against the Mets. ``I usually set goals and if I give up a
run, it'll fire me up to try and pitch 10 scoreless innings. And I
think I was on eight scoreless innings until Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been able to throw two more scoreless and get two
more saves, I think that would have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have. But with his ERA up from 1.77 to 2.89 this week,
Rocker admits his candidacy has faltered behind the league's
foremost closers. San Francisco's Robb Nen has four blown saves to
Rocker's three but still leads the league with 21 saves. Houston's
Billy Wagner entered Saturday with 19 saves and a 1.87 ERA. Trevor
Hoffman (20 saves) is a snap choice for his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up against veterans, you've got to have numbers
that are at least equal if not better,'' Rocker said. ``More often
than not, they're going to go with the veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   The education of Simon
</P>
<P>
   With New York left-hander Al Leiter working, rookie first
baseman Randall Simon was out of the lineup after 15 consecutive
starts that changed his season. During that span, he hit .478 and
is 9-for-15 (.600) on the trip. His average down to .232 on June
13, he enters tonight's game hitting .333.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is new patience at the plate. While the club
will not discourage Simon from customarily swinging at the first
pitch, he has become more selective. After drawing just five walks
in his first 32 games, he has walked seven times in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Where the league was successful at pitching to Simon up and away
out of the strike zone, pitchers are now reconsidering his weak
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pitching me all sorts of ways,'' Simon said.
``Sometime you can see them talking to each other. They're throwing
balls to try and make me chase. I'm just trying to do better. I'm a
good hitter. ... At first, I was swinging at everything. But
playing more makes you adjust to all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm just looking in one zone and looking for my pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Home run king Hank Aaron was honored before the game as part of
Major League Baseball's 35-year celebration of homer No. 715. The
Mets presented him with a $15,000 check for his Chasing The Dream
Foundation. ... Tough weekend for Andruw Jones. A Brian Hunter foul
ball almost picked him off in the dugout in the fourth inning
Saturday. Friday night, he struck out against emergency reliever
Matt Franco. ``I only take pitchers deep,'' Jones said. ``I don't
take third basemen deep.

 &HT;    U.S. defense in good hands with Scurry
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ There have been games where Briana Scurry
looks about as busy as the Maytag repairman, as the U.S. women's
soccer team rolls up lopsided results generally with ease. But when
the American defense breaks down, as it has done frequently during
the Women's World Cup, she comes quickly under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to such sweeping circumstances is the norm for any
goalkeeper, but Scurry has become adept at handling the escalating
expectations of a U.S. team that lately has shown some signs of
crumbling literally right before her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Scurry, who earned more attention for running naked
through the streets of Athens after the U.S. won the 1996 Olympic
gold medal than the considerable feats she performed in uniform,
may be at the top of her game.
</P>
<P>
   High-flying Brazil, which meets the U.S. in today's World Cup
semifinal at Stanford Stadium, (4:30 p.m., ESPN) should give Scurry
and her defense perhaps its biggest challenge of the World Cup,
although the Americans will have a huge Independence Day home crowd
of nearly 69,000 solidly in their corner.
</P>
<P>
   They may not notice Scurry until Brazil surges toward her with
its typical fury, but as she has shown before in the World Cup,
there's a wealth of confidence in the U.S. camp that the last line
of defense has never been in better hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Briana is the best goalkeeper here,'' said U.S. coach
Tony DiCicco, himself a former goalkeeper who works with Scurry and
her two backups during every practice. ``I've seen her play
incredible games for us many times before. But she's added so many
more dimensions to her game. She's dominating the penalty area
more, she's more confident in her kicking game, she's reading the
game better. She could be having her best tournament ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's touted scoring trio of Sissi, Pretinha and Katia has
been lethal, and their teammates form perhaps the speediest
starting unit in the World Cup. That has raised more questions
about a U.S. defense that has given up only three goals, but has
been vulnerable early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to respect their speed,'' said defender Joy Fawcett,
who scored the game-winning goal against Germany in the second
half. ``The important thing for us will be to put pressure on them
individually. We can't get caught stepping back.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened on Thursday against Germany in the
quarterfinals. Scurry called off defender Brandi Chastain in the
first five minutes when Germany was applying pressure, but perhaps
a moment too late. Chastain made a back pass just as Scurry slid
out to the edge of the penalty box, and the ball passed her as it
rolled into the net for a 1-0 U.S. deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ever want to have a start like that, no matter who
you're playing,'' Scurry said. ``But I think it might be more
detrimental to be behind to a team like Germany because their
defense is so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry didn't complete the thought, but Brazil's defense
revealed gaping holes in a 4-3 overtime win over Nigeria. After
going up 3-0 early in the second half, Brazil gave up three goals
in the last 27 minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Sissi, who leads the World Cup with seven goals,
scored the winner against Nigeria on a well-taken free kick, one of
four she has scored on set pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sissi's difficult to stop,'' DiCicco said. In 94 games, Scurry
has given up 53 goals for a solid 0.60 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. leads Brazil 8-1-1 all time, including a 3-0 win
earlier this spring in Orlando, Fla. ``They're a good team and
they're riding high, but there are weaknesses we feel we can
exploit,'' Scurry said. ``Brazil is a quick-strike team, but we are
as well.

 &HT;    Crowd may aid, hinder the U.S.
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif._ Parades, barbecue, fireworks and World Cup
soccer. Which of these doesn't fit as a July 4 tradition? None of
them, if you're a U.S. team playing Brazil in the World Cup and in
Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It has been five years to the day since the Americans played
Brazil tough before losing 1-0 in the second round of the 1994
World Cup, probably still the high-water mark of U.S. men's soccer.
After the game, goalkeeper Tony Meola and teammates ran around the
track, hoisting the American flag and thanking the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women realize that today's game should generate extra
attention because of the holiday and the stakes involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incredibly excited to be playing on the Fourth of
July,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. ``The crowds have been great all
along, but we know this one could be the 12th player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Players agree the pro-American crowd may be even more
enthusiastic, but acknowledge that it could also be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's any indication of what it's been in the past games,
it's going to be crazy,'' midfielder Michelle Akers said. ``You
want to be in the moment, but on the other hand, you can't get too
carried away with it. It's a very big game, and we've got to
concentrate really hard and stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching a sellout
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, more than 67,000 tickets had been sold
for today's doubleheader. After the World Cup match, the San Jose
Clash and D.C. United play in a Major League Soccer regular-season
contest. Stanford Stadium capacity is listed at 69,686 for soccer,
although it holds around 80,000 for football. Women's World Cup
officials said they probably would not open up additional seating.
</P>
<P>
   The other World Cup semifinal also is part of a doubleheader
with the MLS. Before Norway plays China in Foxboro, Mass., tonight,
the New England Revolution plays host to the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Move it or lose it
</P>
<P>
   For some unexplained reason, FIFA personnel didn't allow media
more than 10 to 15 minutes of access to the Brazilian players after
a Saturday morning workout at Stanford Stadium, and virtually none
to sign autographs with fans sitting in end-zone bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   When star forward Pretinha was signing autographs for
youngsters, a FIFA attendant grabbed her arm, imploring her to walk
to the team bus. She responded by giving him a backhand that
momentarily kept him at bay before she scribbled out her name a few
more times.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. locker room was open for nearly half an hour after its
late-morning training session, but players were escorted away from
autograph seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Pele won't choose sides
</P>
<P>
   The biggest game ever for Brazil's women's team has made Pele a
proud fan of his countrywomen, but the rousing following of the
U.S. team has him torn about who he will root for today.
</P>
<P>
   The former Brazilian star and soccer's goodwill ambassador,
heartened by the popularity of the sport among American girls, said
he won't reveal his rooting interest.
</P>

   ``My heart is with Brazil, but I'm very happy the U.S. team has
done so well,'' he said. ``I only wish it was the final.''

GIANTS' CONFIDENCE MAN IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't his defense the San Francisco Giants
missed most, even though he's won seven gold gloves.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his production at the plate either, even though he's a
three-time MVP.
</P>
<P>
   It took seven weeks, but the Giants finally figured it out. What
they missed most about Barry Bonds was the simplest of things.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just feel it when he's on the field,'' outfielder
Ellis Burks said. ``We had to find it for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did just that, posting a 25-22 record while Bonds
rehabilitated from surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left
elbow. In the process, they remained close to the top of the
National League West standings and proved their own resiliency to
themeselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds returned on June 9, weeks earlier than the doctors
predicted, though pain in his elbow persists. Jeff Kent is seeing
fastballs in the cleanup spot again. The team speed has improved.
The lineup is cohesive.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have their confidence man back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude was we'd be in first place when Barry got back,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``We weren't, but we were close.''
</P>
<P>
   They gutted it out without their franchise player. They stayed
afloat. They survived.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds must be beaming with pride, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I don't have to be proud of them.
They have to be out for their own success. They don't have to
please me. The fans and the city are the ones they need to make
proud. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride has always been an issue with Bonds. Humility is not one
of his stronger virtues, and he makes no apologies for it.
</P>
<P>
   He says his confidence is often misconstrued by reporters, who
fire softball questions his way and get heaters thrown back at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Bonds almost anything. The response you get is never the one
you expect.
</P>
<P>
   His contentious relationship with the press is well documented,
though he insists he isn't trying to be a jerk when he answers a
question with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tolerate ignorance,'' Bonds said. ``I don't like to be
called names, either. It's like that kid at school with glasses who
gets called names in the playground. You never appreciate that
stuff, no matter who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't no better than you and you ain't no better than me.
It's not an ego thing. I don't like being treated like a god. It's
just that my profession happens to be playing baseball. Because of
that, people expect things from me that they shouldn't expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   It's his candor and his frankness that often get interpreted as
cockiness. And it's his confidence _ that stabilizing force the
Giants missed so dearly _ that gets most criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was Muhammad Ali confident?'' Bonds said. ``Was Michael Jordan
confident? Was Joe Montana confident? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Is Shaq
confident?
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes my confidence different from Ken Griffey Jr.'s?
From anybody else's? Why does my confidence have to be construed as
something else?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds said sitting and watching for seven weeks didn't change
his mentality. He's not any more mellow than he was last season or
the year before. But it's apparent to some on the team that Bonds
is more content this year, that he's more appreciative of the game,
that he is a happier person.
</P>
<P>
   The finalization of his divorce with ex-wife Sun might have
something to do with it. And maybe missing those 47 games did
something, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized he's human,'' Baker said. ``When you've played as
long as Barry has and you've never had a major injury, never had to
miss so many games, that can get lost on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common shot taken at Bonds is that he isn't a clutch
performer, particularly in his limited postseason experience. In
three NLCS series defeats with the Pirates from 1990-92, Bonds
batted .191.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to hear what they can't do or where they
failed,'' Baker said. ``Especially when you've had a career like
Barry's.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Bonds burning to get the Giants to the postseason? Is he
determined to bust out in the playoffs to take away his critics'
ammunition?
</P>
<P>
   What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to the playoffs to prove anything to anybody,''
Bonds said. ``I go to win.''

SHOW `MO' THE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When given the choice, you always choose paper over plastic.
</P>
<P>
   You are a Clipper fan; you need something to wear.
</P>
<P>
   You've remained loyal and steadfast through thin and thinner,
for badder or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But there is lightning at the end of the tunnel. Four nights ago
and five seconds before you sprayed beer up your nostrils, the
Clippers drafted Lamar Odom. Suddenly, Susan Lucci has been blown
out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are a Clipper fan due for hip-replacement surgery after
four days of swagger practice.
</P>
<P>
   Time out, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   You are a Clipper fan, so you know who Maurice Taylor is. Right,
he's ``Mo,'' one of two Clippers (rookie free agent Tyrone Nesby is
the other) who would think nothing of ripping out the heart of a
defender and ramming it through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   You already knows that Mo plus Odom equals Modom. You know they
should be baud to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of the NBA knows who Mo is, because Mo is among the
three most-productive lads from the NBA Draft of 1997. After two
seasons, only two players from that class - Tim Duncan and Keith
Van Horn - have more points and rebounds than Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, Duncan and Van Horn also will be signing six-year
contract extensions for about 70 million scoots. It's the league
maximum; it's what NBA teams do when slouching into the realization
that they possess a franchise player entering the final year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   You are a Clipper fan. You do the math, you do the history. You
know there may be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   You know the potential problem is named Donald T. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   You know he's the owner of the Clippers and a threat to the
welfare of his own team, because every sports columnist within
spitting distance of the Sports Arena has given Sterling the
raspberry in print. You know the historical residue of his
decisions has made several hard-working, intelligent Clipper
employees look lazy and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   You also know Sterling is no dummy, because we are telling you
so, unleashing deductive logic to assume anyone who's amassed that
kind of bank must have some high-caliber synapses.
</P>
<P>
   You also know Sterling realizes that making money often requires
spending money first. But you're not sure if Sterling, in terms of
NBA business, knows when to say spend.
</P>
<P>
   Around the water cooler, it has been suggested Sterling may want
to show Mo the money, all $70 million, but not until after
</P>
<P>
   the coming season. The people he pays to assess these basketball
possibilities want to give Taylor the extension now. Sterling wants
more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   You are a Clipper fan, and you are booing.
</P>
<P>
   You also know, because we're telling you, Mo probably will
politely request to be traded to another NBA franchise if he's not
offered the max before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   If he's traded, it will be the worst thing to clout this
franchise since Marques Johnson's head rammed Benoit Benjamin's
tummy, or Norm Nixon (Mo's agent) ripped his Achilles tendon, or
Derek Smith ripped his knee, or Ron Harper ripped his knee, or
Danny Manning ripped his knee or Sean Elliott ripped his knee a few
years before inspiring the Clippers to draft Danny Ferry instead of
him, then trade Ferry for Harper, who (you may recall) ripped his
knee.
</P>
<P>
   If Taylor's not traded, the first Clipper season at Staples
Center will feature a cloud of doom treading air in front of
Sterling's luxury suite, blocking his view of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor's contract will expire and he will sign with another
team.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a far worse hit to the Clippers than Sterling's
decision to snuff a trade that would have brought Glen Rice and
Willie Burton for Manning.
</P>
<P>
   You know where to cut the holes in the paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   You are a Clipper fan.
</P>
<P>
   (No. You are not Billy Crystal.)
</P>
<P>
   While the checkbook's open
</P>
<P>
   To Sterling's credit, he did not laugh himself to sleep when
Clipper basketball operations crew members asked if it would be OK
to romance Orlando's free-agent guard Anfernee ``Penny'' Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Penny's six-year tab would be about $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Penny's agents didn't laugh at the Clippers, either, possibly
because Hardaway may, in theory, accept the challenge of battling
Shaquille O'Neal for Staples supremacy. With Taylor, Odom and
Michael Olowokandi on his side, it almost sounds plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more likely Penny and his pals define Clipper interest
as another offer to use as leverage for a sign-and-trade deal
involving the Magic that can bring Penny more than $80 million for
six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But matching salaries could make sign-and-trades more difficult
than the media members who propose them realize.
</P>
<P>
   So despite preliminary chats between the parties, Penny as a
Clipper remains a Hail Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reach in Wednesday's draft was Cleveland grabbing
Duke's Trajan Langdon at No. 11. Yeah, Langdon was the best shooter
available, but he's a 6-1{ off-guard who figures to be a career
backup. ... If Larry Bird was disillusioned with life as an NBA
coach before the draft, he must be miles beyond peeved now. First,
his Pacers are to deal his toughest player, power forward Antonio
Davis, to Toronto for the fifth pick. As part of the deal, the
Raptors selected 6-11 high schooler Jonathan Bender and will
surrender the kid to Indiana. But, according to reports from
Indianapolis, Bird would have preferred Miami of Ohio forward Wally
Szczerbiak. ... Look for free agent Clipper forward Rodney Rogers
to be playing for the Nuggets again next season. ... Another
possible free-agent target for the Clippers is Orlando's Bo Outlaw,
an ex-Clipper who would bring serious juice to their second team.
... In drafting power forwards Elton Brand, Michael Ruffin and Lari
Ketner to go with husky small forward Ron Artest, the Bulls now
have a better pass rush than the Bears.

BRAVES BEAT METS, 3-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Wilpon, one of the Mets' co-owners, said his
general manager, Steve Phillips, gave him a briefing Saturday on
the Mets' attempts to upgrade their starting rotation before the
July 31 trading deadline. But the Mets have had a more pressing
need than a front-line starter against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some runs,'' a downcast Wilpon said after the first-place
Braves had blanked the Mets, 3-0, at Shea Stadium to pull five
games ahead of them in the National League East. ``You can't win if
you don't score.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have now gone 28 consecutive innings without a run
against Atlanta, with shutouts in the first two games of this
three-game series and another last Sunday in Atlanta. The Braves
are the first team to shut out the Mets in three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood (10-4) was the culprit Saturday, allowing two
hits in eight-plus innings while outpitching Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Leiter provided a blueprint for defeating the Braves
_ one the Mets have not been able to follow. ``To beat the Atlanta
Braves,'' he said, ``you've got to get superior starting pitching,
key hits and obviously scratch out a couple of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was the National League's pitcher of the month for June.
But June is over, and so is his five-game winning streak. Leiter
(7-6) allowed three runs in six innings Saturday, including a long
two-run home run to Brian Jordan in the fifth, before 43,256 fans
on a sweltering afternoon. The Mets did not advance a runner past
first base until the ninth inning as Millwood surrendered just two
singles. The Mets finished with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best pitching performances I've seen
anywhere this year,'' Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said. ``Anywhere.
Against us, for us, on TV, American League. Anywhere. He was just
tremendous on the hottest day.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood said: ``We said when we started playing these guys that
we wanted to try to keep them down. We don't want to give them any
games or let them get some wind in their sails. We wanted to try to
beat them as much as we could and not let them get too confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mission has been a success. The Braves are 4-1 against the
Mets this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' performance Saturday was not as glaringly dominant
as Friday's 16-0 rout, but it was convincing enough. The Braves
have taken the first two games of this series by a combined score
of 19-0, while the Mets have had just six hits _ all singles _ and
just four runners in scoring position, including one Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the ninth. Brian McRae drew a full-count walk off
Millwood to open the inning, prompting Cox to call for John Rocker,
who uncorked a wild pitch to allow McRae to advance to second.
After the pinch-hitter Todd Pratt flared a single to right field,
the Mets had runners on first and third with nobody out and their
second, third and fourth hitters in the order coming up.
</P>
<P>
   But Edgardo Alfonzo popped to short center field. John Olerud
popped to left. And Mike Piazza, who is 16 for 77 (.208) with
runners in scoring position this season, struck out on three
pitches to complete a frustrating 0-for-4 day. The Mets were shut
out in consecutive games for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A base hit by any of us three would have given us some
momentum,'' Piazza said. ``There seems to be this sort of trait. We
all kind of go cold simultaneously. It seems like we've been stuck
in neutral the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Through six and one-third innings, the Mets had one hit off
Millwood _ Robin Ventura's fifth-inning single. Leiter, meanwhile,
was in a jam in just about every inning. Then in the fifth, after
Chipper Jones lashed a changeup for a two-out double, Jordan
drilled a flat 2-0 slider into the bleachers in left field. The
home run was Jordan's 16th of the season and 100th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the straightest fastball I've ever seen Leiter
throw,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter said, ``Tell Brian it was a slider and I guess it backed
up and looked like a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' closer, John Franco, who was placed on the 15-day
disabled list Saturday with a finger injury, said before the game
that this series and the one in Atlanta last weekend were a sort of
gauge ``to see where we're at with them.'' So far, not very close.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine was asked about the Padres'
franchise-record 14-game winning streak, which ended Saturday.
``Everyone gets hot and everyone gets cold,'' he said. ``That's
something some people don't understand. That's why people get
fired.''

CHASTAIN STRIKES A POSE FOR SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mia Hamm is considered the cover girl for U.S. women's
soccer, Brandi Chastain could be called the centerfold.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, a skilled fullback, recently landed such off-field
status by donning little more than the stitching on a soccer ball
in a national magazine layout.
</P>
<P>
   Her risque display of flesh in the current issue of Gear
Magazine has supplied endless fodder for the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Steve Vanderpool, director of
public relations for Women's World Cup '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about Mia and many know about Michelle
Akers.... It's great that Brandi is putting another face out out
there for women's soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she's putting a tad more than just a face out there.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page, side-view shot of a squatting Chastain shows her
in the buff, wearing only a pair of Nike soccer boots while
clutching a ball in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   But a pair of goals _ including a heart-stopping own goal
credited for Germany _ in Thursday's Women's World Cup
quarterfinals redirected some of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's miscommunication with U.S. keeper Briana Scurry
almost proved costly, but her half-volley goal in the second half
sparked the team's rally for a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, she still finds ways to grab the
headlines, doesn't she?'' teammate and Pasadena native Carla
Overbeck said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, Overbeck, Hamm and the rest of the American cast
remain alive heading into today's semifinal against Brazil in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil can boast the flashy ``mono-names'' _ Pretinha,
Roseli and the electrifying Sissi, to name a few _ the Red, White
and Blue is gushing with talent and experience through and through.
</P>
<P>
   Few exemplify that as well as the 30-year-old Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year national team veteran, she is among the pioneers
of the worldwide women's soccer movement, playing in all three
World Cups with exactly 100 caps to her credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of defenders, she's among the best there is,'' said
Akers, who has been with the national team since its inception in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it in her pinpoint passing; she can thread the
needle and connect with where players are headed. She has the
smarts for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither her precision nor her intuition are a mere coincidence.
Chastain spent her early playing days honing lethal attacking
talents and she polishes her read on the game every fall as an
assistant to husband and head coach Jerry Smith at Santa Clara
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the welts to prove it,'' joked Chastain, who often
mixes up it with her current collegiate players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put me up front, in the back, at midfield... just don't waste
your time putting me in the stands. I'll find a way onto the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   That's perfectly fine with U.S. coach Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brings that coaching perspective to the field, knows when
to play conservatively but knows how to change it up when need
be,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her physical skills are well refined, too. If we had 11 of her
on the field, with the skill level and the tactical approach, we'd
be totally unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco was also quick to put Chastain's rare blunder against
Germany in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on that play,'' he deadpanned. ``I've seen
big-time professional players make a mistake like that and they
were out of the game. To Brandi's credit, she came back and scored
the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's semifinal also qualifies as a homecoming for Chastain.
She played for Archbishop Mitty High before starring for both UC
Berkeley and Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the chance to play against the World All-Stars, a few
exhibition matches and possibly the semifinal _ that's the best
part,'' said Chastain in February, on the eve of the U.S. vs. World
All-Stars match in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the chance to represent my country and maybe show off
for family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But can she show off any more than she did for the camera lens
recently?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally the way she is,'' said DiCicco, his naturally
reddish facial features flushing a few shades deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have to keep an eye on her. She's the
free-spirited type.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, Chastain quickly corrals those spirits into
a laser-like focus for game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being a little crazy _ some would say strange _ off the
field, but it's all business between the lines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt a little embarrassed because that magazine ended
up with half-naked girls shown all over the place. I was hoping my
shot would be a tongue-in-cheek boost of publicity for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges a major responsibility of a different sort
during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it a great show and showcase the opportunities
for future players,'' Chastain said. ``When I first started out,
there were no female role models to look up to. But the
opportunities have kept opening up since Title IX. The American
women's team's success is just another example of one of those
avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to keep creating exposure for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has already done that _ in more ways than one.

TENSION BUILDS OVER PROTESTANT MARCHING SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Frank Gibson's great uncle died at
the Battle of the Somme 83 years ago this week. Saturday, he
watched as British soldiers put the finishing touches on the barbed
wire and trenches meant to keep him and other Protestants from
marching through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, Gibson said, reminded him of the trenches in France
where his uncle and tens of thousands of Ulstermen died in service
to the king. Now it was the apparatus that he said was ``oppressing
the loyal Protestant people of Ulster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My great uncle's got to be turning in his grave,'' said
Gibson, 40, gazing over the fields at Drumcree Church. ``The army
he died for is doing this to his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Garvaghy Road, Catholic nationalist residents took
little comfort from the fact that Protestant unionists like Frank
Gibson feel abandoned. They fear the authorities will betray them
at the last minute and allow the Orange Order to march through
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Chambers and Sue-Ellen Millar, both 18, sat on the stoop
of the Ashgrove Community Center, Millar gently rocking the
carriage that held her 7-months-old daughter Courtney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the army might still let them down the road,'' said
Millar, voicing a cynicism that is common here, despite the hard
line the police and the army held against the Orangemen last year.
Dozens of police officers were injured, one was killed, and at
least 18 had to move their families in the face of loyalist
intimidation because of their stand at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the standoff resumes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, after he and his Irish counterpart had given
the political parties of Northern Ireland a plan to steer them
through the stalemate that has stalled the peace process, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke of ``the most historic opportunity
for peace this land has known.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in Portadown, history is relative, and the politics
that Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern hold up as an
alternative to the violence of the last 30 years rings hollow to
people who are preoccupied with a 15-minute march that encapsulates
everything for them.
</P>
<P>
   For Protestants, who say they are being slowly overtaken by
Catholics, history means that a parade which has followed a
traditional route for nearly 200 years should be allowed to
continue, no matter how many people it offends. They say the peace
process is a conspiracy to strip them of their rights, and point to
the banning of Sunday's parade for the second consecutive year as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics guffaw when they hear that Protestants feel
marginalized. To them, history is more recent. They talk about how
Bobby Hamill was kicked to death two years ago when he strayed off
the Catholic plantation to socialize in the town center at night.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as loyalists walked past St. John's Catholic church
on the way to the standoff at Drumcree, they jumped up and down,
aping Hamill's killers and shouting his name.
</P>
<P>
   Millar and Chambers are case studies of young Catholics here.
Neither has ever ventured into the town center at night. They said
the unofficial curfew is 6 p.m., summer or winter. If you stay
later, you risk the fate of Bobby Hamill, who died as a group of
police officers stood by a few hundred feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the next Bobby Hamill,'' Chambers says.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of grievance held by Protestants is no less strong,
even though they still control the town and make up 60 percent of
the population. They say Catholics are determined to drive them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics ``don't want us in the country anymore,'' said Stephen
McKinney, 34, who literally wore his colors on the sleeve of his
orange shirt. Two of McKinney's uncles were shot dead by the IRA,
and he is not in a forgiving mood.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the people of the Garvaghy Road, who are quick to
point out that the annual siege over the parade is nothing compared
to the everyday pressure of being surrounded by hostile loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the fields of Drumcree Church have become a
flashpoint in July, an annual reminder that as the peace process
matures, there are still ancient, visceral hatreds that flourish on
this beautiful island.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the international news media descend here, clogging
the narrow roads, providing a windfall for those few fortunate
whose driveways offer enough space for satellite trucks or a
sweeping view of the fields where Orangemen converge loudly and
violently to demand the right to march through a neighborhood that
does not want them.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of international observers also descend on the place,
few if any bothering to talk to Protestants. International opinion
seems squarely behind the Catholic nationalists, yet another reason
why the Protestants of Portadown feel isolated and react with
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Some are bigots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics are breeding like rabbits,'' Peggy Moore was saying
Saturday, standing in the shadow of the 15-foot metal barrier,
reinforced with concrete, that will prevent the Orangemen from
reaching the Garvaghy Road. Asked if what she was saying was
bigoted, the 65-year-old Moore replied, ``How can it be bigoted if
it's true?''
</P>
<P>
   Some are simply scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate Catholics. I know a lot of good Catholics,'' said
Gary Robertson, 35, a deliveryman. ``But Tony Blair wants to let
the IRA into government, and I'm supposed to sit back and accept
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Orangemen will hold a service at Drumcree Church,
dedicated to men like Fred Gibson, Frank Gibson's great uncle, who
died in the squalor of the trenches of the Somme. Then they will
march a hundred yards or so down to the metal barrier topped with
razor wire. Harold Gracey, the local Orange Order leader, will
formally register his disgust that they are not being allowed to
walk the Queen's highway.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Orangemen will take to the fields. At night, young
loyalists will attack the police and soldiers across the stream
whose banks have been widened. Some will try to scale the barbed
wire and breach the trenches. They will be beaten back by the
police and soldiers, who will receive little thanks from the
Catholic nationalists they are protecting.
</P>
<P>
   On the Garvaghy Road, people are sealed in, army checkpoints at
the top and bottom of the road. They say they are being held
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Held hostage, too, is the peace process, which every year at
this time is simply pushed to the side and put on hold, to see how
bad it will be at Drumcree, a perennial reminder that peace, like
history, is relative.

RUSSIAN TROOPS LEFT ON RUNWAY AS ALLIES BLOCK DEPARTURE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Hundreds of Russian peacekeeping troops bound for
Kosovo were left waiting on the runway Saturday after the United
States and its allies blocked their departure for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the mutual suspicion between Russia and the
West even after NATO halted the bombing of Moscow's ally,
Yugoslavia, after 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow had planned to send the first large contingent of its
expected force of 3,600 peacekeepers to join the several hundred
Russian troops guarding the airport in Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow and NATO have been unable to resolve differences over
Russia's role in the peacekeeping force for Kosovo. Clinton
administration officials said Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria,
acting on a NATO request, had refused to allow Russia to fly troop
transport planes over their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Russian troops in Kosovo is sensitive because most
Albanians view the Russians with the same distaste as the Serbs who
had ruled the province. The vulnerability of the peacekeepers
themselves was underscored Saturday when British paratroopers shot
four Albanians, killing two, in an act that outraged Pristina
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the Kremlin has tried to
renegotiate an agreement signed in Helsinki last month to allow
Russian troops in Kosovo to report only to Russian commanders,
rather than remain under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials also say Russia, which had originally agreed
to scatter its troops in sectors under American, British, and
German commanders, now wants to station its forces throughout the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders say they never agreed to put their troops under
NATO control in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contingent in Kosovo will be under complete political and
military control of the Russian command,'' Colonel General Leonid
Ivashov, a senior military negotiator, said in Moscow last week.
``This is provided for in the documents signed by the Russian and
US defense ministers in Helsinki.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks at NATO headquarters in Belgium last week could not
resolve the difference of opinions. That caused the alliance to
block Russia's request last week to fly its troops over Hungary,
which became a NATO member in April, and Romania and Bulgaria,
which have asked to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is NATO's view that we work through all these agreements
before any more Russian forces are deployed,'' National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said Saturday. Talks between Russia
and NATO will resume this week.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright had telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on
Friday to relay NATO complaints about continuing the deployment of
the several thousand Russian troops into Kosovo until a
satisfactory agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Russia surprised and upstaged the alliance when it sent 200
troops from its peacekeeping force in Bosnia across Serbia and into
Kosovo several hours before NATO troops entered the province.
</P>
<P>
   The dash was hailed as a victory in Moscow, where there is
growing resentment at what many Russians perceive as global
arrogance on the part of the United States and its allies. The
commander of the march, Viktor Zavarzin, became a hero and was
promoted to a three-star general. Perhaps no man better symbolizes
the chasm between Russia and the West than Zavarzin, who was
rejected by NATO as Russian liaison to the alliance on the grounds
that he might be a spy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's newly assertive behavior, seen as a welcome development
in Moscow political and military circles, has put NATO on the
lookout for new surprises, especially after Russian strategic
bombers engaged in a Cold-War-stylemilitary exercise near Iceland
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The move to block Russian reinforcements in Kosovo could raise
the stakes in the Kremlin's confrontation with the West. But so
far, the Kremlin has been silent on NATO's move to halt its troop
shipments, which was first reported in The New York Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, paratroopers in Ivanovo, a city 200 miles northeast of
Moscow, spent the day loading equipment, only to learn that their
flight had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Another paratroop force of about 1,000 men was reported arriving
in the Black Sea port of Tuapse, where they would be transported to
Yugoslavia by sea with 40 military vehicles. Russia's Black Sea
fleet said it received permission from NATO member Turkey for four
transport ships to navigate the Bosporus straits that connect the
Black Sea to the Mediterranean on July 10 and 11; it was unclear if
the alliance expects to prevent the troops from departure.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reported last week that Moscow had decided to send
the bulk of its 3,600 troops to Kosovo via sea to save cash.
</P>
<P>
   Filipov reported from Moscow; Farrell from Washington.

YANKS BEAT ORIOLES, 6-5  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In deciding on the pitching staff for the American
League All-Stars, Joe Torre has chosen democracy. He has polled his
fellow AL managers to name the top eight pitchers in the league. He
counted their votes, put them in order and, if all enter the
All-Star Game break uninjured and available, they will be his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, he confirmed, are his own Yankees David Cone and
Mariano Rivera. What about Orlando Hernandez? Well, Torre left a
ninth spot on the staff open. Call it his dictator pick. And El
Duque? ``He got some votes from other managers,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Saturday. Hernandez struggled with his command
most of the afternoon and was hurt by two pitches within seconds of
each other in the fourth inning. He appeared about to be collared
with a loss against the Baltimore Orioles before 42,859 at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But then something remarkable happened. In the bottom of the
ninth inning with two men on, Scott Brosius hit a 3-1 pitch from
Arthur Rhodes into the left-field bleachers for a 6-5 victory. It
was the Yankees' first game-winning home run in the bottom of the
ninth since July 28, 1996, when Darryl Strawberry did it against
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic ninth began when Chili Davis singled off Rhodes to
open the inning and the Orioles left-hander then walked Jorge
Posada. Rhodes struck out Luis Sojo when the home plate umpire,
Larry Barnett, ruled he had not checked his swing.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Brosius blast gave the victory to Jason Grimsley,
who pitched two innings of shutout relief. But it also awarded
Hernandez, who had won of four of his previous five starts and
showed an All Star-caliber will that has helped him lower his
earned run average from 6.56 to 3.91 in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the game after six and two-third innings, Hernandez
had given up five hits and the score was tied, 3-3. He gave the
left-handed reliever Mike Stanton the ball with two outs and men
and first and second. But the game got away from the Yankees, and
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, responsibility for a double by B.J. Surhoff that
chased Charles Johnson and Brady Anderson home with the winning
runs rested with Ricky Ledee. He got the start in left field after
Shane Spencer was hospitalized Saturday night at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center, where he is in stable condition and
being treated for an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee didn't make the best of his opportunity. Stanton threw a
fastball that Surhoff drove into the left-center-field gap. Ledee
missed snagging it as it sailed past his back-handed stab. In the
next inning, he made matters worse by allowing Johnson, the
Orioles' catcher, to pick him off first base.
</P>
<P>
   It was a frustrating way for the Yankees to end a two-game
winning streak _ especially on an afternoon when Derek Jeter and
Bernie Williams extended hitting streaks to 13 and 14 games and
Hernandez battled gamely for an All-Star spot.
</P>
<P>
   His one bad inning was the lightning-strike fourth. Hernandez
had blanked the Orioles through three and two-thirds innings when
Albert Belle came to the plate. He worked the burly power hitter to
a 3-1 count, then grooved a fastball that Belle rocketed 406 feet
and over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Belle had barely touched all the bases after his 17th home run
of the season when Hernandez again mislocated his fastball. This
time designated hitter Harold Baines spanked him for his mistake,
yanking it over the fence near the left field foul pole for his
1,538th career run batted in, which moved him past Joe DiMaggio and
into 32nd place on the career r.b.i list. It was the sixth time
this season that the Orioles had hit back-to-back homers, and it
put the Yankees down, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees responded in the bottom of the inning. After
Williams walked and Tino Martinez singled to right, Chili Davis
came to the plate with two outs and sprayed a single to left field
that Surhoff scooped up, throwing to the plate. But Williams was
running as Davis swung and slid home well before the ball and the
Yankees were back in the game, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque, however, could not escape trouble in the fifth after
Cal Ripken rolled a double down the first base line to begin the
inning. He was sacrificed to third by Hairston. But after Hernandez
struck out Johnson, Brady Anderson poked a single to right field to
score Ripken for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This time Jeter responded for the Yankees. With two out and
Brosius on third, Jeter slammed a two-run homer to right -center to
tie the game. It was Jeter's 14th homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees couldn't do any more damage to the Orioles
right-hander Sidney Ponson, who over seven innings held them to six
hits.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez's All-Star fate will remain in the hands of Torre
and his selection for the ninth spot on the AL roster. ``Some guys
can get hurt, though you don't wish that,'' Torre said. ``Or some
may have to pitch that previous Sunday and will be unavailable. A
lot can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Manto, who was claimed off waivers from the Indians, was
added to the roster after Shane Spencer was placed on the 15-day
disabled list with an irregular heartbeat. Manto, 34, has a .227
career average and mostly plays first or third base, but Manager
Joe Torre talked with him about being an emergency catcher and
filling in at shortstop or second as well. ``It's easy for me to
assume my role,'' Manto said. ``I'm the 24th or 25th guy and I'm
content with that.'' ... The Yankees signed the former Met
left-hander Allen Watson to a minor league contract, and he
reported to Class AAA Columbus. The Yankees only have one
left-hander in the bullpen, Mike Stanton.

TOMORROW WON'T COME SOON ENOUGH IN L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The proof was in the purge, and the ugly white
caps from spring training were at the bottom of the pile burning
Saturday morning in the Dodgers bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   They had tried lineup changes, meetings, benchings. Raul Mondesi
shaved his head, Gary Sheffield grew back his goatee. A two-out hit
or a well-pitched game would have been better, but 34-44 teams
never quite get to that. So a pregame exorcism was all that was
left.
</P>
<P>
   Players getting together to burn the white hats worn during
interleague play was symbolic. It was one of many bad ideas last
winter that went into building this miserable team.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them belonged to new general manager Kevin Malone.
How much of this would be happening if Chan Ho Park, Carlos Perez
and Darren Dreifort didn't look as though they were working on a
new pitch in the instructional league?
</P>
<P>
   But Malone was brought here to set the tone and Saturday's 9-1
loss to the first-place Giants was just another example of his
tough rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Fox-directed signing of Kevin Brown to a
seven-year, $105 million contract. That was the price a team with
four No. 3 starters had to pay to boost its starting rotation. But
it was absurd to think a guy who is aloof by nature and plays just
every fifth day could be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also thinking that Brown, a ground-ball pitcher, would turn
around a team so limited defensively probably wasn't good for the
investment. Leadoff hitter Eric Young is hobbled at second by a bad
Achilles and he and Eric Karros have no range on the right side.
More painful is Young's .349 on-base percentage. Young is 0 for 10
in his last three games, with many of the outs lazy fly balls to
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the trade for Todd Hundley, whose reconstructed
right elbow made the move questionable. It was thinking the team
would be fine with career minor-leaguer Paul LoDuca as the backup
even though the team admitted Hundley would need at least 40 games
off this season.
</P>
<P>
   When LoDuca didn't work out, the Dodgers sent for Angel Pena,
their top prospect who was growing bored in the minors. When Raul
Mondesi began to yawn at Triple-A in 1992, the Dodgers busted him
down to Double-A. Pena, who should be a good one, was rewarded for
his indifference and the Dodgers were rewarded with his .188
average. And in their desperation for left-handed hitting, they
stayed with Todd Hollandsworth, who has more days on the disabled
list in his career than RBI. When the Dodgers look for someone off
the bench in the late innings, there is a good chance Hollandsworth
will be in the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hasty in giving the 2-9 Perez a three-year, $15
million contract even though during four years in Montreal he had
never pitched a meaningful game. Malone had him and liked him with
the Expos and his feelings were confirmed when Perez had four
consecutive, complete-game victories last September.
</P>
<P>
   It looked impressive, but the season already was over. Maybe not
in the standings, but definitely on the faces in the Dodgers
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's maneuverability was hampered by the $54 million he
inherited in guaranteed contracts. But he added to the burden by
taking on center fielder Devon White for three years at $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   White's 94 runs and 22 homers last year with expansion Arizona
looked pretty good. But his attitude was such a turnoff to
Diamondbacks officials, they didn't even talk to him when he became
a free agent last winter. This season, White has missed 21 starts
and hasn't been on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   When he won a June 9 game against the Angels with a grand slam,
it ended two months batting of around .200. But after that game,
White, 36, said he had ``nothing to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to look longingly at Roger Cedeno, who could
make the National League All-Star team with the New York Mets after
several unfulfilling seasons with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was crushed by expectation here and needed a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But Mondesi, long removed from that minor-league demotion, is a
star, even if he has one home run in his last 111 at-bats. Instead
of being accountable for his part in the mess, he complains that
manager Davey Johnson is picking on him by moving him out of the
cleanup spot to everywhere from leadoff to sixth in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the Dodgers are 10{ games back on the Fourth of
July. Last year, they were 12{ back on this day. But that is not
reason for optimism. It is a reason to start thinking about next
winter. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ A lone white gunman cruising the streets Friday
evening in a light blue car shot and killed a black former
Northwestern University basketball coach, wounded six Orthodox Jews
and fired upon a car carrying Asian-Americans in what the police
are investigating as possible hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In all, beginning about 8:30 p.m., the authorities said, the
gunman fired at more than a dozen people in six locations within
about 12 miles of one another, beginning in the northern Chicago
neighborhood of Rogers Park and ending in the suburbs of Skokie and
Northbrook.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, described as between 25 and 30 and about six feet
tall, with short brown hair, had not been arrested by midday
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're not jumping to the conclusion that it's a
hate crime,'' said Patrick T. Camden, a spokesman for the Chicago
Police Department. ``All of the elements appear to be there, but
until we get the offender we won't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The former coach, Ricky Byrdsong, 42, was fatally shot in the
town of Skokie, as he was walking near his home with two of his
children. As the family reached an intersection, a blue car drove
by and seven shots were fired. Byrdsong was hit once in the lower
back. His children were not hit.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks had begun south of there about 20 minutes earlier in
Rogers Park, at Chicago's border with Evanston, just west of Loyola
University, with three Orthodox Jews being shot as they left
Sabbath services.
</P>
<P>
   Then two blocks to the north, a fourth was shot.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a fifth victim was shot a few blocks south,
and finally a sixth was injured nearby. One of the wounded was a
15-year-old boy; the rest were adults.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shootings were done by one man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting the same vehicle description,'' said Lt.
Barry Silverberg of the Skokie Police. He described the car as a
light blue Ford Taurus with a large scratch on the rear door on the
driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong died Saturday after surgery at Evanston Hospital.
</P>
<P>

were treated at a hospital and released. A bullet went through the
clothing of another man, who was not injured.

SOSA NOT ENOUGH FOR CUBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NL MVP Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs is only two homers behind
his pace from last year, when he finished with 66. Sosa hit his
30th on Wednesday, giving him 13 for the month of June. He set a
record with 20 homers last June.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also hit his 300th career homer during the month, which is
amazing since he hit his 200th less than two years ago. He went
from 200 to 300 in 1,045 at-bats over 261 games _ after needing
1,056 games and 3,877 at-bats to accumulate the first 200 homers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising he would get hot in June, finishing the
month with seven homers in his last eight games, including at least
one in four straight. But as with last year, Sosa's numbers aren't
translating into victories for the Cubs. They were 10-17 in June
after going 12-15 last June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More warning signs
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks have come back to the field in the West
and things have gotten so bad they used Nicaraguan right-hander
Vicente Padilla in a save situation in his major-league debut.
Padilla, who opened the season in the Single-A California League,
started the ninth Tuesday with a 4-2 lead vs. Cincinnati but gave
up four hits and three runs without retiring a batter in a 5-4
loss. The D'backs have blown 13 saves and dropped 15 games in an
opponent's last at-bat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Aaron
</P>
<P>
   With 15 homers and 64 RBI entering the weekend, Atlanta's
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan is on pace for the most productive season by a
Braves right fielder since Hank Aaron hit 44 homers and drove in
127 runs in 1966. While two other right fielders have hit 40 or
more homers _ David Justice, 40, 1993;
</P>
<P>
   Dale Murphy, 44, 1987; Aaron, 40, 1973; Aaron, 44, 1969 _ during
that stretch, no one has driven in more runs. With little more than
half the season remaining, Jordan could reach Aaron's 1963 total of
130 RBI and with a prolific second half, he might top Hugh Duffy 's
1894 franchise- record 145 RBI. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Team chemistry
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins beat the Mets on Wednesday with a dramatic
ninth-inning homer by Mark Kotsay , but Florida's only veteran
starter Alex Fernandez wasn't pleased. Fernandez, who is 2-5
despite a 3.17 ERA, left the game with a 3-2 lead and watched
Braden Looper give up the tying run in the seventh. It was the 10th
blown save in 20 chances for the young Marlins relievers this year
(the third by Looper), and it's happened to Fernandez four times.
``It gets old, it gets frustrating,'' said Fernandez, who broke a
$400 clubhouse TV the last time it happened. ``But I've got to have
some common sense and understand what I'm playing with and who I'm
playing with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the rocks
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Rockies were picked by many to finish 1-2 in the
West. Instead, they are battling for last place. Colorado took a
seven-game losing streak into the weekend and no game was worse
than Monday's vs. San Diego. The Rockies committed three errors in
the first inning alone and four in all, and catcher Henry Blanco ,
naturally a former Dodgers farmhand, allowed nine stolen bases,
including five by Damian Jackson. Two of those four errors were
made by Vinny Castilla, who had five in a six-game stretch and 14
overall _ more than all of last season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable guy
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million deal to sell the Mets to Cablevision is likely
to take place this month, pending final negotiations over how much
day-to-day input former Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson
Doubleday will have. They'll retain 20 percent of the club, and
while Doubleday is happy just to take the money and run, Wilpon
still wants to be near the action. This was the type of squabble
between cable chief Charles Dolan and George Steinbrenner that
killed the Cablevision-Yankees deal last winter. A sale would
strengthen the Mets' case for a new stadium, a planned 45,000-seat
Ebbets Field replica with a retractable roof, which they hope to
have by 2003. &QL;

WHAT DODGERS NEED IS A GUY LIKE DEMPSEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson has likened managing a baseball team
to running a restaurant. The analogy is good food for thought.
Because whether it's diners or dingers your livelihood depends on,
success is a matter of synergy.
</P>
<P>
   You can have efficient hostesses, nimble waiters and a
celebrated chef, but if the food preparers don't do their jobs, or
the busboys theirs, the final product will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, you can have one of the league's best pitchers, a
dependable closer, a Gold Glove outfielder and an All-Star hitter,
but if your infielders can't turn the double play and your pinch
hitters can't turn on a fastball, your rawhide is going to cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the Dodgers, baseball's version of the Border
Grill.
</P>
<P>
   Both the eatery on Melrose Ave. and the team in Chavez Ravine
were hotter than jalapenos in the '80s. They were the talk of a
town that loves to hear itself speak. The Grill's dishes were
divine and in 1981 and 1985 and especially in 1988, so were the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Grill since has left chic Melrose Ave. and the
Dodgers have disappeared from the National League's high-rent
district. They're both still around _ you can find the Grill in
Santa Monica and the Dodgers in the cellar of the NL West _ but the
buzz has left their buildings. People are talking now about
Dominick's and Reign and the San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant doesn't go bad overnight and neither does a
ballclub. It just looks that way to people oblivious to the
day-to-day dynamics chipping away at the glitzy exterior. The truth
is, the Dodgers have been limping since just after Kirk Gibson's
gimpy home-run trot in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series against
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez. Charles Johnson. Tom Candiotti. Roger Cedeno.
Hideo Nomo. So many ex-Dodgers are thriving it suggests the front
office has been as error- prone as this team. Network sports sage
Bob Costas once spoke of the Dodgers being ``the worst team ever
put on the field.'' Amazingly, he was referring to the 1988 World
Series, not the California Civil-War Series that resumed Friday at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the 1988 squad had a much lower profile than the
team that dropped its sixth straight game Saturday. What that team
lacked in style points, though, it made up for in substance. From
top to bottom, the 1988 team had all the winning ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser. Rick Dempsey. Franklin Stubbs. Steve Sax.
Alfredo Griffin. Jeff Hamilton. Mickey Hatcher. John Shelby. Danny
Heep. It's not a lineup any rotisserie player would love, but it
won the World Series for the Dodgers 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with the 1999 Dodgers. They seem to have been
thrown together as if for a fantasy-baseball league where chemistry
isn't a concern. The 1999 Dodgers, who have a lot of chefs and not
nearly enough table setters, could learn a lot from picking the
brains of players on the 1988 team.
</P>
<P>
   Why not start with the bullpen coach, Dempsey? Dempsey was a
super sub on the 1988 team, one in a band of reserves that to a man
had more energy than ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible, how we played the game,'' Dempsey said.
``That year we played the game almost as perfect as you could play
it. We didn't beat ourselves too often. It was not a selfish
ballclub. Guys understood their roles. We all genuinely liked each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to gauge the affection this year's Dodgers have for
one another. Three hours before Friday's game, five players sat in
the home clubhouse. Three were chatting _ into their cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
   After the 6-3 loss, the players hurried to beat the traffic,
rushing out of the clubhouse with sneakers unlaced and sandals
unfastened, fanning out toward homes all over greater L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Team chemistry can't be bought, as the Dodgers are finding out
$80 million after the fact. It is fueled by winning, of course, but
it starts with teammates taking the time to get to know one another
as people and not just players.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how far camaraderie can carry a team. Dempsey could
tell this year's Dodgers that and so much more.
</P>
<P>
   If only they'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, inexcusably, not one player has ripped open the
cellophane wrapping on this walking encyclopedia of winning
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You can read whatever you want into that. Dempsey has his own
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression I get from a lot of players is when they make
five, six, ten million dollars, they probably feel like they've
maxed out on knowledge,'' Dempsey said. ``There's nothing more they
think they need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Dodger Blue, from Dempsey on down, wants you to know
the Dodgers are not soulless. They swear the mistakes being made,
on the bases and behind the plate and on the mound and in the
field, are a product of caring too much, not too little.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, so full of himself in
April, has come up empty in his search for answers. He proclaimed
himself ``humbled'' and believes he has plenty of company in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the players' frustration. I see their disappointment. I
see their pain,'' Malone said. ``The fans don't see it because we
don't show it. It's part of the society we live in. Men aren't
supposed to show compassion, emotion. Men are supposed to be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are tough all right _ on toilets and walls and water
coolers. Those shows of emotion are not constructive.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Gibson and Hershiser found other ways to fire up their
teammates. Today that responsibility has to fall squarely on the
shoulders of Kevin Brown and Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi and
Devon White and Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a bad group of guys here,'' Dempsey said. ``I
just think we do need a little better leadership. I haven't seen
that real fire yet. We need somebody to pick the ballclub up and
carry it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, the Dodgers set caps and jerseys and
equipment ablaze in an exorcism exercise that was Brown's idea.
Something tells us that's not the fire Dempsey was looking for. &QL;

GONZALEZ JUST WANTS JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez , upset at the fans' voting and
a previous snub by Yankees manager Joe Torre , said he will not go
to the All-Star Game if he is selected as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, last year's MVP, is not happy the fans in Cleveland
have dominated the voting for the starters, leaving him a distant
fifth among American League outfielders. Ken Griffey Jr. is the
runaway leader followed by Cleveland's
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton and David Justice . ``That's
incredible,'' said Gonzalez, who entered the weekend batting .315
with 23 homers and 70 RBI. ``It's a popularity game. You don't see
real justice in the All-Star voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wasn't voted in as a starter in 1997 even though he had
won the MVP award the year before. He also wasn't happy Torre
picked Yankees outfielders Bernie Williams
</P>
<P>
   and Paul O'Neill as reserves that year instead of him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in the game  &QL; 
Since acquiring shortstop Tony Batista from Arizona to replace
injured Alex Gonzalez , Toronto is playing well again. The Blue
Jays were 12-5 in their first 17 games with Batista in the lineup,
including 11-2 at home. He hit in 14 of the 17, with six homers and
15 RBI _ three more RBI than DHs Geronimo Berroa and the departed
Dave Hollins
</P>
<P>
   combined _ and they had nearly three times the at-bats. His
sixth homer (after five in Arizona) came in his 57th at-bat for
Toronto _ a ratio of one every 9.5 at-bats. The best ratios in the
majors this season have been Jose Canseco 's 10.0 and Sammy Sosa 's
10.2. Batista, best known for his exaggerated open stance,
surprised the D'backs with 18 homers last year, but they traded him
for reliever Dan Plesac because they needed bullpen help.
</P>
<P>
   Hold that deal  &QL; 
The Indians have the best record in baseball, but their track
record on trades the past two years isn't quite as impressive.
Cleveland, which always is looking for pitching, might be reluctant
to try again. Last year, GM John Hart
</P>
<P>
   dealt prospect Sean Casey to Cincinnati for right-hander
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba . Burba won 15 games last season and is 7-3 this
year, but Casey has been leading the NL in batting and turned just
25 on Friday. In November, Hart traded Brian Giles to Pittsburgh
for left-handed set-up man Ricardo Rincon . Giles is the Pirates
starting center fielder and entered the weekend hitting .304 with
16 homers and 52 RBI. Rincon has been a bust, spending most of
April on the DL and struggling in his last few outings.
</P>
<P>
   Moving around  &QL; 
After dropping Derek Jeter to the No. 3 spot, moving Bernie
Williams to No. 2, making Tino Martinez the cleanup hitter and
making Paul O'Neill the No. 5 hitter two weeks ago, the Yankees hit
.342 overall and .373 with runners in scoring position. Williams in
particular is thriving. He batted .364 with seven HRs and 21 RBI in
June, and a whopping .469 (23 for 49) with five HRs and 10 RBI
after the shift. During the same span, O'Neill hit .382 (13 of 34),
rising from .267 to .286. And Martinez, who was batting .255 before
the move, hit .360 (16 for 44) in a 10-game stretch, raising his
average to .272.
</P>
<P>
   Young guns  &QL; 
You probably haven't heard of Chad Harville and Billy Koch . You
will. Oakland's Harville and Toronto's Koch, both rookies, are two
of the league's hardest-throwing relievers. Koch, who struck out
Canseco and Fred McGriff to end Monday's game in Tampa, made it
five in a row when he fanned the side in the eighth Tuesday. The
Jays have not had a dominant closer since Kelvim Escobar was moved
to the rotation, but Koch saved his 10th game Thursday. Harville,
called up on June 23, hasn't given up a run yet. After giving up an
infield single to the first man he faced in the big leagues, Texas'
Lee Stevens , Harville, who has hit 99 on the radar gun, hasn't
allowed another hit. &QL;

WHY NOT LET FANS CALL THE SHOTS?

<P>
   Does Jerry Buss play chess? If so, I suppose his chess set would
be the one with the topless queen.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kevin Malone play chess? On his chess board the pawns would
move in eight different directions, unable to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Does Michael Ovitz play chess? The fact he doesn't have a board
or pieces doesn't mean he's not a player.
</P>
<P>
   I'm asking because if the men running Southern California sports
play chess, they might be aware of something unusual the world
chess champion is doing on the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   And if they know about it, they might see the Internet's
potential for solving the local teams' many problems and muting the
widespread second-guessing of their front offices.

<P>
   Gary Kasparov is playing a game against ``the world'' _ at least
those citizens of the world who know that Ruy Lopez is the name of
a chess opening, not a Braves shortstop, that the Sicilian is a
defense, not a pizza, and that (begin ital)en passant(end ital)
describes a kind of pawn capture, not a French pick-up line.
</P>
<P>
   Kasparov plays white and has a day to decide on each his moves.
``The world'' plays black and has a day to decide _ via an Internet
vote _ on each of its moves.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the ultimate test of common sense. And in the

   The world is not getting swept and is not in last place.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how this relates to sports.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to many of us that common sense has gone out of sports.

HUSBAND CONVICTED IN `SLEEPWALK' KILLING: `I'M NOT MONSTER'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater, convicted of murder despite his defense
that he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 44 times, wants
the world to know one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not this monster that they're trying to paint me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who I am on the inside,'' Falater said in an interview
Friday in the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't changed. That will never change, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments since his June 25 conviction,
Falater, who is seeking a new trial, decried the ``lynch-mob blood
lust''in public reaction to his trial.
</P>
<P>
   The former Motorola engineer also said that even he remains
uncertain about his sleepwalking defense, which drew international
attention to his case, and that he realizes many people will always
consider it a ``scam.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater, 43, also sought to rebut critics ``who don't know me
from Adam but suddenly find they can spout off all sorts of
terrible things about me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they spent an hour with me, they wouldn't say those
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black-and-white jail house stripes, Falater appeared
re laxed and self-assured one week after he was found guilty of
first-de gree murder in the bloody, 1997 killing of his wife,
Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 90 minutes, Falater poured out his remorse about
killing his wife, a brutal act that he acknowledges but for which
he claims complete amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about his feeling of failure as a father, the
forgiveness he says he's received from his mother-in-law, his anger
at what he considers foul play by the prosecu tor, his puzzlement
at the verdict and his determination to find mean ing in his life
even if he's sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming there will come a time, sometime maybe in this
life or maybe in the next life,'' he said, ``when I will see the
purpose and I will see that it was a good thing after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater continued to assert his innocence despite a jury that
took less than eight hours to agree that he committed premeditated
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say I am innocent,'' he said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not _ maybe I killed my wife with my hands. I certainly
didn't plan it. I certainly never intended to do anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his monthlong trial in Mari copa County Superior Court, Fala
ter's attorneys argued that he had been sleepwalking when he
stabbed his wife, stashed his bloody clothes, dragged her into the
pool, held her head underwater, then walked back inside his house.
</P>
<P>
   But Falater detached himself from his own defense, declining to
say that he actually was sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember what hap pened,'' he said. ``That's all I can
say. How can I say I was sleepwal king when I don't remember?''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he isn't scared by the death penalty, which
prosecutor Juan Martinez intends to seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to lay my chips with God anytime,'' Falater said.
``I know how I live my life, despite what's been said about me. I
know who I am, what kind of person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater countered Martinez's claim that Falater tried to deceive
the jury with a ``Don Quixote fantasy'' about his home life, which
defense witnesses, including Falater's two children said was never
marred even by serious argu ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the fantasy _ what happened one night or the previous
20 years of my mar riage, the previous 41 years of my life?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reality. And so I tell you that's what I hope God
would judge me on.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he was ``appalled'' at what he called Martinez's
distortion of the facts, particularly the prose cutor's claim that
Falater had taken part in a suspicious conversation three weeks
before the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez claimed Falater had talked then about the case of
Canadian Ken Parks, who used a sleepwalking defense to win acquit
tal on a murder charge. But the prosecutor never produced testi
mony to support the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard of Ken Parks before I was arrested,''
Falater said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Martinez had based his claim on a distorted version of a
conversation among Falater's col leagues that took place after they
learned about the sleepwalking de fense.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Lori Voepel, who partic ipated in the interview, noted
that Judge Ronald Reinstein had in structed the jury to ignore the
discussion of the Canadian issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's hard to remove that taint,'' said Voepel, who cited
the issue in her motion for a new trial, filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Falater also claimed that Martinez deliberately distorted
information about Yarmila's contraction of a venereal disease,
human papilloma virus.
</P>
<P>
   With the jury out of the court room, Martinez said a nurse had
told Yarmila that the disease meant her husband had been ``messing
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein ruled that the episode was irrelevant to the trial,
and the jury heard nothing of it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Falater fears the jury may have been exposed to
heavy press coverage of the issue, ``which sort of implied that
yes, I had been fooling around on my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I had never been unfaithful to my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he never contracted the disease, that Yarmila's
case of HPV had never been a source of conflict in their marriage,
and that the virus is sometimes transmitted through non-sexual
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has refused to comment on the defense claims.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, whose marriage to Yar mila was consecrated for eternity
in a Mormon temple ceremony, said he hopes to be reunited with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly hope she would be forgiving towards me and
would want me back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's calm demeanor broke down briefly as he discussed his
wife and his two children, 15-year-old Michael and Megan, this
year's valedictorian at North Canyon High School, who turned 18 the
week her father was convicted of murdering her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children have been dam aged in ways I don't even know, I'm
assuming,'' Falater said, adding that Megan had fallen into a
depression after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Falater disputed the post-trial observations of one juror about
his interview with a detective a few hours after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted the fact that his wife was dead too easily,''
juror Theresa Beaubien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just pretty numb that night,'' said Falater, who added
that police had earlier shouted him down when he asked what had
happened to Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   And Falater said his moth er-in-law has forgiven him for killing
Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You know, there's good and bad people in all of us,
and I know this was the bad person in you that would have done
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected the criticism of those who compared his case
with O.J. Simpson's and called it a ``rich-man's defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rich man,'' said Falater, claiming he has a negative
net worth after setting aside a fund for his children's education
and after making some payments to defense attorneys Voepel and Mike
Kimerer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike spent the last dollar of mine in October of last year,''
Falater said. He said Kimerer has been donating his time ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Falater also said his former lock-'em-up attitude toward
lawbreakers has undergone a major transforma tion in the 2{ years
he has spent in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (inmates) are real people, real sorrows, real emotions,
every bit as good as anybody out there,'' he said. ``And many of
these guys have never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially, I feel terrible for a lot of the kids who I meet,
who . . . were raised in a neighborhood where they didn't know
anything but gangs. And they've never been given a fair shake, and
yet, they're being punished for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he has given religious instructions to fellow
inmates who have sought it. He said he would like to continue to
help them as he struggles with the possibility that he may never
again be a free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working with the assump tion that there is still some
meaning and purpose to all of this, that the Heavenly Father knows
what he's doing,'' he said. &QL;

HERMOSILLO GIVES GALAXY A SPARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The Galaxy is benefiting from the acquisition of
Carlos Hermosillo faster than coach Sigi Schmid had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hermosillo's arrival June 12, Schmid joked after another
loss that ``the cavalry was on its way,'' referring to the arrival
of Mexico's all-time leading scorer. Obviously, he was looking for
a positive spin on what was turning out to be a disastrous season.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, he was close to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, once 5-9, had gone its first 12 games without
scoring more than one goal. The team is 3-0 with Hermosillo and has
stretched its winning streak to four games. Hermosillo has also
scored a goal in each of his games.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Galaxy hopes to continue its winning ways in front
of what should be a larger-than-usual crowd at the Rose Bowl when
it faces Miami (4-12, 8 points) at 7:30 p.m., with the traditional
Fourth of July fireworks show to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Schmid talked about how Hermosillo has
affected the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very upbeat person, a practical joker,'' Schmid said.
``There's always a smile on his face _ on the bus or on the field
in training. Based on his pedigree and on what he's accomplished,
that goes a long way when the young players see him enjoying his
work. It shows them the discipline and respect needed to succeed,
but that you can also have a good time doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   That off-field work ethic is what the Galaxy needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is. He's a man of tremendous character,'' Schmid said. ``He
has boosted our team morale and camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Women's World Cup taking center stage the past few
weeks, the Galaxy has quietly begun to make a move in the Western
Conference race. Los Angeles (9-6, 21 points) is tied for third
with Chicago and trails first-place Colorado (10-3, 26 points) by
only five points.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is also no longer the worst scoring team in the
league. It has 10 goals in its past three games to bring its season
total to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy we're finding the net on a more regular
basis,'' Schmid said. ``I'm glad we're helping the league's goal
average instead of bringing it down.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern Schmid has, however, is helping Cobi Jones find the
consistency that helped him score 19 goals and set up 13 others
last year. Jones was named the U.S. Player of the Year and had a
successful stint with the U.S. national team as well.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has only two goals and three assists this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, that's a priority for me, to help Cobi turn things
around,'' Schmid said. ``Jones was asked to carry a tremendous load
for us this season, and that took a tremendous amount of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of little nagging injuries and he's the
second-most fouled player in the league. He will find his game. Now
that our team seems to have found its game, it's our job to help
him find his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not that far off; he's just mentally and physically
fatigued at this point.''

PARK HANDS GIANTS A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park walks to the mound on eggshells these
days, his arm never better, his confidence never worse.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday against the San Francisco Giants, he was a 9-1 loss
waiting to happen, a shattered pitcher on a shattered team that
dropped its sixth straight in front of a crowd of 41,770 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Park now has four consecutive losses of his own since returning
from a suspension for kicking Angels pitcher Tim Belcher on June 3.
But unlike most of his teammates, who say their slump is a passing
thing, there is genuine concern about Park's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to know what he is thinking out there right now,''
pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``It doesn't seem like his mind
is on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-7) hasn't won since May 26, but he has never been this
bad. Against the first-place Giants, he allowed nine runs and left
in the fifth inning without retiring a batter. He was coming off
last Sunday's 8-7 loss in San Francisco, where he gave up seven
runs (six earned) in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of pressure on me right now and it is impossible
to relax,'' said Park, whose ERA is 10.04 since June 1 and 6.19
overall. ``So many things are running through my head. I am not
strong mentally out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not strong enough to withstand several close calls by
home-plate umpire Randy Marsh. After loading the bases in the fifth
by allowing a single and two walks, Park thought he had J.T. Snow
struck out. He didn't get the call, walked Snow and was pulled
after hitting the next batter, Ellis Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Both later scored to make it 9-1 and make it easy on Giants
starter Mark Gardner (3-6), who left after five innings with a
strained hip muscle.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that reliever Onan Masaoka and Mike Maddux
followed Park with five innings of scoreless relief. The last-place
Dodgers are freefalling, dropping six games in the standings in the
last seven days.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping to avoid their second consecutive sweep tonight
when Ismael Valdes, who has dropped five straight decisions, takes
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Carlos Perez, who ran into trouble Friday night after
getting the first two outs in four separate innings, Park got
knocked around early and often. His fastball was around 95, but he
was timid in tight spots.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard opened the game with a double and scored on Barry
Bonds' infield out. Bonds made it 4-1 in the third inning with a
two-run homer, his third of the series and ninth overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants blew it open in the fifth and Park had no explanation
more than an hour later. He went back to watch the inning on replay
and counted at least eight pitches he thought Marsh missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're on, you get through that,'' Osteen said.
``It's obvious that his confidence isn't there. Neither is the
aggressiveness he has shown in the past. A big part of my job is
being a psychologist. We'll try to figure this out before his next
start.''
</P>
<P>
   That will come Thursday in Colorado against the Rockies, who
entered Saturday with nine consecutive losses before stopping San
Diego's winning streak at 14 with a 12-10 victory in the opening
game of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Park will do more thinking. Last year, he was
National League Pitcher of the Month in July after going 4-0 with a
1.05 ERA. To that point, he had also struggled with his confidence
after battling back trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the turning point was last season,'' said
Park, who finished with 15 victories. ``I'll try to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Park claims his problems do not stem from failed attempts last
month to get a multiyear contract from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate Valdes went through a similar situation last year.
After winning 28 games in his first two full seasons, Valdes
appeared headed for a long and lucrative contract. Instead, he had
back-to-back subpar seasons and wound up signing a one-year deal
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was criticized for not challenging hitters. Park now
faces the same scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like I have to turn this thing around for
everyone,'' Park said. ``We need to get some wins and get this
thing going. But I'm not making it happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In keeping with Independence Day tra dition, the U.S.
Departments of Justice and Veterans Affairs have decided to hold an
old-fashioned barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   They've dug a narrow pit in central Phoenix, stoked it with hot
coals and built over it a sturdy spit, on which they hope to slowly
roast a 77-year-old war hero named Bob Deheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they're going forward with this,'' said
Deheer's attorney, Mi chael Rooney. ``I can't believe our gov
ernment would waste its money going after an elderly veteran. And
for what?''
</P>
<P>
   For 75 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Deheer got into a scuffle with officers at the Carl T.
Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The vet was in town to get
his hearing aids adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   He has trouble walking long distances now and couldn't find an
open handi capped parking space in the crowded lot.
</P>
<P>
   So, he tried to park in one of the spaces near the front door
marked ``VIP,'' areas supposedly for federal inspectors in town
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Deheer needed to use the restroom and figured a guy like him,
who'd earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart as a ma chine-gunner
in France, was as much a VIP as any two-bit bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the eyes of the federal cops on parking lot duty. &QL; 
VERBAL FISTICUFFS
</P>
<P>
   They got into a war of words with De heer and wound up hauling
him off in handcuffs, locking him in a cell, then is suing him two
citations _ a $50 disor derly conduct charge and a $25 ticket for
failing to comply with a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
   The feds say that Deheer was abusive, even physically
threatening, and that he refused to use parking spaces that
officers pointed out to him. Deheer denies this. He says the delay
in getting to a restroom actually caused him to urinate on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to pay those fines,'' he told me last month,
when I first wrote about this. ``It just isn't right. I don't care
if they put me in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't.
</P>
<P>
   But they do plan to take him to court. Rather than drop the
charges and apolo gize to Deheer, which would be the right thing,
the VA, in partnership with the U.S. attorney, decided last week to
take the case before a federal magistrate. A trial is set for late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they need to improve their con viction percentages, which
dropped re cently when an appeals court overturned guilty verdicts
against Fife Symington _ an embarrassing setback for prosecutors
who'd spent years chasing the former governor. Now, the government
will use its full powers to take down Bob Deheer.
</P>
<P>
   Over a parking lot beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what we asked GIs like Mr. Deheer to risk their lives
for?'' attorney Rooney asked. &QL; 
ANSWER IN DOUBLE TALK
</P>
<P>
   I put the same question to the folks at the VA and the U.S.
Attorney's Office. What I got in return was double talk.
</P>
<P>
   `'We are not policymakers,'' a spokes woman from the U.S.
Attorney's Office said. ``Our job is to take cases referred to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, without regard for common sense or common decency.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. government beats Bob De heer, it'll be because it
has all the money and all the power. Which is because De heer and
millions like him once stood against guns and bombs and cannon
shells and did not yield.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the old vet won't yield, now, when the
government he risked his life to defend has its big guns pointed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   The words in the Declaration of Inde pendence, celebrated today,
still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Some truths really are self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Although, at the VA and the Justice Department, they don't seem
to believe all men are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Or that those who so served their coun try have been endowed
with certain un alienable rights.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it easy to see how bu reaucrats with no lives and no
respect for liberty would believe so fervently in the pursuit of
Bob Deheer. &QL;

   ``I can't believe they're going forward with this,'' said
Deheer's attorney, Mi chael Rooney. ``I can't believe our gov
ernment would waste its money going after an elderly veteran. And
for what?''
</P>
<P>
   For 75 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Deheer got into a scuffle with officers at the Carl T.
Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The vet was in town to get
his hearing aids adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   He has trouble walking long distances now and couldn't find an
open handi capped parking space in the crowded lot.
</P>
<P>
   So, he tried to park in one of the spaces near the front door
marked ``VIP,'' areas supposedly for federal inspectors in town
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Deheer needed to use the restroom and figured a guy like him,
who'd earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart as a ma chine-gunner
in France, was as much a VIP as any two-bit bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the eyes of the federal cops on parking lot duty. &QL; 
VERBAL FISTICUFFS
</P>
<P>
   They got into a war of words with De heer and wound up hauling
him off in handcuffs, locking him in a cell, then is suing him two
citations _ a $50 disor derly conduct charge and a $25 ticket for
failing to comply with a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
   The feds say that Deheer was abusive, even physically
threatening, and that he refused to use parking spaces that
officers pointed out to him. Deheer denies this. He says the delay
in getting to a restroom actually caused him to urinate on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to pay those fines,'' he told me last month,
when I first wrote about this. ``It just isn't right. I don't care
if they put me in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't.
</P>
<P>
   But they do plan to take him to court. Rather than drop the
charges and apolo gize to Deheer, which would be the right thing,
the VA, in partnership with the U.S. attorney, decided last week to
take the case before a federal magistrate. A trial is set for late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they need to improve their con viction percentages, which
dropped re cently when an appeals court overturned guilty verdicts
against Fife Symington _ an embarrassing setback for prosecutors
who'd spent years chasing the former governor. Now, the government
will use its full powers to take down Bob Deheer.
</P>
<P>
   Over a parking lot beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what we asked GIs like Mr. Deheer to risk their lives
for?'' attorney Rooney asked. &QL; 
ANSWER IN DOUBLE TALK
</P>
<P>
   I put the same question to the folks at the VA and the U.S.
Attorney's Office. What I got in return was double talk.
</P>
<P>
   `'We are not policymakers,'' a spokes woman from the U.S.
Attorney's Office said. ``Our job is to take cases referred to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, without regard for common sense or common decency.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. government beats Bob De heer, it'll be because it
has all the money and all the power. Which is because De heer and
millions like him once stood against guns and bombs and cannon
shells and did not yield.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the old vet won't yield, now, when the
government he risked his life to defend has its big guns pointed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   The words in the Declaration of Inde pendence, celebrated today,
still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Some truths really are self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Although, at the VA and the Justice Department, they don't seem
to believe all men are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Or that those who so served their coun try have been endowed
with certain un alienable rights.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it easy to see how bu reaucrats with no lives and no
respect for liberty would believe so fervently in the pursuit of
Bob Deheer. &QL;

MONDESI ACCEPTS BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi knows something about slumps. He has
one home run in his last 114 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that the Dodgers' listless stretch could
change if he has more games like Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi is still holding at 19 home runs, but he went 3 for 3 in
a 9-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, including a sharp double in
the second inning that led to the Dodgers' only run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dodgers' (34-44) sixth consecutive loss, one short of
their longest slump since Aug. 7-13, 1993. They are 10 games under
.500 for the first time since 1992, when they finished last.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is on me,'' said Mondesi, who is still on pace
to hit 40 homers this year. ``When I was hitting, we were okay.
Since I stopped, we've haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 10-21 since May 28 when he hit a home run
against the Atlanta Braves. In an effort to get Mondesi rolling,
manager Davey Johnson has moved him out of the cleanup spot.
Mondesi has batted first, third and sixth. Saturday, he was in the
fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has told teammates he thinks Johnson is picking on him
in light of the team's failures. Saturday, he said it is no big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worrying about that; it will take care of itself,''
Mondesi said. ``If I keep working hard, days like this will mean
wins later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna BP: Antonio Osuna, sidelined most the season with elbow
problems, made 35 pitches to hitters before the game and said he is
ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   The club will decide the next move for Osuna, who underwent
surgery May 20 to remove a bone spur from his right elbow. He could
throw to hitters again at Dodger Stadium or begin a minor-league
rehabilitation assignment at Single-A San Bernardino. Osuna is
expected back right after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Third baseman Adrian Beltre, who strained his groin
Friday night, did not play Saturday and said he might not return
until Monday in Colorado. ``It was still sore when I got to the
ballpark,'' said Beltre, who has missed just five of 78 games this
season. . . . Five scoreless innings by relievers Onan Masaoka and
Mike Maddux continued a solid stretch for the Dodgers bullpen. In
the last 35 games, they are 4-3 with a 2.52 ERA and nine saves.
Masaoka also got his first major-league at-bat and was credited
with a sacrifice. . . . Giants starter Mark Gardner (3-6) left
after five innings with a strained left hip flexor but recorded his
second victory over the Dodgers in the last seven days. The Dodgers
had just four hits off Gardner and three relievers.

SPORTS RADIO: HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?  
 3 PHOENIX STATIONS FIGHTING FOR LISTENERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There are those times, rare as they may be, when
sports talk radio rises above itself. It's relevant, topical and
informative.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, it becomes radio's slime pit. You want to jab at
the off button, or turn in frustration to hard rock to drown out
the drivel.
</P>
<P>
   As in most love-hate relationships, the day-to-day reality
usually falls between the two extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the emergence of Phoenix as the nation's only
market with three full-time sports-talk stations, the rules have
changed. Two years after ``The Republic'' last examined this
sports-talk glut, hosts routinely deliver crude lines as if
auditioning for a nightclub act; many change stations, some are
canned, a few are run out of town; and collegiate and professional
teams keep landing in new flagships.
</P>
<P>
   The can-you-top-this-one attitude is prevalent. Who can
out-gross whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are coming to expect in talk radio is talent,''
said Clancy Woods, the general manager of KGME and the Phoenix
market manager of Chancellor Media, which recently added KGME-AM
(550) to its stable of stations.
</P>
<P>
   Counters Tony Femino of KMVP-AM (860): ``A lot of guys come here
and get their first radio jobs after delivering milk a year ago. I
think you have to prove yourself. Any idiot can talk . . . it's how
you go about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports talk radio has had growth, but I don't know if it's
progressed.'' &QL; 
`More not better' &QL; 
So how have the three 24-hour sports stations, fraught with their
fragile egos, gone about it the last couple of years?
</P>
<P>
   For KGME-AM, it was moving down the dial, getting a stronger
signal and picking up Arizona State athletics in the process. Its
shock talk/guy talk format has propelled it to No. 1. KDUS-AM
(1060) has rights to the Cardinals and Coyotes, but only one local
program and minuscule, if any, ratings. KMVP scored a coup by
picking up Femino after he left KGME, and its ratings have
improved; along the way, however, it lost ASU sports. KMVP's sister
station, KTAR-AM (620), is a pseudo-sports station, carrying
Diamondbacks and Suns game and limited sports talk.
</P>
<P>
   Who's winning the war? That depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to someone who listens to all three stations, such as
attorney Tom Lukas of Scottsdale, and he's hard-pressed to find an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think more stations make it better,'' he said. ``It
actually makes it worse. It seems that particularly KDUS is really
reaching to just fill time. They couldn't possibly be going after
ratings. I was here from 1984 to 1991, then moved to San Francisco
until 2{ years ago. When I came back, I was absolutely amazed at
what we had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to advertisers, and they point to ratings among the genre's
target group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients hire us to find the best way to reach their
audience,'' said Mike Horne of Results Media. ``In this case, it's
anyone (advertiser) who's interested in a male-driven audience.
Anyone who has a product for the young male audience, usually
25-44, this is a perfect spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost depends. At the three stations, the combined audience
for a week is only 200,000 listeners. What really drives how much a
station can charge are the ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Horne, who works on a two-book average, said the latest numbers
show KGME at the top, with a 3.0 rating for the 6 a.m.-midnight
slot among the target audience (25-54 males). KMVP follows with
1.6, and KDUS was not a factor. In the winter book, KGME's morning
show (4.2) led KMVP (1.4), and its afternoon offering (3.1) also
was ahead of KMVP (2.9). KDUS' ratings, again, were barely blips.
</P>
<P>
   Preaching to the choir &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A major advertiser on sports talk radio is Fox Sports Net
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a major investment with KGME, who we view as the
leader in sports talk radio,'' said Kyle Eng, the director of
marking and communications for Fox. ``We view advertising on sports
talk radio as an effective way to reach our core audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Eng said the network knows that advertising on sports talk radio
is like preaching to the choir, and that's the reason advertisers
like to spread their message on different stations in the same
family.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the hosts and their bosses, and they're not hesitant to
pat themselves on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' said Bruce Jacobs, a morning co-host at
KGME. ``We never get scooped. We're the only sports radio station
in this town that ever breaks a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm tooting my own horn, that's fine. We are much more
aggressive. We've done a lot more breaking stories than any station
in this town. In fact, all of them combined.''
</P>
<P>
   While the myriad of sports talk show hosts may profess to have
all the answers, questions keep swirling.
</P>
<P>
   Sports talk shows around the country have changed dramatically
during the last decade. It has reached a point where you can be
shocked by what someone says but not the least bit surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Jude LaCava, a former host of the 620 Sports Line during the
days when KTAR was regarded as the major sports station in Arizona,
always was viewed as a ``safe'' bet. Even now, as the sports anchor
at Channel 10 (KSAZ-TV), he approaches his job in a light-hearted
manner, but he never strays into questionable territory.
</P>
<P>
   He believes nothing can stop the talk show pendulum until
advertisers go elsewhere and people turn a deaf ear. LaCava said if
he were doing a talk show today, his style would be similar to the
one he had a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never allow outside force to influence who I am,'' he
said. ``You've got to be yourself. You've got to change with the
times, you have to adjust, but creativity has no limits. I like to
think we had just as much entertainment value but in a different
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment could be Jacobs' middle name. That seems to be the
crux of his show, get down and dirty and if sports comes up, fine.
In fact, one self-promotional spot touted the fact the show only
had a 10 percent sports content.
</P>
<P>
   Should kids listen to this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people who are entertained by the show, the happier
we are,'' said Jacobs, the one person many listeners, athletes and
team officials love to hate. ``In terms of the material we talk
about sometimes, do I think kids should listen to it? I don't think
it's as graphic as say, Howard Stern, but I'm not so sure little
kids should be listening, quite honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But junior high kids, 14, 15, I don't see any problem with
them listening to our show. The stuff they hear in school is a lot
worse than they ever hear on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' show with Jim Traber, the station's afternoon duo of
John Gambadoro and Tim Liotta, and KMVP's Paul Calvisi and Ron
Wolfley are the ones who most frequently stray off the sports line.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who said sports talk radio is headed in the right
direction in Phoenix, apparently is working on a plan of putting
his hosts on a shorter leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance to strike between individual
responsibilities and opinions, and responding to the needs of the
community,'' Woods said. ``It just may be a coincidence, but since
we've owned KGME, I think you're seeing less of that (guy talk)
than you did previously. There's much more of a focus on
credibility and access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to the hosts, and what I've explained to people is
that being obnoxious and not having access to key sports figures in
the sports marketplace is not a position that is valuable to us.
Outspoken and credible, that is a position that we would like to
have. I hope we are the station that is the place somebody can
count on for us to state an opinion, to ask the hard questions, if
necessary, but more importantly be the place where you can get the
most information about sports in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta, who also serves as KGME's program director, said his
stations' future is bolstered by the fact Woods ``is such an avid
proponent'' of talk radio, ``and he has a vision that goes way
beyond what others see.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if some of his hosts go too far at times, Chris
Gallu, general manager at KTAR/KMVP said, ``Absolutely. I would
never tell you that my guys have never gone over the edge because
they have. It's my job to talk to them about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kennedy, the lone host at KDUS, thinks too much deviation
from sports isn't the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy talk rates and sports talk doesn't rate,'' Kennedy said.
``And I believe it's damaged the industry. I think it's forced
people to focus on the ridiculous. I think most of our listeners
would rather talk about sports, not the box scores, that's boring,
but interviews and talk about people who play the game, the arenas,
the business of sports, anything but (guy talk). I think a steady
diet of that is what's ruining sports talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've forgotten that sports are fun. I think that's
the problem now.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gambadoro, a co-host at KGME, cares little what his rivals
think _ and he said that he doesn't look at KDUS as competition,
anyway: ``They ventured in, went a year, and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   When hosts like Gambadoro wan der off, they can always see the
logic.
</P>
<P>
   `Sex on radio isn't funny' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want everybody to love you,'' he said. ``You want
people to love you and hate you, but you want them to listen. Those
hosts that are out there to make everybody like them, that doesn't
work. You want people to hate you and disagree with you. That's
what makes talk radio great.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cesmat of KTAR wonders how long the status quo can prevail,
asking, ``Do advertisers want to associate themselves with
pornography on the radio, in essence? Do teams want to be
associated with topless clubs, strip joints and jokes about sex? Do
teams want to be associated with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear some of this stuff that has gone out on the air,
to me it's like somebody isn't getting enough direction. It's not
funny. Sex on the radio is not funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the envelope to the edge, or even off the table, could
work, Femino said, if done creatively and in fairly good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in talking about dates,'' he said. ``You can't
waste people's time. Here are the dynamics. Give the information,
be entertaining, do good interviews and then talk to the callers.
We'll put our interviews up against anyone, not just in the market
but in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the creativity aspect that's important,'' continued
Femino, who refers to the University of Arizona as the University
of Geraldo and former Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne as the Pope on a
Tractor. ``How far can you go? That completely depends on the host.
If the host is good at doing something, you can go as far as he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   True up to a point, says Mike Golic of ESPN Radio, a former host
at KGME.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is definitely shorter nationally,'' Golic said. ``As
far as pushing the envelope, locally you can get away with more.''
</P>
<P>
   Accountability is one area that's extremely gray in talk radio.
Hosts frequently state opinion as fact, and when they're wrong,
they seldom recap their transgressions. They have the forum to
criticize unmercifully, to accuse and to convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think there's accountability, in terms of what you say
about athletes or coaches,'' Jacobs said. ``There's no
accountability if you never show up in a locker room, which a lot
of people in this town and business don't. They just rip away, and
you never see them. That's not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambadoro said accountability comes in ``if we say something
incorrect, wrong or stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, the lawyer listener from Scottsdale, said talk show hosts
are fairly well shielded from lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're talking about public figures, you would have to
prove it was malicious,'' he said. ``In most cases, they have a lot
of leeway.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to puzzle most people is that Phoenix has so much
sports talk, a business that has a narrow base, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Can they all survive?
</P>
<P>
   When KDUS got the Cardinals rights two years ago, general
manager Chuck Artigue said if he ran the other sports stations in
town, he would change formats. It appears now that KDUS might be
the station on the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, yes, I think three stations are too
many,'' Kennedy said. ``I don't think there's room, long term, for
the survival of three sports stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought initially there was enough of the pie out there for
all of us to get a slice and survive, but I don't believe that any
more.''

MILITARY CHAFF MAY BE KILLING PHOENIX LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hair-thin fibers released by military jets to evade radar during
aerial war games in southern Arizona may be shorting out
spectacular monsoon lightning over Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the fibers, called chaff, float above the state
for up to a day, forming huge clouds seen only by weather radar and
preventing the huge buildup of energy needed to produce lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Routinely released by fighter jets during war games at the Barry
M. Goldwater Range, 65 miles southeast of Phoenix, the chaff
consists of hair-thin strands of aluminum-coated fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   Chaff is blamed for everything from making Nevada cattle sick to
posing health risks to those who breathe it in. But the Department
of Defense has denied chaff poses health or environmental risks,
and even critics point out there is not much solid information on
chaff.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Arizona have been looking at the chaff-lightning
connection since at least 1990. They took special notice of a
strange storm that swept out of the south and into the Valley on
Aug. 20, 1993. The storm pummeled the Valley with heavy rain, hail
and powerful winds. There was even a report of a funnel cloud.
</P>
<P>
   But there was almost no lightning.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTNING STRIKES ARE FEW
</P>
<P>
   And lightning almost always comes with strong summer storms in
Arizona. But this storm packed just one cloud-to-ground lightning
strike. A normal storm of that magnitude could have been expected
to produce 35 such bolts, according to Tucson research
meteorologist Robert Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   ``That storm triggered several of us to dig into the data and
try to figure out what in the hell was going on,'' said Maddox,
past director of the Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., and
currently a visiting scientist at the National Weather Service
Office in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said he and his colleagues have been perplexed for years
over weather records indicating that Phoenix has an unusually low
number of lightning strikes for the number of strong monsoon
thunderstorms that pass through in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox took a serious look at the military war games after
examining studies conducted 30 years ago by scientists in Boulder,
Colo., who experimented with dumping chaff directly into developing
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, whose research is ongoing, published a study in 1997,
and his colleagues documented 11 potent Valley summer storms from
1995 to 1998 that produced no lightning.
</P>
<P>
   He said that so far, researchers have been focusing on the
Valley because it's a ``natural laboratory.'' Summer wind currents
blow chaff clear across the Valley, settling out at about the
McDowell Mountains. DISCHARGING LIGHTNING
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaff has sharp edges that discharge lightning,'' Maddox said.
``The net effect is that the really high electrical charge needed
to generate a lightning strike never has a chance to accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although chaff floats unseen over the Valley, it shows up
vividly on Doppler radar, said Tony Haffer, head meteorologist in
the Phoenix office of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggravating,'' Haffer said. ``Chaff tends to make clouds
look like they're capable of producing more precipitation than they
really are. Sometimes, we're not absolutely sure what is and what
is not chaff. It's like the old commercial, `Is it real or
Memorex?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Haffer said that when there's doubt, National Weather Service
offices do further analysis to determine the true nature of the
Doppler signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, it's amusing,'' Haffer said. ``We've noticed that
some of the local television personalities point to the bogus radar
echoes and say there are showers southwest of Phoenix and moving
our way. But when you look at the satellite picture, we have clear
skies.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffer said he'd just like to know when and where the big chaff
dumps will occur.
</P>

   ``We've tried to get some idea from the military, but they've
been reluctant to share that with us,'' Haffer said.  &QL; 
2 MILLION FIBERS PER BUNDLE
</P>
<P>
   According to a September 1998 report issued by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, there were
237,975 bundles of chaff released in 1997 during war games at the
Goldwater range. There are approximately 2 million fibers per
bundle.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldwater range is managed by Luke Air Force Base. Jeff
Rothrock, chief of environmental compliance at Luke, said he's not
familiar with any kind of problems caused by chaff.
</P>
<P>
   Luke news division chief, Mary Jo May, said she also is
unfamiliar with Maddox's chaff research or complaints by the
National Weather Service regarding chaff.
</P>
<P>
   Weather experts said Maddox's research holds up. &QL; 
`PRETTY GOOD CASE'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he makes a pretty good case that it is indeed chaff
that is causing the lack of lightning for certain days here in
Phoenix,'' said Randy Cerveny, a geography professor at Arizona
State University who specializes in storm meteorology and Arizona
monsoons.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Krider, professor of atmospheric sciences at the
University of Arizona, also is familiar with Maddox's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks to me like it's happening,'' Krider said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear what's happening beyond the apparent lost light
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said chaff apparently does not affect other elements of a
thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny said lightning does have beneficial aspects, such as
splitting nitrogen molecules from oxygen molecules and fixing the
nitrogen into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major, natural way the earth gets fertilized,''
Cerveny said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny said lightning also corrects an imbalance between
positive charges at ground level and negative charges in the cloud.
He said there are also studies examining the correlation between
lightning strikes and rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we don't know all the ramifications when there's an
absence of lightning,'' Cerveny said. &QL;

UNSETTLING HEART AILMENT SENDS SPENCER TO SIDELINE 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Instead of playing left field at Yankee Stadium
Saturday, Shane Spencer was lying at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center being treated for an irregular heartbeat. It is never
enjoyable to be poked and prodded inside a hospital, and the
mysterious aspect of a 27-year-old who has never had previous heart
problems suddenly experiencing them added to the delicate nature of
Spencer's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer told the Yankee trainers that he felt dizzy during
Friday night's game with the Orioles, and Joe Torre replaced
Spencer with Ricky Ledee in the seventh inning. Before the eighth
was over, Spencer, who was growing nervous because he was having
heart palpitations, was brought to the hospital, where he will
remain for an undetermined period.
</P>
<P>
   When General Manager Brian Cashman asked about visiting Spencer
Saturday morning, he was told not to bother because Spencer had to
undergo a battery of tests and could not see anyone. That was
unsettling enough to make some Yankees feel pensive. Chili Davis
stopped a humorous discourse about himself to mention how he felt
sorry for Spencer; Derek Jeter promised to call Spencer; and Ledee
whispered about the awkwardness of taking over left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not funny when a teammate gets hurt and you get the
chance to play,'' Ledee said. ``It doesn't feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Scott Brosius' dramatic three-run home run off Arthur
Rhodes in the ninth inning gave the Yankees a 6-5 victory over the
Orioles Saturday, Torre discussed Spencer's travails as someone who
has more knowledge of heart ailments than he wants. Torre's brother
Rocco died of a heart attack three years ago, and another brother,
Frank, had a heart transplant a day before the Yankees nabbed the
1996 World Series title. But each Torre was twice as old as Spencer
is. Twenty-seven-year-old professional athletes are usually
concerned about what club to hang out in, not about atrial
fibrillation. Unfortunately, Spencer is being treated for atrial
fibrillation, something he most likely had not heard of before
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coastal Cardiology of San Luis Obispo, Calif.,
atrial fibrillation is a disorder that is found in nearly two
million Americans, most of whom are older. The two upper chambers
of the heart, the atria, collect blood from the veins and pump it
to the ventricles. When atrial fibrillation is present, the atria
quiver instead of beating effectively. There are numerous risk
factors that can trigger the condition, including high blood
pressure, an overactive thyroid and excessive consumption of
alcohol. Dr. Stuart Hershon, the team's physician, was not certain
what caused Spencer's disorder, but he said that Spencer did not
have any blood clots, which is considered extremely important for
his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he was in danger,'' Hershon said. ``But when
someone has an irregular heartbeat at 27, you want to find out
what's wrong. I don't think he was ever in danger, but he had to be
treated appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Hershon gave Cashman the results of the unspecified tests,
and the Yankees determined that Spencer would need at least several
days to recuperate, they placed him on the 15-day disabled list.
Torre had not spoken with Spencer, but said: ``When things like
that happen, especially when you're young, it scares you. I'm sure
he was a little frightened, and might still be.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is Spencer's heart or Darryl Strawberry's colon
cancer, medical questions eventually give way to baseball
questions. That happened Saturday. While Spencer's health is the
major issue, the timing of his problem is disappointing from a
baseball perspective since Spencer had finally claimed ownership of
left field with 12 hits in his last 36 at-bats, including four
homers. Now the job is open again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure makes you think there's something more to left field
than playing it,'' Torre said. ``It's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees presumably had too many left fielders, but no one
from the group of Spencer, Ledee, Chad Curtis and Tony Tarasco
seized the position until Spencer started 17 of the last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   If Spencer returns in two weeks, he should play like someone who
has seen a ghost. It took him nine years to make it to the major
leagues, and he was an improbable hero last year. Still, Spencer
should realize more than ever that there are no guarantees. Savor
each game. Get enough rest. Eat properly. Avoid carousing. He will
not be 27 forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is temporary, and we'll get him back,'' Cashman
said. ``From everything I'm hearing, we're not going to lose him
for the entire season. It's frustrating for him. But we still
believe in him and Ricky Ledee, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee has been in this odd situation before. He was omitted from
the 1998 post-season roster until Strawberry learned during the
division series that he had cancer. It was an uncomfortable way to
be welcomed back, but Ledee wound up thriving in the World Series
with six hits in 10 at-bats. Ledee has not been as polished since,
including Saturday when he took a questionable angle on a fly ball
to enable two runs to score, went 0 for 2 and was picked off first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't fun when anybody goes down,'' Ledee said. ``But
somebody has to do something. I guess I got a chance to play.'' &QL;

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman, accidental tourist and quasi-amateur pitcher,
had a great time in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He visited the famed Louvre museum in Paris and checked out the
Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. He sailed down the Grand
Canal in Venice and stood in admiration of the grandeur of the
Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had taken my skis with me,'' Zimmerman said. ``But I
had no money anyway. I was trying to see Europe as cheaply as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He was getting paid $1,000 Canadian a month, plus an apartment
to pitch for the Montpellier Barracudas in France's National
Baseball League. The money was under the table because he had hopes
of pitching for the Canadian National team in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The major leagues were the furthest thing from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 10,000 miles away,'' Zimmerman said. ``The closest
thing we had to major-league baseball is we would get a tape of
week-old Atlanta Braves games in the mail. We'd all go to a pub,
put the tape in the VCR and watch the game, even though we already
knew the final score. It was a huge social event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys just wanted to see Tom Glavine and John Smoltz pitch on
the big screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz and Glavine are All-Star pitchers. Sitting in a French
pub and playing in a country where many people don't know baseball
exists, Zimmerman had no hope of ever pitching in an All-Star Game
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now, that might become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's tortuous climb to the major leagues could be
rewarded on Wednesday if New York Yankees manager Joe Torre selects
him to the American League All-Star team for the July 13 game in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said Greg Hamilton, Zimmerman's coach in
France and with the Canadian National team. ``It couldn't have
happened to a better individual. His approach and dedication to the
game are second to none. With Jeff, one of the big keys was just
staying with it and refusing to give up on a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   His All-Star credentials are impeccable. He was 7-0 with an 0.94
earned-run average before last night's game, and opponents were
hitting barely over .100 against him. But Zimmerman insists on
downplaying the anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great, but I don't even want to think about it,''
Zimmerman said. ``That's still a couple of weeks away. We still
have some big games in our division before that. If it happens,
great. But I don't want to even get caught up in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look to the present. I worry about what I have to do today.
That's what got me here so far.'' Like a movie script Zimmerman,
who grew up in the small town of Carseland, Alberta, learned to
play baseball in the western wilderness of a country known more for
hockey and lacrosse. He went to two junior colleges and TCU, a
school not known for turning out major-leaguers. He pitched in
France, two years with the Canadian National team and one year in
the independent Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first job in America on the strength of a fax.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left is to decide whether Matt Damon or Woody
Harrelson will play him in the movie. Kevin Costner would be
perfect, except he's too old. Maybe in the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman refuses to see himself as an inspiration to
underdogs everywhere who harbor a dream of overcoming
insurmountable odds to reach the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The story of what got him here, however, is much better than
that, especially when considering that his father, Bill, has spent
the past year fighting cancer, including spending 4 1/2 months in a
coma. During that time, on several occasions, the doctors urged the
family to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my inspiration,'' Zimmerman said. ``He's helped me
appreciate where I am right now. Before, if I had a bad outing, I'd
be down for a couple of days. I'd overanalyze everything, stew over
it. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because I was so
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, my dad is fighting for his life against a disease that is
devastating his body and I'm thinking, `You're agonizing over a
home run. Let's put things in perspective and not take the game too
seriously.' It's not life or death. What my dad is going through
is. If he's mentally strong, I have to be, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Zimmerman more than inspired his sons. He and the boys'
mother, Sharon, devoted maximum time, energy and money to ensuring
Jeff and his younger brother Jordan, now a relief pitcher for the
Seattle Mariners, would fulfill their dreams of playing
major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where they found the money or the energy to do
everything they did,'' Zimmerman said.

   Carseland is a town of about 300 people, 30 miles outside
Calgary. Bill and Sharon Zimmerman, before they were divorced in
1994, owned two small hotels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Zimmerman said running them is a 24-hour-a-day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff and Jordan were crazy about sports, so their parents
did everything they could to make sure they had a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a population of 300, we never had more than nine kids on
a team,'' Sharon said. ``Most of the time we were running around
trying to find that ninth kid. The boys were also three years
apart, so they were never on the same team. Bill was always running
one way and I was running the other. Then on weekends, there would
be a tournament, so we'd all pack up and go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff was always dedicated. He didn't have to be told what to
do. Every day he would do his exercises, or run a mile. You'd see
him walking from the kitchen to the living room, going through his
pitching motion.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeff was 16, the family moved to Calgary so he could play
against a higher level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it snows in Canada six months out of the year,'' Jeff
Zimmerman said. ``So, my dad rented an old indoor airplane hangar
from World War II and renovated it into a baseball facility with a
batting cage and AstroTurf. They lost a lot of money doing it, but
it allowed my brother and I to play baseball all we wanted to in
Calgary.'' Mobile family After high school, Jeff Zimmerman went to
college in the United States. He attended two junior colleges _
Treasure Valley in Oregon and Indian Hills in Iowa _ before getting
a partial scholarship at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   The family took a bigger step with Jordan. When he was 14, a
Kansas City Royals scout strongly suggested he needed to play in
the United States. The Zimmermans made the ultimate sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called around and heard about Brenham, that their high
school had a good program,'' Sharon said. ``So, we called the high
school coach there, Earl Hathaway, and he said, `You're going to do
what?' But Bill and Jordan took an apartment in Brenham.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan eventually went to Blinn College, a two-year college in
Brenham, and was drafted by the Mariners. Jeff's nomadic existence
was only getting started. He wasn't drafted out of TCU even though
scouts told him he had potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be drafted in the top 10 rounds,''
Zimmerman said. ``But I figured with 80 or 100 rounds in the draft,
somebody would take a chance on me. I was disenchanted with
professional baseball, so I started to look into playing in the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who coached him on the Canadian Junior team, took
Zimmerman with him to France. Few people realize the French play
baseball, but it proved the right spot for Zimmerman. With
Montpellier, he developed the slider that is now devastating
American League hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I dominated, but I didn't have to worry
about losing a ballgame,'' Zimmerman said. ``So, I was able to
experiment with the slider. I could throw it in different counts,
different situations. You can't do that in college ball in the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two years were spent with the Canadian National team
while earning his master's degree at Simon Fraser University in
Vancouver, British Columbia. The goal was to play in the Olympics
in Atlanta. Instead, the Canadians lost to Nicaragua in the finals
of the qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, Nicaragua,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball should have ended there. But Zimmerman, growing
stronger and gaining more confidence in his slider, had one last
card to play. He wanted to try out with the Winnipeg Goldeyes (it's
a fish) of the Northern League, with the idea of catching
somebody's eye in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He asked his parents and fiance Andrea Whiffen if they would
continue to support him, morally and _ more important _
financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said `Yes, go,' '' Sharon said. ``Pack up your bags and go.
There was no hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tryout was a spectacle, which is normal for an independent
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was there,'' Zimmerman said. ``Guys from every
softball league and beer league. I was even pitching against
motorcycle gang members.''
</P>
<P>
   They were also using wood bats, a first for Zimmerman. It made a
big difference over the aluminum bats of amateur competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first four guys didn't hit the ball out of the cage,''
Zimmerman said. ``I was able to pitch inside and didn't have to
worry about being taken out of the ballpark. Throwing to wooden
bats was a lot easier. That gave me a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The confidence Zimmerman has to blow away American
League hitters came from throwing to Canada's version of the Hell's
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   He was 9-2 with a league-leading 2.82 ERA with Winnipeg and
making $700 a month, a pay cut from his lucrative venture in
France. He then sent a fax to 30 major-league teams, asking for
job.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were the only one to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching that game,'' Sharon said. ``I kept thinking:
`Amazing, how did he ever get there?' I knew he had potential, but
I was just hoping he would make it to Double A or Triple A.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done more than that. He might be an American League
All-Star.

STARS READY TO PROMOTE YOUNG MINOR-LEAGUERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Next season, the Stars will be a team with some
new faces _ and possibly some young faces _ general manager Bob
Gainey said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players who we have put into position to be NHL
players, and it's time for some of them to step up and be given
that chance,'' Gainey said. ``We expect to go into training camp
with the intent of allowing some players the ability to prove
themselves at the NHL level.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision makes perfect sense for the Stars, who will be able
to get more speed, younger legs and cheaper legs into the lineup.
But making the transition could prove tricky. How many young
players can step up at one time? Will the Stars lose the very
experience that helped them win the Stanley Cup if they clear out
unrestricted free agents Dave Reid, Pat Verbeek and Craig Ludwig?
And if owner Tom Hicks indeed has money to spend, should the Stars
at least be making inquiries about free agents such as Valeri
Kamensky?
</P>
<P>
   Gainey looked at all the questions last week after free-agent
shopping opened July 1 and decided the best thing to do was wait.
He set free all of the players who had contract options except for
defenseman Sergei Zubov. Zubov has been signed for one more year
and then could become a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But players such as Reid, Verbeek, Ludwig, Tony Hrkac, Brent
Severyn, Benoit Hogue and Guy Carbonneau all are free to go to any
team that gives them an offer sheet. The Stars are gambling that
the free-agent market won't be lucrative this season and that
they'll be able to pick up players like Carbonneau, Ludwig, Hogue
and Hrkac at reduced prices. But Gainey said the Stars also need
time to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came off a very emotional ride and I think it takes
time for things to settle down,'' Gainey said. ``I don't know what
our contract offers will be to certain players, but it's best for
them and for us if we allow ourselves the ability to step back
before we make important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey and his right-hand contract man, Doug Armstrong, the
Stars assistant GM, will be in contact with player agents
throughout July. And once a few of the other unrestricted free
agents around the league start signing, the Stars will have a
better idea of what the going rate is for a player like Carbonneau
or Hogue. They might even look at signing Verbeek, if his asking
price drops greatly from the $3.2 million he earned last season.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Gainey said he feels confident that the young
players the Stars have been grooming to step up are ready to do
just that. Dead solid locks for next year's roster are Juha Lind,
25, and Blake Sloan, 23. The two wingers are expected to be
bookends on a fourth line that should have speed, toughness and
some ability to score. Also expected to be on the roster is
defenseman Brad Lukowich, 22 _ a Richard Matvichuk clone who could
be ready to step over Shawn Chambers and into the fifth defenseman
spot.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those three players, the Stars are expected to
let youngsters Manny Fernandez, 24, and Marty Turco, 23, battle for
the backup goaltender position. The Stars, who traded Roman Turek
to the St. Louis Blues, could go after a veteran free agent like
Ken Wregget as a backup, but Gainey said that would defeat the
purpose of drafting and working young talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players have been in the system and have worked to get
this opportunity,'' Gainey said. ``Now, it's time to give it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Turco (24-17-10, 2.61 goals against average) was rookie of the
year in the International Hockey League with the Michigan K-Wings,
while Fernandez led the Houston Aeros to the IHL championship.
</P>
<P>
   Other young players expected to get the chance to make the
Stars' 24-man roster are: winger Jon Sim, 21; winger Jason
Botterill, 23; winger Jamie Wright, 23; defenseman Alan Latang, 23;
and recently acquired winger Warren Luhning, 24.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Stars have restricted free agents like Derek
Plante and Aaron Gavey who can play either at the NHL level or with
the K-Wings, the Stars' IHL affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   If the young players perform well, that would free up money for
the Stars to either grant raises to Mike Modano, Brett Hull and
Derian Hatcher or to try to negotiate long-term deals with Joe
Nieuwendyk, Ed Belfour and Zubov _ each of whom is heading into the
final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Stars say they are prepared to shake up their
winning chemistry if need be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the greatest mistake anyone could make, even if we
bring the entire team intact, is assuming the chemistry will be the
same,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Every team develops its
own chemistry and it takes time throughout the season to do that.
Next year, some of the players we had on this team will at
different stages in their contracts, different stages in their
lives, and that will affect our chemistry. We have to be prepared
to start over every single year no matter who's in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have some time to put together the roster, but not too
much time. Training camp starts Sept. 4 in Vail, Colo. _ exactly
two months away.

BIAS BY STATE POLICE PROTESTED IN ATLANTIC CITY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Forty to fifty demonstrators were arrested
Saturday when the Rev. Al Sharpton took his civil disobedience
campaign to Atlantic City to protest racial profiling by the New
Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, in which protesters blocked one of the main
thoroughfares to the boardwalk and casino resort area, came the day
after Gov. Christie Whitman released a report acknowledging that
the state police tolerated a culture of racial discrimination and
sexual harassment. An earlier report acknowledged that state
troopers systematically discriminated against black and Hispanic
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before the demonstration, Sharpton called
the latest report ``too little, too late.'' He said the state
needed to identify police officials who had engaged in racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's face-off between the police and protesters seemed
rehearsed by both sides. At 4 p.m., about 100 people moved into the
intersection of Arkansas Road and Baltic Avenue, where the Atlantic
City Expressway descends into Atlantic City, and sat down.
</P>
<P>
   Facing them were a row of Atlantic City police officers, who
ordered those who had volunteered to be arrested to stay where they
were and to raise their hands. Those who did not want to be
arrested were asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   No state troopers were involved because the demonstration took
place within city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to this city on this weekend to make a statement
that people are coming here to seek fun and sun and not facing the
realities of this society,'' Sharpton told reporters. He said the
point of the demonstration had been to divert traffic and send the
demonstrators' message to senior New Jersey officials, particularly
Governor Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Michael A. Hardy, said the site had been selected
because it is ``one of New Jersey's leading financial centers.''
</P>
<P>
   The police tried to insure that the protest would create a
minimum of disruption. Even before the demonstrators entered the
intersection, more than an hour behind schedule, the police had
cordoned off the avenue on both sides, diverting traffic to two
other main streets connecting Atlantic City to the Garden State
Parkway. Police continued to divert traffic during the protest,
which blocked Arkansas Road for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested _ the men in plastic handcuffs, the women
uncuffed _ were taken to the Atlantic City Convention Center, where
they were issued bench warrants and released. &QL;

EVEN WITH BROKEN LEFT ARM, DUNN RIDES BULL TO AUSSIE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACKAY, Australia _ Mounting two snorting bulls despite a broken
left forearm, Troy Dunn finished first in Ride the Rage, a bull
riding show staged last night in the world champion's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When the title was at stake before an overflow crowd of more
than 10,000 at a dog racing track, Dunn posted a final-ride score
of 86 and earned $7,601 in Australian money (approximately $5,100
U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time for Dunn to compete in Mackay, a
northeastern Australian coastal city near the Great Barrier Reef.
Dunn is the 1998 Professional Bull Riders Bud Light Cup Series
champion, and he lives in Stephenville when he competes in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, there was a lot of pressure to ride here at
home,'' said Dunn, who suffered a broken left arm during a North
American bull riding accident last month. ``But on the other hand,
I was pumped up by the big crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn punched up scores of 89 and 86 en route to winning the
title with a two-ride score of 175. After the last bull had bucked,
Dunn edged Australian Kelly Daley by a point.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's three-hour show in Mackay capped a series of three
Professional Bull Riders-sanctioned shows in Australia over the
past two weekends. The other two were in Townsville.
</P>
<P>
   Prize money will count toward qualifying for the PBR's Oct.
28-31 finals in Las Vegas. Unlike the PBR's cup series in North
America that features an invitational roster of 45 riders, the
three Australian events were classified as PBR Touring Pro Division
shows. That means that every PBR member was eligible to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The series, dubbed as the Troy Dunn International Challenge,
also was sanctioned by Championship Bull Riders, an Australian bull
riding organization.
</P>
<P>
   The three shows drew North American competitors who regularly
excel on the PBR's cup series. Terry Don West, who finished third
last year on the tour, won the June 24 opening show in Townsville.
J.W. Hart, a five-time PBR finals qualifier who lives near
Gainesville, finished third in the June 25 show in Townsville.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn stole last night's show in Mackay by pacing the field. In
the final, a bull named Sudden Impact had Dunn out of position
several times. But the stubborn Aussie hung on for eight agonizing
seconds to hear one of the sweetest horns of his life.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 26 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such

changes in book buying.

   &UR; THE OTHER SIDE OF SILENCE. MEN'S LIVES AND GAY IDENTITIES: A
TWENTIETH-CENTURY HISTORY &LR;  By John Loughery. John Macrae/Owl/Holt,
$15.95. This provocative chronicle of gay male life in the United
States from 1919 to the early 1990s combines extensive archival
research with interviews and a broad knowledge of 20th-century
letters. ``Loughery writes uncluttered, calm, controlled,
exceptionally intelligent prose,'' Warren Goldstein wrote in The
New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIES OF THE PLAIN: VOLUME 3, THE BORDER TRILOGY &LR;  By Cormac
McCarthy. Vintage International, $13. The concluding volume of the
author's sweeping cowboy saga brings together the two leathery
heroes from the earlier novels on a New Mexico ranch in the 1950s,
when the mythic West, and an entire way of life, are fading away.
Much of the plot involves romance: between one of the heroes and a
beautiful whore, and between ranchmen and their horses. McCarthy
``once again provides a terrific read,'' Sara Mosle wrote in 1998.
``He is perhaps the greatest writer since Melville on the subject
of work. ... What would be mind-numbing description in less
competent hands is here completely riveting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE THE SKY: A MEDITATION ON FLIGHT &LR;  By William
Langewiesche. Vintage Departures, $12. These thoughtful essays by a
commercial pilot explore both the risks and the joys of flying, in
the process offering the reader a fresh way of perceiving the
world. ``Langewiesche brings knowledge and passion as well as
careful eloquence to his subject,'' James R. Gaines wrote in the
Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST TO THE DAWN: THE LIFE OF AMELIA EARHART &LR; , by Susan Butler
(Da Capo, $17.95), is a well-researched biography of the former
social worker (and truck driver) who in 1928 became the first woman
to fly across the Atlantic. In 1997 the reviewer Emily Wortis
Leider found the book to be overly adoring, but said that ``Butler
shows a mastery of aviation history, and considerable
sophistication about the technology of flight and navigation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIS TIME: NEW AND SELECTED POEMS &LR;  By Gerald Stern. Norton,
$14. This collection of verse, some of it reprinted from earlier
volumes, won a National Book Award in 1998. One critic called
Stern's book ``remarkable for its generosity of spirit, manifested
in a warm surrealism that is often turned with humor toward his own
past as a way of understanding the recurrent questions of growing
old.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ICY SPARKS &LR;  By Gwen Hyman Rubio. Penguin, $12.95. In this
poignant first novel, a hyperarticulate 10-year-old girl who is
both an orphan and a victim of Tourette's syndrome struggles to
come of age in rural Kentucky in the '50s. ``Rubio is a writer of
uncommonly warm and tender vision, often comic, brimming with love
and hope,'' Tara Bayton wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPLAINING HITLER: THE SEARCH FOR THE ORIGINS OF HIS EVIL &LR;  By
Ron Rosenbaum. Harper Perennial, $16. Does Hitler represent a
uniquely evil force or a grotesque perversion of basic human
nature? The author, an essayist and journalist, combs through the
many outposts of Hitler theory _ and the motives of the theorists
themselves _ to shed light on that enduring question. ``He has a
sympathetic ear, a knack for classification and a sharp, critical
mind,'' Michael R. Marrus wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BETWEEN DIGNITY AND DESPAIR: JEWISH LIFE IN NAZI GERMANY &LR; , by
Marion A. Kaplan (Oxford University, $14.95), relies on memoirs,
letters and interviews to create an intimate account of the social
isolation and unending acts of humiliation that plagued German
Jewry. Last year the reviewer Deborah E. Lipstadt called this ``a
devastatingly powerful book'' that reveals how ``genocidal violence
can have its genesis in the smallest expressions of prejudice and
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOST IN TRANSLATION &LR;  By Nicole Mones. Delta, $12.95. The
daughter of a racist American politician becomes intoxicated by
China (and Chinese men) and joins an expedition in search of the
bones of Peking Man. Last year the reviewer Lisa See called this a
``thought-provoking, sometimes disturbing and undeniably
entertaining'' first novel about race, taboo and cultural
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WOMAN OF ROME &LR;  By Alberto Moravia. Steerforth Italia, $16.
Adriana, the sympathetically drawn heroine of this Italian novel,
is a beautiful woman making her way in Mussolini-era Rome for whom
prostitution is not a desperate act but her natural vocation. In
1949 the reviewer William Fense Weaver found Adriana to be
``fascinating and original, as are all the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPLIT: A COUNTERCULTURE CHILDHOOD &LR;  By Lisa Michaels.
Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13. A young poet and essayist recalls
growing up as the daughter of a Weatherman imprisoned in 1969 and a
gentle hippie mother with whom she migrated to California. The
result is ``an intelligent and vivid memoir of what it was like to
be literally a child of the '60s,'' Adam Goodheart wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISSING WOMEN AND OTHERS: STORIES &LR;  By June Spence. Riverhead,
$12. Many of the characters in this first collection are women
mired in perpetual states of transition: recent divorce, recovery
from alcoholism, boring jobs or waiting out a lover's prison term.
``Spence has a canny eye and a pointed sense of humor,'' Laura
Miller wrote in 1998.

A BLAST FROM THE PAST FOR U.S., BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO _ It's Sissy instead of Romario, Mia instead of Cobi.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's Brazil and the United States today, just as it
was five years ago when a heavily favored Brazilian men's team
eliminated the Americans 1-0 in the second round of the 1994 World
Cup. At Stanford Stadium. On the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for the sequel, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   With a championship berth at stake next Saturday in the Rose
Bowl, the heavily favored American women hope to finish what the
men couldn't against a feisty and dangerous Brazilian side in the
Women's World Cup semifinals. The winner faces either Norway or
China, who meet today in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to play better against Brazil than we did against
Germany,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``We'll have to be very
good to get into the final. Brazil is not an easy team. It will be
a hard game, with hard tackles, but it will be a game of skill and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilians are very resilient as they showed against
Nigeria. We are stepping up to a higher level now.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the date didn't escape Brazilian coach
Wilson de Oliveira.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is a different story, sometimes the same story
repeats,'' de Oliveira said. ``We hope this story repeats. We have
a dream. If we can emulate what happened in this stadium five years
ago, our dream will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, DiCicco all but guaranteed that wouldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of game that promotes soccer and women's
soccer,'' said DiCicco. ``Having the Brazilian fans and the Samba
only enhances the event and passion. But having said that, do I
think it's going to be the same result as '94? No I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The theatrics couldn't get much better than they were Thursday
in Washington D.C., where the U.S. rallied on two occasions from a
goal down to pull out a 3-2 quarterfinal victory over Germany, with
President Bill Clinton and his family looking on.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Brazil recorded a thrilling victory of its
own. It blew a 3-0 halftime lead, then rallied to earn a 4-3
victory in overtime thanks to a perfectly placed Golden Goal from
Sissi off a free kick.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, DiCicco learned a few things about his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Brazil unraveled a bit under pressure,'' said
DiCicco. ``We felt they lost some focus and had trouble stringing
passes together. Brazil felt the game was in hand and what we saw
was a team we hadn't seen earlier in the World Cup. They were
starting to show their nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   For the American women, it was the first time they had to face
true adversity in the tournament. Down 2-1 in the second half, not
only were their tournament hopes on the line, but a couple more
German goals could have kept them out of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A few encouraging words from DiCicco and veteran Carla Overbeck
at halftime helped calm them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla said that everything we've done in this lifetime comes
down to these 45 minutes,'' said midfielder Julie Foudy. ``We had
45 minutes to make a difference. That's it and we had to leave
everything on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said Shannon MacMillan, who has a goal and three assists
in the last two matches, could start in place of forward Cindy
Parlow as he looks for a quicker team this time. He also has the
option of playing four midfielders and having MacMillan and
Kristine Lilly patrol the flanks.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said he also may insert defensive midfielder Tiffany
Roberts during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her nickname is `The Little Animal,' '' he said. ``She's like
a puppy chasing you that you can't get rid of. She's one of our
hardest players in terms of committing to win a ball _ and she's
probably one of the smallest.''
