<HEADLINE> EU, NATO to Meet Next Week on European Defense Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
NATO will hold their first formal meeting next Tuesday to discuss
how to enhance European defense capability, a senior NATO official
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the meeting between NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana and the EU rotating president, Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schussel, will focus on measures designed to
enhance European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO.
</P>
<P>
The ESDI concept would supposedly provide NATO assets to
European member states to form a European defense organization to
deal with security issues without the participation of the United
States or other non-European member states.
</P>
<P>
NATO has already formed and developed a multinational Combined
Joint Task Force that is reported to be one of the available NATO
assets for ESDI operations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO European members brought up the ESDI issue again after
the Kosovo crisis flared up. The EU foreign and defense ministers
met in September and October to discuss the issue but did not
accomplish much.
</P>
<P>
As a run-up to next Tuesday's EU-NATO meeting, an agreement was
struck between Britain and France that the European Union must
have the capacity to respond to global crises while respecting
their obligations to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a summit between the two
countries at Saint-Malo. A joint statement following the summit
said the EU should be capable of autonomous action "backed up by
credible military force."
</P>
<P>
France is a country that has long championed the concept of
ESDI, while Britain is one that has so far opted more for NATO
solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Little Progress as NBA Players, Owners Meet for 10 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- NBA Commissioner David
Stern publicly acknowledged the possibility of canceling the
entire season after NBA owners and the Players Association met
for more than 10 hours Thursday but reported little progress.
</P>
<P>
With the lockout in its 157th day, owners rejected a union
offer to send the talks to mediation and Stern sounded ominous
when referring to a NBPA call to set an "ratificial deadline" for
saving the season.
</P>
<P>
"That's something I find sufficiently abhorrent," Stern said
late Thursday night. "Our view is that the season will expire of
its own weight, whenever that time is. There's nothing that I'm
planning to do to push that ahead to an artificial limitation.
</P>
<P>
"But I now recognize the possibility, if not the likelihood,
that the season will expire and that the $1.1 billion in
guaranteed salary that would have been available and the
attendant revenues for the owners is now severely at risk."
</P>
<P>
No new talks are scheduled but time continues to run out. A
total of 225 games already have been lost to the lockout through
Friday and with a month needed to sign players and hold training
camps, an additional 200 will be canceled before even an
abbreviated season can begin.
</P>
<P>
No new proposals were submitted during the lengthy bargaining
session Thursday and NBPA executive director Billy Hunter
suggested the talks may have taken a step backwards when owners
shifted their support back to a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we spend 15 hours or 20 hours in a room, we'
re not going to get worn down, we're not going to enter into any
bad deal because of attrition," Hunter said at a news conference
well after midnight. We've come too far, we've been locked out
too many days, our players have suffered as a group too much for
us to give it all up now, at the 12th hour."
</P>
<P>
Thursday's session began on an optimistic note with the
return of superstar Michael Jordan, who had not attended the
talks since October 28. He left early Thursday night but returned
several hours later.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the owners and players met face-to-face
for the first time since November 20. But there was no hint of
optimism, not even after more than 10 hours of discussions.

<HEADLINE> World Court Declines Jurisdiction Over Fisheries Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice Friday decided it does not have jurisdiction over Spain's
petition against Canada concerning the seizing of a Spanish
fishing vessel, according to Canada's Justice department.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, 1995, the Spanish fishing vessel "Estai" was seized
and its owner arrested by Canadian officials in the Northwest
Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Regulatory Area for
violations of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
Spain then filed a petition against Canada at the International
Court of Justice, claiming the Court had jurisdiction over the
case since Canada had agreed on a general acceptance of the
Court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The Court however held that it could not hear the petition
because the dispute falls within the terms of Canada's reservation
to its general acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Every country has the right to make a "reservation" about which
matters the Court will not have jurisdiction to hear, the Court
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian Justice Minister Anne Mclellan welcomed the
Court's decision, saying it affirms the importance of the consent
of states to the jurisdiction of the International Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
"The International Court of Justice is one excellent tool to
resolve disputes between States, but we prefer it when we can
negotiate a good settlement, as we have already done on the
Northwest Atlantic fishery with the European Union," said Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes TAC, Quotas For 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
adopted the 1999 proposal on total allowable catches (TACs) for a
group of fish stocks and their allocation under national quotas.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body, the European Commission, said here
Friday that these proposals are based on the most recent
scientific advice.
</P>
<P>
The advice came from the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea which is composed of the EU member states
as well as all the North Atlantic coastal states, including the
United States, Canada, Norway and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The advice stressed the need for taking urgent measures to
protect fish stocks, which are facing an immediate biological
threat.
</P>
<P>
The European commission pointed out that the current state of
fish stocks shows a situation where concerns remain for a number
of stocks that are essential to European fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The EU had to avoid making drastic TAC cuts on the sector
unless they were absolutely necessary, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU said, scientific recommendations leading to
substantial cuts have only been adopted where there was a risk of
stock collapse.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals for cuts had to consider the fact that actual
catches have systematically been lower than the TACs, and that TAC
cuts will not result in new constraints, referring to the case for
North Sea whitings and Southern langoustine, according to the
commission.

<HEADLINE> Russia's GDP to Continue to Drop Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's economy might contract
by 5 percent to 7 percent next year if the country does not get
more aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Russia's
Ministry of Economy said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted First Deputy Minister of
Economics Arkady Samokhvalov as saying that the forecast was made
by taking into account the "less favorable" factors: negative
results of talks to restructure the country's foreign debts,
delays in receiving foreign loans, and a continuing drop in world
market commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Under this scenario, issuing new money could be up to 130
billion rubles (about seven billion U.S. dollars) and the annual
inflation rate could be as high as 50-60 percent. The ruble is
also expected to devaluate sharply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of the jobless could rise to 9.3 million,
or 12.7 percent of the workforce, and the subsistence level could
go up by 20-40 percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under a more optimistic scenario, all matters relating to
foreign loans and debt restructuring may be settled quickly, and
the government's anti-crisis measures could produce more positive
results.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Russia's GDP could drop no more than 3 percent,
and the inflation rate would be around 30 percent next year, with
the unemployment number remaining at about 2.4 million, or 3.3
percent of the workforce in 1999, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ancient Settlement Listed as World Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot neolithic settlement of
Choirokitia has been inducted into the world cultural heritage
list by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The world heritage committee made the decision this week at its
annual meeting in Kyoto, Japan, Deputy Director of Cyprus'
Antiquities Department Pavlos Flourentzos said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another 29 sites from various states were also incorporated in
the list at the meeting. Currently, a total of 582 archaeological
sites from 114 countries were listed as the world cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Flourentzos described the Choirokitia neolithic settlement as
"one of the most important ancient sites in Eastern
Mediterranean," which dates back to about 5,800 BC.
</P>
<P>
Choirokitia was founded by a community or primitive farmers,
whose origin is uncertain. These people made a livehood by raising
livestock, hunting wild animals and trading with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the excavations, which were started by the Cyprus'
Antiquities Department in 1936, many primitive agricultural
implements, domestic utensils, arrow heads, stone axes and chisels
used in carpentry were found.
</P>
<P>
The people lived in "bee-hive" or "Igloo" shaped buildings,
with stone foundations, mostly river pebbles, and superstructures
of mud or sun-backed mud bricks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Slips to Six-month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
dropped to 4.4 percent in November as strong holiday hiring at
retail stores and a booming construction sector offset continued
layoffs in manufacturing, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.6 percent in October
and September, was the lowest since April and May, when
joblessness fell to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Employers added 267,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
largest gain in three months. Both the unemployment rate and the
number of jobs added were significantly better than anticipated by
economists.
</P>
<P>
In November, manufacturing employment declined by 47,000 jobs,
bringing job losses there to 245,000 since March. The drops were
sharpest at factories producing industrial machinery, apparel and
textiles, electronic equipment, primary metals such as steel,
transportation equipment and fabricated metals.
</P>
<P>
However, construction companies added 47,000 workers in
November. Besides, employment in finance, insurance and real
estate rose by 23,000, partly reflecting hiring by mortgage
brokers.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of strength include temporary-help firms, computer
and data-processing services, engineering and management services
and retail trade, which rose 65,000 on a seasonally adjusted
basis.
</P>
<P>
The average workweek last month was unchanged at 34.6 hours.
Within manufacturing, however, it fell a tenth of an hour to 41.6
hours. Factory overtime was unchanged at 4.5 hours.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers rose 3 cents
for the second month in a row. At 12.93 dollars, the average is up
3.7 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said orders
to U.S. factories plunged 1.6 percent in October. The drop was
broad-based and was the first since May.
</P>
<P>
The slump in Asia has dried up demand for U.S. exports. This
week, Boeing Co., the world's largest aerospace company, said it
planned 20,000 more layoffs, on top of 28,000 already announced.
And Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the world's fifth largest drug maker, said
it plans to wipe out 4,100 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and the United
States of America Friday pledged to give a total of 2.25 million
U.S. Dollars to help remove obsolete pesticides accumulated in
different parts of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At a donor meeting convened here to seek solutions to the
problem of obsolete pesticides, the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) pledged 1.25 million U.S. Dollars while
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
agreed to donate one million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is asking donors to grant it a sum of 4.5 million
Dollars needed to incinerate the obsolete pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,152 tons of obsolete pesticides have accumulated at
some 256 minor and major sites, and over 100 tons of contaminated
equipment were identified in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the representative of the Netherlands also
expressed his government's readiness to support the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The World Crop Protection Federation said it will donate one
Dollar for one kilogram of unwanted pesticide produced by member
states of the federation.
</P>
<P>
It was said that about 250,000 kilograms of obsolete
pesticides have so far been identified as produced by member
countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Reporters Urged to Be Patriotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister Friday
urged local journalists to be more patriotic.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende made the remarks at Zimpapers Company long service
awards ceremony here in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "the media of any country have the
obligation to report and criticize, not in the interests of
foreign values and agendas, but in the interest of enhancing
national development, national unity and national identity."
</P>
<P>
He said it was a disgrace to the profession and the nation
that Zimbabwean journalists who wrote for foreign publications
churned out reports that damaged the country's image.
</P>
<P>
"A sense of national belonging and national interest should be
the overriding characteristic in all our reports," Chimutengwende
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has suffered bad publicity especially abroad where
the deteriorating economic environment, the land redistribution
program, anti-gay laws and a restless labor movement have made
headlines, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Of the 85 workers who received long service awards for working
for the company for 15 to 40 years, three were women.
</P>
<P>
The minister commended the company for its good management
which has seen it survive in economic hardships.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Honor Missile Contract With Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Mouradov said Friday that his government would honor the
missile contract it has signed with the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by the U.S. ambassador Kenneth Brill,
that the missiles should not come to Cyprus, Mouradov said "Russia
and Cyprus are two sovereign states that discuss matters of mutual
interest. We consider the contract as a bilateral contract and we
will fulfill the terms of our contract".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus for
the deal, and Turkey has threatened to launch preemptive military
strikes if the missiles are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is a timetable for the implementation of the
contract, Mouradov said "when, where and how the contract will be
put into effect is a matter that concerns the defense of the
Republic of Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
"We are not violating international law through our contract
and through the cooperation we have in the military and
technological fields," Mouradov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and Cyprus would be pleased to hear any American
initiative on demilitarization or the reduction of arms in Cyprus.
But he noted that "as far as the contract is concerned Russia and
Cyprus will deal with that".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup.

<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's presidential powers
regulations effecting the ban on stay-aways and spelling
penalties for both employees and employers were made known here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government gazette said that any collective action for the
purpose of resisting a lawful measure or compelling the
government to alter any law is now outlawed, the Zimbabwe News
Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Unlawful collective action covers strikes, boycott, lock-out,
sit-in, sit-out, stay-away or any concerted action by employers
or employees.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, Minister of Public Service, Labor and
Social Welfare Florence Chitauro can suspend the registration of
any organization if there are grounds that it has incited people
to engage in stay-aways.
</P>
<P>
Employers would be barred from paying subscription to an
organization which would have been deregistered.
</P>
<P>
People who encourage to engage stay-aways are liable to a
maximum fine of 100,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (about 2,800 U.S.
Dollars) or three years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The government action comes at a time when actions by the
labor movement, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, are blamed
for inflicting huge damages on the economy.

<HEADLINE> Angola May Resort to Force Against UNITA: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A Government representative in
the Joint Commission for Angolan Peace Process said here Friday
that his government may have to resort to force in a bid to take
over the areas from the hands of the opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, deputy head of the government delegation to
the joint commission, noted that the government may take an
approach other than a peaceful one to retake these areas seized
back by the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"It may be compulsory or through violent means," Carneiro
said. "That's to say to wipe out the armed forces led by (Jonas)
Savimbi" of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government official admitted that to re-establish
local governments in the areas controlled by the UNITA is far
from easy.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the areas the Angolan government took over
from the UNITA has been reoccupied by the rebel troops, said
Carneiro.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his satisfaction with the United Nations
decision to extend the term of the U.N. observers mission in this
southern African country for three more months.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro believed that three months are "enough" to complete
the Angolan peace process together with the breakaway UNITA
Renovation Commission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Thursday adopted resolutions
demanding the UNITA should immediately disband its troops
unconditionally and withdraw from the areas they reoccupied as
stipulated by the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol which ended the
19-year civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process fell into a stalemate as the UNITA
refused to demilitarize all its armed forces and surrender all
the areas it controlled to the hands of the Angolan government in
accordance with the Lusaka peace deal.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Refuses to Attend Talks Proposed by WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States has refused
to attend proposed talks with the European Union on their dispute
over bananas, said trade sources here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. turned down the proposal by Renato Ruggiero,
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), for U.S.
and EU officials to meet in Geneva on Friday with members of a
panel and an appeals board that ruled that the EU's current banana
import policies had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
Also to have been invited were experts from the WTO's legal
division and trade envoys from countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean with interest in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The WTO chief's proposal came at a time when the EU and the
U.S. are at the edge of a trade war over the EU's rules on banana
imports scheduled to be implemented on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that the EU revised rules on banana imports still do
not meet WTO criteria, the U.S., backed by five Latin American
banana exporting countries, brought the case to the WTO. If
consultations between the two sides do not lead to a solution, a
panel will be set up to rule the case.
</P>
<P>
There is now no official agenda when the banana case should be
ruled but the U.S. has set a deadline for a panel ruling on
January 15, 1999 and threatened to imposed sanctions worth 1.6
billion U.S. dollars a year on EU goods in February next year
under its trade law "Section 301".
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that the U.S. domestic trade law "Section 301"
itself would be a violation of WTO rules, saying that no one
except the WTO's dispute settlement body can authorize sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin not to Pass Any Power to Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
would not pass any presidential functions to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, presidential spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin told a
briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said "The president has a great confidence in the
Prime Minister, but any passing of main presidential functions to
the premier is out of the question."
</P>
<P>
The president "is still the guarantor of the constitution and
that does not run counter to the fact that the practical economic
tasks are sovled by the premier and he sometimes substitutes the
president on the international scene," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the president's health Yakushkin said Yeltsin is "in not bad
a form". "The president, to all appearances, is ready to start
work in the Kremlin even tomorrow, but physicians do not advise,
say he should be curred completely."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told reporters that Yeltsin had a meeting
with Primakov in the Central Clinic Hospital on Friday to discuss
the cabinet fulfillment of the anti-crisis program.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the two leaders discussed the tax collection to
the federal budget in November, the tax policy and its prospects.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was taken to the hospital with pneumonia on November
22.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Reach Deal on Farm Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Canada reached
agreement Friday to ease tensions over farm trade through
stepped-up monitoring of Canada's wheat sales and lower barriers
on American grain and livestock moving northward.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. will triple the information it
collects on imported Canadian wheat to determine whether the grain
is being sold below cost.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers have long claimed that the grain is being dumped
in American markets. Canada denies the charge but has refused to
disclose how the wheat is priced or to limit the amount that is
shipped.
</P>
<P>
Canada also will provide quarterly forecasts of its wheat
shipments, end a quarantine requirement on U.S. hogs and allow
some American grain to be shipped on its railroads to Pacific
ports or sold directly to Canadian elevators.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the two countries will speed the standardization
of regulations for pesticides and animal drugs, and Canada also is
relaxing barriers on imports of U.S. cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement stops short of meeting the demand by
some farmers and ranchers that Canada limit what it ships to U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the
agreement "will help solve many of the problems faced by grain
growers, the cattle industry, and pork producers."
</P>
<P>
The talks started this fall after several governors in Northern
states slowed border crossings by stepping up inspections of
Canadian trucks. Farmers are planning a new round of protests this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports of spring wheat increased 2,000 percent, to 1.45
million tons, from 1990 to 1997, and imports of Canadian durum
were up 57 percent, to 427,600 tons.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves First Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament's lower chamber
on Friday approved the first part of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
planned tax reform amid harsh opposition criticism.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, which is expected to get final approval from
the upper house December 18, the income tax rate for low earners drops
to 23.9 per cent from 25.9 per cent and allowances for families with
children rise to 250 marks (150 dollars) from 220 marks.
</P>
<P>
Germany's top marginal income tax rate of 53 per cent will remain
unchanged next year.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's centre-left government plans modest, step-by-step tax
cuts which will only yield a significant net tax reduction in 2002
when the lowest marginal income tax rate will be cut to 19.9 per cent
and the top rate will drop to 48.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government plans to increase taxes on petrol,
natural gas and electricity which it says will be offset by trimming
social welfare payments.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
invited an international consortium to begin negotiations for the
sale of 51 percent shareholding of Uganda Telecoms Limited (UTL).
</P>
<P>
The consortium, comprising World Tel, the International
Telecommunication Union's Investment Fund, and Detcon, a Deutsche
Telecom Subsidiary, was the sole bidder in an international
tender for 23 million U.S. Dollars in cash and deferred payments,
Radio Uganda reported Friday evening.

sector.
</P>
<P>
The sector split the former Uganda Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation into three business entities,
created an independent regulatory agency and licensed a second
national operator.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady progress in the process of
privatization. As at the end of February this year, a total of
80 public enterprises had been privatized. Steps have also been
taken to privatize 13 other enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's New Government Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime
Minister-Designate Salim Hoss formed his cabinet Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet consists of 16 members, only two of whom
worked in the previous government headed by Rafik Hariri, who
refused to accept President Emile Lahoud's request to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, 69, a veteran politician, was named prime minister by
Lahoud two days ago.
</P>
<P>
He said in a news conference that the make-up of the government
is based on the country's traditional power-sharing arrangement,
which divided seats equally between Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He appointed himself as foreign minister and also minister for
immigrant affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Saidi, vice governor of the central bank, was named as
economy and trade minister, and minister of industry.
</P>
<P>
Walid Jumblatt, Druze leader, and Elie Hobeika, Christian
leader, both former warlords during the country's 1975-1990 civil
war, were excluded from the new government.
</P>
<P>
Only Michel Al-Murr, former Deputy Prime Minister and Interior
Minister, and Suleyman Franjieh, former minister of public health,
were retained in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Murr was appointed deputy prime minister, interior minister and
minister of rural and municipal affairs. Franjieh was named
minister of housing and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed cabinet, which is smaller than the previous
30-man government, was believed by local politicians as a first
step toward administrative reform process pledged by Lahoud in his
inaugural speech on November 24.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet is expected to convene its first session
on Saturday, during which ministers will take their first
group photos and discuss the government future policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be submitted to the parliament when Hoss asked
for a vote of confidence for his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new team is almost certain to win the vote because 95 out
of the 128 lawmakers had told the president this week that they
would back the government led by Hoss.

<HEADLINE> Global Investors Confirm UK as Europe's Entry Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) - Britain retains a clear lead in
Europe as first choice for future foreign investment, in spite of
it staying out of the euro.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 150 of the world's top 1,000 companies by AT
Kearney, the US management consultancy, found that Britain was the
fourth most likely destination by global investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors questioned about their future worldwide intentions
rated the UK behind only the US, China and Brazil, and second only
to the US among financial service firms.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest companies cite market size, political
stability, GDP growth, regulatory environment, and profit
repatriation as the five most important factors to consider when
making direct investments.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that Britain's advantages relate to all of
these factors including its strong commitment to the European
Union, although it stays out of the euro at moment.
</P>
<P>
The survey results suggest the UK's decision to wait for the
right economic conditions before recommending adoption of the
single European currency to the British electorate will not affect
investors' interests in Britain.

percent in October to 4.2 percent in November of the year,
Greece's National Statistics Service (NSS) announced on Friday.
</P>

However, he said that the agreements between NATO and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the
one hand and Yugoslavia on the other were an excellent example of
the effectiveness of the coordinated involvement of the two

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Denies Ceasefire Agreement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu has denied that Rwanda was involved in a peace
agreement on the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
relating to the cessation of hostilities in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said Thursday night that no agreement was signed.
Ceasefire is just a wish which did not bind any party, the Rwanda
News Agency Friday quoted Bizimungu as reporting.
</P>
<P>
"All respective parties stood on their positions. There was a
general wish that the peace process continues in order to reach a
solution in the future," Bizimungu said in a press conference at
Kanombe International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu also indicated that Rwanda will keep its troops as
long as its security continues to be threatened by Hutu
extremists, former government soldiers (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe
militia, who are conducting bloody cross-border raids from the
Congolese territory.
</P>
<P>
"Our intervention in Congo is not adventure. It was motivated
by the need to find a solution to the same problems as those we
faced in 1996, the problems of security, the problems of
genocide," Bizimungu underlined.
</P>
<P>
He accused President Laurent Kabila of harboring the Hutu
extremists who committed genocide in Rwanda and who continue
their attacks on the country. Rwanda has accused Kabila's regime
of having formed an alliance with ex-FAR and "Interahamwe", which
is now figting alongside loyalist troops and the South African
Development Community (SADC) forces.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu warned that since there was no ceasefire agreed
upon, warring parties could resume hostilities. Kabila is not
interested in sitting at a negotiating table with the Congolese
rebels, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president further dismissed cleavages between
Rwanda and Uganda about their intervention in the DRC on the side
of the rebels, saying both countries have a common objective.
</P>
<P>
He said that their intervention in Congo has been motivated by
the need to protect their borders which has been destabilized by
rebels attacking from the Congo.

U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky noted the

that more Canadian grain could be headed south to this country in
coming years because of changes in Canada's transportation system
that are making it cheaper to ship into the United States.

KAMPALA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni announced that the government will deploy more
troops in Karamoja Region in northeastern Uganda to make security
a priority.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni made
the announcement Friday at a public rally in the eastern district
of Moroto.
</P>
<P>
He urged district leaders to work closely with the army to
guarantee security in the vast region where cattle rustlers
operate.
</P>

The president commended people in Karamoja Region for obeying the
government's directive not to cross to neighboring districts with
guns and urged those raided by the rustlers from Kenya not to
take revenge.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Ugandan government will contact the Kenyan
side to recover the cattle they lost during the cattle rustling.

Cattle plays a central role in the socio-economic and

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Vote in Local Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has urged his people to come out in mass to
vote in Saturday's local government election, which is the first
under the military government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
In a national broadcast Friday on the Nigerian TV Authority
(NTA), Abubakar said Saturday's election will "undoubtedly lay
a solid foundation for the rest of the elections in the
transition program."
</P>
<P>
He urged politicians and political parties to play by the
rule, saying means will not be justified by ends.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reiterated the Nigerian government's commitment to
hand over power to a democratically elected civilian government
on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We have made solemn commitment to leave a legacy of democracy
based on fairness, equality and justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election will produce 774 local government chairmen
and 8,870 councilors.
</P>
<P>
According to the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), a
total of 355,077 officials would be employed to work at the
111,430 polling stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
INEC also said that it has distributed 60 million voters'
cards during the voters' registration exercise in October.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election would determine the fate of the country's
nine temporarily registered political parties, as the INEC said
only those securing at least five percent of the total votes cast
in each of at least 24 out of the 36 states and Federal Capital
Territory would be fully registered.

MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia says its task is to
prevent a new crisis around Iraq, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting here with head of the UNSCOM Richard Butler,
Ivanov said the task of Russia is to prevent a new crisis around
Iraq, continue the constructive solution of remaining problems and
ease tension in the Gulf zone.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a general understanding of the fact that
a considerable part of the U.N. commission's work is complete.
</P>
<P>
It is now essential to clarify issues that remain open in order
to be able to make a comprehensive review of all aspects of
destruction of mass annihilation weapons in Iraq, Ivanov added.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a review would make it possible to lift the
oil embargo on Iraq as stipulated by relevant resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian foreign minister, Iraq's nuclear,
chemical, and missile dossiers are the "most advanced."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that a detailed exchange of views on the situation
in Iraq will be discussed with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz after his arrival in Moscow Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Blair Accepts France's Idea on EU Defense Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday agreed with French leaders that the European Union should
have an autonomous capacity for taking actions such as preventing
crises, but fell short of blessing the Western European Union as a
future European defense organization.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued after the 21st Franco-British summit held
in Saint Malo, western France, Blair and French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that a capacity to
take action by the EU should rely on credible military forces.
</P>
<P>
The EU should be able to resort to either the NATO forces
stationed in Europe or the national armed forces of European
countries when it decides to take actions in the future, they
said.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union should have an autonomous capacity of
action, relying on the credible military forces, with the means to
use them and being ready to do it in order to respond to
international crises," said the British and French leaders in
their declaration on European defense.
</P>
<P>
Britain said for the first time last month that it would
consider join France, Germany and other European countries in
introducing a defense characteristic to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
London said until then that the defense of Europe should be
completely taken care of by the NATO.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain agreed that the EU should have a capacity
for evaluating the situation, the sources of information, and a
capacity of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to take into account the present means of the
WEU and "the changing relations between it and the EU.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-DPRK Talks Resume in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official said Friday
that talks between the United States and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on the issue of a DPRK underground
facility resumed in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is to confirm that bilateral talks on suspect underground
construction resumed just shortly after 10 a.m. today," the U.S.
delegation's spokesman Richard Scorza said in a recording phone
message.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has suspected an underground facility in Kumchang-ri,
Taegwan county of North Phyongan Province, as a nuclear one and
asked for inspection, but the DPRK has denied the existence of any
nuclear facility and rejected the inspection demand.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has remained unresolved since the talks began in
Pyongyang on November 16-17 between U.S. special envoy Charles
Kartman and DPRK Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan.
</P>
<P>
Calling the U.S. demand a "gave violation" of DPRK sovereignty,
Pyongyang asked the U.S. to make "adequate compensation" before an
inspection is made. But the U.S. rejected the concept of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. says failure to secure access to inspect the site
could jeopardize a 1994 framework agreement under which the DPRK
will freeze its own nuclear program in return for two modern
nuclear reactors worth more than 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. spokesman said the new round of talks is scheduled to be
held on December 4-5 in New York and on December 7-8 in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> World Bank in Support of Malawi's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
92 million U.S. Dollars loan to Malawi in support of the
country's policy reforms in order to accelerate its economic
growth and reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release faxed to Xinhua Friday by the
World Bank, 90 million Dollars of the loan which was approved
Thursday will finance Malawi's fiscal restructuring and
deregulation. The remaining two million Dollars will be for
technical assistance for implementation.
</P>
<P>
The loan will support economic growth and poverty reduction in
Malawi by creating a policy environment that encourages greater
private sector investment and efficiency and helps to realize a
sustaiined and diversified economic growth, said the news
release.
</P>
<P>
It will also support the Malawian government's policies that
redirect its expenditures into social sectors and programs that
benefit the country's poor people, such as basic health care,
primary education and maintenance of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It is a crucial time to support Malawi, said Ahmad Ahsan,
World Bank's senior country economist for Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has a good track record of implementing economic
reforms, especially since 1995, but this progress was interrupted
last year by instability and a decline in economic growth, Ahsan
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the last few months, the Malawian government
worked hard to get the country's economy back on track and
demonstrated its commitment by starting to implement wide ranging
policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that these reforms will help to sustain Malawi's good
growth seen in the past few years and to reduce the poverty
there.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Works on Containing Deserts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- In its efforts to contain
worldwide deserts, the World Bank has since 1990 financed 159
projects that aim to improve natural resources management in
dry-land areas.
</P>
<P>
Its financing now totals nine billion and leverages additional
nine billion U.S. Dollars, resulting in a total dry-land
investment portfolio exceeding 18 billion Dollars, according to a
World Bank news release available to Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank is taking steps to assist countries in
fighting against desertification.
</P>
<P>
These steps include mainstreaming environmental issues in the
country assistance strategies; maintaining an active program of
lending for development in dry-land areas; and increasing the
emphasis in its rural development activities on sustainable
agricultural systems and dry-land management.
</P>
<P>
Of the earth's surface, 41 percent of the total land area is
being eaten up by ever-expanding arid deserts, affecting more
than 900 million people in 100 countries, some of them are among
the least developed in the world.
</P>
<P>
Annual worldwide economic loss due to desertification is
estimated at 42.3 billion Dollars, the news release cited a
latest World Bank report titled New Opportunities for
Development: The Desertification Convention.
</P>
<P>
The report is being issued to coincide with the Second
Conference of the Parties for the United Nations Convention to
Combat Desertification, which is taking place in Dakar, Senegal,
through December 11.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said in its report that desertification can be
tackled only by fostering broad economic and social changes
directed at its underlying causes.
</P>
<P>
It noted that desertification is not just a physical
phenomenon, but also a result of "inappropriate" economic
policies that undervalue natural resources and encourage misuse.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails Europe's Help in Fighting Global Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine met
here Friday while Rubin applauded European efforts to help fight
global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, speaking to reporters before a brief closed-door meeting
with his German counterpart, said Europe had played a constructive
role in fighting world-wide upheaval prompted by Asia's economic
crisis and would no doubt continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
"As we have faced individual issues going through this whole
process, Europe has contributed in a very constructive way and I
have no doubt it will continue to do so," Rubin told reporters
just before meeting Lafontaine, who is on a brief visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans have contributed very constructively in what has
been a very complicated set of issues over the last year, most
recently with their bilateral contribution to the support package
for Brazil," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The international community has put together a 41.5 billion
U.S. dollars dollar rescue package for Brazil, Latin America's
biggest economy. The program includes five billion U.S. dollars
from the United States and more from other bilateral donors.
</P>
<P>
Both Rubin and Lafontaine declined to comment directly on
Thursday's surprise round of interest rate cuts in Europe aimed at
preventing a painful downturn in Europe's economies.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine earlier on Friday said his talks in Washington were
aimed at explaining his government's efforts to stimulate economic
growth and cut sky-high German unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
He has said in the past that he sees monetary policy as one
tool among several that can be used to boost the economy and he is
a strong advocate of the need for a European-wide jobs initiative.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine is scheduled to meet U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and the head of the International Monetary Fund,
Michel Camdessus, later on Friday before returning to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Hague Defiant Over Sacking Lords Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative leader William Hague issued a defiant warning Friday
saying he would sack anyone in his party who behaved like Viscount
Cranborne.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said, "Any leader worth his
salt would sack somebody who did what Lord Cranborne did."
</P>
<P>
"I would do the same again. I've had the most tremendous
support from across the party and I've enjoyed myself immensely,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hague sacked Lord Cranborne Wednesday over his attempt to
strike a deal on Lords reform with Prime Minister Tony Blair,
without telling the rest of the Shadow Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The sacking has left the Conservatives in the Lords in complete
disarray with the whole Tory frontbench team offering their
resignation, which Hague refused.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday four peers rejected their leader's pleas and
resigned while two other peers left the Tory fold to sit as
independents.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Cardiff Friday to the Tory team fighting next
year's elections to the new Welsh Assembly, Hague stoutly defended
his actions over what has been one of the party's worst weeks
since the election.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy when I refused to accept Labor's deal on the
House of Lords. Some senior colleagues of mine said I should
sacrifice long-term principles for short-term convenience," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But," he said, "I refused because I wanted to be true to our
principles. I wanted us to be the one party that stands against
the government's constitutional vandalism."
</P>
<P>
"Standing up for your beliefs isn't easy, but it's right. It's
what I came into politics to fight for," he added.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Sends Letter to Saudi Crown Prince on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz received on Saturday a message from
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on bilateral ties and matters
of mutual concern, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian ambassador in Riyadh Mohammad Riza Nouri, who delivered
the letter, said Khatami wished to discuss with Prince Abdullah
means of developing bilateral ties in various fields.
</P>
<P>
This is the second letter Khatami sent to the Saudi Crown
Prince in less than one month. On November 7, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi conveyed a letter from Khatami to Abdullah
which dealt with similar issues.
</P>
<P>
In that letter, Khatami reportedly expressed Tehran's readiness
to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on the flagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, once in mistrust to each other for
almost two decades, began to improve their ties since Iranian
President Khatami, a political moderate, took office last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries saw a big boost in bilateral ties since
last February when Iran's former president Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani paid a 14-day official visit to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the two sides have exchanged a number of other
high-level visits, during which talks on ways of boosting
bilateral ties and shoring up the sagging oil prices were held.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal signed with his
Iranian counterpart Mohammad Kharrazi, during his trip to Tehran
last May, a memorandum of understanding over future cooperation
in all fields.

They decided to depend on themselves for financing, and Cheng
promised to make the first prototype in six months. They turned an
old house into a research institute, and they looked at eight
factories before finding the metal most suitable for making their
prototype.
</P>
<P>
"It was really tough at the beginning, because we had neither the
necessary design drawings nor specific equipment, and 80 percent
of our materials were of no use at all." recalled Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Five prototype motorcycles with the brand name "Jialing"
finally came out in 1979.
</P>
<P>
It was a great success. Their products sold like hot cakes
nationwide, and Cheng was promoted chief engineer in recognition
of his outstanding performance.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Jialing Group has taken the lead among China's
motorcycle manufacturers. Its productivity has been rising at the
rate of 30 percent a year since it made an arrangement with 11
other firms for spare-parts production, and it made 2 billion yuan
(240 million U.S.dollars) in profits in 20 years.

appliances to the manufacturing of motorcycles, mini-vehicles and
heavy-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Now that the national motorcycle market has reached the
saturation point, Cheng has decided to start the third phase of
his career by developing agricultural machinery to serve the vast
number of China's rural people. "We must always be
market-oriented," said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Cheng explained that he has begun to learn computers now
because computers have become the primary design tools, replacing
the rulers and pencils of yesterday, and one must keep up with a
fast-changing world if one wants to make steady progress.

<HEADLINE> From Armaments to Motorcycle Magnate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Xingming, an
armament-industry engineer 20 years ago and now a motorcycle
magnate, decided to learn computers at the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
While engaged in the technological developments of the armament
industry and motorcycle production, Cheng did his work with rulers
and pencil and paper from the time he was assigned to the China
Jialing Group, a key weapons manufacturer in southwestern China's
Chongqing City, after his graduation from Chongqing University in
1964.
</P>
<P>
"I wish my study of computer technology could help me with a
third success in my life-long industrial career," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Cheng was a specialist in the manufacturing
of cartridges, and his first success was in the weapons industry.
</P>
<P>
He was the first to use steel instead of copper in shell
case production, and the armor-piercing shell he invented was
awarded the state's gold prize.
</P>
<P>
However, he had to shift from war-products to civil industry at
the turn of the 1970s and early 80s when China's weapons factories
were required to transform their production lines into ones for
civil uses.
</P>
<P>
Jialing had only around 58 million yuan (7 million U.S.dollars)
worth of fixed assets, and less than 20 million yuan (2.4 million
U.S.dollars) of annual output value at the beginning of the
reforms, and it was operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
"We felt quite distressed and were at a loss at that time, and
our factory's prospects seemed totally bleak. It was just like a
stranded ship," Cheng recalled.
</P>
<P>
At first, Cheng and the other engineers wanted to cooperate
with Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki, three well-established Japanese
enterprises, on developing motorcycles for civilian use. The
Japanese offered to set up an assembly line for them, with an
annual output capacity of 20,000 motorcycles, and a five-year
investment of 50 million U.S.dollars, but 20 percent of the key
spare parts would still had to be imported from Japan.

<HEADLINE> Chiang Kai-shek's Hometown Luring Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Fenghua in east China's
Zhejiang Province used to be a Mecca for visitors from Taiwan
Province because it is the hometown of Chiang Kai-shek, late leader
of the Kuomintang and head of the Nationalist government from 1928
to 1949.
</P>
<P>
But local people have turned it into a hot spot for overseas
investment as well.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, when the first overseas-funded company was set up
in Fenghua, this county-level city has invested heavily in
infrastructure and built many urban roads and apartment
buildings, as well as a modern telephone network with a capacity
of 100,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
To improve the investment environment, the city government
invited architects to create plans for an urban expansion program,
and residents were asked to make every effort to maintain a sound
business atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off. By the end of this October, the
county-level city had approved the opening of 236 firms with
capital totaling 514 million U.S. dollars, including 168 million
dollars from overseas investors.

WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- With no end in sight to the
157-day lockout, 17 NBA players joined Tim Hardaway of the Miami
Heat last night at a charity game at Miami Dade Community College.
</P>
<P>
The contest to benefit the American Cancer Society drew a

</P>
<P>
Like most All-Star games involving NBA players, this contest
featured little defense and a plethora of emphatic dunks.
Hardaway scored 31 points in the second half to rally the Supreme

<HEADLINE> Norway to Keep Oil Production Ceiling Till Next Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Norway announced on Friday
to extend its oil production ceiling to next summer as the world
oil prices are expected to remain at the current low level.
</P>
<P>
In supporting OPEC's call for production cut to boost oil
prices, Norway decided this spring to cut its oil production in
the North Sea oilfields by 3 percent, or 100,000 barrels a day, by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Norway hopes its decision to prolong the reduction of oil
production will prompt a rally in the oil price, or at least curb
its further decline.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the oil supply has far exceeded the demand in
the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
As OPEC states failed to reach an agreement on efficient
counter moves, the price for oil continues to decrease.
</P>
<P>
The price plunged to less than 10 U.S. dollars per barrel this
week, the lowest in the past 20 years and lower than the production
cost of some North Sea oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Norway's move could put little
influence on international oil prices taking into account the fact
that the global oil market is facing a daily surplus of 1.5
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
But the move will bring a significant influence on Norway's
economy, causing a 2.5 billion kroners (310 million dollars) drop
in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Due to reduced oil prices and production, next year's growth
rate in the Norwegian economy is expected to slide to 0.8 percent
from this year's 2.4 percent, said the Norway Central Statistics
Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Blocking U.N. Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq denied on Saturday an
accusation by U.N. deputy chief arms inspector Charles Duelfer
that Iraq has blocked a U.N. arms inspection team from entering a
site.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Hussam
Mohameed Ameen, head of the Iraqi liaison with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) which provides escorts to U.N. arms
inspectors, said Duelfer's accusation "is a sheer lie."
</P>
<P>
Iraq did not block U.N. arms inspectors from going where
they wanted to go, Ameen affirmed.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, a 12-member UNSCOM team wanted to carry out a
surprise inspection to a base which belongs to a foreign country,
said Ameen. However, he did not mention which country it is.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors' access to this foreign base should be
discussed between heads of the UNSCOM team and the base, said
Ameen. He added the Iraqi side is very prudent on the matter of
this sort.
</P>
<P>
After three hours of representations with the foreign base in
which the Iraqi side is not involved at all, head of the UNSCOM
team Mario Baycol decided not to enter the base, said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned UNSCOM team has carried out inspections
to 15 sites, including governmental organizations, factories and
tobacco companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said that he was surprised to hear Duelfer's accusation,
stressing that Duelfer was deliberately trying to distort the
truth.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
cooperation with UNSCOM which it suspended last August and thus it
narrowly escaped a U.S.-led military attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Red carpet is being rolled over
for the King's presence Sunday night at the Royal Main Stadium
while the mascots of elephant are smiling from every corner of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The colors of the 41 members of the Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) are dancing in the breeze along the express ways above the
metropolitan which habors a population of six million.
</P>
<P>
One day before the opening ceremony, every sign justifies that
Bangkok, casting off the shadow of its most severe economic tumble
in decades, is ready for the latest sports festival of the
continent, the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
After the "Black July" last year when Thai baht was forced to
devalue, Thailand that was struck first in the mire of financial
crisis, was plunged into doubts upon its capability to host the
biggest sports gala before the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
However, as if in a gesture to nod for the Asian Games, the
Thai economy is showing signs of recovery as its currency climbed
to 35 baht to one U.S. dollar from 41 a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rocketed to nearly 400
points from the lowest 200 points not so long ago, and over three
billion U.S. dollars have flown into the country since the
beginning of the year, manifesting more and more foreign investors
are gaining confidence in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Thai
government estimated that Thailand will bottom out of the crisis
by the end of the year and its Gross Domestic Product will see a
growth of one percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Coming at such a time and coinciding with King Bhumibol
Adulyadej's 71st birthday on Saturday, the Asian Games is becoming
a festival for the Thai people.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Thai people have every reason to celebrate as the
Games is to kick off at the peak of the tourism season, bringing
about 80 million baht (2.2 million dollars) daily to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Hotels in downtown Bangkok are fully occupied, and the industry
is expected to earn 300 million baht (8.3 million dollars) during
the fortnight meet.
</P>
<P>
Small peddlers are among the most enthusiastic in welcoming the
Games for they have already seen their businesses boomed.
</P>
<P>
A balloon peddler near the Sanam Luang square (the Royal
Ground), who only gave his name as Chainat, said he has met more
customers now than before.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I earned less than 100 baht (2.7 dollars) every day,
but now more than 150 baht (about 4 dollars)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Songtot, who quitted his job in a factory to sell ice-creams
outside the Main Press Center building in Muang Thong Thani Sport
Complex, said his business is not as satisfactory as expected.
</P>
<P>
"But I hope it will become better when the Games begins," he
said.

BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's international center
Zheng Haixia, who was not included in the Chinese squad for the
upcoming Bangkok Asian Games because of a back injury, has been
named the head coach of the former Chinese women's national cham
pion Bayi.
</P>
<P>
Haixia, who played for the Los Angles Sparks in two past WNBA
seasons, replaced Guo Yonglin's coach position last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bayi, an Army team and a long-term national first-division
league champion, showed a historic-bad performance in this
summer's league competition, partly due to the Haixia's absence,
placed last and relegated to the second-division for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
"It's sad for us. But I'm confident to bring my team back to
the first-division next season," Haixia said. "as a former team
member of the national champion, I will do my best to recuperate
the team's honor.
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking time to learn some basic things after I came here.
To go up to our peak, we must be united and put up our minds that
it will be a hard way."
</P>
<P>
Haixia was a member of the Chinese national team winning the
silver medals both in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and the 1994
World Championship in Sydney, where the 2.04-meter giant was
honored the Most Valuable Player.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China will undertake a campaign
to improve the work style of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
The program called "three stresses" will target leading
officials above the county level through criticism, self-criticism
and education, with stresses on studying theory, increasing
political consciousness, and cultivating healthy trends.
</P>
<P>
According to a telephone-television conference held by the
Party Central Committee here this afternoon, the program will also
help officials consolidate their belief in socialism with Chinese
characteristics, act in unison with the Party Central Committee,
and ensure the implementation of the Party's policies.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said during the conference
that this decision is very significant because it will serve to
improve the cohesion and effectiveness of the Party's
organizations and strengthen their relationship to the people.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, serious problems exist among some officials,
including some who hold important and leading positions.
</P>
<P>
He said Party general secretary Jiang Zemin has instructed that
Party officials should be educated, and that this program is of
great importance as China faces both opportunity and challenge at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Officials must exercise their powers in a correct way,
eliminate bureaucracy, and fight against corruption, according to
Hu, adding that the campaign will deal with pressing problems in
the Party's work, especially those which have aroused concerns
among the public and hindered the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that a democratic atmosphere must be created in the
campaign, and officials should modestly listen to the criticisms
and suggestions of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
The conference was presided over by Wei Jianxing, secretary of
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC.

the sex of a foetus to stop parents from choosing abortion in
their attempt to have a son.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the province, especially in remote rural
areas, people still have the traditional view that a son is needed
to help one in one's old age and they often choose abortion when
they discover that the woman is pregnant with a female child.

The regulation says that any unit or individual who breaks the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Who Improves People's Diets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Wang Leyi, a farmer from China's
Shandong Province, could never imagine a "white revolution" he
started in 1989 would change the lives of multi-million Chinese
who could never get fresh vegetables in winter.
</P>
<P>
Northern Chinese used to live on Chinese cabbage and potatoes
in the winter months, but now the "white revolution", the
cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses covered by
plastic-sheeting, is now common all over northern China.
</P>
<P>
China's total vegetable output nearly doubled in the past
decade, and per capita vegetable consumption reached 253 kilograms
in 1997, about average in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wang's hometown of Shouguang, near the Bohai Sea, has 200,000
of the covered greenhouses and is an important vegetable producer
for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang's greenhouse has thick earth walls on three sides. At
night, the plastic sheeting is covered with rice thick straw to
hold the warmth.
</P>
<P>
Each greenhouse costs about 7,000 yuan, but it produces several
10,000 yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is in his sixties, has had more than 500,000 visitors
from across the country since 1990 and he also has travelled to
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Gansu Province to help
farmers there with vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributes his success to his "active thinking". He
explains that the idea came from a kilogram of cucumbers one of
his relatives gave to his mother during Spring Festival of
1988. He says he was surprised to see cucumbers those icy days the
first time in his life, and at that moment had an idea about how
farmers could do something during the slack season.
</P>
<P>
China has covered greenhouses producing several dozen types of
vegetables on 933,000 hectares of land.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Foreign Trade Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade in 1998
declined 17 percent from the same period in 1997, Russian Trade
Minister Georgy Gabunia said here Saturday at a meeting of the
World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign trade turnover is currently at the 1995
level. The imports decreased by 60 percent since August 17 when
Russia's ruble was devalued and the country defaulted on its debts.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia cited the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and
Russia, and Russia's banking system as the reasons for the decline.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia predicted that the situation might change for the
better when Russia's financial and economic systems are stabilized
and foreign trade achieves 3-4 percent annual growth. It could
return to the 1997 volumes in the years 2002-2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen its role in world markets, Russia must
change its customs legislation, streamline import and export
procedures and gradually open its market, while protecting its own
manufacturers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia said it is an important foreign trade strategy for
Russia to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) and introduce
WTO rules to Russia's economic systems, which he said would help
Russia become a more desirable trade and investment partner.

<HEADLINE> Research Confirming Chinese Flood Legend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars say they have
proven that catastrophic floods did take place in the Yangtze
River Valley about 4,000 years ago and that the ancient legend of
"Dayu Regulating the Floods of the Yangtze River" is true.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Cheng at Nanjing University believes that the
greatest flood coincided with the period the legend describes.
</P>
<P>
Dayu was the reputed founder of the Xia Dynasty and led the
Chinese in controlling floodwaters in ancient China. He is still
worshipped by people in the Yangtze and Yellow river valleys.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said at a symposium on China's environment that he and his
colleagues used carbon dating to study hundreds of ancient relic
sites on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
They say that from 7,000 to 2,000 years ago, there was one
large flood every 500-1,000 years and they found that there were
altogether 7 catastrophic floods from 8,000 B.C.to 1,300 B.C.,
during the Shang and Zhou dynasties (1,600-1,000 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The flood 4,000 years ago was the greatest, they decided, based
on phenomenal interruptions in many strata.

<HEADLINE> TV-Shopping Booms in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nowadays, many Chinese tired
of spending so much of their time shopping have found a new and
convenient way to accomplish this chore -- simply tuning in to one
of the many TV-shopping programs and making a phone call to place
their order.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, when the Beijing Television Station premiered
China's first TV-shopping program, on-air business has been
flourishing in China, mostly in the major cities. Currently, over
200 local television stations nationwide offer TV-shopping
programs.
</P>
<P>
However, this modern method of direct selling has drawn as many
controversial comments as it has sales, both from customers and
officials.
</P>
<P>
While many people like the convenience, others are put off
by what they see as irrationally high prices, poor quality,
false advertising, and poor delivery service.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some television viewers have blasted some TV-shopping
ads for health and body-building products for being sexually
provocative. These problems have led to a cooler attitude toward
TV-shopping this year.
</P>
<P>
However, most local and overseas experts are optimistic about
the prospects for the fledgling business, noting that China, the
most populous country in the world, boasts 75 million cable-TV
subscribers, and a total of 1.09 billion TV-viewers.
</P>
<P>
They urge local TV-shopping operators to improve their services
to win back customers, and believe that the government should take
steps to standardize the business. A non-governmental agency also
should be set up as soon as possible to supervise this sector,
they say.

WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in November
as stronger-than-expected hiring by builders, retailers,
restaurants and other service providers more than offset layoffs
by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
-- The White House signaled Friday that President Bill Clinton
might be willing to pay a fine as part of a censure deal to avoid
impeachment, as his lawyers demanded that the House Judiciary
Committee postpone next week's votes to give them time to mount an
extensive defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, suspected of belonging to Osama bin
Laden's terrorist organization and who was arrested in Munich
three months ago, has resigned himself to extradition to the
United States to face charges of plotting attacks on American
installations.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain accepted a long-standing French proposal that calls
for letting the 15-nation European Union conduct military actions
on its own in situations in which the United States and other NATO
allies do not want to become involved.

<HEADLINE> G77 Conference Ends With Bali Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A Group of 77 high-level
conference ended in Denpasar, capital of Indonesia's Bali
province, on Saturday with the adoption of a "Bali Declaration"
and a "Bali Plan of Action".
</P>
<P>
The Bali Declaration consists of 17 paragraphs carrying the
member countries' stand on and commitment to efforts to intensify
South-South cooperation by enhancing cooperation within and among
regional and sub-regional economic groupings, the Indonesian
Foreign Ministry's Director General of the Foreign Economic
Relations Soemadi Brotodiningrat said.
</P>
<P>
Soemadi told a press conference at the end of the four-day
conference that one of the main elements in the document was the
member countries' commitment to carrying out a number of priority
activities to intensify cooperation within and among regional and
sub-regional groupings.
</P>
<P>
The priority activities include the promotion of network
support, institutions and human resources and the empowerment of
cooperation in the trade, industrial and financial fields to
strengthen inter-regional trade and investment, he was quoted by
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bali Declaration also carries member countries'
commitment to encouraging the participation of the private sector
and civil society in enhancing South-South cooperation through
regional and sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It also carries member countries' commitment to boosting the
involvement and support of the international community, United
Nations bodies, international financial institutes and other
organizations to cement South-South cooperation through regional
and sub-regional cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Bali Plan of Action, Soemadi said it was a further
specification of the Bali Declaration and contained guidelines for
member countries and regional and sub-regional organizations on
the implementation of the priority activities.
</P>
<P>
Among the priority activities were developing institutional
support and human resources, forging cooperation in the fields of
transportation and communication as well as revitalization of
cooperation in trade, industry and finance, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, attended by 22 regional and sub-regional
economic organizations, a panel discussion on exchanging
experience on the benefit obtained and practiced in organizing
cooperation among and within cooperation groups was also held.
</P>
<P>
The panel discussion also touched on the role of the United
Nations and other international organizations in supporting the
regional and sub-regional economic organizations in developing
countries and the role of the private sector and business world in
organizing South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the conference's Bali Declaration and Bali
Action Plan could serve as inputs and recommendations to the
South-South Summit scheduled to be held in Havana, Cuba, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 was founded on June 15, 1964 after 77 countries
signed a joint declaration in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by ministers and ranking officials
of 132 countries, representatives of international organizations,
and observers from Canada, Japan and South Korea. A delegation
from China also attended the meeting at the invitation of the
organizers.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Held Demonstrations across West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians continued
anti-Israel demonstrations across the West Bank on Saturday, days
before U.S. President Bill Clinton sets foot on the soil under
Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Near the Ariel El Jewish settlement north of Ramallah, hundreds
of Palestinians tried to break into the settlement but were fought
back by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers fired tear gas and rubber-coated bullets towards
the demonstrators, but no one was reported hurt, according the
Voice of Palestine (VOP).
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, south of the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians
took part in a demonstration organized by the Palestinian
Liberation Front, which told the protesters that the front will
never stop fighting against the Israeli occupation, VOP said.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem, Palestinian demonstrators
clashed with Israeli security forces near the Rachel's Tomb. The
demonstrators denounced Israel's intention to continue holding the
Palestinian prisoners in its jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian prisoners in various Israeli jails are scheduled to
start a hunger strike Saturday evening in a bid to force Israel to
release them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to visit Gaza to address the Palestinian National
Council on the cancellation of provisions in the Palestinian
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the implementation of the Wye peace accord
signed in October between Israel and the Palestinians. However,
progress in the implementation has been far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians in the territories have been demonstrating
against Israel's continued detention of thousands of Palestinian
prisoners and urged for their release according to the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released the first band of 250 Palestinian
prisoners, out of the 750 stipulated in the Wye accord. But the
Palestinian authority said about half of the freed were common
criminals, not political prisoners as agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it will never set free those Palestinians "with
Israeli blood on their hands," particularly members of the Islamic
resistance group Hamas that has been responsible for a series of
attacks against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Has "Illiteracy-Free" District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh, a country with nearly
half of its 127-million population illiterate, now has a
"illiteracy-free" district, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Magura as illiteracy-free at a massive public rally
in the district, Hasina said the government chose education as a
major strategy for poverty alleviation as illiteracy was one of
the main impediments in the way of overall development in
Bangladesh, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Magura, some 110 kilometers southwest of Dhaka, the capital
city, was backward in respect of the overall socio-economic
development in the country, so the government undertook a program
to remove illiteracy from the district, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The program included poverty alleviation, eradication of
illiteracy, sanitation, afforestation, environment, health and
family planning.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the district would become an example as a basis
for socio-economic development for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
An overall literacy drive started in the district in March last
year, under which 200,100 elderly men and women had been given
education so far.
</P>
<P>
The country's struggle against illiteracy was praised all over
the world, she said, as shown by its achievement of the
International Literacy Award 1998 for its success in the field of
primary and mass education.
</P>
<P>
To remove illiteracy by the year 2006, the Bangladeshi
government has pledged to set up at least one school in each of
the 59,900 villages across the country, where 57.4 percent of its
people aged above 15 are not able to read and write.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stock Exchange Index Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Stock Exchange
(KSE) index closed at 1,759.4 Saturday, up 36 points from
Wednesday's finish.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 9.53 million Kuwaiti dinars (31.33 million
U.S. dollars) as 51.08 million shares were traded in 1,466 deals.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat performance in the KSE came after its index dropped
4.8 percent last week to 1,723.4 points, a 27-month low.
</P>
<P>
The bourse rallied after Kuwait's Central Bank Governor Sheikh
Salem Abdul-Aziz Al-Sabah expressed optimism over the future of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem said Friday that the KSE has been experiencing a
necessary correction phase that will bring prices down to a
reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in the bourse is a natural development
which represent a correction move that comes after a period of
continuous gains during which value of shares reached inflated
levels," Sheikh Salem said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the present weak demand in the stock market to "a
temporary psychological factor" as investors are expected to wait
until the index hits the bottom.
</P>
<P>
However, since the Central Bank has not yet take substantial
actions to shore up the weak stock market, market analysts doubt
Saturday's upward performance in the KSE will last.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Nets 200m Dollars in Trade with CARs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has netted a total
of 200 million U.S. dollar balance in its trade with the Central
Asian Republics (CAR) in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan exported goods worth 218 million dollars to five CARs
of Uzbekstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan
in the past four years and imported various items from the five
countries worth of 18 million dollars, sources from the
International Trade Organization said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the quantum of trade between Pakistan and
CARs had been moving around 50 million dollars per annum because
there was no proper channel for the transportation of goods by
road and by air.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only passengers carry with them a small quantity of
goods which they sell in CARs and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Pakistan and CARs must establish a proper
route to expand their bilateral trade, the sources said, adding
that present available option is the launching of cargo service by
the Pakistan International Airline (PIA) on this route that can
help boost up trade.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the Central Asian Republics have a vast scope of
expansion in their trade. However, it would be possible only when
they succeed in establishing a regular route, either by road or by
air.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Extend Transit Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed
to extend the existing bilateral transit treaty which expires
Saturday by one month or till the date of its formal renewal as
they cannot renew it before its expiry, the official RSS news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Necessary instructions are being issued to ensure that the
movement of Nepal's traffic-in transit between the Calcutta port
of India and the 15 mutually agreed entry and exit points along
the border will continue smoothly, RSS said, quoting a joint press
release.
</P>
<P>
It said that additional transit routes, including that through
Phulbari in northeast India, will also continue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to renew the bilateral transit treaty
signed on December 6, 1991 with mutually agreed modifications.
</P>
<P>
But they failed by the deadline because they could not find a
mutually suitable time, The Kathmandu Post daily said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
RSS said that the mutually agreed draft transit treaty to be
signed shortly will have simplified procedures for the transit of
Nepal's import and export cargoes.
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Nepal depends largely on the transit
routes through India for foreign trade.

ISLAMABAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
have accused Iran of providing anti-personnel mines to the rival
opposition of the Northern Alliance, Bakhtar News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Taliban official responsible for information and culture
Amir Khan Muttaqi said that 400 Iran-made anti-personnel mines
were recently unearthed and seized in Bangi district of Takhar
province.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi deplored that Iran is supplying mines to the Afghan
opposition at a time when international community has geared up
campaign for banning the production, use and sale of mines.
</P>
<P>
He asked the U.N. Security Council to help stop such blatant
interference of Iran in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as
these mines are posing a serious threat to innocent Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that vast agricultural and residential areas in
northern Afghanistan could not be utilized due to the danger of
the mines.
</P>
<P>
Bakhtar News Agency said in its report that the seizure of
mines in Takhar province is yet another open proof of Iran's

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) is scheduled to hold a meeting
next week in Gaza to discuss the Palestinian charter issue, said
the PNC speaker Salim Za'anoun in Gaza on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to pave the way for the upcoming visit to Gaza
by the United States President Bill Clinton, during which he will
address the PNC, Za'anoun told the Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will reaffirm Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat's letter to Clinton in January which
outlined the cancellation of the anti-Israel provisions from the
Palestinian national charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Wye peace accord signed in October in Washington asks for
the reaffirmation of the charter's revision by the PNC. But the
Israel insisted that there must be a vote by over 400 PNC members
on the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
As stipulated by the Wye accord, the Executive Committee of
the Palestinian Liberation Organization ratified the letter in
Ramallah on November 6.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to start his visit to Israel and the Palestinian
territory from December 12.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Golfer on Course to Title at Omega PG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean golfer Kang
Wook-soon remained on course for a remarkable Hong Kong double
after a four under par 66 gave him a four-shot lead here on
Saturday going into the final round of the 500,000 U.S. dollars
Omega PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
Kang, winner last week of the Perrier Hong Kong Open, earned
four birdies in a flawless display of golf and heads the leader
board from Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Chin-sheng, who returned a
three under 67 despite a double bogey at the last hole.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit and Chinese number one Zhang
Lian-wei shared the third place at eight under par after carding
66 and 68 respectively over the 6,096-yeard Clearwater Bay layout.
</P>
<P>
Kang toured the front half in 32 thanks to birdies from six
feet at the second and fifth, and moved to three under for the
day following a 15-foot birdie at the short par four ninth. The
1996 Omega Order of Merit champion made sure of a four-shot
cushion with an eight-foot birdie at the par five 18th.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting the ball better than ever at the moment, and
although there are some very good players behind me on the leader
board I'll try to just focus on my own game tomorrow," said Kang,
a two-time winner on the 1996 Omega Tour.
</P>
<P>
If Kang can keep his rivals at bay in the Omega Tour's
season-closing event, he will become the first player in Asian
PGA history to win back-to-back events.
</P>
<P>
Kang could also become the first player to twice win the Omega
Order of Merit, though his chances will depend on the final round
performances of, among others, Englishmen Ed Fryatt and Chris
Williams, as well as Shaun Michael of America.

<HEADLINE> District Sub-clan Fightings End in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The fighting in Sakow
District between the two Rahanwein sub-clans of Moallimweyne and
Geladleh has now stopped after a peace resolution negotiated by
Rahanwein and Marehan clansmen has came into effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the region, cease-fire was achieved
after a 40-member delegation from Bardera District including
traditional elders from the various Rahanwein clans and a
53-member delegation from the religious group of Jamea Jawarey
have intervened into the serious bloodletting in the district.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day meeting in the town of Sakow, an unconditional
cease-fire was concluded and the two sides signed a six point
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohamed Sheikh Abdusalam, the chief elder of the
Geladleh sub-clan and Madey Malaq Ahmed from the Moallimweyne
signed the document on behalf of their respective sub-clans in
Sakow District Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreed points include the cessation of hostility, the
separation of armed men and their redeployment from the affected
towns and villages where the clashes had spread to.
</P>
<P>
The important points in the pact also include the return of
animal and materials looted during the fighting to their rightful
owners and collective punitive measures to be taken against any
side that violates the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities in Sakow District, the
accord was reached after serious talks began at the grass-roots
level following the failure of several cease-fire attempts late
last month by official talks between the two sides here in
Mogadishu and in the region as well.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 people died and at least 150 other were wounded since
the fighting started some three weeks ago over job opportunities
in a Swedish aid agency -- Swedish Church Relief. The fighting
had erased three villages and caused considerable damages to the
town of Sakow itself.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people who fled to the nearby villages and towns
are reported to have been on the move again toward Sakow District
Saturday after the delegates have called the people via VEP
radios and all other possible means to return to their houses.

<HEADLINE> China's Li Jiajun Sets World Record for 500m at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Li Jiajun surpassed a
world record in the men's 500 meters final at the short track
speed skating World Cup series in Beijing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese clocked a winning time of 41.81
seconds to edge out Japanese Nishitani Takafumi, who won the
event at the Nagano Winter Olympic Games in February.
</P>
<P>
The previous world record was 41.938 seconds, created by
Italian Nicola Franceschina in March 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Li's teammate An Yulong also defeated the Japanese Olympic
champion by one hundredth second, with a time of 42.09 seconds.
Takafumi and his teammate Terao Satoru shared third in 42.10.
</P>
<P>
In women's 500m finals, two Chinese skaters occupied the first
two places with Yang Yang (A) taking the gold medal in 46.02,
followed by Wang Chunlu in 46.05. Choi Min-Kyung of South Korea
got the bronze medal with a time of 46.15.
</P>
<P>
Takafumi kept the lead in the first four laps of the race. But
Li, encouraged by cheers and applauds of the crazy fans, did all
he can to overtake Takafumi in the last lap for the victory.
</P>
<P>
"It's a surprise for me to break the world record. I don't t
hink of that during the final, and I just want to surpass the
Japanese opponent and win the title," Li Jiajun told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Takafumi and Kim Dong-sung of South Korea were Li's main
rivals at the international competitions. "Kim Dong-sung excels
in the long distance events, while Takafumi often plays very well
in the 500 meter finals. And we three are foes on the track," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Kim was disqualified in day's 500m
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Li also won the 1,500m race Friday. If he won or took second
in the 1,000m Saturday while Kim was second or fourth, Li can win
the overall champion of the six-round World Cup series.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident in winning the overall title after today's
victory," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the next Olympics in Salt Lake Winter Olympics,
Li, the silver medallist of the 1,000m at the Nagano Olympics,
said : "I'll manage to overcome the effects of the injures and
age to get good results in 2002."
</P>
<P>
The Changchun native will participate in the National Winter
Games from next January 10 to 19 in his hometown. When asked
whether in the upcoming Games he can defend all his six golds he
took at the last Games, Li said, "I'm not sure because many
excellent skaters have mushroomed in recent years. It will be not
easy to snatch so many any longer."
</P>
<P>
The three-day Beijing tournament is the last leg of the
six-round World Cup series.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan to Fare up for Asiad Marathon Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The women's marathon on Sunday
is fated to be a sensational hit for the 13th Asian Games as its
first gold medal will probably be grabbed either by present
sportspower China or former giant Japan.
</P>
<P>
Pan Jinhong, Chinese national champion who won the 1997 Beijing
marathon with a personal best of two hours 28 minutes 39 seconds,
is tipped to spearhead a scarce field of 13 runners in the Games'
most grueling race.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Wang Yanfang, eighth finisher of the London marathon
early this year, is believed to create enough cusion for Pan to
attain the glory for China, who is hailed to have a lion's share
in the quadrennial gala on the world's most populous continent.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, generay secretary of the Chinese Athletics
Association, said: "Pan is in a solid shape and has a sound chance
for victory though I am not ready to predict her a sure shot."
</P>
<P>
Wang sprained her ankle before coming to Bangkok but the injury
is not serious enough to cost her medal hope, Shang explained.
</P>
<P>
Pan and Wang, both started their marathon careers 10 years ago,
had been training for weeks in Guangzhou and Xishuangbanna of
Yunan Province, where the climate was thought similar to Bangkok,
Shang said.
</P>
<P>
"But it's really too hot in Bangkok," Shang said. "A runner
usually loses her weight of three kilograms after a marathon race
in Beijing, but will lose four here," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese runners are full of confidence despite the
fact that the steaming weather here may affect their timings,
Shang said, adding that "Both Pan and Wang felt no pressure and
they will fight to their best. "
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Chinese athletics top official was quick to say that
"the Japanese runners enjoy their edges."
</P>
<P>
Nooko Takahashi is the hot favorite for Japan, who enjoys an
awesome personal best of 2:25.48 and has won three races on home
soils this year.
</P>
<P>
"I know nothing about the Chinese runners as well as those from
other teams," said the 26-year-old Japanese at a press conference
this afternoon, "I only want to do my best to take the gold
medal."
</P>
<P>
Coach Koshio Koide is pinning high hopes upon his protegee to
win the "most important gold medal" of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"In our full preparation, she has been training very hard in
the past a few months, and she told me she is to stand atop the
podium," said Koide, also coach of Hiromi Suzuki, winner of the
Athens World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Suzuki has skipped the Asian Games to focus on the World
Championships next year and the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Koide
said.
</P>
<P>
But Japan has another fortune as Tomoko Kai registered a
personal best of 2:28.13, only next to both Takahashi and Pan
Jinhong.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old warned against any surprise if she eventually
becomes the winner, saying "I will concentrate on the race and I
have the confidence to run."
</P>
<P>
At an unusally early hour of six thirty, the Bangkok Games'
curtain-raising gunfire will be echoed above a highway, 33km north
of the Athletes Village set up within Thammasal University campus,
signalling the first strides of the 42.195-km classic test of
indurance and stamina.
</P>
<P>
The runners will stride across the Chaopraya River and kick
forward for some 33 kilometes beforing their final show-up at
Thammasal University.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, DPR Korea, Thailand, Tajikistan
and South Korea also field in their runners although they are
widely thought of lack of the calibre to challenge the four
Chinese and Japanese women.
</P>
<P>
As the competitors will have to run against the scorching sun
along the most stages, "I think the winner will have a clocking
between 2:26:00 and 2:32:00," said coach Koide, "But the time is
not important, we only want to win."

<HEADLINE> Modern Technology Comes to China's Securities Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Just over a decade ago,
China's first stock exchange was born at a small counter in a
Shanghai securities company.
</P>
<P>
At that time, there were no computers or electronic bulletins
reporting the latest information. All transactions were handled
the old-fashioned way -- by hand.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, a high-tech electronics fair for stock exchange
activities closed here, indicating that modern technology is now
very much a part of the country's securities exchange.
</P>
<P>
On today's securities market, some 10 million transactions take
place every day, and stock-analysis software and the Internet
enable many shareholders to handle much of their business at home.
</P>
<P>
Economists here note that the widespread use of high-technology
is a result of intensive competition in the securities market and
indicates the development trend of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Arrives in Ankara for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak arrived here at noon Saturday for a two-day state visit to
Turkey at the invitation of President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to hold talks on regional and
international issues as well as bilateral ties between Turkey and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit came two months after he helped defuse a crisis
between Ankara and Damascus over the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president shuttled between Ankara and Damascus in
early October to ease tension heightened after Turkey threatened
to launch military strikes against Syria if Damascus continues to
support the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), outlawed in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The mediation efforts later produced a deal under which Syria
pledged not to allow PKK activities on its territory. Turkish
determination is believed to have forced PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan to leave Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by the Italian police upon his arrival in
Rome by a Russian Airlines passenger plane on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry has said that it expected the PKK
issue would be on the agenda of Mubarak's visit.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for
self rule in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000
lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of the
Kurdish rebel chief, saying its laws forbade extradition to a
country where the suspect may face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said
that he backed the European Union's initiative to try Ocalan
before an international tribunal.

</P>
<P>
"But I want to achieve much and become The Athlete of the

</P>
<P>
Chen set a new world record of four minutes and 34.79 seconds
in the women's 400-meter individual medley and grabbed four golds
in China's Eighth National Games in October, 1997. She was also
voted The Athlete of the National Games.

ISLAMABAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake and a
series of after-shocks jolted the Afghan capital of Kabul in the
early hours of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Kabul quoted residents as saying the
earthquake, which was followed by several after-shocks, is the
most frightening in years.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties. And
the intensity and epicenter of the quake were not known.

Afghanistan, a mountainous central Asian country, is highly

<HEADLINE> Aziz Leaves for Moscow to Seek Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz left here Saturday for Moscow on a two-day visit to
Russia over the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
His visit came a day after Richard Butler, head of the United
Nations Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), visited
Moscow, a move widely believed to seek Russian support on the
Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Butler has requested that Iraq hand over immediately a document
seen at its airforce headquarters last July and other documents
concerning Iraq's chemical weapons used during the Iraq-Iran war
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Butler of trying to create new pretexts for the
United States to launch military attacks on Iraq, calling his
request "provocative."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it is considering disclosing relevant portions of the
documents on its airforce in the presence of the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Envoy Prakash Shah as well
as UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Posuvaluk said recently
that Moscow thought it necessary to resume full cooperation
between Iraq and UNSCOM without any provocation from either party
so that a comprehensive review on Iraq's compliance with the
U.N. resolutions could be conducted in two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Aziz's visit to Moscow at this
time is aimed at drumming up Russian support for an early
commencement of the comprehensive review proposed by Kofi Annan so
that the U.N. sanctions could be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Vyguzova Tipped to Break China's Domination in Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- World champion Irina Vyguzova
of Kazakhstan has the calibre to break China's domination in the
diving competition by winning one gold in the approaching 13th
Asian Games, said Kazakhstan diving coach Yuriy Grishin here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vyguzova, who took the three-meter springboard gold by beating
China's ace women diver Guo Jingjing in the FINA World Cup in
Sydney in January, was considered as the sole threat to the
Chinese divers in the Games to kick off on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We need a diving gold medal," said Grishin through an
interpretor, "Irina has the chance to beat the Chinese divers,
especially in the three-meter springboard."
</P>
<P>
Chinese diving coach Zhou Jihong, who won China's first Olympic
diving gold in the 1984 Olympic Games, also acknowledged that
Vyguzova will stand in her divers' way to glory.
</P>
<P>
"She is an experienced, consistent diver and will pose some
threats to us," Zhou said, "But if my divers make no big mistakes
in the competition, Irina will have no chance."
</P>
<P>
Guo Jingjing was confident that Vyguzova will bring her no
trouble. "I will undoubtedly beat her this time," she added,
"China will make a clear sweep of all the four golds at stake."
</P>
<P>
Yet, Vyguzova seemed unsure of her chance against the Chinese
divers. "Yes I am confident to win," she said, then changed her
tone immediately, "but not this time."

NEW DELHI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K. R.
Narayanan Saturday expressed serious concern over a backlog of 30
million cases in various courts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on judicial reforms here, he said that
the government and judiciary should take steps to tackle all these
cases on a "war footing".
</P>
<P>
The law as it affects women and the weaker sections of society
needs to be reformed and where there are laws already enacted,
they must be faithfully followed by the executive and judiciary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A combination of factors has conspired to make law a
time-consuming process-- the intricacies of procedures, the
ingenuity of lawyers in prolonging cases, even the indifferent
judges, and the unending process of appeals that is available, he
added.

political campaign by calling for the "modernity" of democracy and

citizens, such as strikes.
</P>
<P>
-- At the French-British summit in Saint-Malo, France and the

have an autonomous capacity of action, relying on credible
military forces.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In a speech to the regional council of Bretagne, President
Jacques Chirac redefined his project for France in the 21st
century -- a remoulding of the democracy. He also proposed the
guarantee of minimum public service through law in times of strike
like that of the railway workers which greatly disturbed public
transport of France in the past week.
</P>
<P>
-- One year after the French government launched the program of
 creating jobs for the youths, 150,000 jobs have been created and
unemployment rate among youths dropped by 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Trying to Overturn Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet's lawyers are seeking to overturn the ruling against the
general because of bias, The Guardian newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are seeking the annulment on the grounds that the wife of
one of the five Law Lords, who ruled out on November 25th that
Pinochet was not immune from prosecution, works for Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
Their argument was that Gillian Hoffmann, the wife of Lords
Hoffmann, who cast the deciding vote in the 3-2 ruling that found
Pinochet not immune, is an administrative assistant with the human
rights pressure group in London.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London on October 16 on a warrant from
Spain charging him with responsibility in the deaths or
disappearances of over 3,000 people during his 17-year rule ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old retired general is currently living in a luxury
rented mansion outside London. UK Home Secretary Jack Straw will
decide by December 11 whether the extradition process can go
forward.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, citing Chilean sources, said that submissions
have been sent to the Home Office by Pinochet's lawyer, Kingsley
Knapley.
</P>
<P>
The submissions claimed that Lady Hoffmann's position at
Amnesty International questions the validity of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
They indicated that Lady Hoffmann's relationship with Amnesty
could give the appearance of bias, the Guardian report said.
</P>
<P>
But leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson said that
any suggestion of bias was "preposterous."
</P>
<P>
"Pinochet's lawyers were given ample opportunity to object to
any of the judges before the hearing," Robertson told The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, The Guardian said, a spokesman for Amnesty
ridiculed Pinochet's lawyers' suggestion by saying: "If the
Pinochet legal team have got to the stage where they are now
pursuing this, they are clearly grasping at straws."

<HEADLINE> Macao Police Intensify Crack-down on CD Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in Macao
intensified the crack-down on the piracy of audio, video and
computer software compact discs this year, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November in 1998, Macao police discovered
at least 12 major cases of CD piracy, confiscating some 1.748
million pieces of pirated CDs. The figure was 13 times the sum
seized in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, Macao police detected about 450,000 pieces of
pirated audio and video CDs in four trucks which were loaded with
paper cartons. It was the largest case of CD piracy uncovered by
local police in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Signs have shown that some illegal gangs have been turning out
pirated CD products in Macao and then put them on sale in Hong
Kong and the inland areas of China, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Local police vowed to step up checking of suspicious vehicles
and vessels in the port areas of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Unsold Macao Stamps to Be Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department (MPTD) will soon destroy 2.4 million
sets of stamps because of sluggish sales, the Macao Daily News
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted MPTD director Carlos Alberto Roldao Lopes as
saying that his department has been paying attention to the
preservation value of stamps and that the demolition is expected
to spur the stamp market.
</P>
<P>
He said the quantity of stamp issuance for this year had been
mapped out at the end of 1997 in accordance with market demand at
that time. However, the economy in the Asian-Pacific region has
been depressive this year and some stamp agents have returned part
of the stamps they ordered.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the department decided to destroy 200,000 sets
from each of the 12 kinds of stamps for 1998. And the demolition
will be carried out at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
As scheduled, MPTD has issued 11 kinds of stamps this year and
the last will be distributed to the public next week.

<P>
MACAO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Following a fresh interest rate
cut in Hong Kong, the Macao Association of Banks announced that
interest rate in Macao will be tuned down 0.25 percent Next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, interest rate in Macao will be lowered to 4.25
percent from the current 4.5 percent.

<P>
The association announced interest rate decreases of 0.25
percent each time on October 19 and November 23 this year.

rate reduction might reach 1.75 percent by mid-1999, when
financial costs will drop remarkably and the pressures upon
enterprises will be eased to a great extent.

<P>
Real estate proprietors believe a lower banking rate will first
revitalize the housing market and then boost other sectors of the

<HEADLINE> Armed Forces Must be on Crisis Alert: Malaysian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar Saturday called on the armed forces to be on
the alert for eventualities arising from the current regional
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The King, who is also supreme commander of the Malaysian armed
forces, said the military should optimize use of assets in their
inventory as part of its austerity drive.
</P>
<P>
But this should not mean that the armed forces could compromise
military exercises and its preparedness to defend the nation, the
King said at a passing-out parade and commissioning of 103 short
service cadet officers at the Military Academy here.
</P>
<P>
"In fact during situations like this we must be more alert
because history had proven that economic problems can result in
misunderstanding between neighboring countries and within the
region, with the possibility of conflicts. Although it is better
for problems to be solved through the negotiating table, we must
be in readiness to face the possibilities," the King said.
</P>
<P>
"For this, exercises must continue to be carried out while
assets should be fully utilized," said Tuanku Ja'afar.
</P>
<P>
Loyalty to the superior authorities especially in a disciplined
organization like the armed forces was of utmost importance, the
King said, adding ignoring this aspect might create a
communication gap between the superior authority and subordinates
with the possibility of orders being misconstrued and
misunderstood.

such as border and traffic control, education, training and
scientific equipment.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak on Mediation Between Turkey and Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said the goal of his mediation between Turkey and Syria in October
was to help them solve their disputes in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Turkey's Milliyet newspaper before his
visit to Ankara due Saturday, Mubarak disclosed behind-the-scenes
contacts when tensions mounted between Ankara and Damascus, the
Egyptian Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When the crisis reached its climax, he got messages from Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf countries asking him to step in to act as a
mediator, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey threatened military actions against Syria in October to
stop what it denounced as Syria's support for the separatist
Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting for independence
in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he hurried to Turkey and got assurances from
President Suleyman Demirel that the door was still open for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He then immediately consulted with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad on the issue in a telephone conversation and flew from
Ankara to Damascus for further talks, the Egyptian leader said.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of his efforts was to bring Turkey and Syria
to the negotiating table in a bid to head off a regional military
conflict, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Damascus signed an agreement in late October in
which Syria pledged to close PKK camps in Syria and not to allow
PKK militants to launch cross-border attack against Turkey from
its soil.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak urged Turkey to move forward in relations with Syria
after the two neighbors succeeded in resolving the thorny issue in
a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming visit to Turkey, Mubarak will hold talks
with Demirel on regional issues, including the Middle East peace
process, and ways of promoting bilateral relations, the Egyptian
Mail said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Close to Total Control of Hib Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is close
to totally controlling the serious invasive disease on children
caused by Hemophilia influenza b (Hib) bacteria, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Only 258 cases of invasive Hib, such as bacterial meningitis,
were reported to the CDCP in 1997, compared with 20,000 cases in
children under age 5 were reported in the early 1980s, CDCP said
in the latest issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, case rates have dropped from 41 per 100,000
children in 1987 to 1.3 per 100,000 in 1997, CDCP added.
</P>
<P>
"Hib vaccine should be valued as a way to prevent the deadly
disease that less than a generation ago plagued our youngest
children," said CDCP director Dr. Jeffery P. Koplan.
</P>
<P>
Before Hib vaccine became widely available, according to U.S.
federal statistics, one in 200 U.S. pre-school children developed
serious complications caused by Hib.
</P>
<P>
About 5 percent of children with bacterial meningitis due to
Hib die of the illness, while 15 percent to 30 percent suffer from
mental retardation or deafness.
</P>
<P>
CDCP stressed the continued need for widespread and aggressive
immunization efforts and continued surveillance of Hib invasive
disease.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams Europe Parliament over Kurdish Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey accused the European
Parliament (EP) on Friday of attempting to internationalize the
Kurdish issue, which Ankara considers an internal affair.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
criticized the EP, the consultative body of the European Union
(EU), of calling for the convening of an international conference
on the Kurdish issue in a report adopted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement termed the EP move as "interfering in Turkey's
political and social systems as well as foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
It is far from "constructive and realistic" and will harm the
Turkey-EU relations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), was detained by Italian police upon his arrival aboard a
Russian Airlines passenger plane from Moscow on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of the
Kurdish rebel chief, citing its constitution forbids extradition
to a country that the suspect may face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said that
he backed the EU initiative to try Ocalan before an international
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The PKK took up arms in 1984 for self rule in Turkey's
mainly-Kurdish southeast and over 37,000 people, including PKK
rebels, government troops and civilians, have been killed in the
conflicts since then.

<HEADLINE> S. African Breweries to Move Primary Listing to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Breweries
(SAB), the world's fourth largest brewer, plan to transfer its
primary listing from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) to the
London Stock Exchange next year.
</P>
<P>
The company said Friday that it would transfer its core
operations, beverage gaming and hotel businesses, into a new
company that will list in London by March, South African
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
SAB's decision to leave its country of birth follows fast on
the heels of announcement by Anglo American group, the mining
giant and the biggest listed company in South Africa, that it
would transfer its primary listing to London.
</P>
<P>
With SAB's move, six of the top 10 companies on the JSE will
now have their primary listing in London.
</P>
<P>
The other five are Anglo, the largest, Richemont, Anglogold,
Billiton and Minorco, most of which shifted their primary
listings overseas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The SAB share price closed 200c firmer at 91 Rand (15.6 U.S.
Dollars) Friday following the release of the news. At 91 Rand,
the group has a market capitalization of around 33 billion Rand
(5.64 billion Dollars), which places it fourth in the terms of
size on the JSE.
</P>
<P>
In common with Anglo, SAB cited a desire to get cheaper access
to capital to fund further significant international growth. The
move, the group said, would enable it to compete on the world
stage with its major international partners.
</P>
<P>
SAB, the first industrial company to be listed on the JSE in
1897, said the newly formed company, SAB Plc, would have its
secondary listing in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
At its present market capitalization, SAB would rank at around
70 on the FTSE-100 index of Britain's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
"SAB Plc will be one of the world's largest brewers in terms
of volume of sales, with approximately 25 million hectoliters
sold in South Africa and a further 18 million hectoliters
internationally in the year ended March 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
The group said the new structure would allow it to accelerate
international expansion in a rapidly consolidating beverage
market, while continuing to strengthen its existing operations in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It also might take the opportunity offered by the London Stock
Exchange listing to raise additional equity finance, SAB said.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial crisis
in Asia, the city of Dongguan in China's Guangdong Province had
more than 10 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports during the
January-October period this year, a 24 percent rise on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
The growth is much higher than the national average of 1.3
percent, and the 3.5 percent average for the province.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan is China's largest export-oriented manufacturer, with
13,000 enterprises manufacturing and processing goods for export,
worth about 9.7 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
This booming business is a result of an effort to improve the
economy by giving priority to capital- and technology-intensive
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The businesses also focus on high-value-added products and
processing. Machinery and electronics goods now account for more
than half of the exports and more than half the products are
exported to the U.S. and European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan now accounts for 6.5 percent of the country's foreign
trade.

BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's divers to compete in
the approaching Asian Games will find opponents in their teammates
as they are set to make a clean sweep of gold medals, Chinese
diving coach Zhou Jihong said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Our divers will mainly compete against themselves, and we will
take all the four golds at stake," said Zhou, who brought China
their first olympic diving gold medal at the 1984 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
China will miss star divers Gao Min, Fu Mingxia and Xiong Ni,
all Olympic gold medallists who have come back from retirement.
Zhou said that didn't come to Bangkok Asiad as they havn't resumed
systematic training and turn out in the trials.
</P>
<P>
Though expected to dominate, Chinese divers will face some
challenge from other countries, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have some opponents, such as Irina Vyguzova of
Kazakstan," Zhou said, "I think she is a threat to us."
</P>
<P>
Zhou said her divers will not risk attempting some new dives of
high difficulty degree in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"If they botch in such important games like this, they will
bear much psychological stress, and it will be rather hard for
them to try some other dives of higher difficulty degree," the
former olympic gold medallist said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Inter-Party Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian inter-party talks has
made initiative progress on contentious issues concerning
elections, government-owned Times of Zambia said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the 11-hour meeting chaired by President Frederick Chiluba
in Lusaka Friday, 22 political party presidents agreed to uproot
Nikuv, an Israeli company contracted to deal with voters cards
and registers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have been accusing the company of
practising fraud in favor of the ruling party during the
country's 1996 general and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The party presidents resolved not to renew the Nikuv at the
end of this year when the local government elections were due.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties failed to press for
postponement of the local government elections scheduled for
December 30.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, a committee of eight party presidents was set
up to continue ironing out the remaining issues regarding
constitutional changes and electoral process which have been
hindering the country's political process in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Any four members of the committee can form a quorum to hold
meetings with President Chiluba, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
When opening the talks which were abandoned in 1992, Chiluba,
who is also leader of the ruling party but was seen as a
"neutral" person to chair the talks, urged all the political
parties to try to create a political culture of dialog so that
they could resolve the country's problems through concerted
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks attracted 22 political parties including
the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) and the
largest opposition party, the United National Independence Party
(UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda.

<HEADLINE> The Mulam: Better Educated Ethnic Group (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: The following is
the sixth of a series of stories on the rapidly-changing lives and
culture of the Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Maonan, Gin, and 6 other ethnic
groups living in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which
will have its 40th anniversary on December 11:
</P>
<P>
Among China's 1.2 billion people, the 200,000 members of the
Mulam ethnic group are little known.
</P>
<P>
Mo Hongsheng, magistrate of the Luocheng Mulam Autonomous
County government in Guangxi, says that although the Mulam ethnic
group is smaller in population, their level of education is no
less than that of the Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Mulam ranks second among China's 55 ethnic minorities,
after the Korean people, in terms of education and have many
writers, artists, scientists, and educators.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Chengyi, who got her doctor degree in biochemistry from
the City University of New York this year, is the first Mulam
woman to earn a doctorate abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Senior Middle School in the Luocheng Autonomous County is
a source of many educated people. The first generation of Mulam
university students got their education at this school, which was
founded in 1938. Its graduates are spread over many parts of China
and in foreign countries, one of the farthest away being in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The school has a row of modern buildings and well-trimmed
lawns, even lovelier than some universities. The school is
equipped with more than 50 computers, and every classroom has a
television set.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiuquan, the school's Party Secretary, says that every
national minority has its own strong points and studying hard is a
fine tradition of the Mulam.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Mulam are an aboriginal people of southern China. In
Luocheng County, stone axes dating back 6,000 years have been
found. During the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties,
the Mulam maintained features of their matriarchal society.
</P>
<P>
They are quite different from other ethnic groups in Guangxi,
most of whom live in mountainous areas. The Mulam later came to
control the county seat on the plains where transport was easier.
They have more contacts with the outside world and understand the
importance of learning far better.
</P>
<P>
In the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties,
academies of classical learning and old-style private schools in
the Mulam communities were quite popular, and many people sought
official posts by taking part in the imperial examinations.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, China has been pushing its strategy
of improving China through science and education, which is in line
with the Mulam group's thoughts. The county government has paid
even greater attention to education.
</P>
<P>
According to the county magistrate, Mo Hongsheng, the county has
established an education fund to finance construction of schools
and aid students from impoverished families.
</P>
<P>
If a national minority group wants to become stronger, it can't
only depend on the Central Government for finances, the most
important thing is to improve its culture and the quality of the
people, Mo says. He's a college graduate who recently passed exams
for advanced university studies.
</P>
<P>
Many ethnic people who are more poorly educated than the Han, a
persistent problem among an overwhelming majority of the ethnic
groups, lack qualified personnel to compete in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
But, the autonomous county has nine-year compulsory education
which has helped improve the culture of the Mulam. Farmers, for
example, have used their new knowledge and technology to improve
pig breeding.
</P>
<P>
The Mulam group's modern education includes putonghua, or
Mandarin Chinese, in middle schools, and Chinese versions of
Chinese and foreign literary classics can be found in local
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
An effort has also been made to preserve the culture and
traditions of the Mulam and the county government has decided to
revive the Yifan festival, a sort of songfest, this year.
Recently, some Mulam people even created their own opera in the
Mulam language.

<HEADLINE> An Israeli Soldier Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was wounded
in a Lebanese guerrilla attack in south Lebanon Friday night, the
Orient radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The casualty came when guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched an offensive with heavy guns
and grenades against an Israeli post in al-Aishi, on the eastern
edge of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio Saturday morning confirmed the injury, saying
its warplanes in response blasted Lebanon's southern town of
Nabatieh, believed to be a hideout for Hezbollah guerrillas just
north of its self-styled security zone.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest Israeli casualty since seven of its
soldiers were killed in a spate of Hezbollah bombing attacks in 10
days last month. A total of 23 Israeli soldiers have lost their
lives in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The growing heavy losses have rekindled a heated debate in
Israel over its continued military presence in the area it
occupied in 1985 after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
The popular call for a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon is
growing louder, but Israeli cabinet, after a number of meetings,
still insisted on its security conditions for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli cabinet offered to withdrawal from south
Lebanon but conditioned the implementation of the U.N. Resolution
425 on Lebanese government's arrangement to guarantee security of
Israel's north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria flatly rejected the proposal,
demanding Israel leave the country without any preconditions as
stipulated by the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance spearheaded by Hezbollah has since been
fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy South Lebanon Army
militia.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The '98 Guangzhou
International Automotive Expo opened here today at the Exhibition
Hall of the China Export Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 automotive manufacturers from eight countries and

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh on Long Road to Prosperity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- As one of the world's least
developed countries, Bangladesh has made relentless efforts to
develop its economy in recent years, but the efforts have been
largely offset by protracted political uncertainty and frequent
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, when natural gas was first discovered
underneath Bangladesh, the poverty-stricken Bangladeshis were
overjoyed and described the country as "floating on gas." Both
government officials and ordinary people pinned their hopes on
getting rid of poverty through gas exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The excitement, however, didn't last long. In accordance with
the production-sharing contracts already signed with foreign oil
and gas companies, Bangladesh would get only 25 percent of the
extracted gas, and would have to procure the rest 75 percent from
the foreign companies at international prices, which were much
higher than that of local-company-produced gas.
</P>
<P>
When the first foreign company-drilled gas well began to
produce gas this year, the government found it in a difficult
situation, as it would neither have enough money to buy large
quantity of gas if all the wells operated by foreign companies
were in production nor have the capacity to consume the gas.
</P>
<P>
This problem does not end there. According to latest official
statistics, Bangladesh has a gas reserve of 23 trillion cubic
feet, which can only meet the demand for gas at the present rate
of consumption till the year of 2015. There is simply no
possibility for Bangladesh to export gas, as it can not meet its
own domestic demand in the long run, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 witnessed the worst flood hitting Bangladesh in
100 years, in which half of the country's 127 million population
were affected, and large stretches of crops destroyed and
infrastructure facilities severely damaged, dealing a heavy blow
to its economy.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates put the total loss at around 4.3 billion
U.S. dollars, about 10 percent of the South Asian nation's gross
domestic product. The agriculture sector alone suffered a huge
loss of about 72.5 billion taka (1.49 billion dollars), according
to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
"Only the damage of crops by the flood caused a loss of 36.74
billion taka (756 million dollars)," she said. Over 740,000
million hectares of land were damaged in the prolonged flooding
between July and September.
</P>
<P>
The flood resulted in a food shortage of about 4 million tons,
nearly one fifth of the country's annual food requirement, and
observers here are afraid of a silent famine in Bangladesh in the
coming months, particularly in the winter months between November
and March.
</P>
<P>
To fund its short- and long-term post-flood rehabilitation
programs of over 941 million dollars for the current fiscal year
starting from July 1998, the government has appealed for
international assistance and mobilized domestic resources. For
this end, an international aid of 230 million dollars and local
resource requirements of over 600 million dollars would be needed,
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
But to get international assistance and mobilize domestic
resources is not an easy job. Even if the government could get
what it needed, the implementation of the rehabilitation programs
is still a problem, observers here said. The opposition has
already accused the ruling party of being indifferent to
rehabilitation of flood-affected people, as the "genuinely
affected people were not getting relief and relief materials were
misappropriated by the ruling party leaders."
</P>
<P>
It takes time for the country to recover from calamities. A
severe flood struck Bangladesh in 1988, and it was not until 1997
that the country had fully recovered from the disaster, according
to experts.
</P>
<P>
It would take a much longer period of time for the country to
recover from this year's flood with regard to its duration and
magnitude and considering the volatile political situation in the
country, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in Bangladesh have a liking for calling
hartals, according to the observers. During the five-year rule of
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) between 1991 and 1996, the
then opposition Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) organized 173 days
of hartals, and after the BAL came to power in 1996, the
opposition BNP has also called hartals one after another.
</P>
<P>
One day's hartal in Bangladesh would cause a loss of 3.86
billion taka (84.4 million dollars), according to Finance Minister
Shah A.M.S. Kibria.
</P>
<P>
A three-day hartal organized by the seven-party opposition
alliance in early November this year put all economic activities
in the country at a standstill, and right after the hartal, the
ruling BAL announced unilateral renunciation of hartal in the
country "in the greater interest of economic development of the
country."
</P>
<P>
But the major opposition BNP rejected the government's
"no-hartal" call, and its Chairperson Kaleda Zia called upon the
people to take vow afresh to hasten the fall of the present
government "at any cost," accusing the government of failing to
maintain law and order in the country and being indifferent to
rehabilitation of flood-affected people.
</P>
<P>
Scarcity of natural resources, frequent natural disasters and a
large population might be partially responsible for the country's
economic underdevelopment, but unstable political situation was
the key obstacle to the development of Bangladesh, with more than
half of its 127-million population still living below the poverty
line on an area of just over 144,000 square kilometers, the
observers said.
</P>
<P>
Only when the political parties sit down and settle their
disputes through dialogue and discussion instead of taking to the
streets to lodge their protests, can the country be able to
eventually get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity, the
observers said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges to Have Debt Burden Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Donors have been urged to help
Kenya reduce debt burden which local business people say is so
heavy as to constitute a great impediment to the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
This east African country spends a staggering 48 billion
Shillings (800 million U.S. Dollars) annually in debts repayment,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unless the debts are written off, Kenya will suffer from
further economic deterioration, the report quoted Jubilee 2000
Coalition Director Ann Pettifor as saying. The coalition groups
prominent Asian-origin business people across the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya currently has a foreign debt of 294 billion Shillings
(4.9 billion Dollars) with 240 billion Shillings (four billion
Dollars) accrued in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Pettifor said the conditions for debt cancellation should be
decided by independent international arbitration to save the
common Kenyans from starvation while the government service
debts.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), she
criticized, were applying double standards to African countries
by giving them loans while interest earned on the loans was what
was sustaining the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
Pettifor noted that there is no bankruptcy law, and sovereign
governments cannot go bankrupt, saying, "so when a country is
unable to repay its loans it goes back to the IMF for another
loan to pay old loans accompanied by tough IMF economic
conditions."
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the key 205-million-Dollar loan package to
Kenya in mid 1997, citing poor governance and rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> Wine Can Reduce Stroke Risk, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 4 (Xinhua) -- People who drink moderate
amounts of wine have a lower risk of stroke than those who drink
beer or spirits, according to the latest Friday issue of Stroke, a
publication of the American Heart Institution.
</P>
<P>
The result was based on a 16-year study of more than 13,000
people conducted by Dr. Thomas Truelson and his colleagues at the
Institute of Preventive Medicine in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Acoording to the study, those who said they drank between one
and six glasses of wine a week had a 34 percent lower risk of
stroke than those who said they never drank wine or hardly ever
drank it.
</P>
<P>
Daily wine drinkers had a 32 percent lower risk, while those
who drank beer or spirits showed no significantly lower risk.
</P>
<P>
Wine, especially red wine, contains healthy plant compounds
like tannins, flavonoids and polyphenols, which can act as
antioxidants and help stop fat from sticking to artery walls and
clogging them up.
</P>
<P>
The American Heart Association, however, stressed that
excessive drinking of wine can cause heart disease and
cancer.

intricate drug-dealing network led by a jailed dealer in Florida
State of the United States, police sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The charges follow a secret investigation launched a year ago
involving local, state and federal agencies. The probe found that
officers allegedly looked the other way or actively took part as
marijuana, cocaine and other contraband was smuggled into jails
for inmates in exchange for cash, jewelry, car repairs and
sporting equipment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office unsealed an indictment Friday
charging 26 people, including Eduardo Manzano, the alleged leader
of a jailhouse cocaine and marijuana distribution organization.
Manzano made payments to corrections officers at the detention
center and at the correctional center to gain access to phones,
drugs, food and clothing, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
The state attorney's office arrested and charged 17 more
people, who will be indicted during the next few weeks, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> WB Cautions India on Failure to Achieve Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has made
a depressing forecast for India, warning that failure to achieve
its stipulated growth target of over 6 percent for the current
year would represent one of the biggest challenges for the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In its ninth annual report on the world economy, the World Bank
says that "policy drift" and weak industrial performance have
slowed India's economy. Besides, depressed export markets in East
Asia and Japan are a blow, since they had come to account for a
significant share of India's exports.
</P>
<P>
Competition from East Asia in other markets will slow the
growth of exports, especially from India and Pakistan, it says.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report complains about the lack of any "concrete
proposal" in India's budget for 1998-99 for further substantial
reductions in the public sector deficit.
</P>
<P>
"If growth targets of over 6 percent do not materialize, the
total public sector deficit could well persist at more than 9
percent of the GDP, representing one of the biggest challenges for
the Indian economy," it warns.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City remained in
phase one of environment emergency for the second day in a row,
because of serious air pollution, the city's Environment
Secretariat told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City's Metropolitan Air Quality Index (Imeca) for ozone
content has passed the 200-point level, according to the
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican capital authorities said the main reason for the
pollution is that, with little wind, contaminant substances in the
air cannot disperse. On Friday afternoon, the ozone level in the
air reached 218 points.
</P>
<P>
Because of the phase one emergency, 50 percent of the almost 3
million motor vehicles in the city have been kept off the road,
according to the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, phase one was enforced in May when the Imeca
for ozone surpasses 240 points, as occurred Thursday when it
reached 262.
</P>
<P>
The measure is suspended after the ozone contamination level
drops under 180 points. Phase two is decreed when it surpasses 350.
</P>
<P>
During Phase two environmental emergency, not only motor
vehicles are affected, 20 percent of the gas stations in the city
and factories with pollutant emissions will be closed, and outdoor
school and other cultural and sports activities cancelled.

WELLINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The value of construction
activity within New Zealand fell in the third quarter this year,
according to New Zealand's Deputy Government Statistician Ian

</P>
<P>
In a media release issued here Saturday, he said it is

"The total value of construction work has fallen steadily since
the September quarter last year, in line with the decline
recorded in building consents issued over that time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ewing said the majority of the decline in construction activity
was recorded in residential construction, with work put in place

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Statistics New Zealand has
revised
the country's trade deficit for the year to June 1998 from 841
million NZ
dollars (445.7 million U.S. dollars) to 599 million NZ dollars
(317.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued Saturday, Government Statistician Len
Cook
said the revisions are largely due to late export entries received
by the
New Zealand Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports for the year to June 1998 has been revised

upwards from 21,748 million NZ dollars (11,526 million U.S.
dollars) to
21,990 million NZ dollars (11,655 million NZ dollars). The revised
figure
recorded a 4.5 percent increase when compared to the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
These revisions have resulted in an improvement to the balance
of
trade for the year to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
A joint education campaign undertaken by Statistics New Zealand
and
the New Zealand Customs Service has stimulated exporters holding
on to
export entries to send them in to Customs in order to improve the
timeliness of export documentation, Cook said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- About 3.3 million or 18 percent
of Sri Lankans live in deprivation, below the poverty line,
reveals the latest human development report on Sri Lanka prepared
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) this week.
</P>
<P>
Harsha Athurupana, head of the six-member national research
team, states the deprivation is experienced most acutely in areas
such as energy infrastructure, sanitation, safe water and access
to a good road network.
</P>
<P>
"There are also important deficiencies in the provision of
basic health care and significant regional disparities that need
correction," he adds.
</P>
<P>
According to the report the district with the highest level of
poverty in the country is Nuwara Eliya, with a recorded 31 percent
of the population living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Gampaha ranks lowest in the index with only 12 percent living
in poverty and the capital Colombo second lowest, with 13 percent
of the population living in poverty, according to Dr. Athurupana.
</P>
<P>
He says, "It is only in districts like Colombo and Gampaha that
the cover of electricity is reasonably good with 77 percent and 66
percent of coverage respectively. Such a lack of infrastructure
facilities, especially electricity, completely wipes out any
potential for development in the country."
</P>
<P>
The report recommends a strong physical infrastructure
development program for which a government policy on an urban
development program is cited as a "rational strategy."
</P>
<P>
The report further recommends priority investment and policy
attention in the poverty stricken districts.

BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The high variety of dung
beetles in Thailand is expected to bring the country big benefits
in the future, The Bangkok Post Saturday quoted researchers as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and fifty species of dung beetles have been found
in the northeastern region of Thailand by two Thai experts.
</P>
<P>
Seven dung beetle species found in the region are new ones in
the world, said Yupha Harnboonsong, one of the two experts, who
conducted a year of research in 19 provinces of the region.
</P>
<P>
The beetles, feeding on cattle waste as well as other wild
animal excrement such as that of elephants and pheasants, play an
important role in getting rid of waste.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is looking forward to exporting the beetles to New
Zealand, which must import dung beetles from Australia and African
countries to solve its problem of an abundance of livestock
excrement.

KIEV, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian ex-prime minister Pavlo
Lazarenko has been arrested in Switzerland for alleged money-
laundering during his term of office, Ukrainian embassy in
Switzerland confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investigation against him opened in Switzerland as early as in
March, and his bank accounts in Geneva have been frozen, said the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, an opposition deputy in parliament, appeared before
a Swiss judge for four hours, following his arrest in Basle on
Wednesday. He was also charged with carrying a Panamanian passport.
</P>
<P>
Two envoys of Lazarenko's opposition center-left Hromada party
were reportedly sent to seek to "clarification" of the matter and
make sure that the enquiries were conducted impartially.
</P>
<P>
If Lazarenko's Panamanian passport bears his name, he will be
indicted as violating Ukrainian law, which does not permit its
nationals to have double nationality.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko was prime minister from May 1996 to July 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues Fuel Pump Alert on Airbus Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday ordered the inspection and
repair of fuel pumps on some Airbus aircraft, one day after
issuing an order on Boeing 747 fuel pumps.
</P>
<P>
The FAA asked for inspection and repair of center fuel tank
pumps on the Airbus A300 because of fears they could ignite fuel
fumes.
</P>
<P>
FAA's action follows action last week by the French
airworthiness authority Direction General de l'Aviation Civile
(DGAC).
</P>
<P>
The FAA said in a statement that there were 67 of the
twin-engine wide-body A300-600 series aircraft in operation with
U.S. carriers that included American Airlines and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
Fuel tank ignition sources have received great attention by the
FAA since the 1996 crash of an Boeing 747 into the ocean off New
York that killed all 230 people on board when its central fuel
tank exploded. The exact cause of that blast has not been
identified.
</P>
<P>
The FAA ordered airlines flying Boeing 747s on Thursday to
change the way they manage fuel to prevent dry running of pumps
while a newly discovered problem with pump bearings was resolved.
</P>
<P>
The FAA asked operators to leave enough fuel in the center tank
of all 747 models and cease using the horizontal stabilizer tank
in the rear of the 747-400 to prevent pumps overheating while the
premature wear of bearings was probed.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is a consortium made up of Dasa, which is a unit of
DaimlerChrysler AG, British Aerospace Plc, state-owned
Aerospatiale of France and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA

The collegiate bench reviewed Cheung's criminal responsibility
and ruled that Cheung planned, purchased and directed criminal
acts involving illegal trading in explosives and was therefore a
principal defendant.
</P>
<P>
Members of the bench also noted the large volume of illegal
explosives involved in the case seriously threatened public
security and ruled that Cheung should be subject to full
punishment for all the crimes he organized and directed according
to law.
</P>
<P>
Members also ruled that Cheung's confession admitting to
initiating kidnapings and funding the purchase of items necessary
to perpetrate the crimes, thus playing a role of organizer and
director, and grabbing a huge sum of shares of ransoms provided
ample evidence to support the conviction.
</P>
<P>
The collegiate bench added that Cheung and his accomplices also
committed a crime by smuggling arms and ammunition into Hong Kong,
which seriously jeopardized public security in the special
administrative region.
</P>
<P>
With regards to Cheung's assertion that he voluntarily provided
inland law enforcement departments with information on crimes Hong
Kong residents committed in the region, the collegiate bench
announced that public security departments failed to yield hard
evidence confirming the claim, thus the meritorious service as the
reason for appeal is not constituted.

SOFIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Workers, laid off as a result of
the economic structural reform, will receive one-time grant aid
worth 1 million leva to open their own business, the cabinet
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision replaced an earlier provision, under which this
amount was meant as a loan.
</P>
<P>
However, if the grantees disburse the aid for other purposes,
they will have to repay it, with no interest charged, said Social
Minister Ivan Neikov.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers will be entitled to the grant after the new
ordinance comes into force. They should apply for the grant within
three months after their employer lays them off.
</P>
<P>
The funds are expected to come from the national budget after
jobless workers sign a contract with an employment office.
</P>
<P>
Neikov said he expects that more than 30 percent of the workers
entitled to the fund will set up joint businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday decision was adopted following broad discussions
and consultations with the social partners and the banking
circles, Neikov said.
</P>
<P>
The idea is that laid-off workers receive the grant promptly
and encounter the minimum possible bureaucratic hindrance.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Pakistan Agree to Settle F-16 Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Pakistan have agreed to settle their dispute over an aborted sale
of U.S. F-16 fighters to Pakistan, a U.S.-Pakistan joint statement
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, issued by the White House, reported on the
meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Sharif "emphasized the need for a
fair and early resolution of the F-16 issue," and Clinton
"reaffirmed his commitment to such a resolution."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan paid 658 million U.S. dollars for the purchase of 28
F-16 fighters in the 1980s, but has never received the aircraft
because of U.S. sanctions imposed in 1990 for Pakistani nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting at the White House, President Clinton
briefed Prime Minister Sharif on what he called U.S. efforts to
compensate for the aborted purchase.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the United States has already paid 157
million dollars back to Islamabad, raising the money by selling
aircraft components to other countries.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand on Tuesday agreed to pay some 105 million dollars
over 10 years to lease the fighters, providing additional funds
that could be used to give Pakistan some of its money back.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said they were still waiting for official
notification of the New Zealand's offer.
</P>
<P>
They said the United States had given Pakistan its ideas on how
to resolve the issue of the aborted war plane sale and Pakistan
was evaluating them.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement also said Sharif reiterated his invitation
to Clinton to visit Pakistan. Clinton said he hoped it would be
possible to visit Pakistan next year. Clinton had planned to
visit India and Pakistan this year, but the planned trip was
canceled because of the two countries' tit-for-tat nuclear test
explosions in May.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gang Leader Executed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cheung Tze-keung, leader of a
36-member gang which committed a series of felonies in inland
China and Hong Kong, was executed today in Guangzhou in line with
a last instance verdict issued by the Higher People's Court of
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and Chin Hon-sau, members
of Cheung's gang, were also executed in line with court verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Cheung and his accomplices were charged with a number of crimes
ranging from illegally buying and selling and transporting
explosives, guns and ammunition to smuggling firearms and
ammunition, kidnaping, robbery and concealing stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, the capital of
Guangdong, announced the first instance verdict in Cheung's case
on November 12. The court sentenced the five coconspirators to
death, with the permanent deprivation of political rights. Chu
Yuk-sing and Li Wan were sentenced to death with a two-year
suspension, and the remaining 29 defendants received prison terms
up to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Cheung and 28 defendants appealed the first instance verdict
with the Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province and requested
lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
The five-member collegiate bench formed to review the case
examined all related files, questioned the 29 appellants and seven
first instance defendants in the case, heard arguments by defense
lawyers and carefully scrutinized all criminal facts and laws
applicable to first instance verdict.

<TEXT>
<P>
The in-depth review verified the clarity of all facts in the
case and the collegiate bench decided not to hold a hearing in
accordance with Article 187 of China's Criminal Procedures Law.
</P>
<P>
The Higher People's Court reaffirmed the first instance
verdicts the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court rendered in the
case involving Cheung and four major accomplices. The Higher
People's Court also rendered the final instance verdict approving
death sentences for the five coconspirators in line with
authorizations from the Supreme People's Court in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences were carried out shortly after announcement
of the final instance verdict.
</P>
<P>
Cheung and his defense lawyer cited three major issues
supporting the appeal -- the question of jurisdiction in the case,
the affirmation of Cheung's criminal responsibility, and the
defendant's meritorious cooperation during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, the collegiate bench ruled that all the reasons for
appeal were groundless.
</P>
<P>
The collegiate bench noted that some defendants in the case
were Hong Kong residents and some reside in the inland, but went
on to explain that a number of crimes, including smuggling arms
and ammunition, illegally buying and selling explosives, and
robbery, were all committed in inland areas. The defendants also
used inland bases to plot, plan and prepare for crimes later
committed in Hong Kong, including kidnaping and gold store
robberies.
</P>
<P>
The collegiate bench verified the jurisdiction of inland courts
in accordance with relevant stipulations in China's Criminal Law
and Criminal Procedures Law.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Demands UNITA Set Free U.N. Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday evening demanded that Angola's rebel UNITA
immediately release 14 U.N. peacekeepers from two towns where
fighting has intensified.
</P>
<P>
The demand came at the end of an emergent closed-door meeting
held late on Friday by the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands that UNITA permit the immediate
and unconditional departure of MONUA (the U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola) personnel from Andulo and Bailundo," the council said in a
press statement after closed-door consultations. UNITA is the
short form for the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for the month of
December, Jassim Mohammed Buallay of Bahrain, said the council
held UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi "personally responsible for their
safety."
</P>
<P>
Ten of the soldiers are from India, all of them in Andulo.
Others are from Senegal, Sweden and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government forces bombed the Andulo area at midday
on Friday (local time), giving rise to fears the peacekeepers, who
are almost hostages, would be endangered.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council deplores the deterioration of the
situation in Angola and urges there be no further hostilities,"
the council president said, adding that UNITA was primarily
responsible for an impasse in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The emergent council meeting was partially prompted by a letter
from Savimbi, who said that he felt "that the presence of MONUA in
Andulo and Bailundo is important before and during the full
implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol," a
peace accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is
on a North Africa visit, issued a statement via his spokesman's
office here, saying that the United Nations had decided to
relocate the peacekeepers a month ago.
</P>
<P>
But the leadership of UNITA "under various pretexts," had
refused to provide clearance for U.N. planes to land to evacuate
the U.N. personnel, Annan said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Of late, Annan said in his report to the Security Council that
peace agreements, including the Lusaka Protocol, have not been
well honored.
</P>
<P>
MONUA, which currently groups 1,016 observers, has been in
Angola since June 30, 1997 to help implement the Lusaka Protocol
designed to end nearly two decades of civil war between the
Angolan Government and UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Central American Leaders to Ask U.S. to Extend Work Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Central American
presidents will urge the United States for an 18-month extension
of the work permit for illegal immigrants from the region,
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Central American countries will travel next week
to Washington to attend the opening of the Consultative Group
called by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to obtain
donations for the reconstruction of the countries ravaged by
hurricane Mitch in November.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will take advantage of the meeting to visit
U.S. congressmen and other political leaders to advocate for the
immigrants, whose money remittances mean a big resource for
Central American economies.
</P>
<P>
If the United States agrees to extend the temporary permits,
"we would have time to lobby for definitive status," and in those
18 months "we would have to direct our efforts to the Congress...
to create conscience in the U.S. public sector," Calderon Sol said.
</P>
<P>
Following the disasters caused by hurricane Mitch, the U.S.
authorities announced a suspension of deporting Central Americans
who had not obtained migratory status, but deportation could be
resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Calderon Sol said that his colleagues have planned "a joint
strategy" to help the immigrants obtain a migratory status.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's King Calls For Unity in Face of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej
called on the Thai people to be united in overcoming the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The King gave this message to the Thais on the eve of his
birthday Friday in a speech on one of the toughest years in the
country's history.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing happiness or prosperity to a nation is not the work
of one group. We need to cooperate, using specific skills or
knowledge that one has," the king said in remarks published by
Saturday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"People who have the same skills or knowledge need to work
together, and when they disagree on anything, they should discuss
their conflicts rather than quarrel," the king said.
</P>
<P>
He said quarreling is dictated by emotions while discussion
requires wisdom. Only when people use their wisdom will they be
able to find out solutions to their problems.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying his advice about "self-sufficiency" which he gave
when the financial crisis broke out last year, the king explained
that he had not called for a "cave age" style of living.
</P>
<P>
He said people misinterpreted his statement that it would be
satisfactory if just one-fourth of the self-sufficiency ideology
can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"I was not calling for implementation of a self-sufficient
economy in one-fourth of Thailand's total area. I need to bring
this up because even academics did not quite get it. Maybe I was
not that clear the last time, but from what I wrote it was quite
obvious that I was referring to action, not land space," the
monarch said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to do it in its totality, for that would mean
going back to the stone age, the time when people lived in caves.
</P>
<P>
"People in those days needed to rely on themselves because
other tribes were all enemies. They fought and never cooperated,
so each group needed self-sufficiency," the king said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we see that we can rely on just around 25 percent of
ourselves. We can see the fruits of what we do are mostly traded
with other necessities. That is why I came up with the one-fourth
figure," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king's address took place against the background of
political storms surrounding the government, whose latest
legislative package to revitalize the economy has stirred up
considerable xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand still has gold, but some types of gold have been
overlooked, and foreigners pack what we discard. We are a happy
country without foreigners coming to dig (gold) and even if they
do come, they will dig for us as well," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Small, Medium Enterprises Get Support Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai industry and finance
ministries approved a 40-billion-baht (1.1 billion U.S. dollars)
fund to assist small and medium-sized enterprises next year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Industry Ministry confirmed Saturday that
the fund will come from six state-owned financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The fund is in line with the government's policy to promote
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) so that they will become the
engine of an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The industry and finance ministries also agreed to improve the
efficiency of the Small Industrial Finance Corporation and the
Small Industrial Credit Management Corporation, hoping the two
could be upgraded into state enterprises in the future.
</P>
<P>
SMEs, which do not have non-performing loans (NPLs) or which
are in need of re-financing, would be given first priority in
getting loans from the six state-owned financial houses.
</P>
<P>
For SMEs which have NPLs, the industries could also apply for
loans but they would have to first restructure their debts with
their creditors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 billion baht fund, 2 billion baht (55.6 million
dollars) are from the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand;
3 billion (83.3 million dollars) from the Small Industrial Finance
Corporation; 2 billion (55.6 million baht) from the Bank of
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives; 1 billion (27.8 million
dollars) from the Government Savings Bank; 5 billion (138.9
million dollars) from the Exim Bank; and the rest from the Bank of
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Beef Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil exported 287,000
tons of beef in the first 10 months of this year and received an
income of 466 million U.S. dollars, representing 26 percent and 33
percent increases respectively over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Jornal de Comercio, quoting the Beef Exporting
Industries Association of Brazil (ABIEC), attributed Brazil's beef
export boom to the price increases of other beef exporting
countries, like Argentina and Uruguay, which sharpened the
Brazilian product's competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
ABIEC foresaw a noticeable increase in Brazil's beef exports
for the year, although there could be a slight drop in the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
The European Union received 64 percent of Brazil's beef
exports, followed by the United States with 16 percent and the
Middle East with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The association listed Brazil as one of the world's five top
beef exporters.

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The freezing cold of winter
here has not dampened foreign students' enthusiasm for learning
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday evening, 300 students from 50 countries took part in
a performance featuring Chinese language artistic programs and
singing and dancing from their native countries, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The performance, organized by the Ministry of Education and
Beijing municipal government in the Century Theater, attracted
officials from the ministries of education, culture and foreign
affairs, 200 foreign diplomats from 78 embassies and 1,200
foreigners studying in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Foreign students have seized opportunities like this in the
past few years to practise their Chinese-language skills, sources
from the Ministry of Education said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's Department for International
Co-operation and Exchanges, China has received 258,000 foreign
students since the reform and opening-up polices were introduced
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The number is increasing at an average of 30 percent a year,
despite the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry's latest statistics indicate that last year,
43,712 students from 160 countries were studying in 335 colleges
and universities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 76.87 percent of the students came from Asia, 9.85 percent

COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan security forces
launched a fresh operation code named Rivi Bala (Sun Force) on
Wednesday with the objective of linking up three key northern
towns, said a Defense Ministry release issued Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The operation Rivi Bala, aiming to capture Oddusudan and annex
the areas covering Mankulam, Nedunkerni and Oddusudan, started
after the completion of operation Jayasikuru (Sure Victory) which
consisted of three phases involving the capture of Omanthai,
Puliyankulam and Mankulam.
</P>
<P>
The two divisions participating in this offensive captured
Oddusudan and brought an area of 134 square kilometers under their
control, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels fired mortars at the troops, injuring one officer
and three soldiers, said the release, adding that the security
forces expect more Tamil rebel casualties but exact figures were
not immediately available.

<P>
Approximately 500 civilians crossed over to the controlled
area, the release added.

PLAGUE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Czech central bank announced
Friday a one-percentage-point cut in the two-week commercial loan
interest rate, from 11.5 to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh reduction of this key loan rate within a

</P>
<P>
In order to reverse the over-tight money market and decline of
production and exports, the central bank has adopted a series of
measures to ease the money market. As a result, the discount rate
has been reduced to 10 percent and the interbank short-term loan
rate lowered to 15 percent.
</P>

The State Bank Governor Joset Tosovsky revealed earlier that in
order to stimulate economic growth, the central bank would further
ease the money market and further reduce interest rate at an

WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Police are investigating
the accusations that the father of U.S. Olympic gymnastic
champion Dominuque Moceanu was involved in a pssible
murder-for-hire plot, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The case has been re-evaluated and it is now considered an
open case," police spokesman Robert Hurst said in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu, 17, who was a member of the U.S. gymnast winning
team, said police officers informed her that her father had
negotiated to pay a hit man $10,000 to kill her friend and her
coach.
</P>
<P>
The alleged plot is the latest installment in the broken
relationship between the gymnast and her parents, whom she
believes squandered her trust fund earnings in risky investments.
</P>
<P>
A judge declared Moceanu a legal adult in October so she could
begin taking stock of how her earnings were spent.
</P>
<P>
A hearing next Wednesday will determine whether the
restraining orders should be made permanent.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Governor Backs Shooting of Street Thugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- As Jakarta's crime rate
continues to soar, Governor Sutiyoso has given support to the
decision of police to "shoot to immobilize" in their campaign to
quell civil disobedience, the Indonesian Observer reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"That's the right action. I support such stern action in
immobilizing robbers because the city's crime rate has now gone
beyond the limit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor admitted that Jakarta's international image has
been severely tarnished by the recent spate of car-jacking and
toll road robberies, especially because many of the victims have
been foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we're living in the middle of a jungle because
so many people have very boldly defied the law. We must not let
this sort of condition continue indefinitely. Therefore, we have
to stop the criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Edward Aritonang
told reporters that from November 25 to December 2, police shot
five alleged criminals, three of whom perished, and arrested
nearly 70 others for their involvement in street crimes.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of areas in the city regarded as "hot spots"
for crime has soared. In July there were only 31 hot spots. But
the number rose to 50 in September and now stands at 60, with many
of the danger areas at toll roads.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Jakarta legislative assembly have expressed
grave concern over the increasing number of unsafe places in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Head of the military faction in the assembly Sumekar K.W. said
the number of police in Jakarta must be increased, or failing
that, civilian guards should assist with security measures.

<HEADLINE> Census Helpful to Policy Making for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) official said that China's First
National Agricultural Census, to be completed in 1999, will help
the country draw policies for its agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
"The information will provide a sound base for the planning and
development of this key sector of the economy and thus contribute
to alimentary security and stability for China's population as
well as for the world," today's China Daily quoted Hartwig Haen,
FAO's assistant director-general, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-long census, the largest and most complex of its
kind the world has ever witnessed, and co-organized by China, FAO,
and Italy, released a first set of results Friday from
computerized data processing.
</P>
<P>
The first manually tabulated results of the agricultural census
showed that 561 million people are economically active in rural
areas and of those, 424 million are involved in agriculture.
These numbers differ from former statistics, which spoke of 453
million people working in the rural sector.
</P>
<P>
Another important revelation from the census is that the
cropped area is greater than expected, despite the ongoing loss
of arable land to industrial development and the building of
infrastructure, roads, airports and housing.
</P>
<P>
"Final data from the census will shed light on the use of
fertilizers. The data will also indicate whether China has reached
its productive potential in terms of food development," said Haen.
</P>
<P>
The census collected information on land use, crop areas,
livestock, agricultural employment and other related issues. Over
200 million rural households were visited and interviewed by more
than 7 million census representatives, all in only a few weeks in
last January.
</P>
<P>
"China's agricultural statistics system will be further
improved with the completion of the first agricultural census,"
said Liu Hong, director-general of the National Bureau of
Statistics.

<HEADLINE> Commission to be Created to Demark Peru-Ecuador Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori Friday announced that a joint commission will soon be
established for placing markers along the country's border with
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The joint demarcation commission, to be set up on December 11
in Tumes, north Peru, will be made up of the delegations appointed
by the Peruvian and Ecuadoran governments, said Fujimori in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said last Monday that the demarcation process on the
Peruvian-Ecuadoran common border would be carried out in three
stages -- agreement on where to put the border markers by the two
countries, removal of land mines around the marker sites and the
actual placement of markers.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty in Brasilia in October
to end a dispute over a 78-kilometer section of their border in
the Andean foothils in the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the disputed section of the border will
follow the heights of teh Cordillera del Condor ountain range, as
Peru had claimed.
</P>
<P>
But a one-square-kilometer hilly area within Peru's territory
called Tiwintza will be granted to Ecuador as private property,
with Peru maintaing sovereignty over it.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the
disputed region. Peace talks over the dispute began in 1995.

PRAGUE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Slovak former prime minister
Vladimir Meciar Friday announced exit from the political arena.
</P>
<P>
Meciar said in a statement that he has no intention to run for

</P>
<P>
The announcement came two months after Meciar's Movement for
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the then ruling party, lost its
parliamentary majority in the general election.
</P>
<P>
In the September election, the second after Slovakia's
independence in 1993, Meciar's HZDS won only 57 seats in the
150-seat parliament, 19 short of a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
Meciar, 56, entered the national political field in 1990. He
served as minister, legislator, and as prime minister for three
times in the past eight years.

BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- More than a decade ago,
scientific circles in developed counties were hesitant to
co-operate with their Chinese counterparts because of China's
relatively backward technology.
</P>
<P>
Today developed countries and international organizations are
actively expanding collaboration with China thanks to its rapid

A Sino-European project for modernized flood monotoring
systems, which started in 1991 along the Fuchunjiang River in
Zhejiang province, has played a significant role in flood
forecasts and helped save about one billion yuan, said Wang
Shaoqi, director of the ministry's department for international
co-operation, at a conference yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to mark the 20th anniversary of China's
scientific and technological reforms and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department for Basic Science Research, the
State will invest two billion yuan to gain technological
breakthroughs in fields such as large scale scientific calculation
and genetic engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will reinforce theoretical research to help
develop the agriculture, energy, information science, natural
resources, environment, and population and health sectors, said
its Secretary-General Lin Quan.

"When China began to implement its reform and opening-up
policies in 1978, rural and social development plans focused

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The average price of
Venezuelan crude oil closed the week at 8.05 U.S. dollars per
barrel, down by 0.69 dollars from the previous week, the Energy
and Mines Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for November dropped to the lowest in the
last 12 years at 7.93 dollars per barrel, with the year's average
so far to 10.89 dollars, far from the 15.50 dollars figured out by
the government and from the 16.32 dollars registered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official spokesmen attributed the oil market weakness to
oversupply and the enormous inventories kept by main consumers.
</P>
<P>
Oil represents 70 percent of Venezuela's exports and provides
over 50 percent of the revenue for the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela had foreseen an oil income of 19 billion dollars in
1998, but it finally settled at 12 billion dollars, 7 billion less
than expected.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the Venezuelan treasury would lose
some 1.2 billion dollars a year for every one-dollar drop in the
oil price.

SHANGHAI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Shanghai,
China's leading industrial city, have handled 226 smuggling cases

</P>
<P>
China launched a nationwide anti-smuggling campaign in July

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General Summons Former President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi Ghalib Friday said he had already sent a summons to former
president Soeharto for questioning about the corrupt, collusive
and nepotistic practices he is believed to have engaged in while
in power.
</P>
<P>
"I send the summons directly to Cendana (the home of the former
president) this afternoon," he was quoted by national newspapers
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although Ghalib did not specify the exact date of the summons,
the Criminal Code states that a summons must be issued three days
prior to the designated day.
</P>
<P>
Thus if the letter issued on December 4, the former president
would be required to attend Attorney General's Office on Monday
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie on Thursday ordered Ghalib to speed up
the investigation into Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth,
dropping plans to set up an independent team to probe the former
president's wealth.
</P>
<P>
The president also issued a decree empowering Ghalib to act
more decisively.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib said he has appointed Antonius Sujata, junior attorney
for special crime cases, as head of the questioning team.
</P>
<P>
He said the team is also set to summon former ministers and
other high-ranking officials in a bid to find evidence of corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices during Soeharto's 32 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he had enough evidence to place Soeharto
under house arrest, Ghalib said: "We must be very careful. It's a
big and interesting affairs."
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung Friday told reporters
that Ghalib could put Soeharto under house arrest if it was deemed
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The move drew a swift response from Soeharto, who said that he
was ready to face any probe into his wealth as well as allegations
of corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
In the first public comments by Soeharto since students stepped
up their pressure on the government to open the inquiry into his
alleged wealth a few months ago, Soeharto said he was not above
the law.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a challenge. I realize that as an Indonesian
citizen, I cannot free myself from my legal obligations. But every
one should know that this is a state based on law, and every
citizen is entitled to legal protections," Soeharto said Friday
when receiving A. Adirsyah from Majalah Dharmais, a magazine run
by one of the foundations previously chaired by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto disclosed that he had 22 billion rupiah (3 million
U.S. dollars) deposited in three banks, not 72 billion rupiah as
the government had earlier claimed, and that his personal property
includes two houses in Jakarta and five hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
He said the money was saved from his salaries and pensions from
his time in the Armed Forces and his 32 years as president, as
well as his official travel allowances, dollar-denominated rentals
of two houses in Jakarta plus the interest earned on these bank
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto reiterated that he has no money stashed overseas.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Digital Handset Sales Surpass Analog Handset Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELESES, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Digital handset sales in
the United States through the first three quarters this year
exceeded analog handset sales, representing a major transition in
this market.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Friday by the California-based
market analysis firm Dataquest, U.S. digital handset sales totaled
10.1 million units during the period, as against 7.9 million
analog handsets.
</P>
<P>
This market's transition to second-generation digital phones took
place after they were first introduced in the United States six years
ago, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
Digital phones use a digital transmission technology, which
converts sound into digital at the handset. Analog phones use the
traditional technology that converts air vibrations into an
analogous electrical frequency.
</P>
<P>
Much of the digital handset market expansion is due to the
growth of the time division multiple access (TDMA) market, a
satellite and cellular phone technology that interleaves multiple
digital signals onto a single high-speed channel.
</P>
<P>
Nokia and Motorola are the two biggest players in the U.S.
digital handset market, according to Dataquest.

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has begun his search for
a new assistant following Brian Kidd's appointment to the top job
at Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
Kidd's departure has led to the sort of speculation normally
reserved for manager's jobs at other clubs, and some of the names
mentioned are already in charge elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield United boss Steve Bruce and Hibernian manager Alex
McLeish are among names being touted.
</P>
<P>
Former United star Brian McClair, and recently sacked Wolves
manager Mark McGhee are also supposed to be in the running.
</P>
<P>
Reserve team coach Jim Ryan has stepped into the void - at
least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson had no hesitation in turning to him: "I will take Jim
Ryan with me tomorrow. Jim's a very experienced man and he knows
the club," Ferguson said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Beef up Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- World football's governing body
FIFA admitted Friday there is a growing drug problem in soccer
and agreed in principle to introduce random tests.
</P>
<P>
But the executive committee continued to defy attempts by the
International Olympic Committee to harmonise doping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Michel D'Hooghe, chairman of FIFA's committee for sports
medicine, told the meeting in Zurich of his serious concern about
a growing trend for drug abuse in football.
</P>
<P>
Italian soccer, in particular, has been rocked by doping
controversies this year. Magistrates launched an investigation
into alleged widespread doping in Serie A after allegations by
Roma coach Zdenek Zeman.
</P>
<P>
The committee backed D'Hooghe's call for random
out-of-competition testing but didn't decide when or how. "It's
going to have to be done together with the national
associations," said FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
</P>
<P>
FIFA again expressed reservations about the IOC's proposal for
minimum two-year suspensions for athletes found guilty of using
steroids or other serious drugs, with a life ban for a second
offence.
</P>
<P>
FIFA instead called for "flexibility regarding sanctions for
doping offenders."
</P>
<P>
FIFA was one of three federations - the others were those
representing tennis and cycling - which dissented on the
anti-doping resolutions adopted last Friday at a meeting of the
IOC and 35 Olympic sports bodies.
</P>
<P>
It objected to the two-year sanction on grounds that the
penalty might not stand up in court, and because certain
prohibited drugs have no performance-enhancing benefits in sports
like soccer.
</P>
<P>
But it has now said a panel of experts should be appointed to
keep up to date with rapid developments in the pharmaceutical
industry, and Blatter said FIFA's list of banned substances would
need to be updated monthly to keep up.

<HEADLINE> Turner Sports Want to Stage Winter Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The first Winter Goodwill
Games is likely to be staged on 2000, U.S. Turner Sports
president Harvey Schiller said today.
</P>
<P>
Four summer Goodwill Games have been held, the winter edition
of the international sports event will be the first version of
the Olympic styled festival. It is mostly likely to be hosted in
Lake Placid, New York.
</P>
<P>
"There probably will be some extreme events included,"
Schiller said. "Maybe some of the bobsled or luge teams will go
down the track backwards."
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill schedule is likely to inclue events such like ice
climbing, snow bicycling and super-modified shovel racing. These
are not Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
Other sports on the program include alpine skiing, figure
skating, speedskating, bobsled, luge and at least one
cross-country ski event, according to Schiller.
</P>
<P>
Schiller said the Games probably would last 6-7 days. Lake
Placid, host city of Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980, was the
probable site.
</P>
<P>
Schiller said the final decision would be made soon.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games were the brainchild of Ted Turner, first
held in Moscow in 1986 after two straight Olympic boycotts.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games lost millions of dollars for Turner and
parent company Time Warner, but drew respectable cable TV
audiences last summer.

<HEADLINE> China Closing Heavy Polluters in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government, after
having shut down more than 150 paper mills and tanneries, has
decided to close about 50 cement plants to protect the environment
of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the world's largest water-control
project.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will cause a seasonal rise in water
levels of the Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing in a 660 kilometer
stretch.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chongqing Environmental Protection Bureau, the
cement plants have caused serious air pollution and water quality
problems in the Yangtze and Wujiang rivers in the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The move shows the municipal government's determination to
protect the environment of the Three Gorges Project. Since more
than 80 percent of the Reservoir lies within the Chongqing area,
the municipal government will close any enterprises causing
pollution in the area without hesitation, according to an official
at Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Opens Door to 2002 World Cup Games in DPR Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- If South Korea wants to stage
some of its 2002 World Cup matches in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, FIFA would support the plan, world soccer's
governing body said in Zurich on Friday.
</P>
<P>
While FIFA statutes do not allow a third party to participate
in the World Cup finals, which will be co-hosted by South Korea
and Japan in 2002, the FIFA executive voted on Friday to support
the idea of some games being played in the DPR Korea, if South
Korea asks and if DPR Korea wants to be part of the competition.
</P>
<P>
"We do not initiate but we are open to dialogue if the
political climate facilitates that," said Blatter, who plans to
visit DPR Korea next autumn.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee also continued to discuss rescheduling
the 2002 World Cup to avoid the Asian rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that after investigation he believes it is
possible to squeeze all 64 matches into the month of June,
starting the competition on the first and concluding on the 30th.
</P>
<P>
Blatter also confirmed that the controversial Confederations
Cup would begin in late July.
</P>
<P>
Dates for the first edition of a new World Club championship,
involving eight teams, was provisionally set for a nine day
period in January 2000 but will be co-ordinated with the
international competition calendar.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Foreign Minister to Attend NATO Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced Friday that he will attend the
Autumn Foreign Ministers meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in Brussels, December 8 to 9.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will include sessions of various NATO bodies
including the North Atlantic Council, the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council and
the NATO-Ukraine Commission.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council meeting will focus on preparations
for the April 1999 Washington Summit including the enlargement of
the Alliance to include Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, and
the revision of the 1991 Strategic Concept, which provides
guidance to the Alliance. NATO's ongoing involvement in Bosnia and
in international efforts to resolve the conflict in Kosovo will
also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believes that the revision of the Strategic Concept is
essential given the radical changes that have taken place in the
international security environment over the past seven years,"
said Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"NATO continues to play a crucial role in conflict prevention
and crisis management in the Euro-Atlantic area, as the Alliance's
response to the conflict in Kosovo has demonstrated," added the
Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Axworthy will address the vital question of the
security of the 2000 verifiers participating in the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe Kosovo Verification
Mission.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the revised Strategic Concept will be
endorsed by heads of state and government when they meet in April
1999.

<HEADLINE> Republican Governors Stress Tax Cuts, Other Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The impeachment debate
against President Bill Clinton is no excuse for paralysis on
issues such as tax cuts and better schools, say Republican
governors.
</P>
<P>
Seven Republicans governors met privately Friday with House
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, to discuss promotion of the Republican message on four
principles: lower taxes, improved public schools, better health
care and Social Security's future solvency, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
But the governors said afterwards that if the congressional
impeachment inquiry into the president's conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair drags on into next year, that message will have a
difficult time breaking through.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, chairman of the Republican
Governors Association, said it is in the national interest for
Congress to shift attention quickly to issues that affect
Americans more directly than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"This process should not be an excuse for paralysis," Keating
told reporters. "Let's resolve the facts and move on."
</P>
<P>
The governors are pushing for a greater role in setting the
national Republican agenda. Sixteen Republican governors were
re-elected last month, for a total of 31, and they preside over 70
percent of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Livingston said Republican congressional
leaders would consult more closely with their party's state chief
executives.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for common ground where they can help us and we
can help them," the incoming speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Keating said these governors would lead task forces on issues:
Virginia's Jim Gilmore, taxes; Tennessee's Don Sundquist, health
care; Ridge, education; and Rowland, tobacco. Others will be named
later.

<HEADLINE> White House Voices Concern at Rush to Impeachment Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Friday
it was alarmed that House Republicans were pressing for an
impeachment vote against President Bill Clinton based more on
politics than constitutional seriousness.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't something that can be pushed off and dealt with in
a political way," said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark a day after House Majority Whip Tom Delay
reported that a vast majority of House Republicans are now
committed to a floor vote on articles of impeachment, and will not
entertain until later, if at all, a resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the White House was "willing to listen to any
proposals" relating to a censure, or reprimand, of Clinton. Some
members of Congress have proposed combining a censure of Clinton
with a requirement that he pay a fine. Clinton would have to agree
to pay any fine.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue for members of Congress to discuss among
themselves and we will listen to any ideas that they want to put
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps the most serious thing Congress can do. This
isn't a process where the House of Representatives can throw it to
the Senate to let them deal with it," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been a "serious lack of the constitutional
solemnity" that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had
promised.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the committee's sudden decision to include
controversies about Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign into its
deliberations this week, then drop them again, showed Republicans
have been "chaotic and erratic and politically motivated" and
failed to meet the high standard Hyde set out for his committee.
</P>
<P>
Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston said the full House would
vote the week of December 14. He said a "vote this year would be
acceptable" if it is done in a fair way.
</P>
<P>
As the committee prepares to open its debate next week,
Clinton's attorneys planned to contact the committee Friday while
preparing to offer a defense of the president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee gave the White House a Friday night deadline for
naming its potential witnesses for next week, but said a final
decision on allowing them would rest with panel members.

<HEADLINE> Lower Body Temperature Lowers Stroke Death Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Abnormally high body
temperature within 24 hours of having a stroke may increase risk
for death; While reducing body temperature immediately after a
stroke can reduce the death rate from stroke, say two studies
carried in Friday's Stroke, Journal of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
Spanish researchers examining 260 patients with stroke found
the relationship between brain damage and high body temperature is
greater when the temperature increase occurs immediately after the
stroke.
</P>
<P>
In 57.6 percent with hyperthermia, or high body temperature,
infection was the culprit. The death rate was much greater in
people who had infectious hyperthermia (22 percent) than those
with non-infectious hyperthermia (7.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
In a German study reducing body temperature was the focus.
Scientists say that lowering body temperature by using cooling
blankets, cold infusions or cold washing may relieve pressure in
the brain after a stroke and can improve the patients' outcome.
</P>
<P>
Of the 25 patients in the study who suffered a severe stroke in
their middle cerebral artery and whose body temperatures were
lowered, 14 survived. On average the survivors' neurological
scores improved in the three months after the stroke. For those
who died, they says, the cause of death was due to increased
pressure in the brain during the rewarming process.

<HEADLINE> Ghali on New Role of Francophony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Francophony that had had
solely a cultural dimension acquired also political and economic
ones, said Francophony Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali
late Friday at his meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile.
</P>
<P>
The former U.N. secretary-general was now in Bucharest to attend
the 12th session of the Francophony's Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
Ghali pointed out the importance of the ongoing Francophony
Ministerial Conference, stressing that the Francophony that had
had solely a cultural dimension acquired also a political one.
</P>
<P>
He said it was open to cooperation with other world or regional
organizations, to the benefit of peace and democracy in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Francophony also has an economic dimension which, despite
the fact that it does not have specific institutionalized
instruments, promotes a spirit of solidarity between its members,"
Ghali said, adding that a conference on investment and
international trade would be held next year in Monaco by the
economy and finance ministers of the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile saluted the new role the Francophony considered it
had to promote in international relations. He added that Romania
was interested in the development and institutionalization of the
Francophony economic dimension, while many countries in the
region, members of the organization, were in a stage of economic
transition.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Francophony Ministerial Conference opened its 12th
session in Bucharest, with the participation of the personal
representatives of heads of state or government in the 52 member
states of the French-speaking world. It is the first opportunity
for Romania to host such a gathering since it received full
membership of the movement in Mauritius in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to Ghali, the session would debate "the main economic
and technical policies" of this international organization,
prepare the conference of the economic and finance ministers (due
in Monaco, April 14-15, 1999), the conference in Geneva (due on
March 20, 1999), and the 8th Francophony Summit (September 1999,
Moncton, Canada).

<HEADLINE> UK Insists Libyans Serve Jail in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom insisted on
Friday that the two Libyans who are accused of the 1988 Lockerbie
bombing must serve their jail terms in Scotland if they are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
"The key point on which we are insisting is that, if convicted,
the suspects would have to serve sentences in a Scottish prison,"
A Foreign Office spokesman said after Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
had a 15-minute telephone talks with The United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"If they wished, Libyans could even station diplomats in
Scotland with unrestricted access to the prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Cook agreed to stay in constant touch over the
weekend when Annan flies to Tripoli for talks with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi, said the the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Britain promised Libya unrestricted consular
access to the suspects if they were jailed in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two suspects who are accused by the United States
and Britain of blowing up a Pan-Am airliner over the Scottish town
of Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> France Says Momentum in Seeking End to DRCongo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Friday that despite a delay of a peace meeting by
belligerent countries in the war of the Democratic Republic of
Congo has been postponed, the momentum in seeking an end to the
conflict is not over.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the elan given in Paris should be lost like
this. One should simply expect errors, delays, complications, like
everywhere where one tries to make peace," he said in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes all the countries involved in the
conflict are now tired and want a ceasefire, although an in-depth
solution is more difficult to make.
</P>
<P>
A meeting to be joined by countries involved in the DRCongo
conflict formerly scheduled for next Tuesday in Lusaka, Zambia,
has been postponed until December 14 because of unexplained
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The seven countries involved in the conflict -- DRCongo,
Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia -- agreed last
week in Paris to stop acts of hostilities immediately and sign a
ceasefire agreement by mid-December.
