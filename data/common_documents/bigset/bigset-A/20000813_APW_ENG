<HEADLINE> Twins Catcher Tears Knee Ligament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Twins catcher Chad Moeller left
Saturday night's game against Toronto with a torn ligament in his
right knee and will be placed on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller tore his right meniscus and will undergo arthroscopic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Kelly said he didn't know exactly how the injury
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just crouched and something popped,'' Kelly said. ''It's
really unfortunate because the kid was doing a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moeller, called up from Triple-A Salt Lake City on June 20, was
hitting .216 with one home run and seven RBIs in 102 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller will be replaced by A.J. Pierzynski, who will be
recalled from Salt Lake City. Pierzynski was batting .335 with four
homers and 25 RBIs in 155 at-bats for the Buzz.

<HEADLINE> Browns Lose Ty Detmer for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Cleveland Browns quarterback Ty Detmer was lost
for the season Saturday night when he ruptured his right Achilles'
tendon while scrambling to avoid a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer, 32, the former Heisman Trophy winner at Brigham Young,
was entering his ninth season and had played well against
Philadelphia in the preseason opener. He was hurt on the third
scrimmage play of the second half against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been chewed up pretty good. We'll look at the emergency
list of quarterbacks,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ty is a true professional. It's not like someone in the
offensive line broke down. It looked like he was just trying to run
and change direction. ... We'll miss him, his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Detmer played four years with Green Bay, two with the Eagles and
one with the San Francisco before joining the Browns last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts anytime you lose a guy with nine years experience,''
Browns starting quarterback Tim Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns also have rookie Spergon Wynn on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer has completed 454 of 795 career passes for 5,445 yards
with 31 touchdowns during his career.

<HEADLINE> Chargers 31, Vikings 7  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Rookie Ronney Jenkins was a one-man highlight
show for the otherwise uninspiring San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins scored on his second 86-yard kickoff return in as many
games and powered his way for a 2-yard touchdown as the Chargers
scored the final 31 points to beat the Minnesota Vikings 31-7
Saturday night with virtually no contributions from the first-team
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leaf made his first competitive appearance in San Diego
since midway through his troubled rookie season of 1998, leading
the Chargers (2-0) on one scoring drive, although it was only a
5-yard drive thanks to Scott Turner's interception of a deflected
pass by Daunte Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jenkins, a free agent from Division I-AA Northern
Arizona, who was the star. His 86-yard return tied the game at 7
midway through the second quarter, just after Randy Moss had put
the Vikings (0-2) ahead with an over-the-shoulder, 24-yard
touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins took the kickoff at the 24 and started up the middle,
where he found a huge hole at about the 30. He evaded two tackles
and found clear running at the 50, then cut to the left sideline
and outran Don Morgan, holding the ball as if to say, ''Come get
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just read it and hit the hole,'' Jenkins said at halftime.
He also had an 86-yard TD return in San Diego's 23-20 win at San
Francisco a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins scored on a 2-yard run with 9:33 left in the game. He
finished with 69 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Rogers Beckett, the Chargers' second-round draft pick,
had an interception and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins got more yards on his touchdown return than the Chargers
did on offense in the first half. They had just 35 passing yards
and 0 rushing yards. They didn't get their first first down until
late in the second quarter, and that came on a pass interference
call against Minnesota on their 5-yard scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made some big plays, but I think our defense had to play
way too much because we couldn't get any first downs,'' coach Mike
Riley said at halftime. ''I was real disappointed in the production
of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Jim Harbaugh completed 2 of 5 passes for just 1 yard and
threw one interception in his three possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, playing two days after tearing scar tissue in his
surgically repaired right shoulder, came on to cheers -- and a few
boos -- late in the first quarter. It was his first appearance in a
game at Qualcomm Stadium since Oct. 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With Leaf at QB, 252-pound running back Robert Chancey scored on
his third crack from 1 yard out to cap the 5-yard scoring drive and
give the Chargers the lead for good at 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf also led the Chargers on a 15-play, 72-yard drive that was
capped by Jose Cortez's 22-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead with
4:58 to go in the third quarter. Leaf walked off the field in
frustration after his third-down pass to Trevor Gaylor was broken
up in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, who threw a TD pass in San Diego's exhibition opener,
completed 11 of 18 passes for 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Moreno, the Chargers' second-string quarterback, threw a
6-yard pass to Reggie Davis with 40 seconds left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper was 12-of-23 passing for 129 yards, with two
interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Four Arrested For People Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court sentenced to prison four
''snakeheads,'' or people-smugglers, for sneaking 13 people out of
the country, state-run media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ringleader Yu Guangyou was given seven years on Aug. 8 by a
court in the city of Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, while his
cohorts received sentences of up to five years, Xinhua News agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting the help of sailors Wang Qi, Zhang Linjing and Ni
Aizhong, Yu hid the migrants aboard ships and smuggled them out of
China in small groups over the course of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Yu took payment from the migrants for helping
them leave the country. It did not give the stowaways'
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, seven people, including three Taiwanese,
were arrested in China's Fujian province for conspiring to smuggle
women to Taiwan to work as prostitutes, Xinhua said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese media have carried numerous reports of police action
against snakeheads and migrants after 58 illegal Chinese immigrants
were found dead in a truck at the English port town of Dover in
June.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Cancels U.S. Event  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese officials showed no signs of
disappointment or anger Sunday about the cancellation of a rare
U.S. meeting between their president and members of Congress -- a
gathering that would have infuriated rival China.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before President Chen Shui-bian was to board a plane for
the United States, a Foreign Ministry official downplayed the
canceled meeting, telling reporters that Chen's 16-hour layover in
Los Angeles was too brief for special meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Chen will spend most of his time in the hotel,''
said Wu Tzu-dan, a vice foreign minister. ''There's no time to do
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting permission to stop in the United States before he
travels to the Caribbean, Central America and Africa was a big
enough victory for Chen. It was unlikely that the Taiwanese leader,
who took office May 20, would do anything that strains Taiwan's
relationship with America, the island's most important friend.
</P>
<P>
   By giving Chen a transit visa, Washington risked angering China,
which insists that Taiwan is a breakaway province that should
reunify with the mainland. Beijing opposes any activities -- such as
official U.S. visits -- that give the island increased international
legitimacy. Only 29 nations, mostly small developing countries,
have diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China began protesting shortly after Chen announced that he was
given a U.S. transit visa, warning that his visit could severely
damage U.S. ties with China. The U.S. State Department pressured
Chen not to meet with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was invited to gather with members of Congress at a private
home Sunday in Los Angeles. Four California representatives were to
attend the meeting: Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Howard Berman and
Republicans Christopher Cox and Dana Rohrabacher.
</P>
<P>
   But the gathering's organizer, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut
Democrat, said Chen informed him Saturday night that he was pulling
out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday in Taipei, the issue was the hot topic at a
pre-departure news conference at the Presidential Office. Reporters
pressed Wu, the vice foreign minister, about whether there was
still a chance Chen would meet with the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, there is no such arrangement,'' Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Chen planned to go directly to his hotel
after he lands Sunday evening. He will meet with Chen Chien-jen,
Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States, who has
organized a banquet for Chen and his delegation in the president's
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, the group will have to depart for the
airport, following a tight schedule that leaves little time for
anything else, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   Wu emphasized that the stop in Los Angeles was strictly a
transit visit and stretching it into an official visit would be
offending U.S. goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel like there's any reason to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's itinerary includes the Dominican Republic (Aug. 14-17),
Nicaragua (Aug. 17-18), Costa Rica (Aug 18-19), Gambia (Aug.
20-21), Burkina Faso (Aug. 21-23), Chad (Aug. 23-25) and a Dubai
stopover (Aug. 25-26).

<HEADLINE> Angels 9, Yankees 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Kent Mercker pitched effectively in his
return from a brain hemorrhage and Troy Glaus homered twice,
including a grand slam, to lead the Anaheim Angels over the New
York Yankees 9-6 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who had the hemorrhage while pitching against Texas on
May 11, received a standing ovation from fans along the third-base
line as he made his way in from the bullpen after warming up, then
left the mound after 3 2-3 innings to another standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 74 pitches in his comeback from a 92-day layoff,
allowing three runs and five hits with three walks and one
strikeout. He left with a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had a career-high five RBIs and his fifth two-homer game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill's sixth homer in 36 at-bats since New York
acquired him from the White Sox put the Yankees ahead in the
second, but Denny Neagle (2-3) had his third straight shaky outing,
allowing six runs in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle forced in the tying run with a bases loaded-walk to Benji
Gil, allowed the slam and then, one out later, left after Mo
Vaughn's 28th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle gave up three walks, five hits and six runs in 1 2-3
innings, his shortest outing since he got just one out for
Pittsburgh against Houston on July 15, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Pote (1-0) got the win in relief of Mercker, and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa got four outs for his fifth save in 10 chances.
</P>
<P>
   New York closed to 6-3 on Scott Brosius' third-inning homer and
Derek Jeter's RBI single off Pote in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored three times in the bottom half against Dwight
Gooden on Glaus' 34th homer and Garret Anderson's two-run double,
his third double of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who went 3-for-5, hit a two-run double in the seventh off
Mike Holtz and Jose Canseco hit a solo homer in the eighth.
Canseco's second homer since the Yankees claimed him on waivers
from Tampa Bay was a 435-foot drive into the rocks beyond the
left-center field fence.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the 442nd of his career, tying Dave Kingman for 23rd
place.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jorge Posada's third-inning walk was his 79th of the
season, topping Wally Schang's 1921 total to set a Yankees record
for catchers. ... Glaus has seven career multihomer games. ...
Angels RF Tim Salmon left with a tight left groin after scoring on
Anderson's fourth-inning double. ... The Yankees lost a series for
only the second time in their last 13. Seattle won three of four
last weekend at Yankee Stadium. ... The game drew 43,394, the
Angels' fourth sellout of the season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hits Democratic L.A. Bases  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As a warm-up to the Democratic National
Convention, President Clinton is touching all his party's
traditional donor and voter bases this weekend -- labor, the
Hispanic, black and Jewish communities and Hollywood, too.
</P>
<P>
   He even squeezed in a Saturday morning golf game with Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, and Terry McAuliffe,
the loyal Clinton fund-raiser credited with raising millions from
Hollywood and other sources for the convention that begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The game was in lieu of a scheduled round of television
interviews. Clinton canceled those amid quiet grumbling that his
long, full schedule in Los Angeles was stealing some of Vice
President Al Gore's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the interviews were
canceled in part to head off too many questions about ''process,''
meaning too many questions about Clinton's role in the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he wants to talk about is his speech,'' Lockhart said.
Clinton addresses the convention Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's five days in Los Angeles include dozens of meetings,
speeches and get-togethers. Some are public, most are not.
</P>
<P>
   The president's schmoozing time with Hollywood moguls and stars
is probably the most talked-about aspect of his stay. He has long
been locked in a happy, lucrative embrace with Hollywood, and this
weekend he is trying to share the wealth with the two candidates
closest to him -- Gore and New York Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended a star-studded, late-night concert Saturday
that was expected to raise at least $1 million for his wife's
campaign. More than two dozen ''tribute speakers'' and performers
were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 guests at the luxurious home of real estate
executive Ken Roberts sat on specially made directors chairs
labeled ''Hollywood Tribute to William Jefferson Clinton'' on a
hillside lawn overlooking the city. Guests paid $1,000 each to
attend the concert; about 300 couples paid $25,000 to attend a
dinner afterward with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In between the tribute speakers and performers, guests were
shown snippets of a re-edited ''Man From Hope'' video on Clinton
that was featured at the 1992 Democratic nominating convention. The
updated version intercut new interviews with Clinton in which the
president reflected on his early childhood and his start in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   A host of speakers included Red Buttons, Shirley MacLaine and
Rosa Parks. Performers ranged from crooners Paul Anka and Michael
Bolton to Motown diva Diana Ross, pop diva Cher and rocker Melissa
Etheridge.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, the president's speech came with warm-up
remarks from comic book mogul Stan Lee and actor John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dance card also includes a lavish brunch Sunday at the
Malibu home of singer and Democratic patron Barbra Streisand that
is expected to collect $10 million for Clinton's presidential
library.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Democratic Party officials say many of
Clinton's appearances are unofficial ''thank-you'' sessions with
past donors. Although organizers hope that face time with the
president will help free up more dollars in the future, there is no
admission price for the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's official public schedule includes one event apiece
designed to lure or honor Jewish, black and labor donors and two
events with a mostly Hispanic audience, including Friday night's
speech to a fund-raising party benefiting Rep. Xavier Becerra,
D-Calif. Clinton threw a few partisan jabs, praised Gore and struck
a nostalgic note for the end of his White House tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not telling you this as your president, I'm telling you
this as your friend,'' Clinton said. ''Los Angeles and this state
have been wonderful to me and to my family and to my
administration.''

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan claimed the Reform Party nomination
Saturday and reached out to founder Ross Perot and his supporters who are trying
to prevent Buchanan from receiving $12.5 million in federal campaign funds.
''Ross, let's go out and do battle together,'' Buchanan said in a last-minute
revision to his nomination acceptance speech. ''We're giving (the party) the
chance to grow and live. We've earned that chance. Ross, come on out and give us
a hand.'' There was no immediate indication that Perot or his supporters would

child's bicycle still smoldered in a field as FEMA Director James Lee Witt
visited this former mining camp. Flames had swept through the small town earlier

officials said they were encouraged by two days of cooler temperatures that

much of New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York and
Connecticut, the National Weather Service said. A state of emergency was
declared in Sparta, where eight to 10 inches of rain fell in just a few hours.
Residents had to be evacuated from homes there and in nearby Ogdensburg and Lake
Hopatcong, and police were scrambling to answer calls about people stranded on

Americans for years have been overcooking pork out of fear of trichinosis --
unaware that improved production practices virtually have eliminated the
disease-causing worm from U.S. hogs. The Agriculture Department is now testing a
program for certifying pigs as trichinae-free that could be a model for
controlling other parasites and food-borne pathogens such as E. coli and
salmonella. The program, which will be tested starting this fall with packing
plants in Minnesota and Iowa, could start on a full-scale basis by the end of

drove Serb forces out of Kosovo to end Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians
in the Serbian province. Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav

Holyfield Wins Unanimous Decision

   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Evander Holyfield, showing signs of age and ring wear,
battled back in the late rounds Saturday to win a unanimous decision over John
Ruiz and become the first boxer in history to win portions of the heavyweight
title four times. At the age of 37, Holyfield displayed only flashes of the
fighter who beat the likes of Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe, going 12 rounds
before winning the WBA title vacated by Lennox Lewis. Fighting a boxer who had
never been in a title fight before, Holyfield won by only one point on two
ringside scorecards and four points on a third. He fought best in the final
round, when he battered a tiring Ruiz to seemingly pull the fight out.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Reunions Make Progress  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In sharp contrast with South Korea,
the rival North will send many state-decorated luminaries for
family reunions in Seoul this week -- a sign of politics intruding
on the supposedly humanitarian project.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a deal struck at a historic summit of their leaders
in June, the Koreas will exchange 100 people each Tuesday for four
days of temporary reunions with relatives they have not seen for a
half century.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions, the first since 1985, are a symbol of the thaw
following the first-ever summit between the two Koreas, which have
been divided since 1945. The encounter between the South's
President Kim Dae-jung and the North's Kim Jong Il provided the
best chance yet for peace on the Korean peninsula, the Cold War's
last holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Koreas have stopped propaganda broadcasts to each
other and agreed to reopen border liaison offices Monday and
connect a cross-border railway that was cut off just before the
Korean War broke out in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's leader was quoted this weekend as saying he
believes that inter-Korea relations have improved significantly
since the historic summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall relations between the North and the South have
developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and
reunification,'' Kim Jong Il was quoted as saying in a report by
the country's foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   Out of more than 75,000 people who had applied for this week's
reunions with their relatives in the North, South Korea chose its
100 finalists through a computer lottery. Most of them are over 70
years old and include no notables.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the North Korean list includes a renowned poet,
painter, film maker, scientist and many other celebrated people.
All the Northern visitors are South Korean natives who defected to
the North.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million North Koreans fled to South Korea during the
three-year Korean War. Thousands of South Koreans are believed to
have gone to the North voluntarily or after being inducted into the
North's army.
</P>
<P>
   ''The composition of the North's delegation carries a political
message that South Korean defectors are well-treated and well-off
in the North,'' said Nam Ju-hong, a professor at Seoul's Kyonggi
University.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul government officials said they were confused about the
criteria North Korea might have used in selecting its visitors,
because some who have direct kin in South Korea were dropped, while
others will be coming to see their in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Loyalty to its system appears to have been the North's most
important criteria,'' said Song Young-dae, a former Cabinet member
who got involved in negotiations with North Korea in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials said that except in some exceptional cases,
North Korean families who have defectors in South Korea generally
live as social outcasts and are put on the government blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable member of the North Korean delegation is Yoo Mi
Young, 78, the wife of former South Korean Foreign Minister Choi
Duk Shin who defected to the North in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, a retired army general, served as foreign minister under
the military junta led by dictator Park Chung-hee in 1961. He later
became Seoul's ambassador to West Germany before the German
unification and headed the indigenous Korean religion, Chondo.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, with his wife, fled South Korea in 1976 after police
launched an investigation into allegations that he embezzled
official funds of the religion. He died in North Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Choi was treated as a national hero in North Korea. He headed a
political party based on the Chondo religion. After he died, his
wife took over the party.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Koreans are upset by the North's choice of Yoo as
head of its delegation for the family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The North's decision to send ''such an individual to the South
... is nothing short of contempt,'' said Seoul's leading
conservative newspaper Chosun in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's two children in Seoul reportedly are reluctant to meet
their mother. They did not apply for a reunion with her.
</P>
<P>
   Her 48-year-old youngest daughter in Seoul, Choi Soon-hae,
reportedly said through a friend that if her mother wants to meet
her, she will agree to see her. But her second son in Seoul, Choi
In-koo, 53, said through his wife that he does not want to see her.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans generally despise the families of defectors to
North Korea. Depite a thaw brought on by the June summit, suspicion
runs deep among South Koreans toward the North.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities and Politicians Mix  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Motown's legendary producer Barry Gordy put
it simply: ''It's like old home week.''
</P>
<P>
   From the red carpets laid out at the California Science Center
to the dirty cement sidewalks outside The Conga Room, the parade of
celebrities and politicians was nearly nonstop across town
Saturday, two days before the start of the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Harry Belafonte chatted with Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., at the African-American Committee 2000 and Beyond gala at
the Science Center. On the other side of the room, Gordy embraced
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Some 450 people were tempted by soul food ranging from potato
pie to fried okra.
</P>
<P>
   While many were enjoying the black tie affair that also featured
singer Freda Payne and comedian Lewis Dix, most said they came not
for the partying but to support bringing more blacks into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're really on the brink of disaster in the 21st
century,'' Belafonte said. ''Despite a booming economy ... there
are a lot of disadvantaged people left out of the process. And most
of them are black.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Conga Room, an old Hollywood nightclub and restaurant,
convention goers were invited to listen to Latin music with Joe
Andrew, the Democratic party's national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A day after Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., bowed to pressure
from the Democratic Party to cancel her Playboy mansion fund-raiser
for Hispanic voter registration, Hugh Hefner opened his lavish home
tor the convention-attending news media.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit-eared Playboy bunnies mingled with the media's most
influential, including CBS' Bryant Gumbel and comic talk show host
Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had someone ask me if I had to get CBS' permission to be
here. My answer was no, and I would never ask for permission,''
Gumbel said, standing next to a Playmates' swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, host of ABC's ''Politically Incorrect,'' joked that he
should have read his invitation more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I'd come here to relax,'' he said. ''I didn't
realize there would be all these journalists and I'd be working.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 guests, Arianna Huffington called the event a ''true
trade gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like everybody I've ever worked with (in the media)
is here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez caused consternation at the top levels of the Democratic
Party by deciding to hold the fund-raiser at Hefner's estate, famed
for its scantily clad women. She changed her mind Friday only after
convention organizers revoked her invitation to address the
gathering next week.
</P>
<P>
   Her speaking slot at the convention was reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Kidnap Suspect Arrested in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) -- An 8-year-old girl missing for three days
made a daring escape from her abductor Saturday, dashing from his
car to the safety of a passing truck, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Midsi Sanchez, who disappeared on the way home from school
Thursday, had her leg restrained in her captor's vehicle, but was
able to free herself, bolt from the car and flag down the passing
driver in Santa Clara, said Anton Morec, a spokesman for the Santa
Clara Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pulled up, she jumped up immediately into his vehicle. She
told the driver she had been kidnapped and she needed help,'' Morec
said. ''She did all the right things. Her instincts were very good
for an 8-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect chased her as she ran down the street, but fled when
he saw she had reached the driver, said Lt. JoAnn West of the
Vallejo Police Department. West said the driver recognized the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Curtis Dean Anderson, KCBS reported. Anderson,
39, had a previous conviction for kidnapping and served time in the
Solano County jail for that conviction, West said. He has also has
had previous arrests for weapons violations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Anderson drove Midsi to an industrial area of
Santa Clara and parked the car near a business where he had worked
and went in. Police said Midsi's leg was shackled and they believe
when Anderson left, she took a key from the front, unlocked the
shackles and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe he and Midsi spent Friday night in the car near
the business, but are not sure where she spent Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara is about 45 miles south of San Francisco and 70
miles southwest of Vallejo, where Midsi lives and was last seen.
</P>
<P>
   Midsi's family awaited her return Saturday night with balloons
and signs welcoming her back. The family had originally planned to
celebrate the girl's Aug. 3 birthday on Saturday, and decided to
combine the birthday and welcoming celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Midsi was to be examined at an area hospital for injuries and
was to be reunited with her parents late Saturday. She was very
hungry and ate several hamburgers as police questioned her about
her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Midsi's parents talked to the girl by phone Saturday, and
expressed relief at her return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm grateful,'' said her mother Susana Velasco. ''She is a
hero; she got away. She outsmarted him.''

<HEADLINE> Activist Drops Manure at DNC Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An activist dressed in a pink pig costume
dumped four tons of animal manure from a truck Saturday in front of
a hotel housing guests attending the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, anti-abortion activists and immigrant rights
advocates organized small protests, the first in a week of
demonstrations expected to draw thousands during the convention
that starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wilshire Grand Hotel, about 10 people from People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals stood on the sidewalk as the activist
dumped the manure in the hotel driveway. Some wore the same
full-body pig costumes and carried placards that read, ''Meat is
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Police impounded the truck and arrested the driver, Sean
McKinney Diener, 20, of Layton, Utah. He was booked for illegal
dumping, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   City workers and hotel employees cleaned up the 5-foot by
10-foot spill with shovels and trashcans.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the group performed a similar stunt outside a
restaurant where Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
had just eaten breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In other protests Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Nearly 30 anti-abortion demonstrators marched around the site
of the convention carrying poster-sized pictures of aborted
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Activists protesting U.S. immigration policies set up 553
white crosses in a church parking lot to commemorate people who
have lost their lives crossing the U.S.-Mexico border since the
1994 inception of Operation Gatekeeper, a crackdown that pushed
illegal traffic to more remote and treacherous areas.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people, nearly a dozen of them dressed in ceremonial
Mexican outfits, danced and marched in a protest outside Vice
President Al Gore's downtown office.
</P>
<P>
   The National Chicano Moratorium Committee sponsored the rally
about three blocks from Staples Center, where the convention will
take place, to call for undocumented-worker amnesty and a stronger
Hispanic voice in government.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Pisani, 61, of Los Angeles, held a banner that read,
''Democrats and Republicans -- Executioners of Latin Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protesters prepared for demonstrations outside Staples
Center by making banners, picket signs and large, satiric puppets
at their headquarters near MacArthur Park.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a federal judge ruled that police could only
enter that building if they had a search warrant or during an
emergency. The decision came in response to the American Civil
Liberties Union's complaint that the headquarters, named the
Convergence Center, had been a target of police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The department earlier was ordered to shrink a security zone
around the Staples Center to allow demonstrators to be nearer to
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard Parks joined activists Saturday to pay
tribute to children slain by violence and to call for greater
restrictions on guns. Parks and his wife, Bobbi, added a pair of
ballet shoes belonging to their 20-year-old granddaughter Lori
Gonzalez, who was gunned down outside a fast-food restaurant, to
more than 200 pairs of shoes from young victims of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people say guns don't kill people, they're not being
truthful,'' Parks said. ''Guns do kill and they kill at a very high
rate.''

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Land Mines Kill Six  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- Two land mines exploded under buses carrying
paramilitary troops in Kashmir on Sunday, killing six soldiers in
stepped-up violence before India's Independence Day, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other explosions also rocked the Himalayan province, the
seat of an Islamic insurgency that has left 25,000 people dead in
the last 11 years. In all, 42 people were reported hurt in addition
to the six killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen -- the largest of the
Muslim rebel groups here -- claimed responsibility for the mine
explosions at Kud, a village 50 miles north of Jammu, the winter
capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. The group said it would
increase attacks against Indian troops in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to end Indian rule in Kashmir and our
activities will escalate,'' Salim Hashmi, a Hezb-ul Mujahedeen
spokesman in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, told The Associated
Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Five soldiers of the Border Security Force were killed in the
first blast, on the Jammu-Srinagar Highway. Soldiers immediately
halted traffic and looked for land mines along the route.
</P>
<P>
   When traffic resumed two hours later, another land mine went off
about a half-mile away. The second blast damaged a bus and killed
one soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said both mines apparently were triggered by a
remote control device.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions left 40 soldiers hospitalized at a hospital in
Udhampur. Doctors said 10 soldiers were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The buses were part of a convoy carrying security personnel to
Srinagar, 185 miles to the north, ahead of Tuesday's Independence
Day celebration. Militants fighting Indian security forces in
Kashmir usually increase violence against the government during the
run-up to the Aug. 15 celebration, and separatist guerrilla groups
have vowed to wreck the festivities again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The other three explosions, including a grenade hurled by
militants and another land mine blast, left two people injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Srinagar, police sealed an area around the Bakshi Stadium
where the Independence Day parade is held every year. Militants
usually fire rockets and grenades toward the stadium to disrupt the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police set up metal barricades on the roads to check all
vehicles in the area. Passengers on buses were frisked with metal
detectors. Many residents stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainous province of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, both of which claim it in its entirety. The Islamic
guerillas want Indian-controlled Kashmir to break away from heavily
Hindu India and either remain independent or become part of mostly
Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks here increased after Kashmir's main guerrilla group, the
Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, called off a brief cease-fire
this week. The group wanted India to involve Pakistan in talks on
resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, militants set off two powerful bombs in downtown
Srinagar, killing 14 soldiers and journalists and wounding 25
others. On Saturday, suspected guerrillas lobbed a grenade near the
Hazratbal Mosque in Srinagar, wounding two Hungarian and two
Kashmiri women.

<HEADLINE> Barricaded man shoots three officers during Brooklyn incident  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A gunman engaged police in a standoff at his
Brooklyn home, shooting and wounding four officers before he was
killed Saturday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The almost seven-hour faceoff with Albert Alalouf began Saturday
afternoon after his parents had gone to the 61st Precinct in
Brooklyn to report that he had purchased several weapons on Friday,
and then told them he intended to ''shoot and kill police
officers,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Gregory John was among the first officers to respond to
Alalouf's residence in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, where he
opened fire with his shotgun at about 1:30 p.m. The officers
returned fire, forcing Alalouf back inside the home at 16 Parkway
Court, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   John, 32, an Emergency Service Unit officer with 10 years on the
job, was hit in the shoulder, police said. He was reported in
stable condition at Kings County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Alalouf remained barricaded inside the home as police circled
the residence. At about 8 p.m., officers searching the perimeter of
the home approached the front door and came across Alalouf, who
again opened fire, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officer James McGrath, 33, suffered a graze wound to the face,
and Officer Jose Guerra, 34, was struck in the face and leg, said
Officer Louis Cruz, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect fled out the back window, where an addition officer,
Jose Ocasio, 43, was shot once in the left calf, Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired back and Alalouf was fatally wounded. He was
pronounced dead at the scene, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and Guerra, both members of the Emergency Service Unit,
were taken to Kings County Hospital and treated.
</P>
<P>
   Three other officers were treated for injuries that were not
gunshot-related, including scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities credited John's bulletproof vest with saving his
life.
</P>
<P>
   After the ordeal was over Saturday, Giuliani displayed the
officer's Kevlar vest, which contained at least eight holes where
the buckshot had torn into it.
</P>
<P>
   John actually wore two vests - his personal vest beneath his
uniform, and a heavier ESU vest worn over his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for the vest,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> Shipwreck uncovered 175 years after sinking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WESTPORT, N.Y. (AP) - A group of young shipmen from a small
waterside community perishes when an autumn storm capsizes their
vessel as it travels home.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like this summer's hit movie? It's the tale behind this
summer's historical find on Lake Champlain.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers announced Saturday that they found a ship that sank
almost two centuries ago in Lake Champlain. The canal-schooner that
took five lives with it in 1825 is in nearly perfect condition,
researchers announced at the former family homestead of Jacob
Halstead, the captain of the doomed ship.
</P>
<P>
   Historians said the find is significant since the Troy is the
only example of an early sailing-canal boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first place in North America where these vessels
appeared,'' said Arthur Cohn of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum.
''It's one of the most spectacular wrecks I've ever seen,''
</P>
<P>
   ''It must have rocketed to the bottom and hit with an impact
sufficient to bury the bow,'' he added. ''There's been some
deterioration to the stern, but the rest of the hull is in
remarkably good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn did not give the exact location, saying the site is
sensitive because it may still contain human remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shipwreck was a monumental tragedy for the village of
Westport,'' Cohn said. ''Five young men lost their lives. That had
to be a horrific experience for this small community to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people on shore saw the struggling boat a few minutes before
it went down Nov. 23, according to newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jacob Halstead and his 13-year-old brother, George, the
accident took the lives of Jacob Pardee, the captain's half
brother, and two crewmen, Daniel Cannon and John Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother and sister were sitting at home in the Halstead house,
listening through the storm for the sound of homecoming footsteps
as the night wore on,'' Caroline Halstead Royce wrote in 1902 in
''A History of Westport.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Suddenly they heard the boys on the doorsteps, stomping off
the snow in the entry as they were wont to do before coming in,''
Royce wrote. ''The women sprang to the door and opened it, stepped
to the outer door and looked down upon the light carpet of
untrodden snow which lay before it and then crept trembling back to
the fireside, knowing that the son and brothers would never sit
with them again within its light.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial stone remembering the crew sits in Westport Village
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   When the Champlain canal opened in 1823, schooners were used to
haul iron ore to the canal, where the cargo was transferred to
canal barges.
</P>
<P>
   By 1825, the sailing-canal boat was developed to eliminate cargo
transport. Sails were used to propel the boats, and a lowered mast
navigated the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Sails made the canal boats, which floated in shallow water,
top-heavy and unstable. Though designed with a center board on
bottom to improve stability, the boards were often too small to
keep many ships upright.
</P>
<P>
   The Maritime Museum found the vessel while conducting a
several-year project to map the lake bottom and catalog shipwrecks
and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Troy is the second major shipwreck discovery the museum has
announced this year. A railroad drawboat from the 1870s was found
near Port Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Westport is 106 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Seek More Than Bones  </HEADLINE>
By JEN LIN-LIU
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY FORGE, Pa. (AP) -- Somewhere in the 3,600 acres of Valley
Forge National Park, archaeologist Janet Six sat in a ditch,
scooping dirt into a bucket, like a child in a sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   Across the dig site, archaeologist Julie Steele shook the dirt
through a large sifting box. Something caught her eye. ''Oh, look!
I got a bone!'' she said. On second glance, ''I got a tooth!''
</P>
<P>
   With youthful excitement -- and the help of some young volunteers
-- four Valley Forge archaeologists are conducting the park's
largest dig ever in hopes of discovering the intimate details of
the lives of George Washington's Continental Army.
</P>
<P>
   The park is encouraging children to volunteer at the site to
make it an all-ages learning experience. Recently, a group of 14
children, including a troop of boy scouts, helped out for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids learn so much, so fast,'' said Doug Campana, Valley
Forge's senior archaeologist. ''Older people are more set in their
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are given instruction on how to use the trowel, a
hand-held shovel that is the archaeologist's basic tool. They learn
to scrape away at the ground so they won't damage any artifacts
that may be below the surface. The soil they scrape is put into a
bucket, which gets transferred to a large, boxy sift, which helps
separate the trash from the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   David Perner, 15, and John Morrow, 11, plan to volunteer for the
entire project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can get a bit tedious,'' said David, who wants to pursue
archaeology as a life-long hobby. ''But it is rewarding when you
find something.''
</P>
<P>
   John was 5 years old when he decided he wanted to become an
archaeologist. His mother, Chris Morrow, said she is not sure how
John developed an interest in archaeology so early, but she has
encouraged it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few years ago, we got him a metal detector,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like digging in the dirt,'' John said. ''My mom won't let me
dig at home.''
</P>
<P>
   John said he hopes to go to Africa or Asia someday to dig for
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear they're finding some cool things there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dig at Valley Forge is rare because of a lack of funding for
such projects and a desire to preserve historical sites. The
project got under way as part of a partnership between the National
Park Service and Aurora Foods.
</P>
<P>
   More than two centuries earlier, the Continental Army of the
newly formed United States of America settled at Valley Forge for
the winter, sleeping in huts and eating near a large oven that was
embedded in the ground. Now, it is an indistinguishable patch of
woods inhabited by deer and squirrels. But deep in the dirt, there
is evidence of Washington's army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good things come to those who wait,'' said archaeologist Cory
Rosentel.
</P>
<P>
   John shook his head. ''Bad things come to those who wait too
long,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But, a few minutes later, John found a piece of window glass. It
was identifiable because of its greenish tint and bubbly texture.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest discovery has been an old fireplace that
likely belonged in a hut. Around the fireplace, the team of
professionals and youngsters have found animal bones, glass and
redware, or the ''Tupperware of the time,'' as Steele calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fireplace is just a formation of stones, but Six gets
chills thinking about what used to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can imagine that a guy was chewing a cow bone, threw it in
the fire and left the hut,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six said the job of an archaeologist fits her perfectly. ''I
like to be outside and put puzzles together,'' she said. ''Once you
dig, you get bitten by the bug.''

<HEADLINE> Weight Training Can Have Dangers  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As more people weight train, more get hurt --
especially baby boomers and older people who are trying to keep
from showing their age, a study finds.
</P>
<P>
   The weight training is fine, but people ought to learn to do it
right, said researcher Chester S. Jones of the University of
Arkansas, who reviewed federal injury data over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That seemed to come out of the data -- that people weren't
practicing safety,'' Jones said. ''There are proper ways to do
weights, and things that are necessary to prevent injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his colleagues reviewed statistics from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention on hospital emergency room
visits from 1978 to 1998. Based on 101 hospitals in the CDC's
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the researchers
projected that 980,173 people were treated nationally for weight
training-related injuries over the 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The weight training injury rate rose by 35 percent over that
period. And some groups had far greater jumps in their emergency
room visits.
</P>
<P>
   The largest spike was in injuries per 100,000 men 65 years of
age and older, which rose 303 percent from 1978 to 1998, the study
said. Injuries per 100,000 women ages 45-64, the second greatest
spike, rose 281 percent. Those jumps were offset in the overall
population by smaller decreases in other categories, and one group
-- boys ages 5-14 -- in which injury rates fell almost 12 percent
instead of rising.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, men in general had an increase in injuries of 28
percent, while women had an increase of 64 percent. Jones said the
larger percentage for injuries to women may reflect the surge of
women into weight training during the study period.
</P>
<P>
   The size of those percentage differences may be deceptive,
however, because they are spread over two decades. On a
year-to-year basis, the increases were gradual.
</P>
<P>
   And the increase probably does not mean weight training had
become more dangerous over the 20 years, Jones said. What drove up
the injury rate could be simply that more people took up weight
training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries most commonly took place in the home, which accounted
for 40 percent of cases, which indicates people weren't getting
instruction on how to lift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injuries were to the hands and feet, indicating
people didn't know how to handle the weights, Jones said. Weight
training, done properly, is not only safe, it is beneficial,
strengthening bone as well as muscle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for older people, ''weight training was not a
preferred activity 20 years ago,'' Jones said. This changed as
research, largely in the last decade, showed that even frail 80-
and 90-year olds can restore enough muscle strength to improve
their lives, such as their ability to do household chores, by
taking up weight training. In addition, weight training retards the
loss of bone density that can develop into osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   However, older exercisers may not realize the risks, and this
may account for their outsized injury rates, Jones said. ''Weight
training can be a very physical exercise, and maybe a lot of these
older people aren't ready to participate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise is valuable, but older people should get information on
how to start safely, talk about their health with their primary
care physician, and learn about the background of any personal
trainer they may hire, before they start exercise, said Chhanda
Dutta, director of musculoskeletal research at the National
Institute on Aging, who was not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep in mind your starting point,'' Dutta said.
</P>
<P>
   The research also found a jump in injuries among boys ages 4 and
younger -- up 23 percent. These injuries commonly happened in the
home, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can be blamed for those injuries, said Dr. Reginald L.
Washington of Denver, who chairs the sports medicine committee of
the American Academy of Pediatrics. ''Almost always, when a child
gets injured in that situation, it's with parental support and
encouragement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Children in these ages are being pushed to weight train because
parents wrongly think their children will get a head start toward
being world class athletes that way, said Washington, who was not
connected with the study. But children can't gain muscle until
puberty; the most they can gain earlier is some toning, he said.

<HEADLINE> CIA Exhibits Hollywood Spy Gadgetry  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANGLEY, Va. (AP) -- The CIA is offering its employees a fanciful
look back at the ''good old days.''
</P>
<P>
   In brightly lit corridors of its suburban Washington
headquarters, the Central Intelligence Agency is displaying
''spy-fi archives'' -- a one-of-a-kind collection of Hollywood spy
gadgetry and memorabilia from 1960s television series and movies
that romanticized and glamorized the spy business.
</P>
<P>
   There's Maxwell Smart's shoe phone from the hit TV show ''Get
Smart.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the pen Robert Vaughn used as a secret communicator in
the series ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a mock tarantula used as a prop in a famous scene from
the 1962 James Bond film ''Dr. No.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's much more -- all from the private collection of
Hollywood screenwriter and author Danny Biederman.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping secrets, of course, is more important in the real world,
and thus it happens that only people cleared for entry to CIA
headquarters -- not the general public -- can see the Biederman
collection. It was first shown to employees on Thursday and will be
kept through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Biederman adored everything about the spy business.
Still, he never dreamed his carefully preserved movie props,
costumes, scripts, photographs and posters would end up at CIA
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like freaky, bringing these two universes together. It's
like beyond fiction,'' Biederman said as he strolled through the
agency where some real-life -- but still secret -- tools of the spy
trade may be not entirely unlike those that U.N.C.L.E. agents (the
good guys) used to foil T.H.R.U.S.H. agents (the bad guys).
</P>
<P>
   Take the pen communicator used by Napoleon Solo, the fictional
hero played by Vaughn on ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks like an ordinary, if slightly oversized, pen. From the
bottom you pull out a hidden transmitter, and from the top you open
a short antenna. Just like that, instant communications. Good for
use anywhere in the world. Might the CIA's agents have something
similar?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not out of the realm of possibility that very similar
items existed -- or continue to exist,'' said CIA spokesman Tom
Crispell, dutifully careful to safeguard the spy agency's valuable
''sources and methods.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that fuzzy connection between fact and fiction that makes
Biederman's collection a natural fit for CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Illusion in the real world is as important as it is in
Hollywood,'' Crispell said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the display items:
</P>
<P>
   --The ''stereophonic gun'' with two barrels and a single trigger
used by a KAOS agent in a ''Get Smart'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   --From the 1966 movie, ''Our Man Flint,'' a jacket worn by a
member of the Galaxy, the cadre of villainy that plots to take over
the world. The movie starred James Coburn as ultra sophisticated
spy Derek Flint.
</P>
<P>
   --A Walther PPK pistol used in the James Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   --Original storyboards for the title sequence of the ''I Spy'' TV
show starring Robert Culp and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   --Actor Martin Landau's copy of the script for the first episode
of the TV show ''Mission: Impossible'' in September 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the ''good old days,'' when the line between good and
evil was cut clearly, when the ''bad guys'' were easily defined and
demonized -- in short, the heyday of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cold War ended and communism collapsed as a threat, the
spy business lost some of its luster. Morale at the CIA sagged and
the agency shifted its focus to less glamorous threats like drug
runners and computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Apple, a member of the CIA's Fine Arts Commission, said
the agency heard about Biederman's collection and approached him
last year. The idea was to give CIA employees a look at 1960s-era
Hollywood shows that, for some, were the source of their interest
in spying.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the fictional counterpart to what we really do,''
Apple said. During the Cold War, when the CIA was even more
secretive than today, it was left to Hollywood to imagine what
spying was really about.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did us a favor because they portrayed us very favorably --
as heroes,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Roads, bridges, dams washed out by downpours  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - The Musconetcong River in northwest New
Jersey was cresting at some points Sunday - a result of torrential
downpours the day before - prompting officials to evacuate
residents of one town and put others on alert.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimated that Saturday's heavy rains and
flooding caused several million dollars worth of damage in northern
New Jersey, washing out bridges and roads and bursting dams.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman flew over the mud-soaked counties Sunday
morning to view the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rivoli, director of the Warren County Office of
Emergency Management, said water was breaching the Musconetcong
River, which flows out of Sussex County and borders Morris and
Warren counties, and were worried that it could overflow at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hackettstown were being evacuated and other towns
were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've notified all municipalities along the river and they're
telling residents that there's a possibility that the river could
flood. At this point we're watching the water level to see how it
makes its way down stream,'' Rivoli said. ''Everybody's got what we
call a 'heads up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning Sunday
morning for parts of Morris, Warren, Hunterdon and Sussex counties
due to river flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In Stanhope, officials were worried that a dam on Furnace Pond
could burst due to the water pressure, Rivoli said.
</P>
<P>
   The water pressure already had eroded a drainage pipe, enlarging
it from about 3-feet in diameter to 8, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pond that about seven municipalities empty their
stormwater into,'' he said. ''State Police and dam safety people
said it's holding, but could go at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, one of the hardest-hit areas, three roads and three
bridges were destroyed by the torrential downpours, which dumped 14
inches of rain on the township, said Police Sgt. Russell Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The force of all that water also burst the dam on Seneca Lake, a
small, private lake surrounded by homes in Sussex County, the
northernmost part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and officials said no hazardous
materials had been released, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police tape surrounded the small beach at the empty
lake, which smelled of dead fish.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Brunetti, 43, said the lake emptied of its thousands of
gallons of water in one hour Saturday evening. It was ''just a big
hole, and the dock floating away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the township was receiving help from Sussex County
officials, State Police and the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in the world is helping us and we're doing OK,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 families spent the night in an emergency shelter in
Sparta Township. Steve Wille, a Red Cross volunteer who has lived
here for 30 years, said he'd never seen anything like Saturday's
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all seen sheets of rain for five, 10, 15 minutes. This
continued for hour after hour after hour after hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yards in Sparta were covered with mud and a fast current of
brown water flowed down streets.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Preskar Earl said the combination of flooding and downed
trees diverted two ponds in her back yard into a stream that runs
behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just water and trees and boulders coming everywhere,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, water supply was a major concern as rushing water
took out the town's two water mains along the Sparta Glen, said
Town Manager Camille Furgiulele.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said town officials had decided to tap a nearby water
well to alleviate the problem, but that the supplementary source
would only yield about 20 percent of the usual supply of 1 million
gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   The well was put online just after 11 a.m. Officials also said
they were talking to the National Guard and some private companies
to see if additional water supplies could be trucked in.
</P>
<P>
   Repair crews were unable to reach the water mains because roads
were flooded and a bridge to access the area had washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said although there are only about 8,000 residents in
Newton, the county seat, up to 20,000 people work there.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Franklin, Sussex County, water was still up to the
front porches of houses Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing people row boats to their houses, that was pretty
crazy,'' said Josh Osowski, 26, of Newton, who was passing through
Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson Township, all roads were reopened Sunday except
Route 15 south. One of the three emergency shelters that had opened
Saturday was closed and many people were able to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   A police dispatcher said things were getting back to normal
''slowly but surely.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooding lakes and rivers Saturday washed out bridges in
Jefferson Township and Ogdensburg, and caused road closures in
Morris and Sussex counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County alone, damages will reach millions of dollars,
estimated county Emergency Management Coordinator Eskil ''Skip''
Danielson. Four bridges were destroyed and several roads washed
out.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 customers of GPU Energy were without power Sunday
afternoon in Newton, Sparta and Flemington, said Ron Morano, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The energy company was planning to fly over the area to see if
there were any outages that had not yet been reported. Power had
been restored to most of the 10,000 customers who were without it
Saturday, he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader's U.S. Stop Hot Topic  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new leader ventured abroad Sunday
for the first time as president -- a two-week trip that could strain
U.S.-China relations and strengthen ties with the island's
dwindling number of diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
   President Chen Shui-bian had planned to meet with a group of
U.S. Congress members during a 16-hour layover in Los Angeles. Chen
is still coming to the United States, but this weekend he pulled
out of the Sunday meeting amid warnings from the U.S. State
Department that the gathering would rile China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen did not mention the meeting during a brief departure
speech, which emphasized the island's success in building a
democracy and strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taiwan is standing up and moving forward,'' he said, borrowing
a theme from his May inauguration speech. ''I want the whole world
to see the Republic of China,'' he said, using Taiwan's official
name.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is Chen's first since he took office, and it comes amid
continuing tensions between China and Taiwan. The two split during
a civil war in 1949, but China claims Taiwan as a part of its
territory and says it should reunify with the mainland. Chinese
leaders have threatened to use force to bring Taiwan under its
control if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   China fiercely opposes any activities -- such as official U.S.
visits for Taiwan's top leaders -- that give the island increased
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   After then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui visited the United
States in 1995, China lobbed test missiles near Taiwan. This time
around, Beijing warned Washington that issuing Chen a transit visa
would severely damage U.S. ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 nations, mostly small developing countries, have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Six of them will be part of Chen's
brief swing through the Caribbean, Central America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Getting permission to stop in the United States was an important
victory for Chen: It was a sign that Washington could trust that
the 49-year-old former Taipei mayor would not do anything to
disrupt America's delicate relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   During Taiwan's presidential campaign, Chen's opponents tried to
brand him as a rash, inexperienced leader whose past vocal support
for Taiwanese independence would spark a war with China. But since
taking office, Chen's numerous conciliatory gestures and summit
invitations to China have earned him praise from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was apparently not ready to test the boundaries of
Washington's goodwill by meeting with U.S. lawmakers or making a
public speech. He declined an invitation to gather with members of
Congress at a private home Sunday in Los Angeles, said the
meeting's organizer, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday in Taipei, the issue was the hot topic at a
pre-departure news conference at the Presidential Office. Reporters
pressed Wu Tzu-dan, a vice foreign minister, about whether there
was still a chance Chen would meet with the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, there is no such arrangement,'' Wu said. He
said that maybe Chen would ''wave to them from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu said Chen planned to go directly to his hotel after he landed
in Los Angeles Sunday evening. He was to meet with Chen Chien-jen,
Taiwan's de factor ambassador to the United States, and the group
was to leave for the airport the next morning following a tight
schedule that leaves little time for anything else.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. stopover, Chen's itinerary includes visits to the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso,
Chad and Dubai. He is expected to return to Taiwan after the Dubai
stop on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the planned visits, many Taiwanese complain that the
island's smaller allies are not true friends because Taipei uses
aid -- ''checkbook diplomacy'' -- to buy their support. Those who
support keeping ties with small nations, on the other hand, point
to China's aggressive campaign to steal away Taiwan's allies and
isolate the island internationally.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important diplomatic battlegrounds is Africa,
said Eugene Chien, deputy secretary-general to the president. Chien
said Sunday that top Chinese officials have made numerous visits to
Africa in recent years and have invited Taiwan's allies on the
continent to a China-Africa forum in October.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been working extremely hard in Africa,'' Chien said.

<HEADLINE> Fishing industry nets $50 million, but will likely be back for more </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Even though beleaguered fishermen have reeled
in millions of federal dollars, some say they will need even more
to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The money, intended to provide relief from environmental
restrictions, overfishing and foreign competition, was included an
$11.2 billion emergency spending bill that President Clinton signed
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the package's money was for military operations, but
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration got $50 million
to help fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see us coming back for more,'' said Leesa
Cobb, president of the Pacific Marine Conservation Council, which
represents commercial fishermen and scientists. ''I hate to say
that, but we'll have to. In the coastal communities along the West
Coast, you're going to see people losing their boats and homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast groundfish industry and conservation groups were
hoping for $100 million for a boat buyback program in which the
government would pay them for their vessels. They got $5 million to
help retrain fishermen forced out of business by overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Groundfish are species that live on or near the bottom of the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   For year, fishermen have grappled with a general decline in
catches.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Magnuson-Stevens Act created the first U.S.
management authority over fishing in waters from three miles to 200
miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The law ended overfishing by foreign boats, but overfishing by
the U.S. fleet continued, leading to declines in several fish
species. To replenish stocks, regional fishery management councils
have set catch limits and made specified waters off-limits to
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, New England fishermen caught $557 million worth of
fish. Eight years later, their take was $540 million. Fishermen on
the Pacific saw a drop in earnings from $362 million to $284
million over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, the $50 million relief package is among
the largest the industry has received.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fishing industry historically has not gotten a lot for
disaster relief,'' said Eugene Buck, a senior analyst for the
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Buck said when the
industry gets federal aid, it usually comes in increments of $5
million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In debate on the latest package, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
criticized the spending and said Congress is ''placing the fish
industry at the top of our list of pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers representing fishermen insist the aid is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lobsters represent a $52 million industry in Connecticut,''
said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ''This is not chicken feed. The
lobstermen aren't looking for a handout, but this is a case where
there's a role for Congress to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   New England groundfishermen are getting $10 million through a
government program that will buy back 600 fishing permits that are
not being used.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called it a ''necessary first step''
and said more money may be needed for boat buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   While the fishermen appreciate the relief, some say they could
do more to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parker, executive director of the Cape Cod Commercial Hook
Fishermen's Association, said the fishing industry should sink some
of its own money into boat buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government needs to do more research to study the
fish stocks, but taxpayers shouldn't bear all the burden for
helping us,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the best way to reduce the industry's reliance on
federal aid is to restrict more fishing areas and increase aid to
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Crockett, executive director of the Marine Fish Conservation
Network which represents conservationists and commercial and sport
fishermen, said more restrictions would put some fishermen out of
work. But he said it is a sound investment to give those fishermen
temporary federal aid while fish stocks replenish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to stop this raid on the Treasury, you're going to
need more regulations,'' Crockett said. ''That means there's going
to be a period where fishermen are going to have a tough time, but
it won't be stretched out. If there are no fish for fishermen to
catch, they're going to keep coming, hat in hand, looking to
Congress for money.''

<HEADLINE> Verizon, union officials still struggling to resolve strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Thousands of phone technicians and operators
for Verizon Communications entered their second week on strike
Sunday, threatening more repair and installation delays for
consumers in Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Two unions representing 87,200 workers continued negotiations
with the company's management to replace a contract that expired
Aug. 6. The parties have hit roadblocks on issues such as required
overtime, the movement of work and working environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company created these problems. It's up to Verizon to
address the issues,'' Candice Johnson, spokeswoman for the
Communications Workers of America, the larger of the two striking
unions, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions were reviewing an updated proposal Verizon made early
Sunday and had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer, company spokesman Eric Rabe said, ''represents
a good summary of everybody's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says it relies on overtime to meet consumer demands, and
stringent hiring standards and a tight labor market make it
difficult to add new workers. The company contends it tries to
reduce inconvenience by scheduling overtime in advance.
</P>
<P>
   CWA also said the two sides are far apart in addressing the
matter of moving work outside the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
states. Unions fear that Verizon - the product of a summer merger
between Bell Atlantic and GTE - will distribute work within its
expanded territory to areas where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials argue they need flexibility to shift calls to
other centers in their region to alleviate heavy volumes in certain
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by CWA and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers affects more than 25 million customers in
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Reunions Move Nearer  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In sharp contrast with South Korea,
the North will send many state-decorated luminaries for family
reunions in Seoul this week -- a sign of politics intruding on the
supposedly humanitarian project.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a deal struck at a historic summit of their leaders
in June, the Koreas will exchange 100 people each Tuesday for four
days of temporary reunions with relatives they have not seen for a
half century.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions, the first since 1985, are a symbol of the thaw
following the first-ever summit between the two Koreas, which have
been divided since 1945. The June encounter between the South's
President Kim Dae-jung and the North's Kim Jong Il provided the
best chance yet for peace on the Korean peninsula, the Cold War's
last holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il said last week there will be more reunions in
September and October, and by next year separated families from
South Korea will be allowed to visit their hometowns in the North,
South Korea's state Yonhap news agency reported. The remarks were
made to visiting South Korean media executives.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's leader was quoted this weekend as saying he
believes that inter-Korea relations have improved significantly
since the historic summit. Already, the Koreas have stopped
propaganda broadcasts to each other and agreed to reopen border
liaison offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall relations between the North and the South have
developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and
reunification,'' Kim was quoted as saying in a report by the
country's foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   Out of more than 75,000 people who had applied for this week's
reunions with their relatives in the North, South Korea chose its
100 finalists through a computer lottery. Most of them are over 70
years old and include no notables.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the North Korean list includes a renowned poet,
painter, film maker, scientist and many other celebrated people.
All the Northern visitors are South Korean natives who defected to
the North.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million North Koreans fled to South Korea during the
three-year Korean War. Thousands of South Koreans are believed to
have gone to the North voluntarily or after being inducted into the
North's army.
</P>
<P>
   ''The composition of the North's delegation carries a political
message that South Korean defectors are well-treated and well-off
in the North,'' said Nam Ju-hong, a professor at Seoul's Kyonggi
University.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul government officials said they were confused about the
criteria North Korea might have used in selecting its visitors,
because some who have direct kin in South Korea were dropped, while
others will be coming to see their in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Loyalty to its system appears to have been the North's most
important criteria,'' said Song Young-dae, a former Cabinet member
who got involved in negotiations with North Korea in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials said that except in some exceptional cases,
North Korean families who have defectors in South Korea generally
live as social outcasts and are put on the government blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable member of the North Korean delegation is Yoo Mi
Young, 78, the wife of former South Korean Foreign Minister Choi
Duk Shin who defected to the North in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, a retired army general, served as foreign minister under
the military junta led by dictator Park Chung-hee in 1961. He later
became Seoul's ambassador to West Germany before the German
unification and headed the indigenous Korean religion, Chondo.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, with his wife, fled South Korea in 1976 after police
launched an investigation into allegations that he embezzled
official funds of the religion. He died in North Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Choi was treated as a national hero in North Korea. He headed a
political party based on the Chondo religion. After he died, his
wife took over the party.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Koreans are upset by the North's choice of Yoo as
head of its delegation for the family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The North's decision to send ''such an individual to the South
... is nothing short of contempt,'' said Seoul's leading
conservative newspaper Chosun in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's two children in Seoul reportedly are reluctant to meet
their mother. They did not apply for a reunion with her.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans generally despise the families of defectors to
North Korea. Despite a thaw brought on by the June summit,
suspicion of the North runs deep among South Koreans.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes in Congo; 20 Killed  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A plane carrying about 20 passengers en
route to Kinshasa crashed near the Angolan border, a Congolese
aviation official said Sunday. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 20-seat Antonov 26-B, crashed Saturday afternoon
about 40 miles north of the Congolese city of Tshikapa, a center
for Congo's diamond industry, the official said on condition of
anonymity. He said it remained unclear exactly how many people were
on board the plane, which was heading from Tshikapa to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was registered in Congo but was owned by a variety of
people, at least some of whom are Ukrainian. The plane's pilots
were also Ukrainian, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The route from Tshikapa to Kinshasa is commonly flown by diamond
traders. It was not clear Sunday if the passengers on the plane
were in the diamond business.

<HEADLINE> College students left in debt over painting  </HEADLINE>
	   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of painting the town red this summer, some college
students around the Northeast are finding that painting is putting
them in the red financially.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Friedman was among the college students who thought he had
found a dream job as a manager for University Painters of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a 19-year-old Avon resident who attends Johnson &AMP;
Wales University, was told he could manage his own business, earn a
profit of $5,000 to $13,000, and get a four-day cruise to the
Bahamas for painting homes with other college students. By
mid-summer, Friedman found himself thousands of dollars in debt,
his painters unpaid and liable to the Virginia company for $3,000
for failing to live up to his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of having money for school, now I have none,''
Friedman said. ''I have no money, no job, and I've lost the entire
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, many recruited through campus employment
offices, are reporting similar problems, wishing they had never
become involved with University Painters, based in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua D. Jablon, the founder and president of University
Painters, said many students had successful experiences working for
his company. But he conceded problems occurred in New England,
saying the company might have made mistakes in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not for the meek. It's a hard, challenging job that
requires a lot more than the typical summer job,'' Jablon said.
''There's a lot of guys who are frustrated in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, along with 23 other college students around New
England, was selected to be an ''outlet manager.'' He was to run a
small business, make estimates, hire and supervise painters.
</P>
<P>
   The managers all signed contracts saying if they quit or were
fired, they would have to pay University Painters $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they didn't read the contract closely or didn't
fully understand its provisions. Some conceded that they signed
even after their parents had raised red flags.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 of the 24 student managers quit or were fired. Of
the 11 managers who spoke to the Hartford Courant, most reported
inadequate training and pay problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students said University Painters delayed paying
their painters by claiming it did not receive the necessary
documents. Many painters quit as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a sports management major, was fired on July 19. He
said he will file a complaint with the state Department of Labor
seeking its help in his dispute with University Painters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm stupid for falling for it, but I tried to make it
work,'' Friedman said. ''I'm stuck with all my equipment. This
company needs to stop taking advantage of college kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Jablon said Friedman's painting crew will be paid and that any
houses left incomplete will be finished by his company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be happy to settle each and every situation,''
Friedman said.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts tribe could claim land in Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KILLINGLY, Conn. (AP) - The petition of a Massachusetts Indian
tribe for federal recognition has town leaders in northeast
Connecticut preparing for possible land claims.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs is expected to rule in
November on the petition of the Nipmuc Nation. Officials said they
expect that if the federal government grants the recognition, the
Nipmucs will file claim to more than 10,000 acres in Massachusetts,
just across Connecticut's border.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, representatives of the 10 member towns of the
Northeastern Connecticut Council of Governments asked the council's
attorney to check into whether the Nipmucs may have a legal claim
to land in Connecticut. The Nipmucs currently own 4 acres of land
in Thompson, about 200 yards from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Council Executive Director John Filchak said the council would
hold a ''preliminary and very general'' discussion of the Nipmuc
issue during its monthly meeting on Thursday. The council's member
towns include Brooklyn, Canterbury, Eastford, Thompson, Killingly,
Plainfield, Pomfret, Putnam, Sterling and Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know how directly or indirectly the Nipmuc land
claims affect our member towns,'' said Filchak. ''We still need
more specifics and need to see more documents on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   William Gould, chairman of the Nipmuc Nation Tribal Council,
said his tribe has plans to claim land in Massachusetts, but
currently has no plans to claim any more land in Connecticut. Gould
said 45 percent of the tribe's 2,000 or so members live in this
state, about 50 percent live in Massachusetts and about 5 percent
live in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock First Selectman Ernest Wetzel said his town, Putnam
and Thompson all could be impacted by the recognition of the
Nipmucs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all very preliminary,'' he said. ''Right now, we know
there are many Nipmucs who have residency in the towns, but, once
they get tribal recognition, we don't know if they will make claims
on land, claims for reservations, or expect some concessions in the
towns.''

<HEADLINE> Schools show race disparity in discipline jccp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The percentage of minority students
suspended and expelled from school exceeds their representation in
many school districts in Connecticut, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   Minority students receive nearly half of all the suspensions and
expulsions statewide, but make up less than 1/3 of the student
population, the state's disciplinary offense report found. The
numbers were reported to the state for the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
   In Norwalk, minorities make up 50 percent of the population but
account for 69 percent of punished offenses. In West Haven, 39
percent of students are minorities while accounting for 52 percent
of the cases. In Ansonia, minorities make up 28 percent of the
population and 42 percent of the discipline cases.
</P>
<P>
   Minority advocates expressed concern over the finding, while
some school officials demanded a recount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a perception that black kids need a harsher
discipline than whiter students,'' said Wayne Winston, co-chairman
of the Bridgeport education committee of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Orfield, a Harvard professor and leading desegregation
expert, said he is disturbed but not surprised by the rate at which
minority students in Connecticut are disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of a long-established pattern,'' Orfield said.
</P>
<P>
   A June report by the Civil Rights Project, which Orfield
co-directs, found that while black children represent 17 percent of
public school enrollment, they comprise 32 percent of suspensions.
Another report, issued by the U.S. Department of Education in 1997,
found that almost 25 percent of all black male students were
suspended at least once over a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Murphy, assistant school superintendent in Ansonia, said
officials would not tolerate any evidence of unfair discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ''If differentiated discipline should emerge, we would instantly
step in to see it not happen,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the discipline disparity is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the answer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stratford School Superintendent Raymond O'Connell also couldn't
explain why minorities are disciplined more often than whites in
Stratford. Stratford officials contend the figures they sent to the
state are wrong, possibly because they confused the code for white
and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Murphy, spokesman for the state Department of Education,
said the purpose of the report is to give local districts and the
state Legislature a better understanding of what's happening in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the numbers do raise concerns that we expect school
districts will address,'' Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas building cashless slot machines, out to alter gambling habits </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERNON, N.Y. (AP) - The Oneida Indian Nation wants to change the
way people gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In an aging, one-time lawnmower plant, the Oneidas are building
a new advanced cashless gaming system that allows patrons to make
dinner reservations, go shopping or set a golf tee-off time even as
they play for the big jackpot. It also can give casino operators a
profile of their customers and a way to better tailor their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are trying to do is bring the entire resort to the
person in the most convenient way,'' said Frank Riolo, president of
the Oneida's new enterprise, Standing Stone Gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the process, we get to know our customers,'' said Riolo,
who also serves as chief operating officer of the Oneida's hugely
successful Turning Stone casino-resort hotel-convention center
complex, which has more than 3 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to know your customers, why your customers came to
you and what you need to do to bring them back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas envision their gambling machines one day replacing
the traditional coin-operated machines that fill mainstream casinos
in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, America's gambling meccas.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the Oneidas expect to put their machines in Native
American gambling halls nationwide, especially in states like New
York that outlaw conventional slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   The machines look like a video game terminal and record credits
and debits like an ATM, offering dozens of games, including keno,
lotto and draw poker. Instead of pumping quarters into slots,
customers are issued identification cards to access the machines
and gamble. Unlike other slot machines, which each operate
independently, the Oneidas machines are all hooked to a central
computer that controls the results and collects the data.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have already struck a deal to furnish 45 machines
for the Swinowash Indians' casino in Washington state. More orders
could come from Washington's Lummi Indians, who have reached a
tentative pact with the Oneidas to serve as consultants for their
35,000-square-foot casino.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from three other Washington tribes, a California
tribe and two Las Vegas slot machine manufacturers have visited
Turning Stone to assess the Oneida II system, Riolo said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Indian Gaming Association, there are
198 tribal governments running 326 gaming operations in 24 states -
all potential customers, as Riolo sees it. In California alone,
which recently approved the cashless video games, Native Americans
operate more than three dozen gaming operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nickel in the slot'' machines first appeared in the mid-1800s
and awarded cigars and free drinks. The first coin-operated
counter-wheel machine was patented in 1892 by Gustave Schultz of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the basic machine has gone through many innovations
until it reached its contemporary form where each machine is
operated by an internal computer. The last big advancement in slot
technology was the bill acceptor first introduced in the early
1980s, a concept borrowed from the vending industry.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first suggested, critics suggested it would never
catch on because most slot players are low-level coin gamblers and
would never put $20 in a machine at one time, Riolo said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the bill acceptor is why the slot machine has
become the most popular casino game, accounting for as much as 50
percent to 80 percent of a casino's business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Oneidas believe the proliferation of ATM machines
have conditioned people to readily use a card, there has been
resistance to the idea of cashless slot machines, said an industry
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's when the player decides it will catch on,'' said Stuart
Linde, who follows the gaming industry for Lehman Brothers. ''If
you put two machines side by side, they like to hear the coins.
They like to feel it. They like to have control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the industry would like to see the change, added
Linde.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going cashless really reduces costs. Handling money is
expensive,'' he said. ''You have to pay people to come in and fill
the hoppers. Sometimes, that takes as much as 45 minutes - time
that machine isn't making any money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas are the first Native American tribe to build their
own cashless gaming machines, according to the National Indian
Gaming Association. Several of the industry's top companies -
Aristocrat, Bally, International Games Technology and Universal -
sell comparable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Riolo, however, believes the Oneida system will flourish because
it can be used with any brand of game terminal. Other manufacturers
sell software that supports only their own terminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas invented their cashless video gambling machines out
of necessity in the mid-1990s while negotiating a gaming compact
with New York state, which has outlawed the traditional
coin-operated slots. Under New York law, a slot machine is defined
as a machine that takes something of value (coins or tokens) and
returns something of value (coin, tokens or receipts).
</P>
<P>
   The first machines were a collaboration between the Oneidas,
computer manufacturer Stratus Computer, software company S2 Systems
and game terminal manufacturer U.S. Games, now Leisure Time.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas started with 350 of their original video machines on
the floor at Turning Stone. Today, the casino has nearly 1,200. The
Oneidas will place 50 of the new machines in the casino next month.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Farrah Fawcett admits she is anything but an
angel.
</P>
<P>
   But the former ''Charlie's Angels'' star says she doesn't abuse
drugs or alcohol, contrary to media and industry speculation that
has dogged her for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take no drugs,'' says Fawcett, 53, in the September issue of
Movieline. ''I don't drink either. I don't like the taste. The only
thing I'll have is a glass of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stories about me make it seem as if I'm holed up in some motel
room shooting up or something. Anyone who knows me knows that my
time off is spent either at the gym or playing paddle tennis or in
the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett, who had a son with actor Ryan O'Neil, with whom she
lived for 17 years, also enjoys aspects of her single life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like spontaneity, the infatuation. You know, the fun part of
the relationship. I like the beginnings, the first few months
before you find out who they really are.''
</P>

   Fawcett, who posed nude for Playboy magazine at the age of 50,
will appear with Richard Gere in Robert Altman's film ''Dr. T and
the Women'' in the fall.

<HEADLINE> 16 Die in Kashmir Violence  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- A series of explosions and gunbattles rocked
the Himalayan province of Kashmir on Sunday, leaving 16 people dead
and dozens injured in stepped-up violence before India's
Independence Day celebrations, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Kud, two land mines exploded under buses
carrying Indian paramilitary troops, authorities said. Six troops
were killed and 40 injured, 10 critically.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen -- the largest of the
Muslim rebel groups here -- claimed responsibility for the mine
explosions at Kud, 50 miles north of Jammu, the winter capital of
Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would increase attacks against Indian troops
here. The province is the seat of an Islamic insurgency that has
left 25,000 people dead in the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to end Indian rule in Kashmir and our
activities will escalate,'' Salim Hashmi, a Hezb-ul Mujahedeen
spokesman in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, told The Associated
Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The buses were part of a convoy carrying security personnel to
Srinagar, 185 miles to the north, ahead of Tuesday's Independence
Day celebration. Militants fighting Indian security forces in
Kashmir usually increase violence against the government during the
run-up to the Aug. 15 celebration, and separatist guerrilla groups
have vowed to wreck the festivities again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, an army foot patrol sighted militants in a remote,
mountainous area 160 miles north of Jammu and opened fire on them.
An ensuing gunbattle left 10 rebels dead, Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra
said. No army casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The army described the killings as a major success in its
intensified anti-militancy operations on the eve of Indian
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the province, three smaller explosions injured two
people Sunday. In Srinagar, police sealed an area around the Bakshi
Stadium where the Independence Day parade is held every year.
Militants usually fire rockets and grenades toward the stadium to
disrupt the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police set up metal barricades on the roads to check all
vehicles in the area. Passengers on buses were frisked with metal
detectors. Many residents stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainous province of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, both of which claim it in its entirety. The Islamic
guerillas want Indian-controlled Kashmir to break away from heavily
Hindu India and either remain independent or become part of mostly
Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks here increased after Kashmir's main guerrilla group, the
Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, called off a brief cease-fire
this week. The group wanted India to involve Pakistan in talks on
resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, militants set off two powerful bombs in downtown
Srinagar, killing 14 soldiers and journalists and wounding 25
others. On Saturday, suspected guerrillas lobbed a grenade near a
mosque in Srinagar, wounding two Hungarian and two Kashmiri women.

<HEADLINE> New Guardhouse Decks Berlin Wall  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The guardhouse went up again at Berlin's infamous
Checkpoint Charlie on Sunday, and parts of the Berlin Wall are to
be rebuilt at the border crossing where Cold War powers faced off
just yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin isn't about to become a divided city again. This time,
the guards wearing U.S. and British military uniforms were just
Germans in costume. They were participating in the unveiling of a
guardhouse rebuilt to stand as a reminder to future generations of
the barrier that divided a country -- and Europe and the world along
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our duty is to maintain and salvage what was once here,'' said
Rainer Hildebrandt, head of the Museum at Checkpoint Charlie and a
leading force behind preserving the memory of the scar that ran
through Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly 39 years ago Sunday that construction began on
the Wall. East German leaders called it an ''Anti-Fascist
Protection Barrier'' -- although the real goal of the Wall was to
stop the thousands of their citizens who were leaving for the West.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Wall went up, people could travel freely across
Berlin, and many who lived in one part of the city worked in the
other. That all changed after Aug. 13, 1961, when, without any
warning, East German soldiers began stringing lengths of barbed
wire and building barriers across the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, nearly 1,000 people died trying to
cross the border between the divided Germany, including 235 killed
at the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Checkpoint Charlie -- so named because it was the third
checkpoint in the city after Alpha and Bravo -- got its first
guardhouse on Sept. 22, 1961. In the months afterward, both the
United States and Soviet Union stationed their tanks there on what
became the front line in the Cold War, known for its trademark
''You are leaving the American sector'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Those tanks wouldn't move until after Nov. 9, 1989. That was the
day East Germans streamed through the border after the government
decided to lift the travel restrictions that had been in place for
more than 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   After it fell, Berliners were more than eager to tear down all
signs of the Wall. Thousands of tourists with hammers chipped
pieces away, and much of the Wall was ground up and used to make
roads. The previous guardhouse at Checkpoint Charlie was removed
June 22, 1990 as diplomats from the Allied powers looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 10 years after the Wall fell, there have been
increasing efforts to try and preserve the memory of the most
visible manifestation of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new white, wooden guardhouse that stands in
an island in the road at Checkpoint Charlie, the museum hopes to
restore elements of the entire barrier system, which included tank
traps, dog runs and the no man's land in between the Wall's two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration work also has begun across town on one of the
largest remaining strips of the Wall, the so-called East Side
Gallery. After 1989, artists there decorated what was once the
untouchable eastern side of the barrier with pictorial odes to
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The new Checkpoint Charlie guardhouse ''must always remind us
how easy it is to divide people, and how long it takes and what
effort it costs to bring them together again,'' Eduard
Shevardnadze, president of Georgia and a former Soviet foreign
minister, said in a letter sent to the Sunday ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Nigel Dunkley, military attache to the British Embassy,
remembered the hard stares he received from East German border
officers and the cameras that watched his every move when passing
through the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''The younger generation does not have any concept of the
oppressive atmosphere,'' he said after the unveiling. ''We tend to
forget how terrible it was and it's not a bad idea to remind
people.''

<HEADLINE> Connecticut delegates get front seat at Democratic convention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Connecticut's delegation to the Democratic
National Convention this week has suddenly found itself taking a
front seat after the selection of Senator Joseph Lieberman as Vice
President Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 67 delegates originally were placed at the back of
the convention floor. But with Connecticut's junior senator now
Gore's vice presidential running mate, the delegates have been
moved to the front, next to Gore's home state of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we'd be in the backwater, and now we're the stars;
no, the second stars,'' said Dennis O'Neil, an alternate from
Litchfield.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil is hoping to brandish a replica of the UConn women's
basketball team's NCAA championship trophy in front of the
neighboring Tennessee delegates. The University of Tennessee's Lady
Volunteers lost to the Lady Huskies in the tournament final in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is expected to cast 67 votes this week for Gore as
the party's nominee for president, including 17 ballots from
supporters of Bill Bradley. Bradley lost to Gore in the Democratic
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Paindiris, chairman of the Bradley campaign in Connecticut
and a Glastonbury delegate, said he is behind the ticket. One
reason is Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more energized than ever before,'' Paindiris said.
''We're part of the action. It's almost like being a Tennessee
delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's elevated status has given O'Neil a reason to care
about the political process again.
</P>
<P>
   ''That the daughter of Holocaust survivors can stand on the
threshold of a dream, it can only happen here,'' O'Neil said,
referring to Lieberman's wife, Hadassah.
</P>
<P>
   William Moriarty, a Waterbury resident attending his first
convention, said the event has taken on new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've moved up to the front of the pack now,'' Moriarty said.
''He's No. 2 on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut delegates will have their choice of star-studded
parties. They've received hundreds of invitations, from a concert
featuring Barbara Streisand, Whoopi Goldberg and Boyz II Men to a
tribute to Lieberman tonight sponsored by the Interstate Natural
Gas Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be one of the most exciting weeks of my
life,'' Moriarty said.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Looks Worriedly Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- When soldiers here staged their
Christmas Eve coup, they announced themselves by holding up a
supermarket, robbing residents and cruising this sprawling city in
looted four-wheel-drives, firing automatic weapons into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, the general those soldiers brought to power
remembers the putsch as a smooth transition -- a ''velvet
revolution,'' as he puts it -- all the while calling for calm as the
increasingly uneasy West African nation moves toward upcoming
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas from Gen. Robert Guei may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast -- once an island of stability in one of the world's
most troubled regions -- faces a conjunction of political and
military turmoil in coming weeks that some fear could lead to
widespread unrest, and perhaps even tear the country apart.
</P>
<P>
   In a dingy, concrete meeting hall in the working class
neighborhood of Abobo, hundreds of people pumped their fists in the
air on a recent evening, shouting support for the man they want as
Ivory Coast's next president: opposition leader Alassane Dramane
Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was illegal, since campaigning is not allowed until
two weeks before the Sept. 17 presidential vote. Hulking security
guards in warmup jackets eye the sea of taxi drivers, housekeepers
and construction workers streaming into the hall while scanning the
street for soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tension, Ouattara's candidacy remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute amendment to the country's new constitution
stipulates that both parents of presidential candidates must be
''of Ivorian origin.'' The change is widely believed to be aimed at
excluding Ouattara, a former prime minister and top official with
the International Monetary Fund whose opponents insist his parents
were from neighboring Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes beyond presidential politics, reflecting a
complex history of religious, ethnic and geographic suspicion
between northerners -- most of them Muslims who support Ouattara --
and the southern Christians who long dominated the Ivorian
government.
</P>
<P>
   To Ouattara's many supporters, his exclusion is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would completely divide the country,'' said Brahima Camara,
20, taking a break at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   And if he can't run?
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have a civil war,'' he said simply, echoing a comment
made repeatedly by Ouattara's supporters. ''I want to avoid that,
but he should be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the possibility of war is fiercely debated, the idea would
have been dismissed just a couple of years ago. Ivory Coast was the
star of West Africa, a nation with 40 years of stable civilian
government and an economy that dwarfed its neighbors'.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed quickly here. Battered by plummeting prices
for its main exports, cocoa and coffee, the economy faltered.
</P>
<P>
   With jobs disappearing, Ivory Coast's welcoming attitude toward
immigrants -- some 40 percent of its 19 million residents come from
elsewhere -- began souring. The now-ousted president, Henri Konan
Bedie, launched a series of ethnically divisive policies.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this brew came the December coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   Although initially popular among Ivorians, who were weary of the
Bedie regime's alleged corruption and ethnic favoritism, the junta
has left many people disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Guei took control promising to heal the country's ethnic rifts.
But the questions over Ouattara's candidacy have instead made them
worse.
</P>
<P>
   And Guei, who stepped into the post-coup spotlight pledging to
quickly step down, now has a well-oiled political machine seeking
his presidential nomination -- by the former ruling party that his
soldiers forced from power.
</P>
<P>
   Like much in Ivory Coast these days, Guei's ambitions reflect
the overlap of military and political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's moves to remain in power have alienated some of his
military allies, according to a report in the Abidjan-based
independent newspaper Le Jour, which said some junta members are
asking that Guei resign if he wants to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers, meanwhile, say the security forces are increasingly
fractured along political lines, with various groups backing Guei,
Ouattara and the ousted Bedie, who vows to return for the elections
from his forced exile in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Twice since the coup, unrest in the ranks over unpaid bonuses
has flared into mutiny. Tensions rose sharply after a two-day July
rebellion, when rioting soldiers looted banks and stores. Weeks
later, the promised bonuses remain unpaid, and soldiers say anger
is bubbling again.
</P>
<P>
   While such divisions are unsettling to many Ivorians, Guei's
supporters use them for political gain, arguing that only a general
can keep Ivory Coast from devolving into anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to Gen. Guei, we have avoided a bloodbath,'' said Balla
Keita, the general's political adviser. ''He's someone who can keep
the soldiers in the barracks ... Ouattara can't do that. No one
else can do that.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State Might Be Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's president said Sunday that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may put off plans to declare an
independent Palestinian state on Sept. 13, the deadline for a final
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may happen, I don't know and I can't say this, but I
believe the delay may take place,'' President Hosni Mubarak told
reporters as he inaugurated a scientific research center. ''We
don't want any clash between the two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat repeatedly has said he will declare an independent state
Sept. 13, and Egypt has been among Arab nations to say that they
would recognize a Palestinian state whenever Arafat chooses to
declare it.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian officials have said that Arab countries,
under pressure from the United States, urged Arafat to postpone the
declaration of independence to give another chance to talks with
Israel. Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker has been
briefing Arab leaders on U.S. positions and urging them not to do
anything to lessen chances for a resumption of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said in Jerusalem that the
Palestinians are reluctant to change the deadline because they do
not want negotiations with Israel to go on ''without a ceiling,
open-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My instructions from Arafat, and this we've conveyed to the
Israelis, are to reach an agreement with the Israelis no later than
Sept. 13,'' Erekat said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad said the decision on
a date for a declaration was not final. ''The PLO's ruling body
will meet at the end of August, early September to make a final
decision on the date for a declaration,'' Zayyad told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, a key mediator in the Mideast peace process, said a
deal between Israel and the Palestinians before the deadline was
possible -- but his words were not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue needs hard and combined efforts and, God willing, I
hope we will strike a deal, but I can't say if that will be before
or after Sept 13,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's acting foreign minister, said in a
telephone interview with Israeli television that he thinks Arafat
will not declare a state by that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there will be a unilateral declaration, it will be very
harmful for the peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is scheduled to visit Jordan
on Wednesday for talks with King Abdullah II, who has been trying
to bridge the gaps between the Palestinians and the Israelis, a
government official and the Israeli Embassy announced.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a two-week summit with Arafat and Barak collapsed over
the issue of Jerusalem's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered the Palestinians limited control over parts of
east Jerusalem, but Arafat held firm on Palestinians' demand for
full sovereignty over the traditionally Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   East Jerusalem contains sites holy to Muslims, Christians and
Jews, including the third-holiest shrine in the Islamic world.
Israel has long said that Jerusalem must remain united under
Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking support for the Palestinians' position, Arafat made a
brief stop in Pakistan on Sunday en route to China.
</P>
<P>
   He was to meet Pakistan's army ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
Pakistan is a longtime supporter of the Palestinians and does not
recognize the state of Israel or let its citizens travel there.

<HEADLINE> Castro Speaks on His 74th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A politically recharged President Fidel Castro
marked his 74th birthday Sunday with a speech to a graduating class
of health care workers -- communist Cuba's new ambassadors to the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ''These Cuban health care workers will leave an indelible
imprint as they travel around the world, providing their services
and sowing medical schools in other lands,'' Castro said at the
ceremony. ''Today, it gives us immense satisfaction to take part in
the graduation of 4,000 new members of the glorious contingent of
professionals who bring such honor to the homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of greetings delivered to Castro by several
speakers at the graduation, there was no public birthday
celebration Sunday. But Castro, born Aug. 13, 1926 in the eastern
Cuban town of Biran, would seem to have much to celebrate this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader recently won a major political victory with the
return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba after a protracted
fight with the child's Miami relatives, who fought to keep him in
the United States. Over seven months, the man who has ruled this
communist island for 41 years mobilized tens of thousands of Cubans
almost daily in mass gatherings demanding the child's return to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   While many here grew weary of the rallies, Castro was able to
increase interest in politics among the nation's youth, who he
hopes will carry on his communist ideals after he is gone. The
international missions by health care workers appear to be another
strategy for spreading Cuba's message of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we have 22 medical schools and over 67,000 doctors,''
Castro said Sunday at the graduation in a plaza in front of the
U.S. Interests Section, the American mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are about 1,700 Cuban health workers completing
international missions, according to Cuba's state media. Earlier
this year, Castro promised to dispatch as many as 3,000 doctors to
developing nations, saying the program ''could save at least 1
million lives each year in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Cuban doctors defected recently while on an international
mission in Zimbabwe. The two -- Leonel Cordova Rodriguez, 31, and
Noris Pena Martinez, 25 -- were granted refugee status and flown to
the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors first sought asylum several months ago. During the
process, they said, they were kidnapped by Zimbabwean security
officers, who helped Cuban diplomats force them onto a flight to
Havana. Air France refused to let them board during a stopover in
South Africa after the doctors slipped a note to a crew member
saying they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba said the doctors betrayed the medical mission to aid
Zimbabwe's health service but denied any involvement in the alleged
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring specifically to that case Sunday, Castro
criticized ''imperialist'' nations that ''offer money and make all
kinds of promises to our doctors, hoping to bribe them into
defection and treason, heedless of the lives that would be lost as
a result.''

<HEADLINE> Hollow Man, Cowboys Top Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Curmudgeon astronauts and an invisible maniac
topped the movie marquees, with scab football players and
May-December lovers close behind.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible scientist thriller ''Hollow Man'' and the
geriatric NASA adventure ''Space Cowboys'' tied for first place at
the weekend box office with $13.1 million apiece, according to
studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings could change when final numbers are released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, debuted
at No. 1 while Clint Eastwood's ''Space Cowboys'' opened in third
place a week earlier. But ''Space Cowboys'' held more strongly in
its second weekend, its take dropping just 28 percent, compared
with a 50 percent drop for ''Hollow Man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual weekend, with no film dominating and the top
seven movies bunched within a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Autumn in New York,'' the Richard Gere-Winona Ryder
tearjerker, debuted at No. 3 with $11.5 million. Keanu Reeves and
Gene Hackman's ''The Replacements,'' a comedy about misfit players
during a football strike, opened in fourth place with $11.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Two holdovers were No. 5 and 6, ''Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps'' with $10.3 million and ''What Lies Beneath'' with $9.8
million. The supernatural tale ''Bless the Child,'' starring Kim
Basinger and Jimmy Smits, premiered at No. 7 with $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   August typically is a slow month for Hollywood. With summer
waning, films cluster together and post smaller grosses as
''blockbuster fatigue sets in,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''This weekend was sort of a horse race. A slow horse race, but
still a horse race,'' Dergarabedian said. ''Unless you have films
like 'Sixth Sense' from last August that grab the national
consciousness, it's tough to have any record-breaking grosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the top 12 films grossed $97.7 million, down 13.7
percent from last year and continuing a summer slump behind 1999's
record summer revenues of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Autumn in New York'' posted the best per-theater average among
wide-release films at $5,100 in 2,255 cinemas. That compared to
$4,621 in 2,835 theaters for ''Space Cowboys'' and $4,432 in 2,956
cinemas for ''Hollow Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gere and Ryder's film debuted solidly even though distributor
MGM chose not to screen it for reviewers beforehand, usually a sign
the movie is a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gleason, MGM head of distribution, said the studio
scrapped advance screenings because of the somber subject matter, a
romance between a man and a dying younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our best judgment was that it would have gotten disappointing
reviews basically saying that even though it's beautifully
photographed, it's really a downer,'' Gleason said. ''This is a
movie that plays to upscale audiences who are the ones most
affected by adverse reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ''What Lies Beneath'' climbed to $112.1 million, the
10th movie released this year to hit $100 million. The studio's
''Chicken Run,'' with $99.9 million, is expected to pass that mark
Monday and surpass ''The Prince of Egypt'' later this week as
DreamWorks' highest-grossing animated movie.
</P>
<P>
   In limited release, cult director John Waters scored an
impressive opening for his madcap assault on Hollywood filmmaking,
''Cecil B. DeMented,'' starring Stephen Dorff and Melanie Griffith.
The movie took in $130,000 at nine theaters for a $14,444 average.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Blethyn's marijuana comedy ''Saving Grace'' had a good
second weekend with $358,000 at 35 theaters and a $10,229 average.
Distributor Fine Line plans to expand the film to nearly 300
theaters next weekend and add a few hundred more later.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   1. (tie). ''Hollow Man,'' $13.1 million.	   1. (tie). ''Space Cowboys,''

<HEADLINE> Crowd in Malaysia Backs Anwar  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Nearly 1,000 people gathered
outside a maximum-security prison on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur
on Sunday to demand freedom for jailed former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was the fourth anti-government rally since a
high court judge on Tuesday convicted Anwar of sodomy and sentenced
him to nine years in prison atop the six years he is serving for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who was sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
arrested in September 1998, denies all the charges, saying they
were trumped up by his political enemies to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of riot police gripping shields and armed with tear gas
launchers stood in formation within the compound in Sungai Buloh,
37 miles north of the capital, where Anwar is imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freedom for Anwar!'' cried the men, women and children, who
released a half-dozen pigeons and doves, along with scores of
balloons, into the stormy sky. ''God is great! Freedom to the
people!''
</P>
<P>
   They sang patriotic songs, yelled ''Reformasi,'' the cry for
political reform, and demanded the resignation of Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   They held up banners reading ''Happy Birthday Anwar!'' and
''Liberate the judiciary!'' Anwar turned 53 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has repeatedly lambasted the judiciary, accusing it of
allowing itself to be manipulated by his one-time mentor, Mahathir,
who has ruled Malaysia for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir criticized other countries for saying that the judicial
system in Malaysia is not good, a news report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is the same too,'' he said. ''... The same thing
happened in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries who issued statements condemning Malaysia over the
recent verdict against Anwar include the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand, the national news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition activists have announced plans for a rally in the
country's biggest sports stadium, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur,
and to launch a national movement against Mahathir, starting in the
opposition-controlled states in northern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Several police trucks and a water cannon truck were on the scene
Sunday, but there was no attempt to disperse the crowd, which
demonstrated for an hour and then drove off in a convoy of more
than 100 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel invigorated by all the support,'' said Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, who was at the prison with her four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition leader in the Democratic Action Party, Lim Kit
Siang, called the verdict ''a cruel and unconscionable political
persecution'' and urged Malaysians to vote Mahathir out.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something very dark in the Malaysian national soul
which is completely alien to the most rudimentary notions of
decency and justice,'' he said in a statement. ''This corruption of
the national soul must be purged.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic's Challenger Blasts U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's main
challenger at upcoming national elections in Yugoslavia slammed the
United States on Sunday, saying no Serb should ever forget last
year's NATO bombing of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While naming Milosevic as the main culprit for Serbia's hardship
in the past decade, Vojislav Kostunica, the presidential candidate
of most of the pro-democracy parties in the upcoming election, said
Washington has been ''evil'' to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who bombed Serbia could have avoided March 24,''
Kostunica said, referring to the first day of NATO's 1999 attacks.
''Their responsibility is somewhat bigger because their power is
greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's comments during a meeting of his Serbian Democratic
Party reflect a widespread anti-American sentiment among Serbs, who
believe Washington's policy of imposing sanctions was unjust,
despite Milosevic's responsibility for bloodshed in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, considered a moderate nationalist who has stayed out
of various failed opposition deals, enjoys the greatest support by
far among Serbs, recent independent polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts fear, however, that Milosevic will rig the Sept.
24 national elections for president and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In Podgorica, Montenegro's pro-Western leader Milo Djukanovic
said in comments published Sunday that the upcoming elections were
a farce and that his government would resist outside pressure to
take part.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, whose tiny republic and Serbia make up Yugoslavia,
told a gathering of Montenegrin diaspora on Saturday that the
elections only serve to give ''legitimacy to the Belgrade
dictatorship,'' Montenegro's official Montena fax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, a former Milosevic ally, has been taking steps
toward independence, raising fears of Milosevic's armed
intervention in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's leadership has cited recent constitutional changes
which downgrade the republic's position in the federation as the
reason for the election boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has rejected appeals by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Serb pro-democracy forces to reconsider his
boycott decision.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Singer Erikson Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Rev. Artur Erikson, a popular
Lutheran singer who wrote more than 600 songs, has died. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson died Thursday at his home in Gagnef, 120 miles northwest
of the capital, Stockholm, according to Swedish media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson got his start in music from his father, a singing
minister who often took his son along as he toured the country. The
boy made his stage debut at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Erikson became a minister in Sweden's dominant Lutheran
church and took his own act on the road for 15 years. He made
frequent radio appearances starting in 1956 and became a household
name in the early 1960s as a guest on Sweden's most popular
television talk show, Hyland's Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson, whose repertoire spanned from gospel to psalms, topped
the local charts in 1970, with his song ''To My Sister.'' Erikson
recorded and produced 28 albums, earning six gold records.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Kajsa.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Burial Spawns Thai Tourism  </HEADLINE>
By MICOOL BROOKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHUN YUAM, Thailand (AP) -- As World War II dragged to a bloody
close in 1945, Imperial Japan's 15th army was in retreat from
Burma. About 20,000 wounded and exhausted soldiers died during the
long march home.
</P>
<P>
   Their death -- and their memories -- are bringing unexpected
prosperity to this dirt-poor border village: It was here, at a
Buddhist temple-turned-field hospital, where many of the Japanese
soldiers breathed their last.
</P>
<P>
   A joint Japanese-Thai excavation program to find the remains,
plus pilgrimages by Japanese veterans and their families to honor
the war dead, have spawned a tourism industry catering especially
to the Japanese, the local police chief said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of its fascinating history, Khun Yuam is on the road
to becoming ... like the bridge on the River Kwai,'' said Lt. Col.
Cherdchai Chomchavat, referring to the bridge on the infamous Death
Railway that Japanese forces built using Allied prisoners as
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands were buried in and around Khun Yuam, which has
remained virtually unchanged over the last five decades -- a
one-street village of about 100 families, mostly subsistence
farmers living in thatch-roofed bamboo huts set amid lush wild
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials first surveyed the Khun Yuam area in 1978,
when they excavated 362 remains near the border with Burma, now
known as Myanmar. A joint survey with the Thai Fine Arts Department
conducted in 1998 estimated that as many as 7,000 remains are
present at 39 locations in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, about two dozen Japanese make the arduous trip every
weekend to Khun Yuam, 500 miles northwest of the Thai capital of
Bangkok. They first travel by train or by road to the town of Mae
Hong Son, then complete the remaining 40-mile journey by taxis or
buses on a potholed road.
</P>
<P>
   Most make a day trip, though a 12-room guesthouse opened in the
village earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate ''Victory Japan Day,'' the day Japan ceased
hostilities in 1945, relatives plan private services Tuesday at the
Japanese War Museum in Khun Yuam. The museum houses a large
collection of war relics, including rifles, swords, helmets, bugles
and heavy machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing interesting other than World War II military
history and the skeletons of dead soldiers,'' said Cherdchai, the
police chief, who also is the museum's curator.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the village is the sprawling 100-year-old Muay
To temple complex, which housed the Japanese 15th Army's field
hospital. The makeshift facility treated soldiers who marched
through hundreds of miles of jungle to reach the sanctuary of
Thailand, a wartime ally, after the failed invasion of India and
the debacle in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Around the temple -- a renovated modern structure of gold painted
slanted roof -- are shrines built by the Japanese relatives. Most
are gravestone-style memorials dedicated to ''warriors of heaven,''
each surrounded by a metal gate.
</P>
<P>
   Cherdchai said the construction of the shrines generated
employment in the village. Some Japanese are also funding charity
programs and student scholarships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   War veteran Nagase Takashi, 83, spent $15,000 of his pension
this year to build a ''Stars and Dew'' temple at Khun Yuam to honor
fallen Japanese soldiers, including his brother-in-law. The temple
is a spartan prayer room, the far end dominated by a large metallic
statue of a sitting Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi, a resident of Kurashiki city, told the AP during a
recent visit that he was compelled to do something to honor the
15th Army's war dead.

   LOURDES, France (AP) -- Former Nobel Peace Prize winners gathered
Sunday in southwest France to celebrate a ''Night of Peace'' that
was expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors, pilgrims and
international humanitarians.
</P>
<P>
   Argentinean laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Cambodian Tum
Chanareth and Mairead Maguire, an Irish peace activist, were among
the former Nobel prize winners that shared the vision of peace and
nonviolence for children worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarians and religious figures were also scheduled to
address the crowd gathered in Lourdes, the site of a Catholic
healing shrine which draws more than 4 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by the French group, Appeal by the Nobel
Peace Prize Laureates, to promote a United Nations resolution which
calls for peace for the children in the world in the new
millennium's first decade, the group said.

<HEADLINE> Men Held for Weapons in Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ten men were detained after French
peacekeepers discovered a cache of grenades, ammunition and radios
in northern Kosovo, NATO-led peacekeepers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were found Saturday in the divided city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, where speculation that the United Nations plans to take
over a Serb-controlled lead smelting plant has heightened tensions
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeepers who patrol the predominantly Serb northern
sector of the city seized the weapons after noticing a man with a
two-way radio standing outside a shed.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers cordoned off the area, a U.N statement said. A
search of the premises unearthed the grenades, ammunition and
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people were then turned over to U.N. police. Maj. Craig T.
Snow, a spokesman for NATO-led peacekeepers, could not immediately
confirm whether they were Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen in the industrial city over the fate of the
plant in the nearby town of Zvecan, just north of Kosovska
Mitrovica. Last week, U.N. officials said that the plant was
spewing pollution into the air, raising lead levels to 200 times
the accepted World Health Organization norms. The United Nations
immediately launched a public awareness campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of solidarity, Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders
joined with U.N. personnel to publicly have their blood tested.
Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic claimed the lead scare is an
excuse for the United Nations to take over the Zvecan plant.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbs and ethnic Albanians living in the same community,
Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically mixed city in Kosovo --
and the most violence-prone.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against
separatists in Kosovo. After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to
withdraw last year, ethnic Albanians began attacking Serbs as
revenge.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill Russian Convoy Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters ambushed a Russian convoy
near the Chechen capital, killing three soldiers and wounding 10,
officials said Sunday, a day after the top pro-Moscow leader in
Chechnya claimed rebel forces were no longer a major threat.
</P>
<P>
   Two armored personnel carriers were passing through the village
of Prigorodnoye just outside Grozny on Saturday when rebels
attacked, an official with the pro-Russian Chechen government said
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops returned fire, and the battle continued for 40
minutes, the official said. It was not known if the rebels suffered
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush came a day after Russia's top civilian leader in
Chechnya, Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov, claimed the rebels were too
scattered to pose a threat to Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in the breakaway republic have refrained from
launching major attacks for weeks, instead relying on ambushes and
other guerrilla tactics to wear down the Russians. They have
acknowledged weapons shortages, but show little sign of giving up
their fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians pushed into Chechnya last September after
withdrawing at the end of a 1994-96 war. But they have yet to take
back the southern third of the republic, where mountains and
forests provide ample cover for the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Writers Detained in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Two pro-reform Iranian writers were arrested
just as they were being honored by their peers as the best in their
fields, reports said Sunday. The imprisonments brought the number
of writers detained to five in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahim Nabavi was on his way to jail Saturday at the time his
name was being called out as best satirist at an awards ceremony
honoring Iranian media, said Karim Arqandehpour, deputy head of the
Press Guild Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi, who had written for several now-banned reformist
newspapers, was interrogated Saturday and ordered jailed by the
judge of the hard-line press court, Saeed Mortazavi, the daily
Hamshahri reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ghoochani was jailed Sunday, a day after he was honored
as best political writer. Ghoochani, who wrote for the now-banned
Asr-e-Azadegan, was summoned to court Saturday. He was seen Sunday
being led from court to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a press festival. This is a press mourning. There
is nothing to celebrate,'' the daily Iran newspaper quoted Rajabali
Mazrouei as saying, presumably at the awards ceremony. Mazrouei is
a lawmaker and a leading member of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front, Iran's largest reformist party.
</P>
<P>
   Another liberal writer, Ahmad Zeidabadi, was supposed to be at
the awards ceremony as a member of the panel of journalists who
acted as judges. He was jailed Aug. 7, one of three other writers
detained recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, 25 newspapers -- all but one pro-reform -- have been
closed down and more than two dozen reformist writers jailed. Most
are being held in Tehran's Evin Prison on the charge of ''insulting
Islamic sanctities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi, whose books are highly popular in Iran, was detained for
a month in September 1998 for his critical satirical writings.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary also summoned Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani
to court Saturday to answer questions related to expenses made by
his ministry in unfinished cultural projects, IRNA reported.
Mohajerani is reviled by hard-liners, who tried to impeach him last
year over the press freedoms he had granted.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners have been fighting a popular reform movement led by
President Mohammad Khatami. The reformists won control of
parliament in February elections, but hard-liners run the
judiciary, military and the broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the parliament, or Majlis, which was scheduled to
debate lifting restrictions on press freedoms, was ordered by
hard-line supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei not to amend the
press law, resulting in scuffles, shouts and a fight in open
session.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, 161 members of the 290-seat Majlis signed a letter
pledging that reforms would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We assure the nation that the recent controversies will not
affect the will of the committed people of Islamic Iran for the
continuation of reforms, and that we, as your representatives,
advise and warn opportunist and reactionary currents to give up
efforts to discourage the people from pursuing reforms,'' said the
letter, obtained by The Associated Press.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Sex and the City's'' Mr. Big is going to

stop?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Noth isn't sure he wants it to be.

   Noth, a Yale School of Drama graduate, dismisses those who
compare him to George Clooney, the last TV star to make the
transition to film stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clooney's got a charm that is really palpable,'' said Noth in
Sunday's editions of the Daily News. ''I'm not sure I have that. No
one is coming to me and offering me a $50 million movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Noth will play Sen. Joe Cantwell in the Broadway revival of Gore
Vidal's ''The Best Man,'' set to open Sept. 17.

</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood's elite shelled out about $1 million to honor
President Clinton this weekend, the money went into campaign
coffers to benefit Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to being first lady, and a candidate, there are
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that been drawn into sharper focus than at this
week's Democratic National Convention, where the president will
deliver his valedictory address to the party faithful Monday night,
a speech preceded by a 10-minute, prime-time, nationally televised
talk by the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers say such exposure is an added plus from the
candidate also being first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of her Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, paints it
in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this shows is that Hillary Clinton has no record of her
own to run on and no base of fund-raising support she can call her
own,'' Lazio spokesman Michael Marr said Sunday. ''It's obvious
that Mrs. Clinton can't win on her own and that she needs
assistance, some real and some imaginary, from the White House in
this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of office - his office - go with her. While
delegates and other candidates arrived in Los Angeles by plane,
train, bus or car, the first lady came with the president on Air
Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just like every other New Yorker, with Secret Service
protection,'' she joked earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   After a small fund-raising reception Sunday hosted by a Los
Angeles-based plastic surgeon - expected to raise another $50,000
for her campaign - President and Mrs. Clinton were to attend a
reception at Sony Pictures Studios hosted by major Jewish
organizations. That could help in New York where the Jewish vote
can be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton remains highly popular among Jews, she
has had problems convincing Jewish voters she shares his strong
commitment to Israel. Polls have shown her Jewish support in New
York below the 60 percent level most analysts believe she needs to
win.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday night's ''Hollywood Gala Salute to President
William Jefferson Clinton,'' the star-studded cast didn't let the
audience of 1,000 forget there was another reason they were there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm backing her 150 percent,'' John Travolta, who played the
Clintonesque figure in the film ''Primary Colors,'' told reporters
as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bolton serenaded the first couple with ''When a Man
Loves a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what it's like to be married to the greatest,'' Lonnie
Ali said from the stage, the former heavyweight champ by her side.
''You have my respect, my admiration and my sympathy. Muhammad and
I wish you every success in your quest for the New York Senate
seat.... You too, madam, are the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the president, daughter Chelsea at their
side, held hands during the tribute. At one point, he put his arm
around his wife. When they took the stage to a standing ovation, he
kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   In her brief remarks, she mentioned only his work, not her
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no such hesitancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really proud of her'' when she decided to run ''because
we could have spent more evenings like this and we could have
simply spent the last year celebrating.... I hope you will help her
win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the president remains popular in New York state - his
job-approval rating hovers above 60 percent - voters there as
elsewhere have expressed displeasure over Clinton scandals,
including his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has sought to profit from that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our country
and dishonored their powerful posts,'' Lazio wrote in a recent
fund-raising letter.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it took Lazio almost a full week on the road to
raise about $1 million, Hillary Clinton - with a lot of help from
her husband - hit that mark on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> VP Vote To Test Paraguay Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguayans dipped their forefingers
in ink Sunday and voted for a vice president to serve beside a
hugely unpopular -- and unelected -- president.
</P>
<P>
   The special, one-office election was seen as a test to this
South American country's shaky democracy. The office has been empty
since Vice President Luis Argana was gunned down in the street in
March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the political chaos that followed his slaying, Luis Gonzalez
Macchi was thrust into the presidency and has since seen his
popularity plummet amid economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million Paraguayans were choosing from three candidates,
and election officials reported no incidents during the early
voting hours on a chilly and cloudy winter day.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls showed the two leading candidates running
even: Julio Cesar Franco, 48, of the opposition Liberal party, and
Argana's 43-year-old son, Felix, of the ruling Colorado Party. The
third candidate, plastics artist Ricardo Buman, is considered a
long shot. He comes from the nascent Humanist Party.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in Paraguay's history that a vice president
will be chosen outside of a presidential election and opposition
members believe they have their best chance in years to break the
stranglehold of the Colorado Party, which has governed Paraguay
since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Argana, an architect and Asuncion city councilman, voted Sunday
morning after visiting his father's tomb. He has cast himself as a
potentially stabilizing force in the troubled administration of
Macchi, the former Senate president who took office after Raul
Cubas resigned as president in the wake of Argana's death. Cubas
was suspected of being involved in Argana's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi's popularity has dipped to less than 20 percent as
Paraguay struggles through a grinding recession.
</P>
<P>
   Argana supporters have suggested his election to office would be
a first step toward justice for his father's death. Argana's murder
remains unsolved, although a Paraguayan judge has accused Lino
Oviedo, an army chief and former political ally of Cubas, of being
the mastermind of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a doctor, has suggested that he would work to have
Macchi removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   After casting his vote in downtown Asuncion, Franco
enthusiastically flashed his ink-stained forefinger to supporters.
Voters are required to dip their fingers in ink after voting in
order to prevent fraud.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Plans Low-Key US Stop  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Without a red carpet or welcome mat,
Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian planned a quiet overnight visit
to this city where Democrats open their national convention Monday.
</P>
<P>
   China protested the 16-hour stopover, while the top Democrat on
the House International Relations Committee complained that the
Clinton administration pressured Chen into not meeting with several
congressmen attending the convention.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chen's first venture abroad as president. The two-week
trip, which also will include stops in the Caribbean, Central
America and Africa., is aimed at strengthening ties with Taiwan's
dwindling number of diplomatic allies. The United States does not
have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but 29 small nations
do.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes amid continuing tension over China's claim that
Taiwan is part of its territory. Chen has tried to improve
unofficial U.S ties while offering conciliatory gestures and summit
invitations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee, had invited about a dozen
Democratic and Republican committee members and others to meet with
Chen at a private residence in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen declined the invitation. While officials in Taiwan
downplayed the cancellation, Gejdenson complained that the State
Department and White House had ''pressured (him) to refrain from
meeting with Congress during his visit'' and keep a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staff member, Amos Hochstein, said Sunday that 12 to
15 members of Congress had been expected to attend. With several
lawmakers in town for the convention ''we thought it would be a
good opportunity to meet with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department publicly objected to such a meeting last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and most other countries recognize only
mainland China, which claims that Taiwan is part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had warned that even the brief stop on U.S. soil could
severely damage U.S. ties with China. In 1995, a more extensive
visit by then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui was followed by
Chinese missile tests near Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting permission to stop in the United States was an
important victory for Chen. In Taiwan, it was viewed as a sign that
Washington trusted Chen would not do anything to disrupt America's
delicate relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese Foreign Ministry official Wu Tzu-dan declined comment
on the cancellation. Asked if Chen still might meet with any
members of Congress individually, Wu said he would only ''wave to
them from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''President Chen will spend most of his time in the hotel'' in
Long Beach where a banquet was scheduled for the Taiwanese leader
and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., in an interview with Associated
Press Television Network, accused the administration of ''groveling
before a dictator'' in its lack of a warm reception for Chen, who
is democratically elected leader of Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> 3 Red Cross Workers Released  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Two Red Cross workers were reunited with their
families in Geneva, after they and their driver were freed Sunday
from nine days' captivity in the remote mountains of northern
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said no ransom had
been paid for the release, while the identity of the kidnappers
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The aid workers -- a French woman, an Italian woman and a
Georgian man -- were handed over to Georgian authorities in the
Pankisi Gorge, near the border with Chechnya, in the early hours of
the morning, and taken to the capital Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Procofieff, 38, of France, and Natascia Zullino, 36, of
Italy and on her first Red Cross mission, were flown to Geneva,
where they rushed across the tarmac to meet a group of 10
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who appeared in good health, smiled and waved to
reporters but did not comment on their ordeal. Their driver, Yuri
Darchiev, was reunited with his family in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very well,'' said Zullino's brother, Daniele. ''We want
to spend time as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not say who the captors were or reveal the
conditions for the release. But Italy's ambassador to Georgia,
Michelangelo Pipan, said in an interview with private Italian TV
network Canale 5 that the captors ''were not Chechen rebels, but in
all probability common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Procofieff had been ending a tour of duty in the valley -- which
hosts several thousand refugees from Chechnya -- and introducing her
successor, Zullino, to the area. The two women and Darchiev had
last been heard from Aug. 3, when they left for the Pankisi Gorge.
Their abandoned car was found in the area two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we can say is that the kidnapping by several armed men
happened on Friday, Aug. 4, and that our three colleagues were held
in several successive places,'' Angelo Gnaedinger, the ICRC general
delegate for Europe, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that they were not subjected to violence,'' added
Gnaedinger, who returned from the Georgia with Procofieff and
Zullino. The ICRC plans to debrief all three workers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gnaedinger said the three hostages were never taken out of
Georgia, after initial fears they had had been taken to Chechnya,
where Russian troops have been battling rebel forces since
September.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian authorities had negotiated with the abductors for
several days. They stressed that ''no ransom was paid,'' Gnaedinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgian negotiator, Mamuka Arershidze, told Russia's NTV
television that the captors demanded that they not be arrested or
tried for the abductions.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups pulled out of Chechnya and surrounding
regions after a wave of kidnappings and killings of Russians and
foreigners that followed the first, 1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
   Six Red Cross workers were killed in 1996 as they slept in
Chechnya's capital Grozny and at least three foreign aid workers
were kidnapped. Kidnapping for ransom became a huge industry in
Chechnya after Russian troops pulled out at the end of the last
war.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups began returning cautiously to the area after Russian
forces entered Chechnya again last September, but only a few aid
workers are inside the republic itself, largely because of security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross suspended its work in the Pankisi Gorge after the
latest kidnapping. It will remain suspended while security measures
are reviewed, Gnaedinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a hurry'' to start again, he said. ''We don't want
the refugees to pay for this.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Criticized on Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The leader of Germany's Jewish
community accused German politicians and society Sunday of not
doing enough to fight neo-Nazis, urging more involvement from
parents and stronger action against far-right Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was before was too little,'' Paul Spiegel, president of
the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said at a ceremony honoring
the anniversary of his predecessor Ignatz Bubis' death.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he died a year ago, Bubis had lamented in an
interview that he had failed to do enough to bring Germans and Jews
together. Although Bubis' remarks were viewed at the time as overly
pessimistic, Spiegel told an audience of 700 people at the Jewish
community center in Frankfurt that Bubis was a ''visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't let ourselves dream that a half-century after the
Holocaust it would be so difficult for the democratic German
society to resist right-extremism,'' Spiegel said. ''Before his
death, Bubis recognized this more clearly than we did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel appealed to parents in Germany to speak to their
children about the threat of neo-Nazis. When parents don't speak
out against violence aimed at foreigners, ''they make it all too
easy to look away and encourage by their silence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish leader also called for authorities to combat hate
sites on the Internet with the same vigilance with which they
pursue child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also called for more
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not acceptable and must be fought with every force and
every legal instrument,'' he said in an interview Sunday in the
Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were continued reports of incidents connected
to neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Five skinheads, aged 18 to 25, were arrested in the southern
city of Konstanz after an attack on two Turkish men, one of whom
was thrown into a lake. The two victims, ages 21 and 22, suffered
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Schleswig, 58 neo-Nazis from across the
country were taken into custody Saturday after police found posters
with extreme-right slogans and baseball bats, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the eastern state of Sachsen-Anhalt also broke up
an attempted gathering Saturday evening to mark the anniversary
next week of the death of Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess. They
arrested 16 people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people have also been arrested in the eastern state
of Thuringia in the last three days in connection with
extreme-right crimes after police conducted a series of raids.

<HEADLINE> USS New Jersey to be moved to restoration site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The USS New Jersey will be moved Tuesday
from the Beckett Street Terminal to the pier where it will be
converted into a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Port Alliance, the nonprofit group that will restore
the ship, said the vessel will be towed to Pier 1 of the South
Jersey Port Corporation's Broadway Terminal at about 2 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There, the ship will undergo a $7.3 million restoration that is
expected to take about 14 months, said retired Capt. David
McGuigan, president of the Home Port Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   McGuigan said the restoration will include underwater hull
inspections and cleaning, hull and topside preservation and
painting, improvements to the teak deck, removal of hazardous
materials and the installation of various security, fire, flood and
safety systems. Some of the ship's interior also will be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Port Alliance plans to spend more than $20 million to
establish the USS New Jersey Memorial, including the ship
restoration, construction of a T-shaped pier and a shoreside
reception, museum and theater complex on the waterfront.

<HEADLINE> Putin To Cut Nuclear Spending  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin has decided to reduce
spending on nuclear forces and shift some of their responsibilities
to the conventional forces, the air force commander said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came at a meeting Friday to debate the future of
Russia's beleaguered military and defuse tensions over control of
the country's nuclear arsenal. Putin, elected in March, has
championed nuclear disarmament as a goal of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency said that at Friday's meeting, ''A
decision was made on the redistribution of financial flows'' away
from the nuclear forces toward the conventional forces. It gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
   Air force commander Anatoly Kornukov, who participated in the
meeting, said on Russian television Saturday that the space missile
defense troops, currently a branch of the Strategic Rocket Forces,
would be put under air force command by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the General Staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, wants to
downgrade the Strategic Rocket Forces by folding them entirely into
the air force, saying Russia must concentrate its meager money on
conventional forces such as those fighting rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal prompted a rare public dispute with Defense
Minister Gen. Igor Sergeyev, a former commander of the nuclear
forces. He argues that Russia needs to improve its nuclear arsenal
to deter possible attacks by other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin won backing from
the Security Council for his proposal to reduce Russia's nuclear
arsenal to 1,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has promised to cut its stockpile -- estimated now at
6,000 warheads -- to 3,000 to 3,500 under the START-II arms
reduction treaty with the United States. A planned START-III
originally envisaged both sides cutting to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, arguing that Russia cannot afford upkeep on so many
weapons, has suggested dropping that to 1,500. Kvashnin wanted even
deeper cuts, to 1,400 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1.2 million-strong armed forces are broke and low on
modern equipment and morale. The Russian Defense Ministry budget
for 2000 is less than $5 billion -- compared to about $268 billion
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Explodes in Bogota  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A car bomb exploded outside a police
station on the capital's outskirts Sunday, injuring a civilian,
amid rural clashes between troops and guerrillas that left at least
13 dead over the weekend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has apparently escalated in the run-up to President
Clinton's planned visit to Colombia on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was intended for a military truck carrying soldiers as
it passed through a working class neighborhood in southern Bogota,
said Alfredo Salgado, assistant director of Colombia's national
police.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosives, packed into a Fiat sedan less than 20 yards
from the police station, exploded minutes after the truck passed
by, damaging several homes and buildings, and injuring one person,
Salgado said. The person was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Police attributed the attack to the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came amid a weekend of fighting in different parts
of Colombia that has left at least three soldiers and 10 guerrillas
dead, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend battle that was still raging Sunday between about 500
FARC guerillas and government soldiers trying to reclaim a
rebel-controlled town has killed at least two soldiers and seven
rebels, said Gen. Heran Cadavid, head of the army's Sixth Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out Saturday afternoon when soldiers moved
into Roncesvalles, a village 125 miles southwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   FARC forces also laid siege to a hydroelectric plant in
Anchicacaya, 215 miles west of Bogota, on Saturday night, and seven
soldiers were wounded as they pursued the rebels, an army
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country's second guerrilla group, the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, on Sunday was concluding a week-long
campaign of attacks to protest a $1.3 billion anti-drug trafficking
aid package for Colombia that Clinton signed into law last month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit Colombia's port city of Cartagena to meet
with President Andres Pastrana and top anti-drug officials.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN vowed last Sunday to set up road blocks on major
highways and stage attacks for a week to protest the aid package.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier and two ELN guerrillas were killed in clashes
Saturday night at a pair of rebel road blocks near the northeastern
towns of Maceo and Segovia, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say ELN rebels also kidnapped dozens of people, destroyed
37 electric power stations, torched 69 cars and trucks and damaged
70 highways during their week of violence.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Swear in Central Government  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARTA, Djibouti (AP) -- More than 2,000 Somali clan elders,
religious leaders, businesspeople and peace activists accomplished
Sunday what the men with guns could not, or would not: They formed
a central government after almost a decade of internecine warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Following a simple inauguration ceremony Sunday, men and women
in traditional multicolored robes lined up outside a huge tent to
be sworn in as Somalia's first legislators in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia, which has a population of about 7 million, has had no
central government since opposition leaders joined forces to oust
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. The country then descended into chaos
as faction leaders turned against one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will put an end to violence. There is no war in the
country, there's just some banditry because of a lack of police and
central authority,'' said Ismael Mahamoud Barreh as he waited in
the suffocating heat to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The Horn of Africa nation's new 225-member parliament grew out
of talks that began May 2 in Arta, 20 miles southwest of Djibouti
city. The legislature will continue to meet in Djibouti, which
border Somalia, until a suitable location can be found in Somalia
and security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, the brainchild of Djibouti President Ismael Omar
Guelleh, is the 13th attempt at finding a solution to Somalia's
turmoil. But it is the first to involve religious and traditional
leaders and other members of civic society rather than just militia
leaders -- the key, observers and delegates say, to its apparent
success.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while optimism abounded at the dusty tent, Western diplomats
and delegates sounded a note of realism.
</P>
<P>
   The country's infrastructure has been virtually destroyed, the
parliament has no money, a number of the powerful faction leaders
have boycotted the conference and the two leaders of the breakaway
regions of Somaliland and Puntland oppose Guelleh's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will put Somalia back on the map but it's not going to be
easy,'' Barreh said. Without a tax base, he estimated that Somalia
will need billions in international aid.
</P>
<P>
   David Stephen, a U.N. observer at the conference, said the
Somalis had already disproved many Western doubters by creating the
assembly. But he acknowledged that the job is far from finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''The magnitude of the task of rebuilding this country without a
government for 10 years cannot be underestimated -- it's massive. No
other country in the world has had no central authority for so
long,'' Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, he said, the legislature needs the support of
Somalis and the international community. However, he added,
Somalia's history has made the West wary.
</P>
<P>
   The largest-ever international peacekeeping mission was deployed
to Somalia from 1992-1995 and was plagued with repeated disasters,
including the deaths of 18 U.S. soldiers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen next in Somalia is unclear. Many have watched
the talks in Djibouti carefully, hopeful that a new government
would be formed to bring them stability. Their fear is that the
faction leaders opposed to the conference will begin a campaign of
violence to disrupt the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But while some militia leaders have voiced skepticism, they have
not denounced the process outright.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of all the uncertainty, Sunday was a day of optimism
for the nation. Members of Somalia's vast diaspora, vital to its
economy, arrived in Djibouti from all corners of the world to
support the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wonderful ... all of Somalia is getting together and I
believe they will accept this government,'' said Asli Abade Parker,
a Somali who flew to Djibouti from Dallas three months ago to
support the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the parliament will hold its first session with its
eldest member elected as a temporary speaker. The legislators will
discuss rules and procedures, elect a permanent speaker and decide
how they should elect a president.	   Once the president is chosen, he or she
will select a prime
minister, who will then appoint a cabinet with the approval of
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Probst Discusses Survivor Criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- ''Survivor'' host Jeff Probst knew he was
going to take some jibes for some of the program's hammy dialogue,
but he didn't expect them to be quite so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know it would be to this degree,'' said Probst, who
has intoned such lines as ''Fire represents life,'' and ''This is
the conch shell of truth'' on the show. ''I've never been
criticized before. And I'm no different from anyone else. I want to
be liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Probst tells ''TV Guide'' in its Aug. 14 edition he knows
how lucky he is to be a part of the summer hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''CBS and (''Survivor'') creator Mark Burnett took a gigantic
risk letting me host the show,'' he said. ''In a star-driven
universe, they could have looked for someone like Regis Philbin or
Dick Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said he was looking for something different in a host.
</P>
<P>
   ''I (wanted) someone who looked like they belonged out there,''
Burnett said. ''Someone who wouldn't be a whiner and wouldn't quit
on me. I didn't need a talking head.''
</P>
<P>
   Probst, 38, has appeared on cable's FX network and has hosted
the VH-1 game show ''Rock and Roll Jeopardy.''

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Survivors in Congo Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A plane carrying 27 people crashed after
it was unable to land at a city in the Congolese interior, an
aviation official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of survivors among the 21 passengers and six
crew members, the official said, adding that 13 bodies had been
recovered from the wreckage so far.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 20-seat Antonov 26-B, crashed Saturday afternoon
about 40 miles north of the Congolese city of Tshikapa, a center
for Congo's diamond industry, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the plane, which was en route from the
capital, Kinshasa, was unable to land properly at the Tshikapa
airport due to technical problems. The control tower ordered the
pilot to make an emergency landing, but the pilot chose to try to
return to Kinshasa, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed shortly after beginning the flight back to the
capital, about 400 miles northwest of Tshikapa.
</P>
<P>
   Small planes that fly through the Congolese interior are
regularly overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   The route between Tshikapa and Kinshasa is commonly flown by
diamond traders, but it was not known Sunday if any of the
passengers were in the diamond business.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was registered in Congo but was owned by a variety of
people, at least some of whom are Ukrainian. The plane's pilots
were also Ukrainian, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the
crash.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Search for Detmer Backup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Browns coach Chris Palmer said Sunday
he will likely wait until other NFL teams reduce their rosters to
find a backup for quarterback Tim Couch in the wake of Ty Detmer's
season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer was lost for the season Saturday night when he ruptured
an Achilles' tendon during Cleveland's 19-6 loss to the Chicago
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer, a nine-year veteran, was changing directions while
scrambling out of the pocket in the second quarter when he went
down. He will undergo surgery on Monday and will need 6-to-8 months
of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said it was too early to determine whether the injury to
the 32-year-old Detmer was career threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer opened last season as the Browns' starting quarterback
before being replaced in Week 2 by Couch. Detmer was again the
starter in the final game of the season against Indianapolis after
Couch severely sprained an ankle in Week 15.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Detmer leaves rifle-armed rookie Spergon Wynn as the
backup to Couch, who has had an inconsistent training camp and
exhibition season so far.
</P>
<P>
   Couch was hoping to silence his critics after a poor first
outing against Philadelphia in the preseason opener, but threw
three interceptions in the loss to the Bears. He was 11-of-19 for
81 yards and the three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did some good things and he missed some things,'' said
Palmer, who has been supportive of his starting QB amid the
criticism. ''I would be more upset if he wasn't throwing to the
right spots with the ball, but he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said after reviewing an emergency list of available
quarterbacks that he would wait until the roster cuts on Aug. 22
and 27 to find a backup for Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a situation where it has to be a good fit,'' Palmer
said, ''because right now we have a good situation in that locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was selected in the sixth round (183rd overall) by the
Browns this year out of Southwest Texas State. In extended time
against the Bears, he was 9-of-26 for 79 yards and had three rushes
for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said it's unlikely the Browns would attempt to go through
the season with Wynn as the No. 2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to put somebody into something before they're
ready,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palmer said wide receiver Kevin Johnson may miss this
Saturday's home game against the Washington Redskins because of a
hamstring injury. Johnson has not practiced in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns also lost backup offensive tackle Jeremy McKinney for
the season in the loss to the Bears. McKinney tore a ligament in
his right knee.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Meets Gadhafi in Libya  </HEADLINE>
By AMR NABIL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez followed
up a controversial trip to Iraq with a visit Sunday to Libya --
another nation often at odds with the United States and familiar
with the sort of U.N. sanctions he has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Chavez praised the
country's economic and political reforms and called the 1986 U.S.
bombing of Tripoli a ''criminal act.'' The two leaders discussed
bilateral relations and the prospect of further cooperation,
according to the Libyan News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our struggles are the same, as well as our ideals, namely the
preservation of dignity, liberty and the rule of the people,''
Chavez said, quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez met with Gadhafi as part of a tour of fellow member
nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The
Venezuelan leader, who formally invited Gadhafi to the September
OPEC summit, stressed the importance of cooperation between OPEC
members to maximize oil benefits and control fluctuating prices,
the Libyan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hopes to hold a Sept. 27 summit of the heads of state of
OPEC countries in Venezuela, the first such meeting since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's visit, Gadhafi showed Chavez where his adopted
daughter died in an April 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli and the port
city of Benghazi that killed at least three dozen people. The
strikes were retaliation for Libya's alleged involvement in a West
Berlin bombing that killed three people at a disco frequented by
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place has deepened our heartfelt repudiation of this
criminal act,'' Chavez was quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has led efforts to isolate Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and hold together the steadily fraying support for
U.N. sanctions against Iraq. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it also
led the way in ostracizing Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez has a record of bucking the United States and has
hailed Libya as a ''model of participatory democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan president's visit Thursday to Baghdad was the
first by a foreign head of state since before the 1991 Persian Gulf
War. U.S. officials condemned it as bestowing undue credibility on
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   At his next stop in Indonesia, Chavez called for the lifting of
U.N. sanctions against Iraq in place since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War. ''Whoever is disturbed by my
words, I do not care,'' he said in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Still ahead on the Venezuelan leader's OPEC tour were visits to
Nigeria and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Libya fell under a U.N. Security Council air embargo and other
sanctions in March 1992. The sanctions were suspended in April 1999
after Libya turned over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. Though
Libya is free of the restrictions, the sanctions have not yet been
formally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The official U.S. stance toward Libya is under review. Like
Iraq, Libya is on the U.S. State Department's list of nations that
sponsor terrorism, but officials in Washington say Libya's links to
terrorism have dropped dramatically since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still maintains unilateral sanctions against
Libya, though they were eased last year. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright also has been considering revoking a ban on U.S.
travel to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, however, hasn't sought out a better relationship with
the United States, looking instead toward Africa. Some African
leaders ignored the U.N. sanctions, so Gadhafi's isolation -- though
significant -- never was complete.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Libya's revenues come from oil sales,
making the economy vulnerable to wild fluctuations in oil prices,
which plunged as low as $10 a barrel in 1998 and rose above $30
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Chavez arrived in Abuja, the Nigerian capital,
where he was greeted at the airport by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
The two presidents were to sit down briefly Sunday night, Nigerian
officials said, though substantive talks were not expected to begin
until Monday.

<HEADLINE> New York delegates call a posh hotel home  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - New York's delegates to the Democratic
Convention are staying in one of the fanciest hotels in town, but
they have one problem - no swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Century Plaza pool is closed for construction.
</P>
<P>
   A late-night swim, however, will be one of the few things the
New Yorkers do without over the next four days of politicking and
partying.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel where the state's 294 delegates are staying is one of
Los Angeles' most expensive - the regular room rate is close to
$400 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Attending this year's convention is so pricey, in fact, that the
New York State Democratic Party has taken the unusual step of
offering financial aid for some cash-strapped delegates. Even so,
sticker shock kept at least one delegate home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really was just too expensive for me to handle,'' said Ed
Collins, of Binghamton. Collins said he was less enthusiastic about
making the trip west because he supports Bill Bradley over Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when you add the whole trip up, forget about it! I've got
two kids to think about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While single rooms normally go for $385 the delegates are
receiving a discount rate of $215 a night. Guests can order Dom
Perignon from the room service menu for $175 or indulge in a
Beverly Hills shopping spree in nearby Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope said seven
delegates had applied for and received financial assistance from
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an expensive convention for all of us,'' Hope
acknowledged. ''The plane ticket is expensive. Five days in L.A. is
expensive. I understand it's a sacrifice for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for New York's many labor union-affiliated delegates. The
unions were picking up the check for their members.
</P>
<P>
   And with the hectic schedule of corporate-sponsored receptions
and parties offering up free food and drink, New York delegates may
not need to fork over $50 for the Century Plaza's picnic lunch for
two that is stocked with brie and strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   The state's delegates appeared to be reveling in their
surroundings on the Avenue of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to have a Senate candidate who is also the first
lady,'' said delegate Michael Welsh, of LeRoy.
</P>
<P>
   The party's top celebrity, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is staying
with the president right next door at the tony St. Regis Hotel. The
first lady will be popping over for a kickoff reception kick and
the delegation breakfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And the delegates may not even need to worry about missing out
on a swim.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon a contingent of New Yorkers left the hotel
in t-shirts and shorts going in search of the beach.

   AYLMER, Quebec (AP) -- The sore back that forced Dottie Pepper to
withdraw midway through the second round of the U.S. Open will keep
her off the tour for another month.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper described the injury as ''functional overload'' caused by
''four years of doing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an injury that has been coming on for quite a while,''
she said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, winless this year but still eighth on the LPGA money
list, said she is being treated by back specialist Tom Boers of
Columbus, Ga., whose other patients have included golfers Fred
Couples, Ernie Els and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said she is aiming to return to the LPGA Tour by the
Betsy King Classic in Kutztown, Pa., on Sept. 8, and she said there
is ''no doubt'' she will play in the United States vs. Europe
Solheim Cup, starting Oct. 6, in Scotland. She has already

<P>
   That, though, was nothing like the bump tour rookie Diana

116th to 62nd on the winnings list with $107,097.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon credited D'Alessio with helping her win the du
Maurier.
</P>
<P>
   They played together on Saturday and Sunday, and Mallon said
D'Alessio made some impressive par saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talk about composure,'' Mallon said. ''She made so many putts

another player is not playing well, it kind of distracts you. She
played great. I think she's going to be a very good player in years
to come for us.''

<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - The Musconetcong River in northwestern New
Jersey was cresting at some points Sunday - a result of torrential
downpours the day before - prompting officials to evacuate
residents in two towns and put others on alert.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, where more than a foot of rain fell Saturday,
officials evacuated some Main Street residents Sunday because they
feared mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimated that Saturday's heavy rains and
flooding caused several million dollars worth of damage in northern
New Jersey, washing out bridges and roads and bursting dams.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said
officials would have a preliminary estimate of the damage on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman flew over the mud-soaked counties Sunday morning to view
the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County alone, the storm caused about $166 million
worth of damage, said Phil Morlock, the county's health and public
safety administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Morlock said $80 million of that total was damage to bridges and
roads. The rest was to private property, including in Newton, where
water mains were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rivoli, director of the Warren County Office of
Emergency Management, said water was breaching the Musconetcong
River, which flows out of Sussex County and borders Morris and
Warren counties, and were worried that it could overflow at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hackettstown were being evacuated and other towns
were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've notified all municipalities along the river and they're
telling residents that there's a possibility that the river could
flood,'' Rivoli said. ''Everybody's got what we call a 'heads
up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday evening, officials were still waiting to see what
the water would do, said Ed Bruder, of the emergency management
office. He said a quarry in Mount Olive had almost filled with
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that overflows and hits the dam at the quarry and the
quarry breaches, all that water will hit the Musconetcong and come
down in to Hackettstown and Washington and will cause some
flooding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning Sunday
for parts of Morris, Warren, Hunterdon and Sussex counties, due to
river flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In Stanhope, officials were worried that a dam on Furnace Pond
could burst due to the water pressure, Rivoli said.
</P>
<P>
   The water pressure already had eroded a drainage pipe, enlarging
it from about 3-feet in diameter to 8, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pond that about seven municipalities empty their
storm water into,'' he said. ''State Police and dam safety people
said it's holding, but could go at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, one of the hardest-hit areas, three roads and three
bridges were destroyed by the torrential downpours, which dumped 14
inches of rain on the township, said Police Sgt. Russell Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who live in a small section of Main Street were
evacuated Sunday because fire officials feared a mudslide down a
mountain that rises above the township. Firefighters ferried
residents across metal ladders and ropes set up across fast-moving
currents.
</P>
<P>
   Several homes were blocked on one side by mud from another slide
and on the other by a road that had turned into a brown river.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter carried a small, white dog in his arms while
balancing himself on a tree trunk that had fallen across a stream.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling relieved that I'm on this side and that my kids
are here,'' said Tori Monahan, 33, with her daughters, Katie, 1,
and Kelly, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The force of Saturday's rain and flooding burst the dam on
Sparta's Seneca Lake, a small, private lake surrounded by homes in
Sussex County, the northernmost part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. Police tape surrounded the small
beach at the empty lake, which smelled of dead fish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Brunetti, 43, said the lake emptied of its thousands of
gallons of water in one hour Saturday evening. It was ''just a big
hole, and the dock floating away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 families spent the night in an emergency shelter in
Sparta Township. Steve Wille, a Red Cross volunteer who has lived
here for 30 years, said he'd never seen anything like Saturday's
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all seen sheets of rain for five, 10, 15 minutes. This
continued for hour after hour after hour after hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Preskar Earl said the combination of flooding and downed
trees diverted two ponds in the back yard of her Sparta home into a
stream that runs behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just water and trees and boulders coming everywhere,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, water supply was a major concern as rushing water
took out the town's two water mains along the Sparta Glen, said
Town Manager Camille Furgiulele.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said a nearby well was tapped to alleviate the
problem, but that the supplementary source would only yield about
20 percent of the usual supply of 1 million gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Repair crews were unable to reach the water mains because roads
were flooded and a bridge to access the area had washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said although there are only about 8,000 residents in
Newton, the county seat, up to 20,000 people work there.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding lakes and rivers Saturday washed out bridges in
Jefferson Township and Ogdensburg, and caused road closures in
Morris and Sussex counties.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 customers of GPU Energy were without power Sunday
afternoon in Newton, Sparta and Flemington, said Ron Morano, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Power had been restored to most of the 10,000 customers who were
without it Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year-old boy was struck by lightning Saturday while
fishing with his family in Middle Township, but wasn't seriously
hurt. The lightning bolt hit a lamp post and traveled down to a
metal railing that the barefoot boy was holding onto.

<HEADLINE> School board members in impoverished Camden run up travel, food expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - As they were asking the state to increase
aid, school board members in this impoverished city were spending
lavishly on themselves for travel and food, according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   Board members spent nearly $100,000 on expenses in the 1999-2000
school year - almost twice what was budgeted, according to The
Philadelphia Inquirer, which examined the board's expenses and
purchase orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the nine-member board
spent $54,000 on travel, including airfare and hotels, $13,642 on
conference registration fees and $7,897 on food, the newspaper
reported. They also spent $588 on flowers and donations and $753 on
cab fares.
</P>
<P>
   For three consecutive years, the board overspent its $50,000
expense budget. Money was transferred from other accounts,
including salaries and facilities, to cover the costs, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Camden is southern New Jersey's largest district, with 19,000
students. The board's $50,000 expense allotment is considerably
more than what other neighboring boards allow.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Hill, which has 11,000 students, budgets $5,000 per year
for board expenses, and Willingboro, with 5,600 pupils, allows
$3,400, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which has 209,000 students, budgets $100,000 per
year for board expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The district spent $7,600 in January for the board and top
administrators to attend a two-day retreat in Princeton. Board
members said they chose a location away from Camden to avoid
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Board members spent up to $122 per day for meals while on
business trips and also charged personal expenses to the district,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Atlanta, board member Rosemary J. Jackson
ordered five movies and room service totaling nearly $300, and made
$112 worth of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who traveled more than any other board member, defended
her trips, saying she has made contacts around the country and used
some of what she's learned to sponsor a curriculum fair and
education symposium.
</P>
<P>
   She also defended her spending, saying the phone calls were
necessary because of her work as a consultant, and the only chance
she gets to watch movies is when she's away.
</P>
<P>
   State regulations bar school board members from being paid for
their services.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of what I give up, in hours, work and commitment ...
I don't think there's a comparison, she told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Board members also spent lavishly on catered meals during board
meetings, paying the soul-food restaurant Corinne's Place $500 per
month. The board instructed the restaurant to provide meals for 30
people, even though there are only nine board members. Containers
for carryout were provided.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Education's Compliance Investigation
Office is examining the spending and questioning board members, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Philip E. Freeman Sr. acknowledged that ''there
are no checks and balances'' and said he welcomes the state review.
</P>
<P>
   Camden has a $247 million school district budget and has said it
needs $27 million more in state aid this year.
</P>
<P>
   Spending in the district has caught the attention of the state
in previous years. Former board president Elaine Bey was jailed in
1998 for embezzling more than $24,000 and former Mayor Arnold
Webster admitted illegally paying himself $20,000 from school board
funds after becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said any findings from their current probe that
warrant criminal investigation will be given to state prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> All Not Right With Unbeaten Ravens  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Brian Billick clenched his teeth as he spoke
about the Baltimore Ravens' offensive performance against the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved the ball around pretty good, but the focus, the
attention to detail, the execution, just wasn't there,'' he said.
''Our task is clearly in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens' lone touchdown in Saturday night's 10-0 victory came
on Chris McAlister's 33-yard interception return. The first team
offense produced only three points, and quarterback Tony Banks
irritated Billick by letting the clock expire in the first half
with the Ravens at the New York 11-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully we can learn a lesson and not have that catch us in
the regular season,'' Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   At least Banks made it out of the game healthy, and that is no
small feat. The Jets lost two quarterbacks to injury -- Vinny
Testaverde hyperextended his left big toe and Chad Pennington left
with a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got out of Dodge, so to speak, with some bumps and bruises
and pulls, so you've got to feel fortunate,'' Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Mike Flynn sprained his right foot and is
doubtful for the Ravens' next game, Friday night on the road
against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike needs every snap he can get, so that's unfortunate,''
Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has won 10 straight preseason games, but Billick
expected more from an offense that during the offseason added
several weapons, including tight ends Shannon Sharpe and Ben Coates
and rookie wide receiver Travis Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens had decent field position in the first half against
the Jets, and Priest Holmes had 78 yards rushing on only 12
carries. But the offense never got into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't be a club like we were last year, where we were so
comfortable that our defense is going to give us great field
position every time,'' Banks said. ''We've got to hold up our end
of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has certainly done its part, forcing seven turnovers
in two weeks, including two interceptions and a fumble recovery
against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working on getting turnovers all training camp, and
it's paying off,'' defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens play their final two preseason games on the road
before opening the regular season at Pittsburgh. They then host
Jacksonville, travel to Miami and face Cincinnati at home before
beginning a string of three straight road games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The journey begins for us now,'' Billick said.

<HEADLINE> Peirsol: Krayzelburg is Beatable  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Aaron Peirsol doesn't agree with the
mentality that everyone is swimming for second when backstroke
world record-holder Lenny Krayzelburg is in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone keeps mentioning that Lenny is unbeatable,'' Peirsol
said. ''Everyone thinks first is out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol, 17, knows firsthand that isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming in Krayzelburg's home pool, Peirsol beat the Ukraine
native at 200 meters last month at a Los Angeles meet. It was
Krayzelburg's first loss in that event in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The young guys are able to drop times so fast,'' Krayzelburg
said. ''He brings out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, 24, and Peirsol, of Irvine, Calif., resume their
burgeoning rivalry in the 200 backstroke final at the U.S. Olympic
trials Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of four finals on the sixth night six of the eight-day
trials. The others are the women's 200 breaststroke and 100
freestyle, and the men's 200 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Peirsol became the third-fastest man ever
behind Krayzelburg and 1992 Olympic champion Martin Zubero of
Spain. In 1999, he was the youngest man ever to break two minutes
in the 200 back.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg and Peirsol were two seconds ahead of the field
after Sunday's prelims, and the only ones under 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, the favorite for two backstroke golds in Sydney,
welcomes the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last two years I've been swimming by myself,'' he
said. ''If someone is with you, you have to use a lot more strategy
in your race. It's going to be better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg owns the world and American records of 1 minute,
55.87 seconds in the 200. He'll be looking to lower his world mark
Monday, a feat he failed to achieve in the 100 back final Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people were talking about it. I was talking about
it,'' he said. ''I really thought I was going to break that
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's on the Olympic team in the 100 back, Krayzelburg
isn't putting as much pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to see fast times, it's possible we could see a
world record,'' he said. ''I wouldn't be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg sees his biggest Olympic competition coming from
Peirsol in the 200 back and Neil Walker, of Austin, Texas, in the
100 back.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good preparation here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres resume their battle in the 100
freestyle, where Thompson holds the American record -- a mark she
lowered last month at a meet in Los Angeles. Both already are on
the Olympic team in individual events.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, a four-time gold medalist in the Atlanta Games,
swims her first event of the trials Monday in the 100 free. She'll
also go in Tuesday's 50 free preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 50 is obviously my favorite. It's my baby,'' said Van
Dyken, who won the 50 gold in Atlanta. ''The 100 is kind of the
icing on the cake for me, kind of get the jitters out before the
50.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, 27, underwent shoulder surgery in June 1998 and then
again last January, after which she wasn't able to raise her right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I had really wanted to do was to make it to trials and now
I'm hoping to make the Olympic team. How weird is that?'' she said.
''It's been a long road, but it's been a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200 IM, Tom Wilkens faces Tom Dolan again. Wilkens
was on world-record pace in the 400 IM at 300 meters Tuesday when
Dolan and Erik Vendt overtook him to earn Olympic berths.
</P>
<P>
   Kristy Kowal, 16-year-old Megan Quann and Amanda Beard, silver
medalist in Atlanta, will fight for two available spots in the 200
breaststroke. Beard is down to her last chance to make the team
after failing in the 100 breast, where she also won silver in
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Van Dyken Healing Quickly  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Amy Van Dyken never thought she'd feel this
good.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of four gold medals in Atlanta -- the most by an
American woman at one Olympics -- Van Dyken was preparing to watch
the Sydney Games on television after two shoulder surgeries the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   But she has made a remarkable recovery since her latest one in
January, posting the fifth-fastest time Sunday in preliminaries for
the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was really good,'' said Van Dyken, whose time of 55.55
seconds put her less than a second behind top qualifier Dara
Torres. ''I looked around (in her heat) and there wasn't anybody,
so I kind of backed off a little bit. It was a lot of fun and it
was a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, 27, underwent shoulder surgery June 1998 and needed
another operation at the beginning of this year. She only resumed
training in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never felt better,'' she said. ''Everything's going better
than I thought it would. I wasn't expecting a lot coming here. To
be seeded fifth after the morning and to have a time like that --
things are perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken didn't feel things were so perfect after surgery.
Heck, she wasn't even able to lift her right arm -- quite a handicap
for a swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I had really wanted to do was to make it to the trials,''
she said. ''Now, I'm hoping to make the Olympic team. How weird is
that? It's been a long road, but it's been a lot of fun and I've
learned a lot about myself as a person and as a swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Torres, in another remarkable performance by
someone who retired from the sport for seven years, led the prelims
at 54.62. She was followed by Jenny Thompson (54.72), who edged
Torres in a thrilling 100 butterfly Thursday, giving them both a
spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Torres was bothered by cramps Friday in the 200 freestyle,
forcing her to drop out after the preliminaries. She didn't feel
much better when she arrived at the Indiana University Natatorium
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Richard (Quick, her coach), 'I feel like crap,''' she
said. ''He asked me to explain and I said, 'C-R-A-P.'''
</P>
<P>
   Torres felt better after warming up. When the race ended, she
was pleased to see so many of her contemporaries reaching the
semifinals, including Angel Martino, who is 10 days younger and the
mother of a 3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we're going to have a great relay,'' Torres said.
''It's great to have the older women dominating the sprint
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Thompson were the only women to eclipse 55 seconds in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to have a comfortable swim and I felt like I did
that,'' Thompson said. ''You don't win the race in the prelims and
no one is looking to do that. I'm just planning to have the best of
the three (races) in the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old, who has won five gold medals and a silver at
the Olympics, was relieved to clinch a spot on the team so early in
the trials. Four years ago, she shockingly failed to qualify in any
of her individual events and had to settle for a spot on the relay
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have that stress,'' she said, ''so I'm much more
comfortable taking it easy in the prelims.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise for Torres, who feels she is just entering her prime
after retiring from swimming to dabble in modeling and television
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way I should have been swimming when I was
younger,'' she said. ''Every one thinks it a miracle I'm swimming
so much faster now. But this is what I had in me when I was
younger. It just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   In other morning prelims, Lenny Krayzelburg breezed into the
semis of the 200 backstroke with a leading time of 1:58.79.
Seventeen-year-old Aaron Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., was second at
1:58.90 -- no one else cracked 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg already made the team in the 100 backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Kristy Kowal of Athens, Ga., bouncing back from the
disappointment of finishing third in the 100 breaststroke,
dominated qualifying in the 200 breast at 2:26.32, while
16-year-old Megan Quann of Puyallup, Wash., was next at 2:28.12.
The teen-ager won the 100 breast.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wilkens of Palo Alto, Calif., began a busy day by pacing the
200 individual medley at 2:02.96. In the evening, he was to swim
both the semifinals of the IM as well as the 200 breaststroke
final.
</P>
<P>
   The other two finals were women's 200 butterfly and men's 100
freestyle.

<HEADLINE> Buick Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Woody Austin got himself some job
security this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't quite enough to send him home with a smile, though.
</P>
<P>
   Austin led the Buick Open by two shots after two rounds, but had
rounds of 73 and 70 on the weekend to tie for fourth, five shots
behind winner Rocco Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   That earned him $118,800, enough to secure a spot in the top 125
on the PGA Tour money list and a playing card for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ecstatic about the money,'' Austin said Sunday. ''I really
wanted to get things done by Reno (Aug. 21-27), because I didn't
want to play in the two events in Canada after that. Now I don't
have to worry about it. I can take some vacation and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin is in the tour's bottom 20 in putting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to guys like Brad Faxon and Ben Crenshaw, and I've
gotten better on short putts, but I'm still like 175th,'' he said.
''It's all about confidence. If you don't have that, you will never
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin, whose only career win came at the 1995 Buick Open, was
disgusted by his play on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I birdied the first two holes Saturday, and if I could have
just played even-par golf from there on in, then shot the same
score today, I would have been right there,'' Austin said. ''And
that's not making any big putts -- that's just keeping bogeys off
the card and making the tap ins. It's great to play this well - but
I'm really disappointed that I didn't do more.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   UP AND DOWN ROUND: Carl Paulson tied for sixth thanks to two
great runs of birdies Sunday. First, after bogeying the 5th, he
birdied Nos. 6, 7 and 8. After a bogey on No. 9 and routine pars on
10 and 11, he birdied the next three holes, parred the tough 15th
and birdied 16th. In all, he had eight birdies, two bogeys and only
eight pars.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ENDANGERED SPECIES: Once again, the 15th hole was the hardest
on the course, with Mediate, Tiger Woods and Hal Sutton among those
who dropped a shot there Sunday. Dudley Hart, though, managed an
eagle from the fairway, the first on 15 in the history of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LEGENDARY PAIRING: Woods was happy to hear the solution for
his pairing at the PGA Championship this week at Valhalla.
Normally, the winners of the three majors play together in the
first two rounds, but Woods made that impossible by winning both
the U.S. and British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would have been to add last year's PGA
champion, but of course, Woods won that as well.
</P>
<P>
   So the PGA decided to pair Woods and Masters champ Vijay Singh
with Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus, 60, is playing his last full year of
majors, and is also Valhalla's designer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was wondering what they were going to do with our group,''
Woods said Sunday. ''That sounds like it is going to be a lot of
fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GETTING CLOSER THE SECOND TIME: Sunday's last-group duel was
hardly the first head-to-head matchup between Mediate and Chris
Perry. The pair played in the Sweet 16 round of the Western Amateur
in 1984. As he did Sunday, Mediate came out on top, but not by only
one shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was playing some kid from Pennsylvania who used this tiny
putter and whose dad walked every hole with him,'' Perry said. ''I
had never heard of him, and he birdied everything and beat me 6 and
5. I told him that after he did it again today, he should at least
give me the hubcaps off his new Buick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate said that the outcome was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris was a great amateur and won dozens of tournaments, and I
won two,'' he said. ''If I beat him more than 1-up, he must have
really had a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Divots: Neal Lancaster won the award for consistency, shooting
1-under 71s in all four rounds. ... Loren Roberts tied for 16th at
12 under, and moved past Notah Begay for the last automatic spot on
the American Presidents Cup team. The team is selected on the basis
of money won through the PGA Championship. ... Brett Quigley
birdied all four par-5s on Sunday, making him the only player to do
that all weekend. Quigley also added an eagle on the par-4 14th for
a season-low round of 64.

<HEADLINE> Jenkins Wins Canada Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Tom Jenkins made a 10-foot birdie putt
on the 18th hole Sunday for a one-shot victory over Kermit Zarley
in the AT&AMP;T Canada Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins's 4-under-par 68 gave him a 14-under 274 total and his
first victory of the year on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Zarley's closing 66 at St. Charles Country Club equaled the low
round of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jenkins' second career victory as a senior and the top
prize of $217,500 pushed him over the $1 million mark in official
earnings this year with $1,134,196.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tewell had a 69 and finished third with a 276, while Bruce
Fleisher, who shared the third-round lead with Jenkins, had a 72
and was another two strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Baiocchi was alone at 279 after a final-round 66, while
Leonard Thompson (70), Ed Dougherty (72) and Tom Wargo (68) all
finished at 280.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus had a final-round 72 and finished at 283.

<HEADLINE> Ehud Barak Bypasses Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reappointed
two dovish ministers to his government Sunday, bypassing parliament
and eliciting sharp criticism from hard-line opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is trying hard to show that it's government as usual, even
though three parties have bolted his coalition over his
far-reaching peace offers to the Palestinians and he is governing
with just 42 legislators out of 120 in the parliament, or Knesset.
By naming new ''acting ministers,'' Barak is avoiding the Knesset
approval for Cabinet appointments required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid said he and Barak agreed that he
would return as education minister, a post he left in June.
</P>
<P>
   Former Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen, also of Meretz,
said he too would return to his post as an acting minister. He had
left his position at the same time as Sarid.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office would not comment. Meretz officials said a formal
announcement was likely on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two were squeezed out of the Cabinet in a bid to appease the
religious Shas party, a key-player in the peace process. Shas and
the secular Meretz party had been locked in a bitter dispute over
control of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Barak had felt he needed Shas in government to
secure its hawkish constituency's support for far-reaching peace
moves, while he knew he could count on Meretz support whether or
not they held Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   Shas then left government a month later over proposals Barak was
planning to make at the Camp David peace summit, including
extending limited sovereignty to the Palestinians in parts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz now intends to play an active part in peace negotiations,
Sarid told Israeli television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The two Meretz politicians were the latest ''acting ministers''
named by Barak to fill in his government. On Sunday, Labor party
secretary-general Raanan Cohen took his post as acting labor
minister, a post vacated by Shas leader Eli Ishai.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barak made Shlomo Ben-Ami acting foreign minister,
and Roni Milo of the Center Party is expected to be named acting
health minister Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers claimed the ''acting minister''
appointments might be illegal because they bypass Knesset review.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an appointment that seems ... in defiance of the Basic
Law of the Government,'' Likud-party lawmaker Limor Livnat said on
Israeli television. She asked the Supreme Court to force Barak to
bring the appointments to the Knesset for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister is safe from parliamentary efforts to topple
him while the Knesset is in recess -- until October. After that, he
may be able to cobble together a minority government that, together
with outside support from Arab parties, would keep him in power
long enough to wrap up a peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Barak aide has said Barak aims to stay in power long
enough to complete a peace deal. While Camp David failed to produce
an agreement, negotiators on both sides said breakthroughs at the
summit made a permanent status agreement much likelier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jewish settlers agreed Sunday to remove illegal
mobile homes they had put up on West Bank hilltops in a bid to
expand their settlements, an Israeli Defense Ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers had put up seven caravans and two large containers
at locations nar the Nof Kana and Bruchim settlements in the
northern West Bank. The ministry official said the army would
remove the homes if the settlers failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, settlers agreed with Barak to stop illegal settlement
building while he pursued peace talks. But the settlers declared
the deal void last month because of Barak's offers to the
Palestinians at Camp David.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Carolina Panthers kicker John Kasay is expected to
miss the
entire season after fracturing his left kneecap during a morning
workout Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bone in the left-footed kicker's knee was broken nearly in
half, coach George Seifert said. Kasay, a Pro Bowl selection in
1996, was taken from training camp at Wofford College in
Spartanburg, S.C. to Charlotte, N.C., for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kasay, the team's leading scorer every year since they joined
the NFL, was practicing with the team for just the second time
since returning from surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in the same knee. That injury happened in a December game,
and Seifert wasn't sure if the two injuries are related.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Kasay was attempting a 30-yard field goal when, as
his foot connected with the ball, he screamed: ''Oh no! No!
Trainer! Trainer!'' The ball squirted away off to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard for me to see that much,'' said punter Ken Walter,
who holds for field goals. ''I was concentrating on the hold, but I
kind of felt something that wasn't normal. He didn't get a good
foot on the ball. Next thing you know, I hear him yelling and
squirming around on the ground.''
Jets:
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde's preseason is over after the quarterback was
hurt in the second quarter of Saturday night's 10-0 exhibition loss
at Baltimore. The injury is to the same foot on which he tore his
Achilles' tendon in the 1999 opener, costing him the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Al Groh made it clear Sunday that Testaverde's toe is
a short-term problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably be a week before he is really up to going
hard,'' Groh said. ''That is what I am going to start this week
with and when we get to the next week, see how it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's out for Friday, that's probably the way things will go.
This is only Sunday, we just had the injury last night, so it is
premature to have an idea what the course of his week will be
like.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the regular season-opener against Green Bay on Sept. 3,
Groh is confidently hopeful regarding Testaverde's availability.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to speculate on that now, but with the
indications now and with aggressive treatment, he should be ready.
We'll see how he throws with it when we get him back,'' Groh said.
Browns:
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chris Palmer said Sunday he will likely wait until other
NFL teams reduce their rosters to find a backup for quarterback Tim
Couch in the wake of Ty Detmer's season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer was lost for the season Saturday night when he ruptured
an Achilles' tendon during Cleveland's 19-6 loss to the Chicago
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer, a nine-year veteran, was changing directions while
scrambling out of the pocket in the second quarter when he went
down. He will undergo surgery on Monday and will need 6-to-8 months
of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said it was too early to determine whether the injury to
the 32-year-old Detmer was career threatening.
Steelers:
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh signed former Michigan State running back Lloyd
Clemons, an undrafted free agent who was cut by the Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Clemons was signed Sunday after backup running back Chris
Fuamatu-Ma'afala cracked two ribs in Thursday's preseason game
against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Clemons led Michigan State with 959 yards last season.
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Although Jaret Holmes and Paul Edinger are both 3-for-3 in field
goal attempts during the preseason, coach Dick Jauron said the team
would not hesitate to bring in another veteran kicker as they have
already done with Jeff Jaeger and Michael Husted.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes hit from 54 and 48 yards in Saturday night's preseason
victory over Cleveland, and Paul Edinger was good on two
34-yarders.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have both kicked well enough in games to show they belong
in the league and there is a lot of pressure on them from the
press, from us and from themselves,'' Jauron said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Enis gained 37 yards on 10 carries Saturday night, a
marked improvement from his five-carry, 8-yard performance the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Company calls new proposal comprehensive, unions say it sets talks back </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Thousands of technicians and operators for
Verizon Communications entered their second week on strike Sunday,
leaving consumers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states saddled
with more delays in telephone repairs and installations.
</P>
<P>
   At the bargaining table, the unions rebuffed the latest company
proposal delivered to negotiators shortly after midnight Saturday.
Key stumbling blocks such as mandatory overtime and the shifting of
workloads within the company's expanded territory remain largely
unaddressed, the unions said, or in some cases matters have been
made worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Verizon had better put its energies into serious collective
bargaining if it wants to end this strike any time soon,'' warned
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America -
the larger of the two unions bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, the company offered what it called a ''revised
comprehensive offer'' to CWA and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers to respond to problems the union had found with
earlier company offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now believe we have gone a good distance down that road,''
Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said. ''We continue to believe we've
got the right package here.''
</P>
<P>
   But union officials said the proposal did not address key
issues, such as shifting of work by Verizon from the former Bell
Atlantic territory to GTE's region. Verizon is the product of a
summer marriage between those two companies.
</P>
<P>
   CWA bargainers said the only company proposal addressing
overtime - related to the definition of a ''reasonable excuse'' for
turning down forced overtime - would weaken existing workers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also asserted that the company is now seeking
concessions on the matter of job stress for employees in call
centers. According to CWA, Verizon wants to limit to 1.5 percent
the number of workers that can transfer each month. Union officials
argue that this traps customer service representatives and
consultants in high-pressure jobs without opportunities for
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said he was disappointed at the tone of the comments and
said again that the company has tried to sweeten the pot for its
workers in recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, 4,800 Puerto Rican telephone workers - who have been
bargaining for several months with the former GTE, now Verizon -
plan informational pickets and ''collective actions'' to show their
solidarity with the striking employees in the East. Those
employees, members of the Independent Union of Telephone Workers
are now working without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week has passed since contracts expired for 87,000
Verizon workers in the East. The company's 30,000 managers have
jumped in to tackle a daily running total of 90,000 repair orders,
a problem exacerbated because of inclement weather in parts of the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strike dragging into a second week, the company says
it will not call in federal mediators so long as the parties make
some progress in their talks.
</P>
<P>
   On hurdles that remain, the unions say the company's policy of
requiring overtime severely disrupts workers' family lives,
particularly employees who are single parents. The unions also fear
the addition of GTE territory to Bell Atlantic's Northeast and
Middle Atlantic base will make it possible for the company to shift
work to areas where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says stringent hiring standards and a tight labor market
make it difficult to add new workers. Flexibility in vacation
policies that let union workers take days off with minimal notice
also means the company needs to have others fill in, Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that union workers have significant job
security guarantees already and the company is constantly adding
positions - increasing its union-represented work force by 3,000
this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Stargell Is Ailing  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Hall of Famer Willie Stargell, in ill health
for several years, was hospitalized again earlier this summer and
the Pittsburgh Pirates are uncertain when he will return to their
front office.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell, a special assistant to general manager Cam Bonifay,
was hospitalized after spending several days in Pittsburgh in
advance of the June amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital stay, believed to be about a month in length,
followed a six-week hospitalization last fall after an infection in
a cut finger spread through his body, threatening his organs.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Stargell, the NL co-MVP on the Pirates' last
World Series championship team in 1979, has undergone dialysis for
failing kidneys several times a week for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell recovered from last fall's illness to spend most of
spring training with the Pirates, but developed health problems
again and has been in Pittsburgh only a few days this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before his recurring health problems became more frequent,
Stargell attended numerous Pirates games and scouted their minor
league players. Bonifay frequently consulted with him before making
player transactions, especially those involving prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell, however, often looked tired during his stays in
Pittsburgh and sometimes spent parts of game sleeping in the
trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates closely guard Stargell's privacy and declined to
reveal the nature of his illness last fall, and did not issue a
statement when he was hospitalized this summer. He was hospitalized
in Pittsburgh and later at his home in Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell hit 475 home runs during his 20-year Pirates career and
estimates he lost 200 more by playing in monstrous Forbes Field in
the 1960s. He often is referred to as the Pirates' greatest living
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no greater icon for Pirates baseball and
professionalism than Willie Stargell,'' Pirates owner Kevin
McClatchy said.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell starred on World Series championship teams in 1971,
when he had 48 homers and 125 RBIs, and 1979. He is the last
Pirates player to hit more than 40 homers in a season, 44 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell, who once held the record for the longest home run in
nearly half the NL parks, saw his statistics decline precipitously
after his sore knees worsened in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But he revived his career, and led the Pirates to an unexpected
World Series championship in 1979, by hitting 32 homers and driving
in 82 RBIs. With manager Chuck Tanner carefully picking his spots
for him -- he didn't start nearly 60 games that season -- Stargell
was the MVP for the season, the NL playoffs and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell hit only 14 homers the following three seasons before
retiring in 1982 after the second Willie Stargell day in three
years. He was a first-ballot Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   He later was a coach for the Braves and the Pirates and was
working in the Braves' minor league system when he returned to the
Pirates in 1997 at McClatchy's urging.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates want Stargell to play a featured role in their
sold-out, season-closing game against the Cubs on Oct. 1, the final
game in three Rivers Stadium, but that may be determined by his
health.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell also is scheduled to appear as a guest narrator at a
Pittsburgh Symphony concert this fall.

<HEADLINE> Mediate Wins Buick Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- The record crowds that turned out to
see Tiger Woods saw quite a show on Sunday -- by Rocco Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate, who never led the entire tournament and trailed by one
stroke going to the last hole, made a 12-foot birdie putt and won
the Buick Open when Chris Perry missed a 10-foot putt for his first
bogey in 29 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate birdied two of the last three holes and closed with a
6-under-par 66 to win for the fourth time in his career. He
finished at 20-under 268 and earned $486,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if I made birdie, I might get in a playoff,'' Mediate
said. ''I didn't expect this.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six players with the 54-hole lead alone have gone on to win
the Buick Open. Perry figured to be an exception until he drove
into the left rough on the 18th, played short of the green and then
ran a pitch about 10 feet past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''We both played great,'' Perry said. ''He just made one more
putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, the only other player who had a serious chance of
winning, played the back nine in even par and wound up with a 68,
three strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Woods provided was a scare when he tried to hit a
ball that was directly behind a tree root on the par-5 13th. Woods
gave it a lash and dropped the club, flexing his left hand that was
jolted by the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''It actually hurt quite a bit for a while, then I shook it
off,'' Woods said. ''I was trying to hit the ball on the upswing,
so I just chipped the top of the root. If I had been trying to
swing down on it, I would have really been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods never made a move on the front nine -- critical since he
started six strokes back -- and finished with a 68, seven strokes
behind Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   A birdie by Joe Ozaki on the 18th knocked Woods out of the top
10 for only the third time in his last 25 PGA Tour events. All
three came in his first tournament after winning a major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Woods is the PGA Championship, which starts
Thursday. Woods will try to become the first player since Ben Hogan
to win three majors in one year.
</P>
<P>
   On a drizzling day at Warwick Hills, Perry and Mediate quickly
turned the final round into a duel and were tied at 19 under
through 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Perry holed a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 12 and extended his
lead to two strokes when Mediate missed a 3-footer for par on the
15th.
</P>
<P>
   While the 18th was the decisive hole, the tournament might have
turned on the par-5 16th. Desperate for a birdie or better, Mediate
hit a driver from the fairway with a perfect fade that allowed the
ball to run up to the green 30 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Perry decided to hit a 3-wood, but pulled it badly in an awkward
spot left of a bunker that guarded the flag. He had to make a
5-footer just to save par, while Mediate two-putted for his birdie
to cut the lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that was the turning point,'' Perry said. ''I felt
like if I could birdie 16, the tournament would be over. He pulled
off a great shot, and then I hit a really solid shot that just
didn't cut.''
</P>
<P>
   While 17 players began the final round within six shots of the
lead, not many of them could make a run at Perry -- or their bid
simply started too late.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case of Woods, who made the turn in 35 as the guys
he was chasing were making all the birdies. The world's No. 1
player almost compounded matters by trying to go for the par-5 13th
green despite the root in front of his ball.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of the Tour Championship last year, when
Woods hit through a baseball-sized rock to get at his ball. This
time, however, the consequences were greater since the PGA
Championship is next week in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Woods once again survived. The best player in the world is
also one of the strongest -- and the most stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only way I could get it close to the flag,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson was four behind at the start of the round and
hopeful of duplicating his comeback victory in the Colonial. But
he, too, was stuck in neutral. By the time he got it together with
a birdie-eagle-birdie stretch on the back nine, he was too far
back.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson wound up with a 68 and tied for fourth with first- and
second-round leader Woody Austin at 273.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was the first one to put pressure on Perry, and sensed
everything going his way when he walked after a 70-foot putt that
dropped for eagle on the par-5 7th, pulling him within one of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as he got. He missed a 6-foot birdie putt
on 9, chopped up the 10th for his first bogey of the day, failed to
birdie the two short par-4s on the back and dropped another shot on
15.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 5, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Juan Encarnacion returned to the Tigers
lineup and hit a three-run homer as Detroit beat the Oakland
Athletics 5-3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The A's lost for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (9-7), coming off a complete-game victory over
Baltimore on Tuesday, allowed three runs on seven hits over seven
innings. It was his third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones came in with the bases loaded and two outs in the
eighth inning and went on to earn his American League-leading 33rd
save.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fifth, Brad Ausmus singled off Barry Zito
(1-1) and Damion Easley walked.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion, rested by manager Phil Garner for the previous
three games, stepped up with two outs and homered into the
left-field seats. It was his 11th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers went up 2-0 in the second when Shane Halter homered
after a single by Deivi Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland scored in the sixth when Sal Fasano singled, Randy
Velarde walked and Ben Grieve hit an RBI single with two outs.
Velarde tried to score on the play when Cruz dropped the ball, but
was thrown out at the plate when the shortstop recovered in time.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez narrowed the gap for the A's in the seventh inning
with a two-run home run off Moehler.
</P>
<P>
   Zito was making his fifth major league start. He won his debut
on July 22 against Anaheim, but had not gotten a decision since.
</P>
<P>
   Zito went six innings, allowing five runs on seven hits. He
struck out five and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe juggled the lineup before Saturday's
victory, and stayed with the changes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff batter Terrence Long was moved to the No. 5 spot and
Velarde led off, and shortstop Miguel Tejada jumped to the No. 2
spot after batting at the bottom of the order for much of the year.
Matt Stairs fell from the No. 5 spot to seventh in the order.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit RHP Hideo Nomo is still being bothered by pain in
his middle finger. The Tigers had hoped he could return by Monday
or Tuesday against Seattle. Willie Blair, Steve Sparks and Jeff
Weaver are the probable starters for the three-game series. ...
Tejada had a 13-game hitting streak snapped ... Oakland's Omar
Olivares made his first appearance in relief since coming off the
disabled list on Saturday. Olivares, a former starter who had a
strained right shoulder, said Saturday he was unhappy with the move
to the bullpen.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Lame fire code enforcement in four NJ counties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Nearly 12 percent of buildings in a
survey of four northern New Jersey counties weren't inspected last
year for state fire code violations, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said New Jersey has some of the most stringent
regulations to protect the public from fires. They were put into
effect 15 years ago after a series of deadly boarding home fires.
</P>
<P>
   But among 93 communities in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Hudson
counties surveyed by The Record of Hackensack, about 12 percent of
600 buildings considered ''life hazard uses'' were not inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Life hazard uses are places where a fire would be particularly
catastrophic, such as schools, nursing homes, shopping malls, movie
theaters or buildings that are prone to fire because combustible
material is stored or used on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Uniform Fire Code says those buildings considered
life hazard uses must be inspected at least once a year by a
certified official and that records of those inspections should be
kept on file.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper then projected its findings over the four counties
to conclude that between 1,143 and 1,214 buildings were not
inspected in 1999. The report also concluded that between 8,071 and
8,570 buildings were inspected in that year. The result had a
margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that between 668 and 709 life hazard
use buildings have no record of inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Clifton had the worst record for doing inspections
on time, the newspaper reported. It missed 19 of the 33 life hazard
uses in a sample of buildings the newspaper collected. Eight of
those buildings had not been inspected in five years, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lyndhurst, officials didn't even keep records of fire
inspections. That prompted the state Division of Fire Safety to
strip Michael Antonicelli of his responsibility as fire official
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enforcement of fire prevention - the inspection part of it
- is something that has to get emphasized to the locals,'' William
H. Cane, director of the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety, told
The Record.
</P>
<P>
   Cane said he had not realized that many towns were violating New
Jersey's fire inspection requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But even Cane's agency had some trouble keeping up with its
inspections, failing for two years to inspect the Meadowlands
Sports Complex, home to the Giants football team in East
Rutherford, the newspaper said. Inspectors from May through July
found 1,301 fire violations in the stadium. It had last been
inspected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Local fire officials told the newspaper they could not inspect
all life hazard use buildings on time because of their other
duties, which include inspecting homes and small businesses and
teaching communities about fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to do it all, and, sure, we fall behind on life hazard
uses,'' said Clifton Fire Chief John E. Dubravsky. ''I think more
emphasis should be put on residential fire safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's investigation was prompted by a Jan. 19
dormitory fire at Seton Hall University that killed three students.
In the days after the fire, South Orange officials acknowledged
that they did not inspect the campus in 1999 and kept unclear
records of earlier inspections.

<HEADLINE> Russia Orthodox Church Plans Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The head of Russia's Orthodox Church criticized
challenges to the church, particularly breakaway factions and
Catholic missionaries, as he opened a key synod Sunday that will
chart church policy for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Council of Bishops will also decide this week
whether to canonize Russia's last czar and his family as saints.
</P>
<P>
   The first crucial document debated by the council will detail a
new social concept covering everything from the church's relations
with the government to its thoughts on homosexuality, sports and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The second sets out relations with other faiths. Both have been
kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the council in Moscow's giant Christ the Saviour
Cathedral, Alexy criticized independence efforts by Orthodox
leaders in Ukraine and Estonia, and among the Russian diaspora, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   He called for more cooperation with the Catholic church, but
said he regards ''as inadmissible Catholic expansionism'' among the
traditionally Orthodox population of Russia and the former Soviet
republics, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox church played a key role in the passage of a 1997
law that gives precedence to Orthodoxy and restricts nontraditional
faiths in Russia. It has strongly opposed missionary work by
foreign churches.
</P>
<P>
   The social doctrine to be adopted at the synod is expected to
declare that freedom of conscience is incompatible with Orthodoxy,
said Geraldine Fagan of the Keston Institute, a British-based group
which monitors religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad said
in an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper that accepting
freedom of conscience would be to accept a ''degradation of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the council will consider whether to canonize
Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his family for the humility
with which they faced death before a Soviet firing squad in 1918.
More than 1,000 other victims of the Soviet regime are also
expected to be canonized.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of canonizing Nicholas has stirred debate in the church
hierarchy, with some leaders already recognizing him as a saint and
claiming that his icons have produced miracles. Others fear such a
move may be interpreted as an approval of monarchism and of
Nicholas as a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Alexy cautioned church leaders to ''discuss it particularly
thoroughly and think about how to entrust this difficult issue to
God's will, so that the process of making a decision would not
cause dangerous schisms in our community.''

<HEADLINE> Barricaded man who shot three officers wanted to be a cop  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The deranged man who wounded four police
officers from two Brooklyn houses was once a jail guard who aspired
to become an officer, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's siege that ended in the death of the gunman,
Arthur Alalouf, police found an arsenal in his basement, along with
a dead dog and cat and ''dozens and dozens of samurai swords, Bowie
knives, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition,'' said police Chief
of Detectives William Allee Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old former correction officer was dressed in a
camouflage shirt and armed with a survival knife when he died
trying to escape at the end of the six-hour siege.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Alalouf warned his parents ''that he would shoot
the police,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quoted his parents as telling
officers at the 61st Precinct in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly couple had gone there to report that their son
purchased weapons Friday and brought them to the home they shared
in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. They also told police he had
asked his family to leave, or he would burn down the house, said
police Sgt. Janet Velez.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at about 1:45 p.m., as police approached the house,
he opened fire with a shotgun from a back window.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Gregory John was hit, suffering a shoulder wound.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani later displayed the officer's Kevlar vest, which had at
least eight holes where the buckshot had torn into the chest area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for the vest,'' Giuliani said. Officer John actually
was wearing two vests - his personal vest beneath his uniform, and
a heavier ESU vest on top.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers descended upon the area and
evacuated neighbors from nearby houses.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the shootout from his home at 16 Parkway
Court, Alalouf made a dash through the backyard and across a fence
to a nearby home, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing he had fled, police entered the first house with
infrared robotic cameras and tried to distract the gunman with
flash and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Alalouf remained hidden in the second house until about 8 p.m.,
when police approached the front door and he opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officer James McGrath, 33, suffered a graze wound to the face,
and Officer Jose Guerra, 34, was struck in the face and leg, said
Officer Louis Cruz, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect fled out the back window, where the fourth officer,
Jose Ocasio, 43, was shot once in the left calf, Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired back and Alalouf was fatally wounded. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of his home, police found a cache of firearms
that included five rifles, two other Mini-14 assault rifles,
holsters, survival equipment and four pistols - two licensed for
target shooting and two unregistered.
</P>
<P>
   The dog and cat were sealed in a box, and appeared to be dead
about a month, Allee said. It was unclear how they died. Also found
in the house were several live dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mossberg 12-guage shotgun used to wound the officers, as
well as one of the Mini-14s and the hundreds of rounds of
ammunition, were purchased Friday at a gun shop on New Utrecht
Avenue in Brooklyn, said Allee, the chief of detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were obtained legally, and Alalouf had a month to
register them. He paid for them with his father's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   John, the 32-year-old Emergency Service Unit officer with 10
years on the job, was in stable condition Saturday at Kings County
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and Guerra, also members of the Emergency Service Unit,
also were being treated at Kings County Hospital. Three other
officers suffered minor injuries that were not gunshot-related,
including scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra, who suffered eye damage and had bullet fragments lodged
in his esophagus, was in serious condition. Ocasio was conscious
''and seems to be doing well,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath reportedly was released.
</P>
<P>
   While the three hospitalized officers were ''in a great deal of
pain,'' Giuliani said, he was relieved that none had been wounded
by ''friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor described Alalouf as ''obviously seriously deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities could not immediately obtain his employment record,
but Giuliani said he worked as a New York correction officer from
1982 to 1984; he was fired after complaints against him the mayor
said were ''unsubstantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point after that, ''he made an attempt to become a
police officer.''

<HEADLINE> Sanders: Done With Football  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders says he is finished
playing football and is enjoying his retirement from the Detroit
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I wanted to play football again, all I'd have to do is just
show up (at Lions training camp) in Saginaw or at the Silverdome,''
Sanders told the Detroit Free Press on Saturday at the Buick Open
golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders retired in July 1999, two days before the start of the
Lions' training camp. He played 10 seasons with the Lions, and
totaled 15,269 career rushing yards, second in NFL history to the
Walter Payton's 16,726.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published on the Free Press' Web site, Sanders
denied his father's comments that he decided to retire out of
dislike for coach Bobby Ross and a poor opinion of the Lions' front
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would anyone automatically assume that other people were
speaking for me?'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My decision has nothing to do with the Lions. I know that you
probably don't believe me, but it has nothing to do with the Lions.
I played 10 years. And that was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he was disturbed by the public reaction over his
decision to retire. He was booed when introduced at a fight at Joe
Louis Arena last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''That bothered me at first, but I tried not to take it
personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sanders sent the Lions a check for $1.833 million, a
payment he was obligated to make if he doesn't play this season.
The money represents part of a signing bonus Sanders received in
1997, when he signed a six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a February decision, arbitrator Sam Kagel said Sanders owes
the Lions $1.833 million of unearned signing bonus for each year he
doesn't play during the remaining three years of his contract.

</P>
<P>
   The surgery on McDuffie's left big toe will be performed by foot
specialist Dr. Robert Mills on Monday or Tuesday. McDuffie also
underwent surgery on the toe in February to repair a torn tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could never get over the hump,'' Dolphins coach Dave
Wannstedt said. ''He'd have one good day, and two days later he'd
be sore.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-case scenario for the Dolphins has McDuffie missing
four weeks, including the first two games of the regular season.
The more likely scenario has McDuffie missing the first six weeks
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dolphins opt to place McDuffie on injured reserve, he
will be unable to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to count on two or three other guys to become one
O.J.,'' receiver Oronde Gadsden said.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie, who didn't make himself available to the media Sunday,
had 43 receptions for 516 yards and two touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the reliable McDuffie could be a problem for the
offense-starved Dolphins, who have yet to score a touchdown this
preseason with their first-teamers on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' scoring woes may stem from instability at
quarterback since Dan Marino retired and the team's transition to
coordinator Chan Gailey's new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the quarterback situation not solidified yet, losing O.J.
is kind of critical,'' receiver Tony Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates to join Martin as starters include Gadsden and Lamar
Thomas. Also, running back Thurman Thomas is expected to be called
upon more in McDuffie's role as third-down specialist.
</P>
<P>
   After Gadsden and Thomas, experienced NFL pass-catchers on the
roster include Leslie Shepherd and Bert Emanuel, plus youngsters
Quentin Spotwood, Robert Baker, and Kevin McKenzie.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teen Swim Champ Nall Retires  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Anita Nall, her body wracked by chronic
fatigue and other ailments, retired from swimming Sunday, eight
years after breaking a world record twice in one day in the U.S.
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Nall, 24, failed to advance out of the 100-meter breaststroke
preliminaries Friday, tying for 38th out of 91 swimmers. Her time
of 1 minute, 13.13 seconds was more than five seconds slower than
her silver medal time in the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She decided not to attempt the 200 breast preliminaries Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like my body isn't allowing me to do this anymore,''
said Nall, who was diagnosed with chronic fatigue several years ago
when little was known about the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Already baffled by its effects on her body, Nall later found out
she has a blood pressure abnormality and a milk allergy that
interferes with her daily training.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I stick to a normal routine, I'm fine and I feel good,''
she said. ''The minute I have some stress I tend to have some kind
of ailment come up. Maybe I'll feel 100 million times better and
that's what I'm hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   Nall was a 16-year-old from Baltimore when she broke the world
record in the 200 breast twice in the same day in the 1992 Olympic
trials. She still holds the American record in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   At the Barcelona Olympics, Nall won a silver in the 100 breast,
bronze in the 200 breast and gold in the 400 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times when you grow up in a sport and become famous
at an early age, you focus your whole being on swimming,'' she
said. ''I don't need to swim to make me feel good about myself.
I've evolved as a person and athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   By the '96 trials, Nall was sick and her training was off. She
didn't make the team and retired. She came back in the summer of
1998, and qualified for the 1999 World University Games, where she
was fourth in the 200 breast.
</P>
<P>
   Nall plans to complete a degree in communications at Arizona
State, continue holding swim clinics and has been offered an
age-group coaching job with Phoenix Swim Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to do it over again, I would've done everything the
same way. Things happen for a reason,'' she said. ''I'm excited
about my future, but still very proud of my past.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY LOSERS: Julia Stowers of Knoxville, Tenn., and Kim Black
of Syracuse, N.Y., might want to buy presents for Cristina Teuscher
and Dara Torres.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers made the Olympic team in the 800-meter freestyle relay
despite finishing out of the top 16 of the 200 free preliminaries.
Stowers was 17th and Black 19th.
</P>
<P>
   But Teuscher and Torres scratched the semifinals, opening up
spots for Stowers and Black. Stowers was seventh and Black eighth
in the semis, where the top eight make the final.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers finished fourth and Black sixth in the final. The top
four are expected to make the 800 free relay.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Williams, the 22-year-old daughter of Boston Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams, wasn't so lucky. She placed 18th in the
prelims and advanced to the semis when Kalyn Keller scratched. But
Williams finished 14th and didn't make the final.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CANCER COMEBACK: Trevor Gray of Tacoma, Wash., would've been a
contender in the Olympic trials -- until cancer sidetracked his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was third in the 200-meter backstroke at the 1999 summer
nationals. Then, he was diagnosed with cancer, forcing him to
undergo surgery three months ago to remove his thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming with a 3-inch scar on his neck, Gray finished 29th in
the prelims with a time of 2:5.49, about five seconds slower than
his pre-cancer times. He failed to advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I did OK considering,'' he said. ''At least I'm
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SLOW, SLOW, SLOW: Slow times in the women's 200-meter
freestyle don't bode well for America's prospects in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Benko won the event Saturday night with a time of
2:00.45 -- the slowest winning time at the trials since Shirley
Babashoff went 2:00.69 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Benko was more than two seconds off the American record, set by
Nicole Haislett in 1992, and also failed to crack the top 10
performances in the world this year.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Prepares Land Massacre Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police blocked roads and set up
checkpoints across an Amazon city before Monday's trials of
suspects in one of the bloodiest land disputes in Brazilian
history.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 people were expected attend the trial of the 13
Rondonia state police and two squatters charged in a 1995 clash
that left 10 farm workers and two police officers dead.
</P>
<P>
   Officers stopped and searched those entering Porto Velho, 2,000
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, along the city's only access
road. Scythes, machetes and other farm tools were being confiscated
to avoid violence, police chief Severino Moreira said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Police shut down roads adjacent to the courthouse and set up
tents and a large-screen television so landless rural workers could
watch the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre occurred Aug. 9, 1995, when state police tried to
evict 500 squatters from the Santa Elina ranch in Corumbiara, a
small town 500 miles south of Porto Velho.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim some 300 police encircled the camp around 2:00
a.m., tossed in tear gas and stun grenades and invaded the
settlement with guns blazing.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy reports later showed that of the 10 squatters killed,
seven were shot point blank in the face, neck, chest and back. One
victim, Ercilio Oliveira de Campos, was shot 19 times. Another, who
was not identified, was shot 12 times in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the police were expected to argue they were met with
gunfire as they arrived to carry out an eviction order. Squatters
had asked the government to carve out a small plot for them, but
local ranchers insisted on expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   The accused police and squatters will be tried separately. If
convicted, they could face hefty prison terms, although under
Brazilian law no one may serve more than 30 years at a single
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The case has taken five years to get to trial due to the complex
nature of the country's justice system. Some say the politically
explosive nature of the case has also dragged the matter out.
</P>
<P>
   Unequal land distribution is at the root of rural violence in
Brazil, where 90 percent of the land belongs to 20 percent of the
people, and the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade more than 1,000 people have lost their
lives in land disputes in Brazil, according to the Land Pastoral, a
Catholic group that advocates land reform.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Daughters Work Convention  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Politics always was a family affair to Al
Gore, groomed by his parents for Washington life. Now a third
generation of Gores takes up the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Daughters Karenna and Kristin are chief ambassadors until Gore
and wife Tipper arrive at the Democratic National Convention later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   One is the family's political heir apparent; the other makes her
political debut. The sisters kick off their week of campaigning
with a common theme: To get politically blase Generation Xers
excited enough about their dad's run to actually vote.
</P>
<P>
   First stop Sunday was an afternoon volunteering at the Los
Angeles Regional Food Bank. The message: Gen-Xers are ''the most
active generation in American history'' when it comes to
volunteering to help the poor, the homeless, the environment, all
sorts of causes, Kristin Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''when it comes to voting, unfortunately we are the most
apathetic generation,'' she said, after the sisters joined college
students to help sort donated food and other items that will be
sent to needy people. ''We need to volunteer and we need to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters never mentioned their father by name, but urged that
young people vote for candidates who support the same societal
improvements that, by volunteering, youths themselves do.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is really, really important,'' said Karenna Gore
Schiff. ''We must take this spirit that the volunteers showed here
to make our country a better place, and demand the same of our
government. We have to make sure that our public servants are on
the same side, working for the same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her involvement would go beyond voting, to actually
running for office, Schiff laughed and said, ''No plans for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to when I have more people in my generation
running,'' she said. ''I don't think we should all come from the
same family so Kristin and I are campaigning for some fresh
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon volunteering, the sisters were primed for
some fun, at a Hollywood party featuring the popular Goo Goo Dolls
Sunday night. Tuesday, they join a voter registration rally thrown
by MTV's Choose or Lose.
</P>
<P>
   For Schiff, 27 and a new mother living in New York City,
campaigning has become old hat. She was critiquing her father's
political speeches in her teens. Now she has become an astute
adviser to her dad, who says her instincts have ''nearly perfect
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week marks the political debut of Kristin Gore, 23, a
comedy writer for Fox TV's hip sci-fi cartoon Futurama. Millions
will get their first good glimpse of the Gores' second daughter
Thursday night, when she introduces her mother on the convention
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two youngest children, still fiercely protected from the
public eye, will spend the convention more enjoying themselves than
in front of TV cameras. Sarah, 21, is a student at Harvard. Albert
III, who at age 6 was hit by a car and almost died, is now a
17-year-old, football-loving high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was groomed for politics by his late father, Sen. Albert
Gore Sr.
</P>
<P>
   But family matriarch Pauline, now 88, may have influenced her
son even more, and she will be at his side Thursday as he accepts
his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Gore, one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt
Law School, taught her son from an early age that men and women are
equal. She also introduced her son to environmentalism, his
champion cause, and advised him to be a pragmatic politician.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sister Nancy died at age 46 of lung cancer, an experience
that prompted Gore to speak out against smoking. Nancy's husband
Frank Hunger remains one of Gore's closest confidants. The
Mississippi lawyer, who strategizes for Gore behind the scenes,
arrived at the convention this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Kings Sign Mathieu Schneider  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Unrestricted free agent defenseman
Mathieu Schneider, who played for the New York Rangers the last two
seasons, signed a contract with the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, 31, had 10 goals and 20 assists in 80 games last
season, and 10 goals and 24 assists in 75 games two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he played for Montreal, the New York Islanders and
Toronto. In 708 career games, he has 115 goals and 260 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Kings were at the top of my list right from the start,''
Schneider said. ''I think this is a real good fit for me and my
style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings vice president/general manager Dave Taylor called
Schneider a proven veteran defenseman with great mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mathieu also plays with an edge, has great vision on the ice
and can move the puck,'' Taylor said. ''This move is a significant
upgrade to our defensive corps.''

<HEADLINE> Del. Racing Halted by Bomb Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANTON, Del. (AP) -- Racing at Delaware Park was suspended
Sunday because of a bomb threat, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The track was evacuated and three races were canceled when a
caller dialed 911 about 2:40 p.m. and reported that two bombs had
been placed at the track, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb-sniffing dog was called to search the premises. No
explosives were found.

   The phone call was traced to a pay phone on the property and
troopers identified a suspect from evidence at the scene, said Cpl.
Walter W. Newton of the Delaware State Police. He declined to
provide specifics about the nature of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Kenneth Pierson, 47, of Wilmington, was located at

<HEADLINE> Police in Riot Gear Face LA Protest  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than 3,500 bellowing, marching
protesters jammed downtown streets Sunday, putting police on edge
with deafening screams and sending shoppers and business owners
fleeing for cover.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of arrests, and the only
disruptions seemed to be among downtown shoppers and storeowners
startled by the noisy marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators walked shoulder-to-shoulder, jumping up and down
as they made their way to the Staples Center, with riot gear-clad
police officers blocking off streets outside of the approved parade
route. Protesters occasionally broke apart from the crowd, then
surged forward, screaming, running and making police jump.
</P>
<P>
   Families pushing babies in strollers fled drugstores and
souvenir shops as they saw the crowd approach. Store owners rolled
down steel doors over their storefronts and ran inside as marchers
got close.
</P>
<P>
   The protest in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, on death row for
killing a Philadelphia police officer, was the first major
gathering of demonstrators massing in Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention, which starts Monday. Activists
gathered at Pershing Square and rallied for more than two hours
before beginning their 12-block march.
</P>
<P>
   When the group reached the fenced-in protest area outside the
convention site, a Latino band took the stage, protesters chanted
''Free Mumia'' and other slogans, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson passed
buckets through the crowd seeking donations for Abu-Jamal's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest attraction was a hose the Fire Department tied to a
fence, creating a makeshift fountain for sun-beaten demonstrators.
Protesters ran with arms outstretched to dance in the artificial
rain, shouting ''Thank you! Thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mackler, Abu-Jamal's defense coordinator, read a statement
from the prisoner opposing both major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you vote for one of the two hated dogs of American
politics, you are voting for your own oppression,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   A man decked out in glittering red, white and blue with a
rainbow wig and a devil mask drew a grinning crowd of admirers from
the march as he harangued the helmeted officers through a bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attention Los Angeles Police Department,'' said the man, who
claims his legal name is Vermin Supreme. ''Everything is under
control. Your services are no longer needed. Please return to your
homes now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some distributed leaflets for protests scheduled later in the
week while others waved picket signs opposing the death penalty.
One sign read, ''Not one more lynching'' and was emblazoned with a
picture of Abu-Jamal, convicted of killing an officer in 1981.
Supporters contend Abu-Jamal, who is black, was framed by racist
police.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden wall etched with thousands of names of alleged victims
of police brutality was set up along one edge of the square.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the death penalty, Al Gore and George W. Bush have
continued to ''march the retarded, the young and quite possibly the
innocent to their deaths,'' actor and activist Ed Asner told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fight is for our very souls,'' he said. ''Mumia must not
die!''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of uniformed police on motorcycles circled the peaceful
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Police began working 12-hour shifts, sending out hundreds of
additional officers to gird for a week of demonstrations. Abortion
rights activists, environmentalists and striking workers at a Santa
Monica hotel also planned rallies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the protesters' headquarters near MacArthur Park, nicknamed
the Convergence Center, demonstrators were taught Sunday how to
cope with tear gas and pepper spray and how to behave when
confronted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Others made banners, picket signs and large, satiric puppets for
demonstrations outside the Staples Center, where the convention
runs through Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Polls Show Diverse Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Polls taken just before the Democratic
National Convention offer a picture of the presidential race to
suit any taste, from a dead heat to a narrowing of George W. Bush's
lead to a big Bush advantage among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys of registered voters show Republican Bush with
about a 10-point lead over Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One poll out Sunday suggested the race was roughly even among
registered voters, however, and another suggested Bush is ahead by
16 points among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed Bush with 44 percent
support and Gore with 41 percent, with the remainder for others or
undecided. An NBC-Journal poll released before the Republican
convention showed Bush with a 6 percent edge. The latest NBC poll
of 802 registered voters was conducted Thursday and Friday and had
an error margin of 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll out Sunday showed Bush at 55
percent, and Gore at 39 percent among likely voters, a group that
tends to lean more Republican. That poll of 641 likely voters was
taken Thursday and Friday and had a 4 point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of those polled in the NBC-Journal poll said the
selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as Gore's
Democratic running mate made them feel more positively about Gore,
while seven of 10 said it made no difference. That's about the same
percentage who said that of Dick Cheney, Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls out late last week, including those by ABC, CBS
and Newsweek, gave Bush about a 10-point lead over Gore among
registered voters, down slightly from the polls immediately after
the GOP convention. A likely voter poll by CNN-Time put the margin
for Bush slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead after the July 31-Aug. 3 GOP convention ranged from
11 points among registered voters to 18 points among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fully expect the polls to tighten significantly after the
Democratic Convention and expect a very tight race in the fall,''
said Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan. ''Mr. Gore may even take a slight
lead coming out of the convention.... But Governor Bush's
consistent lead in the national polls shows his positive, unifying
message and focus on important issues like education, Social
Security, national defense and tax relief is winning over voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats found encouragement in the polls, however, both in the
shrinking margin in polls that show Bush ahead, and in two recent
polls that showed the race about even, the NBC-Journal poll and a
Fox News-Opinion Dynamics poll out Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the polls show that momentum is going toward
Gore-Lieberman,'' said Joe Andrew, Democratic national chairman.
''The horse-race numbers vary, but they are better than they were a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a position where just a decent convention puts us
where we want to be -- at one point we thought it would take a great
convention,'' said Andrew. ''After the convention, we need to be
where we were before the conventions. We need to have this race
back within the margin of error.''

   Andrew said a close race would help Democrats energize their
voters, an area where Republicans have had an advantage much of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility in the polls is not unexpected because of the
rapid changes that come during the two political conventions --
notably the selection of running mates -- and the generally low
amount of attention voters paid to the campaign up to that point,
veteran analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Protest Navy Exercises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- About 1,000 protesters joined hands
along the fence outside a U.S. Navy training ground in Puerto Rico
on Sunday to protest military exercises under way there.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators also hung white ribbons and anti-Navy signs on the
chain-link fence in Vieques. Military police on the other side
videotaped the demonstrators as they chanted, ''Vieques, yes, Navy,
no!'' and sang protest songs.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the protest was peaceful and that none of the
protesters tried to enter the training ground during the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of the 5 mile-by-20mile island and has
used it for exercises and weapons storage since the 1940s.
Resentment over the Navy's presence flared in April 1999, when a
U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped two bombs off target, killing a
civilian security guard working in the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters camped out on the bombing range and thwarted further
exercises until federal marshals forcibly cleared them out in May.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to order the Navy to leave by May
2003 if the island's 9,400 residents vote in a referendum to expel
it. Exercises are to continue with dummy bombs and shells until the
vote, which is expected next year.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Player Has Prison Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Billy Tibbetts, a forward who was out of
hockey for more than three years before signing with the Pittsburgh
Penguins, served 2&AMP;frac12; years in prison and has a lengthy criminal
record in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a record, for sure,'' Penguins general manager Craig
Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts pleaded guilty March 30, 1994, to raping a 15-year-old
girl at an outdoor drinking party in Scituate, Mass. He was 17 at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Cortland Matters called the
crime ''brutal'' but did not sentence Tibbetts to jail. Instead, he
was given a suspended sentence of 3 to 5 years and four years of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, 1994, he was given a suspended sentence of six
months, 18 months probation and was fined $625 on charges of
assault and battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct and
intimidating a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts was arraigned again July 12, 1995, in Hingham (Mass.)
District Court for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, a
BB gun. He was found guilty and sentenced to 2&AMP;frac12; years in prison. He
also was found to have violated his parole.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, he was
paroled Oct. 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts has played one full season since 1994, yet Patrick said
several NHL teams wanted to sign him after he was paroled last
year. Pittsburgh got him several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just got in there before anybody else,'' Patrick said.
''Actually, a few people called me and were upset that we beat them
to the punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts likely will start the season at the Penguins'
Wilkes-Barre-Scranton or Wheeling farm clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In his only full professional season, Tibbetts had 37 goals, 31
assists and 300 penalty minutes in 58 games for the Johnstown
Chiefs of the East Coast Hockey League in 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> Haitian community outraged that paramilitary leader allowed to live in Queens. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- The fact that a feared, former-paramilitary
leader from Haiti is living amongst his fellow countrymen in Queens
has outraged his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people gathered outside Emmanuel Constant's Queens home
Saturday morning, to angrily protest his presence in the United
States, according to newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   Constant founded the Front for Advancement and Progress of
Haiti, the political arm of the military group that deposed Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The group is accused of killing up to 4,000 people and
committing hundreds of human rights violations, including beatings
and rapes.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Haitian and human rights groups have tried to
convince the U.S. government to extradite Constant back to the
Caribbean nation to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Constant was arrested in New York in 1996, and detained by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for a year. He was abruptly
released a year later.

Study: TV Coverage Favors Republicans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- TV networks have given George W. Bush more favorable
coverage than Al Gore, both during the GOP convention and throughout the
presidential race, a new analysis finds. Still, Republicans are worried the
networks will give the Democratic National Convention more TV time this week
than they gave the GOP gathering in Philadelphia two weeks ago. The study, being
released tomorrow by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, examined 72
stories that aired during the Republican National Convention, July 31-Aug. 3, on
the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news. It found that 60 percent of people quoted in
stories praised Bush's policies, political skills or personal character, while
80 percent of people quoted criticized Gore.

N.J. Roads, Bridges Washed Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) -- Residents of two northern New Jersey towns were
evacuated today and others were put on alert in the wake of torrential downpours
that washed out bridges and roads, broke through a dam and prompted fears of
mudslides. Officials estimated that yesterday's downpour, which dumped more than
14 inches of rain on the area around Sparta, caused hundreds of million of
dollars in damage. The storm caused about $166 million in damage in Sussex
County alone, the area hit hardest by the storm.

Paraguay VP Vote Too Close To Call

   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's election for a successor to its slain
vice president was too close to call today, with exit polls showing only the
slightest of margins between the late politician's son and the opposition
candidate. The special, one-office election is seen as chance by the opposition
to end the ruling Colorado Party's 53-year rule in this South American country's
shaky democracy. The post of vice president has been empty since Luis Argana was
gunned down in the street in March 1999.

   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- Hundreds of evacuees were allowed back into homes in
the Elkhorn Mountains today, but wildfires still threatened more than 2,000
homes across the state. So far this fire season, more than 365,000 acres of
Montana has burned -- an area larger than the city of Los Angeles -- and 169
buildings, including more than 50 homes, have burned. Firefighters had gotten a
break from the weather yesterday and had made progress toward containing the
fires, said Larry Humphrey, the area's incident commander.

Ford: Problem Tires Made During Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Many of the 6.5 million Firestone tires being
recalled were made during a strike at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant, Ford
Motor Co. said today. The tires are under investigation in hundreds of crashes
that caused at least 46 deaths. Ford conducted an analysis of its Firestone
tires and the complaints it had received to pin down where the tires were made.
The number of complaints was 10 times higher for the 15-inch ATX tires made in
Decatur than for the Wilderness tires, said Jason Vines, Ford's vice president
of communications. At the time, union workers at the plant were on strike, and
the plant was operating with replacement workers and managers.
Bridgestone/Firestone said the strike had nothing to do with the problems.

National Gas Price Average Drops

   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The average price of gasoline fell 7.48 cents a
gallon nationwide in the past three weeks to $1.53, continuing its decline after
record highs in some areas in June. The slide began after suppliers rushed
gasoline to the Midwest to solve distribution problems in the region, analyst
Trilby Lundberg said today. However, price declines in the next few weeks may
slow or stop altogether, since summer is still in full swing, Lundberg said.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Pat Perez made a 5-foot birdie putt on
the first hole of a playoff with Mike Heinen and Pat Bates on
Sunday to win the Buy.com Tour's Ozarks Open.
</P>
<P>
   Perez closed with a 3-under-par 69 to match Heinen and Bates at
18-under 270 on the Highland Springs Country Club course. Perez
earned a career-high $76,500 for his first Buy.com title.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like I finally accomplished something in my career,''
said Perez, who helped Arizona State to the 1996 NCAA title. ''It's
a real accomplishment to beat these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinen finished with a 66, and Bates shot a 69. Paul Gow (66),
Hugh Royer III (66) and Matt Peterson (68) tied for fourth at 271.

Yankees-Angels:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: C Jorge Posada batted eighth Sunday, the deepest he
has been in the Yankees' lineup this season. ... Roger Clemens'
recent three-year contract extension improves his chances to reach
his goal of 300 wins while with the Yankees. The last pitcher to
notch his 300th victory in a Yankees uniform was Phil Niekro, in
1984. ... Glenallen Hill did not start because of a mild right
shoulder bruise after bouncing off the left-field railing fielding
Garret Anderson's fourth-inning double Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Eight days after Troy Percival went on the DL, there is
still too much inflammation around the ulnar nerve in his elbow for
him to resume light throwing. ... Manager Mike Scioscia laughingly
recalled picking up the phone just before Saturday night's game and
hearing a lost motorist ask for directions to Edison Field, the
call mistakenly having been patched through to his office. ''So I
gave him directions. He didn't know who he was talking to, but he
sure sounded glad to know where he was going.''. ... RF Tim Salmon,
who came out of Saturday night's game with a tight groin, sat
Sunday and is listed day-to-day.
White Sox-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP James Baldwin, who got a no-decision after
departing Saturday's game with a 4-3 lead through seven innings, is
15-1 indoors in his career but 46-44 outdoors. ''I don't think it's
explainable,'' manager Jerry Manuel said. ''I wouldn't even try to
explain it.'' ... 3B Herbert Perry (tendinitis of the Achilles'
tendon) returned to the starting lineup after being scratched the
previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: LHP Tony Saunders (broken left arm) will make his
fourth rehab start Saturday for Class A St. Petersburg at Sarasota
in a Florida State League game. As has been the case since Saunders
started his rehab, the Devil Rays are giving him a couple extra
days off. ''You have to give yourself extra time, especially with a
rehab like this,'' said Saunders, who tired in the fourth inning of
his 3 2-3 inning stint Saturday for St. Petersburg. ''Even though I
got tired in the last inning, I feel better this time than the past
times.'' ... 2B Bobby Smith (sprained right knee) will join
Triple-A Durham Monday to begin a rehab stint. His status will be
re-evaluated Friday. ... The Devil Rays will attempt to become the
first American League team to beat Boston's Pedro Martinez in three
straight starts on Monday. The New York Mets beat Martinez three
consecutive times from May 28, 1997-June 5, 1998.
Orioles-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Pat Rapp was scheduled to start Sunday, but left
the team because his father is seriously ill in Louisiana. ...
Lesli Brea, recalled Friday from Double-A Bowie, made the start in
his place. It was the major league debut for the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Neither team took batting practice or infield as
the 90-degree heat combined with high humidity continued in Kansas
City. ... Baltimore was headed home to play Chicago Monday after a
10-game road trip; the Royals are off Monday before going to
Minnesota to start a nine-game road trip.
Blue Jays-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Carlos Delgado is on pace for 108 extra-base hits,
which would be the third-highest total in major league history and
the most since Lou Gehrig had 117 in 1927. ... The major league
mark is 119 set by Babe Ruth in 1921. ... Raul Mondesi will have
right elbow ligament surgery Monday in Coral Gables, Fla. He was
placed on the 15-day DL dating back to July 22.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: As part of the team's 40th anniversary celebration,
Kirby Puckett's catch and home run in the 11th inning that won Game
6 of the 1991 World Series was voted the top moment in team
history. ... Rookie C Chad Moeller has been placed on the DL with a
torn meniscus in his right knee. He was operated on this morning. C
A.J. Pierzynski was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake.
Tigers-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Hideo Nomo is still being bothered by pain in his
middle finger. The Tigers had hoped he could return by Monday or
Tuesday against Seattle. Willie Blair, Steve Sparks and Jeff Weaver
are the probable starters for the three-game series. ... Juan
Encarnacion was back in center field for the Tigers on Sunday after
sitting out the past three games. He marked his return by hitting a
three-run home run in the fifth inning of A's rookie Barry Zito.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: After having success with a juggled lineup on Saturday,
A's manager Art Howe used the same order on Sunday: Leadoff batter
Terrence Long was moved to the No. 5 spot, Randy Velarde led off,
and shortstop Miguel Tejada jumped to the No. 2 spot after batting
at the bottom of the order for much of the year. Matt Stairs fell
from the No. 5 spot to seventh in the order. ... Omar Olivares came
off the DL Saturday and was placed in the bullpen. The former
starter, who had a right shoulder strain, is not pleased about the
decision. ''They know I want to start,'' he said. ''I've got my arm
strength back. How is throwing 20 or 30 pitches going to help my
arm? I want to be a starter.'' Olivares was 3-8 with a 6.64 ERA
before going on the DL.
Indians-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians have a winning record on every individual
day of the week except Friday. Seattle topped Cleveland 7-1 on
Friday, dropping the Indians' Friday record to 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Jamie Moyer, Seattle's starter on Monday against
Detroit, was the losing pitcher in both losses on the Mariners'
recent road trip where they won six of nine games. In the two
starts, he was 0-2 with a 15.30 ERA, allowing 17 earned runs in 10
innings.
Red Sox-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Since returning from the disabled list on July 23, RHP
Rod Beck has allowed just two earned runs in 9 2-3 innings. He
pitched two-thirds of an inning on Saturday night against Texas.
Beck was on the 15-day disabled list with an irritation in his
neck. ... Rico Brogna is batting just .186 (3-for-16) in eight
games for Boston since being acquired from Philadelphia via a
waiver claim on Aug. 3. After going 1-for-3 with a double on
Saturday night, he wasn't in the starting lineup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Even with no real explanation as to why he passed out in
the dugout after being pulled out of Friday night's game, RHP Ryan
Glynn has been cleared by doctors to make his next scheduled start
and insists he's not worried. ''As far as I know, I'm OK. There's
no real concern. This will not be on my mind at all,'' Glynn said
before going through a pregame workout Sunday with no apparent
problems. Glynn was given a clean bill of health even though a
series of tests by several doctors over a 24-hour period never
determined the cause of his fainting. Glynn (2-3) is scheduled to
start Wednesday against the New York Yankees. Manager Johnny Oates
said he will monitor the pitcher very closely. ... This weekend's
Rangers game program featured All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez on
the cover. The AL MVP is out for the season, having broken his
right throwing hand on July 24.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Dodgers-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Sunday's game was the final regular-season game
between the Dodgers and Braves. ... With Saturday's loss, the
Dodgers have lost nine in a row on Saturdays going back to June 10
vs. Oakland. LA was 8-1 in its first nine Saturday games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: OF Reggie Sanders, placed on the 15-day DL July 28 with
a strained left hamstring was eligible to be activated Saturday,
but the Braves have decided to give it at least until Monday. When
Sanders is activated, OF George Lombard, recalled from Triple-A
Richmond to replace Sanders, will be sent back to the minors.
Astros-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros have used 21 different pitchers this season,
two short of the franchise record set in 1965. ... Five first-round
draft picks for the Astros have played this season -- a team record.
Craig Biggio (1987), Billy Wagner (1993), Scott Elarton (1994),
Tony McKnight (1995) and Lance Berkman (1997). ... The Astros are
6-24 in one-run games, recording the lowest amount of wins and most
losses of any team in the majors. In 1994, the Astros accumulated
13 one-run victories to establish a franchise record ... C Tony
Eusebio tied the club's season-high with a 16-game hitting streak --
longest ever by a Houston catcher. Eusebio, who wasn't in the
starting lineup on Sunday, is hitting .345 over his streak. Biggio
recorded a 16-gamer from April 5-26.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Kent Bottenfield will look for his first Phillies
victory on Monday against Arizona. Bottenfield (0-1) is coming off
a strong seven-inning effort against San Diego on Wednesday. In two
starts with the Phillies, he has given up 14 hits in 13 innings and
carries a 4.15 ERA. ... Alex Arias has a .324 average (61-188) as a
pinch-hitter. ... 3B Scott Rolen missed his fourth straight start
with a strained left wrist. ... The Phillies face Randy Johnson on
Monday. 3B Kevin Jordan and Rolen are a combined 5-for-42 (.119)
with 17 strikeouts against him.
Giants-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Livan Hernandez's five-game hitting streak came
to an end and dropping his average to .297 (19-for-64) with eight
RBIs. Hernandez, who had hit in 12 of his last 13 games coming in,
came up with a runner on first in the eighth and the game still
scoreless. Mets pitcher Al Leiter remembered how well Hernandez hit
when he was his teammate in Florida. He also got a message from
current teammate Mike Hampton, batting .304 (17-for-56) with eight
RBIs. ''I had to protect Hampton's bid for the Silver Slugger,''
Leiter said. ''He reminded me of that.'' ... Hernandez got his
500th career strikeout when he fanned Robin Ventura in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Al Leiter struck out Barry Bonds on curveballs in the
first and seventh innings, the first one called, the second one
swinging. ... It was New York's first two-hitter since Leiter's
complete-game, 5-0 win over Cincinnati last Oct. 4 in the NL
wild-card tiebreaker playoff. Their last combined two-hitter was
over Toronto on Sept. 1, 1997 (Jason Isringhausen, Greg McMichael,
Mel Rojas and John Franco). ... The Mets, 40-18 at home, have won
five straight at Shea Stadium and 12 of 13. ... Since joining the
Mets, Mike Bordick is hitting .300 (18-for-60) with three homers
and five RBIs.
Rockies-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Larry Walker is happy to let New York's Benny Agbayani
explain how it feels to lose track of the number of outs. ''The
good thing about it is now I get to be left alone,'' Walker said
Sunday, a day after the Mets outfielder gave a live ball to a young
fan in the stands the night before. Walker made a similar mistake
in Los Angeles while playing for the Expos in 1994. ''You can ask
him all that stuff now,'' Walker said. ''I don't have to answer
questions about it any more.'' ... 1B Todd Helton went 3-for-3 to
raise his major league-leading average to .392 in Colorado's 5-3
win Sunday. Helton, who also walked, has reached safely in 15 of
his last 16 plate appearances. ... The Rockies won three straight
on the road for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos are 20-39 since June 5 when they were a
season-high eight games over .500 for the second time this season.
Montreal has won just seven of its last 28 games -- and one of seven
-- at Olympic Stadium to fall to 29-30 at home. ... Backup catcher
Lenny Webster is scheduled to appear in a Cornwall, Ontario, court
Monday to face charges of illegally importing a handgun into
Canada. ... Pitching coach Brad Arnsberg got into a heated argument
with plate umpire Alfonso Marquez during a mound visit after Mike
Thurman had walked Jeff Cirillo to load the bases in the fourth.
Diamondbacks-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: SS Tony Womack, who had arthroscopic left knee surgery
after the 1997 season, left Sunday's game with irritation in the
knee. He will be re-examined Monday in Philadelphia. He appeared to
be in discomfort Sunday but said, ''I can't let it affect me.''
Womack was 5-for-12 with four runs scored and three stolen bases in
the three-game weekend series in Pittsburgh. ... RHP Johnny Ruffin
went on the DL with a groin injury following Sunday's game and OF
David Dellucci rejoined the Diamondbacks from Triple-A Tucson. ...
3B Matt Williams didn't like it when Pirates RHP Josias Manzanillo
yelled in satisfaction after retiring him on a fly ball in the
sixth. Williams said, ''I'll put it this way, I usually don't let
my emotions get the best of me on the field. However, nobody on
this club shows anybody up and we don't want to be shown up,
either.'' ... RHP Brian Anderson knew he was in trouble Sunday when
C Kelly Stinnett couldn't tell his four-seam fastball from his
two-seamer. Normally, the rising four-seamer is the faster of the
two. Anderson said, ''That means I'm not finishing my pitches. It's
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: 1B Kevin Young said the Pirates' season ''has been a
total disaster, but I still don't think we're that far away. The
thing about a season like this is it really motivates you to do
better.'' Young, despite having an off-year, has 71 RBIs and could
come close to matching last year's 106 RBIs. ... There apparently
has been no movement on C Jason Kendall's contract since general
manager Cam Bonifay said talks were stalemated two weeks ago. ...
The Pirates have lost their last nine Sunday games, last winning
June 11 in Kansas City. ... RHP Jason Schmidt will have
arthroscopic shoulder surgery Thursday in Birmingham, Ala.
Cardinals-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Eduardo Perez, batting .303, went on the 15-day DL
with a sprained right knee. He was replaced on the roster by
reliever Gene Stechschulte, who had a 4-1 record, 26 saves and 2.45
ERA in 41 games at Triple-A Memphis of the Pacific Coast League.
Stechschulte pitched 1 1-3 innings at the setup pitcher in Sunday's
6-4 victory over Milwaukee. ''When you're the closer on a winning
team in the minors, that's as good as it gets,'' manager Tony La
Russa said. ... Jim Edmonds was 0-for-12 in the weekend series in
Milwaukee and is batting .315. ... J.D. Drew had a career-high four
hits Sunday. ''He's got as high a ceiling as any guy playing
today,'' La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Manager Davy Lopes hopes to have SS Mark Loretta, who
was batting .305 when he went on the DL June 2, back in the lineup
Friday in Houston. Loretta was scheduled for three more games --
Sunday, Monday and Wednesday -- at Indianapolis before returning to
Milwaukee for a checkup Thursday. ''If he's close, he'll come with
us to Houston,'' Lopes said. ''If not, he'll probably go back (to
Indy) and play some more.''
Reds-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey Jr. is the only major leaguer with more
homers than Sammy Sosa from 1993 to 2000. Griffey has hit 345 while
Sosa has 335. ... Reds pitchers have thrown 78 wild pitches, the
most in the majors. ... Starting pitcher Steve Parris is a native
of nearby Joliet, Ill. ... Sometime during next weekend's homestand
against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Reds will reach the 2 million
mark in attendance for the second straight season. With 1,964,246
in attendance through 59 dates, the Reds are on pace to reach
2,729,944. That would eclipse the franchise record of 2,629,708 set
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: After going scoreless for the last 13 innings, manager
Don Baylor tweaked his lineup for Sunday's game. Jose Nieves was at
third and Gary Matthews Jr. started in center field. ''When you get
shutout 13 consecutive innings, you can't stand pat and say, 'OK,
we're going to come out it,''' Baylor said. ''I want to come out of
it today.'' ... OF Rondell White, on the disabled list July 8 to
Aug. 6 with a strained right hamstring, spent some time before the
game working with hitting coach Jeff Pentland. White requested the
extra work, Baylor said. ''When you're off a month, your timing is
off,'' Baylor said. ''He hasn't really had any guys he could get
real good pitches to hit. He just needed some extra work.'' ...
Manager Don Baylor chose RHP Jamie Arnold to fill Kerry Wood's spot
in the rotation Tuesday. Arnold was 2-1 with a 4.58 ERA in three
games at Triple-A Iowa.
Padres-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Closer Trevor Hoffman has 261 career saves, passing
Rod Beck for 14th place on the career list. ... The Padres placed C
Ben Davis on the 15-day DL Sunday with a strained left rib cage and
purchased the contract of catcher George Williams from Triple-A Las
Vegas. ... Brian Tollberg, who won his first two career starts this
season, hasn't won in his next nine. He is 2-2 with seven
no-decisions in his last nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Preston Wilson struck out once, giving him 149 for
the season -- 40 shy of Bobby Bonds' record set in 1970. Wilson has
gone 22 games without a home run. ... SS Alex Gonzalez, on the DL
since July 28, says he could return in a few days. ... 2B Luis
Castillo stole his major league-leading 48th base.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Plans Low-Key US Stop  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian waved to
well-wishers outside his hotel Sunday but made no statement and
planned no official meetings during an overnight visit to this city
where Democrats prepared for their national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Chen slipped quietly into the Los Angeles area with no red
carpet or government welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   China protested the 16-hour stopover, while the top Democrat on
the House International Relations Committee complained that the
Clinton administration pressured Chen into not meeting with several
members of Congress attending the convention.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chen's first venture abroad as president. The two-week
trip, which also will include stops in the Caribbean, Central
America and Africa, is aimed at strengthening ties with Taiwan's
dwindling number of diplomatic allies. The United States does not
have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but 29 small nations
do.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes amid continuing tension over China's claim that
Taiwan is part of its territory. Chen has tried to improve
unofficial U.S ties while offering conciliatory gestures and summit
invitations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee, had invited about a dozen
Democratic and Republican committee members and others to meet with
Chen at a private residence in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen declined the invitation. While officials in Taiwan
downplayed the cancellation, Gejdenson complained that the State
Department and White House had ''pressured (him) to refrain from
meeting with Congress during his visit'' and keep a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staff member, Amos Hochstein, said Sunday that 12 to
15 members of Congress had been expected to attend. With several
lawmakers in town for the convention ''we thought it would be a
good opportunity to meet with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department publicly objected to such a meeting last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and most other countries recognize only
mainland China, which claims that Taiwan is part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had warned that even the brief stop on U.S. soil could
severely damage U.S. ties with China. In 1995, a more extensive
visit by then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui was followed by
Chinese missile tests near Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting permission to stop in the United States was an
important victory for Chen. In Taiwan, it was viewed as a sign that
Washington trusted Chen would not do anything to disrupt America's
delicate relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Chen's airplane was parked about 600 feet from
the Air Force One jet that brought President Clinton to town for
the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese Foreign Ministry official Wu Tzu-dan declined comment
on the cancellation. Asked if Chen still might meet with any
members of Congress individually, Wu said he would only ''wave to
them from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''President Chen will spend most of his time in the hotel'' in
Long Beach where a banquet was scheduled for the Taiwanese leader
and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., in an interview with Associated
Press Television Network, accused the administration of ''groveling
before a dictator'' in its lack of a warm reception for Chen, who
is democratically elected leader of Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> 16 Die in Kashmir Blasts, Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- A series of explosions and gunbattles rocked
the Himalayan province of Kashmir on Sunday, leaving 16 people dead
and dozens injured in stepped-up violence before India's
Independence Day celebrations, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Kud, two land mines exploded under buses
carrying Indian paramilitary troops, authorities said. Six troops
were killed and 40 injured, 10 critically.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen -- the largest of the
Muslim rebel groups here -- claimed responsibility for the mine
explosions at Kud, 50 miles north of Jammu, the winter capital of
Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would increase attacks against Indian troops
here. The province is the seat of an Islamic insurgency that has
left 25,000 people dead in the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to end Indian rule in Kashmir and our
activities will escalate,'' Salim Hashmi, a Hezb-ul Mujahedeen
spokesman in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, told The Associated
Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The buses were part of a convoy carrying security personnel to
Srinagar, 185 miles to the north, ahead of Tuesday's Independence
Day celebration. Militants fighting Indian security forces in
Kashmir usually increase violence against the government during the
run-up to the Aug. 15 celebration, and separatist guerrilla groups
have vowed to wreck the festivities again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, an army foot patrol sighted militants in a remote,
mountainous area 160 miles north of Jammu and opened fire on them.
An ensuing gunbattle left 10 rebels dead, Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra
said. No army casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The army described the killings as a major success in its
intensified anti-militancy operations on the eve of Indian
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the province, three smaller explosions injured two
people Sunday. In Srinagar, police sealed an area around the Bakshi
Stadium where the Independence Day parade is held every year.
Militants usually fire rockets and grenades toward the stadium to
disrupt the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police set up metal barricades on the roads to check all
vehicles in the area. Passengers on buses were frisked with metal
detectors. Many residents stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainous province of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, both of which claim it in its entirety. The Islamic
guerrillas want Indian-controlled Kashmir to break away from
heavily Hindu India and either remain independent or become part of
mostly Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf on Sunday pledged to
continue support for the uprising in Kashmir during a speech to
celebrate his country's Independence Day, which falls on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pakistan stands united with their Kashmiri brothers and
sisters in their just cause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Islamabad of supporting and arming the militants,
a charge the government here denies. Pakistan insists it only gives
moral support to the Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks here increased after Hezb-ul Mujahedeen called off a
brief cease-fire this week. The group wanted India to involve
Pakistan in talks on resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India
refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, militants set off two powerful bombs in downtown
Srinagar, killing 14 soldiers and journalists and wounding 25
others. On Saturday, suspected guerrillas lobbed a grenade near a
mosque in Srinagar, wounding two Hungarian and two Kashmiri women.

<HEADLINE> Leaf, Moreno Likely to Get a Start  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Although he was shaded from the afternoon sun,
San Diego Chargers coach Mike Riley was on the hot seat Sunday
about how he's going to use his quarterbacks in the final two
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ryan Leaf, pegged as the franchise's savior two summers ago
before being sidelined by his bad-boy act and a shoulder injury,
get a start as he continues his solid comeback? How about
second-stringer Moses Moreno, the local product who's made just one
career regular-season start?
</P>
<P>
   Riley was short on specifics but said the coaching staff will
consider all scenarios leading up to Friday night's game at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The line of questioning came up after starter Jim Harbaugh was
ineffective in the first three possessions in Saturday night's 31-7
win over the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said it certainly wasn't all Harbaugh's fault, because
receivers blew routes, the protection wasn't good and the Chargers'
running game went nowhere -- they had 0 rushing yards at halftime.
The Chargers had just 35 yards total offense at halftime, but led
14-7, thanks largely to rookie Ronney Jenkins' 86-yard kickoff
return for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to evaluate it some more and not jump to any
conclusions right now, just stay status quo,'' Riley said. ''It's
probably not necessary to do anything right away on that. But we
will look at it. We are in a competitive deal here now, so
production is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley also said the Chargers (2-0) are ''trying to be
equitable,'' and someone other than Harbaugh could start against
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will definitely be one of the things that we'll look at
and really, that's not a reflection on where Jim is,'' he said.
''I'm not going say that we've made a change in our starter, but in
order to get somebody else some earlier turns, we may change the
rotation around.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf and Moreno both played well Saturday night. Leaf was
11-of-18 for 80 yards and led the Chargers on two scoring drives,
one of just 5 yards following an interception, and a 72-yard drive
using the no-huddle offense that was capped by a field goal. Moreno
threw the Chargers' only TD pass of the night and finished 6-of-8
for 82 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh was 2-of-5 for 1 yard with one interception and a
fumble, which San Diego recovered. In two games he is 7-of-13 for
34 yards with no TDs and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the Chargers should have a starter picked, or be real
close, by the final exhibition game against Arizona on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we want to take one more hard look at somebody, then that
person may get extended time in that game,'' he said. ''I don't
think we're at that point yet, but we're going to be forced here
pretty soon to make that decision, and maybe we can get it done by
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said one consideration in the quarterback rotation is
giving the quarterbacks work with starting center Roman Fortin.
Once Fortin's out, rookie Jason Thomas takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard part is who to give the opportunity to, really, with
that first-string line,'' he said. ''I just think that is a
critical part of the ballgame. How we do that is important for the
quarterbacks to have an opportunity to show what they can do.''

<HEADLINE> Indians 10, Mariners 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Travis Fryman and the Cleveland Indians got
plenty of help from the Seattle Mariners on Sunday, not that they
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman homered, doubled and drove in four runs and the Indians
took advantage of Seattle's sloppy fielding for a 10-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland won for the ninth time in 11 games and moved one
percentage point ahead of Oakland for the AL wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pay attention to who else is winning or losing,'' said
Fryman, ''but there are plenty of guys who can tell you all the
stats. I'm just concerned with us playing well. If we take care of
our own business maybe we can win this division.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland trails the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox by 7&AMP;frac12;
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got something going right now, don't we?'' Cleveland
manager Charlie Manuel said. ''The trouble is, we have 40-something
games left. We've got a long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners made four errors in a game for the first time since
June 8, 1998. They began the day with a .986 fielding percentage,
second only to Cleveland (.987) in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Cleveland) played well against us,'' said Mariners manager
Lou Piniella. ''They came in here hot and they showed us why. We
played a little sloppy early, which is not a characteristic of our
team. Our team has been good and solid on defense, but before you
turned around we had four errors on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made seven errors in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman hit a two-out, two-run drive in the seventh inning off
Jose Mesa for his 16th home run. It was the Indians' first homer
since last Sunday, snapping their season-high 53-inning drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to hit one out of this park,'' Fryman said. ''You
really have to hit it well. I thought Manny (Ramirez) hit one in
the first, but it didn't make it out to center. I happened to get
around on it and took it out to left.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Speier (4-1) recorded the win with 2 1-3 innings of
hitless relief. He walked three and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Speier has yet to allow a run in the month of August, going 3-0
with just one hit allowed and nine strikeouts in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed to get off to a good start on this road trip,'' said
Speier. ''To come away with a series win after losing the first
game to Seattle is big. We have a good thing going, and now we need
to get ready for Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians open a three-game series at Oakland on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia (4-3) allowed six runs, four of them earned, on
six hits and four walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland scored once in the first without a hit. Kenny Lofton
reached on an error by third baseman Carlos Guillen and Roberto
Alomar walked.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez followed with a deep fly and that center fielder Al
Martin caught at the wall, but his throw eluded shortstop Alex
Rodriguez and second baseman Mark McLemore. Lofton scored from
second on the throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver hit a solo homer in the Seattle third off Steve
Woodard, and the Mariners added another run in the inning when
Martin tripled and Edgar Martinez singled. Martinez leads the
majors with 112 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's lead didn't last long as Garcia allowed three singles
to open the fourth, including an RBI single by Fryman that made it
2-all.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians went on to load the bases on a throwing error by
Garcia, and regained the lead as Wil Cordero came home on a
double-play grounder by Sandy Alomar Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland continued to build its lead in unconventional ways in
the fifth. Omar Vizquel bunted for a single and reached second
after Guillen threw wide of first for his second error of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel went to third on a wild pitch from Garcia and scored on
a balk. Cordero hit a two-run double for a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you don't make good pitches, they will make you pay for
it,'' said Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero and Fryman hit RBI doubles in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle chased Woodard in the fifth. With one out, Rickey
Henderson doubled, Martin singled and Rodriguez hit a two-run
double.
Notes: Cleveland won its seventh game in 10 tries at Safeco Field,
the most of any visiting team. ... David Segui went 2-for-4 in day
games this weekend, and leads the league with a .443 average
(47-for-106) in day games. He did not play Sunday. ... Garcia made
his first career start against Cleveland, the only AL team he had
not faced. ... In his career, Garcia is 9-2 with a 3.86 ERA against
the other AL central opponents. ... Martin played in his 1,000th
career game. ... In the third, Martinez stole his first base since
Aug. 30, 1999. ... Seattle matched a franchise high with five
stolen bases. It's the second time the Mariners have done it this
year and 14th time in team history.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Urges Help for Poor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony, who will deliver an
invocation at Monday's opening of the Democratic National
Convention, told Catholic delegates on Sunday that children's lives
are threatened ''both in the womb and in our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the invitation to speak from the convention podium
is a departure from recent years. Catholic leaders have turned down
such offers in decisions widely seen as a reactions to Democratic
support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony, the archbishop of the Los Angeles diocese, the nation's
largest with nearly 4 million Catholics, told about 350 people
during Mass on Sunday at the Wilshire Grand Hotel that society
faces three main threats:
</P>
<P>
   --To human life from legalized abortion, capital punishment and
doctor-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   --To human dignity from the growing gap between rich and poor,
and a scarcity of affordable housing, health care, child care and
quality education.
</P>
<P>
   --And to human rights from exploitation of immigrant workers,
discrimination, racism and a minimum wage that is insufficient to
''support a family in dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, God will not rely on polling data to judge our
fidelity to the Gospels,'' he told the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''God will not convene focus groups to determine our moral
integrity or our ethical fitness,'' he said. ''Instead, we will
face a self-examination that is both simple and stark: Whatever we
did for the least of those among us, we did for God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenges that stand before us are many,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One such challenge, he said, is ''to reinvigorate a deeper sense
of promoting the common good, rather than an exaggerated sense of
individualism.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony has been a leading voice on church positions against
capital punishment and abortion. This year he urged Gov. Gray Davis
to declare a moratorium on capital punishment for an investigation
of possible inequities and biases.

<HEADLINE> Bogota Car Bomb Caps Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A car bomb exploded outside a police
station on the capital's outskirts Sunday, injuring a civilian,
amid rural clashes between troops and guerrillas that left at least
17 dead over the weekend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has apparently escalated in the run-up to President
Clinton's planned visit to Colombia on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was intended for a military truck carrying soldiers as
it passed through a working class neighborhood in southern Bogota,
said Alfredo Salgado, assistant director of Colombia's national
police.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosives, packed into a Fiat sedan less than 20 yards
from the police station, exploded minutes after the truck passed
by, damaging several homes and buildings, and injuring one person,
Salgado said. The person was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Police attributed the attack to the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came amid a weekend of fighting in different parts
of Colombia that has left at least eight soldiers and nine
guerrillas dead, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend battle that was still raging Sunday between about 500
FARC guerillas and government soldiers trying to reclaim a
rebel-controlled town has killed at least two soldiers and seven
rebels, said Gen. Heran Cadavid, head of the army's Sixth Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out Saturday afternoon when soldiers moved
into Roncesvalles, a village 125 miles southwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   FARC forces also laid siege to a hydroelectric plant in
Anchicacaya, 215 miles west of Bogota, on Saturday night. Five
soldiers were killed and seven wounded as they pursued the rebels,
the army announced in a news release Sunday night. One more solider
remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country's second guerrilla group, the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, on Sunday was concluding a week-long
campaign of attacks to protest a $1.3 billion anti-drug trafficking
aid package for Colombia that Clinton signed into law last month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit Colombia's port city of Cartagena to meet
with President Andres Pastrana and top anti-drug officials.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN vowed last Sunday to set up road blocks on major
highways and stage attacks for a week to protest the aid package.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier and two ELN guerrillas were killed in clashes
Saturday night at a pair of rebel road blocks near the northeastern
towns of Maceo and Segovia, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say ELN rebels also kidnapped dozens of people, destroyed
37 electric power stations, torched 69 cars and trucks and damaged
70 highways during their week of violence.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to FIX overline to 4 officers shot  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The deranged man who wounded four police
officers from two Brooklyn houses was once a jail guard who aspired
to become an officer, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's siege that ended in the death of the gunman,
Arthur Alalouf, police found an arsenal in his basement, along with
a dead dog and cat and ''dozens and dozens of samurai swords, Bowie
knives, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition,'' said police Chief
of Detectives William Allee Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old former correction officer was dressed in a
camouflage shirt and armed with a survival knife when he died
trying to escape at the end of the six-hour siege.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Alalouf warned his parents ''that he would shoot
the police,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quoted his parents as telling
officers at the 61st Precinct in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly couple had gone there to report that their son
purchased weapons Friday and brought them to the home they shared
in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. They also told police he had
asked his family to leave, or he would burn down the house, said
police Sgt. Janet Velez.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at about 1:45 p.m., as police approached the house,
he opened fire with a shotgun from a back window.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Gregory John was hit, suffering a shoulder wound.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani later displayed the officer's Kevlar vest, which had at
least eight holes where the buckshot had torn into the chest area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for the vest,'' Giuliani said. Officer John actually
was wearing two vests - his personal vest beneath his uniform, and
a heavier ESU vest on top.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers descended upon the area and
evacuated neighbors from nearby houses.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the shootout from his home at 16 Parkway
Court, Alalouf made a dash through the backyard and across a fence
to a nearby home, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing he had fled, police entered the first house with
infrared robotic cameras and tried to distract the gunman with
flash and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Alalouf remained hidden in the second house until about 8 p.m.,
when police approached the front door and he opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officer James McGrath, 33, suffered a graze wound to the face,
and Officer Jose Guerra, 34, was struck in the face and leg, said
Officer Louis Cruz, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect fled out the back window, where the fourth officer,
Jose Ocasio, 43, was shot once in the left calf, Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired back and Alalouf was fatally wounded. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of his home, police found a cache of firearms
that included five rifles, two other Mini-14 assault rifles,
holsters, survival equipment and four pistols - two licensed for
target shooting and two unregistered.
</P>
<P>
   The dog and cat were sealed in a box, and appeared to be dead
about a month, Allee said. It was unclear how they died. Also found
in the house were several live dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mossberg 12-guage shotgun used to wound the officers, as
well as one of the Mini-14s and the hundreds of rounds of
ammunition, were purchased Friday at a gun shop on New Utrecht
Avenue in Brooklyn, said Allee, the chief of detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were obtained legally, and Alalouf had a month to
register them. He paid for them with his father's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   John, the 32-year-old Emergency Service Unit officer with 10
years on the job, was in stable condition Saturday at Kings County
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and Guerra, also members of the Emergency Service Unit,
also were being treated at Kings County Hospital. Three other
officers suffered minor injuries that were not gunshot-related,
including scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra, who suffered eye damage and had bullet fragments lodged
in his esophagus, was in serious condition. Ocasio was conscious
''and seems to be doing well,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath reportedly was released.
</P>
<P>
   While the three hospitalized officers were ''in a great deal of
pain,'' Giuliani said, he was relieved that none had been wounded
by ''friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor described Alalouf as ''obviously seriously deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities could not immediately obtain his employment record,
but Giuliani said he worked as a New York correction officer from
1982 to 1984; he was fired after complaints against him the mayor
said were ''unsubstantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point after that, ''he made an attempt to become a
police officer.''

Gore Would Seek Clinton's Counsel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, at the very moment he is trying to
emerge from President Clinton's shadow, said today he would not hesitate to seek
Clinton's counsel if he succeeds him. ''Why would I rule that out?'' Gore said
in an interview with The Associated Press. The vice president, battling
Republican attempts to shackle him to Clinton's personal scandals, also said he
would serve his own term in the Oval Office ''according to the highest values.''
Gore spoke on the eve of Clinton's valedictory tomorrow night to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.

Study: TV Coverage Favors Republicans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- TV networks have given George W. Bush more favorable
coverage than Al Gore, both during the GOP convention and throughout the
presidential race, a new analysis finds. Still, Republicans are worried the
networks will give the Democratic National Convention more TV time this week
than they gave the GOP gathering in Philadelphia two weeks ago. The study, being
released tomorrow by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, examined 72
stories that aired during the Republican National Convention, July 31-Aug. 3, on
the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news. It found that 60 percent of people quoted in
stories praised Bush's policies, political skills or personal character, while
80 percent of people quoted criticized Gore.

Ford: Problem Tires Made During Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Many of the 6.5 million Firestone tires being
recalled were made during a strike at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant, Ford
Motor Co. said today. The tires are under investigation in hundreds of crashes
that caused at least 46 deaths. Ford conducted an analysis of its Firestone
tires and the complaints it had received to pin down where the tires were made.
The number of complaints was 10 times higher for the 15-inch ATX tires made in
Decatur than for the Wilderness tires, said Jason Vines, Ford's vice president
of communications. At the time, union workers at the plant were on strike, and
the plant was operating with replacement workers and managers.
Bridgestone/Firestone said the strike had nothing to do with the problems.

   JAMMU, India (AP) -- A series of explosions and gunbattles rocked the
Himalayan province of Kashmir on Sunday, leaving 16 people dead and dozens
injured in stepped-up violence before India's Independence Day celebrations,
police said. In the village of Kud, two land mines exploded under buses carrying
Indian paramilitary troops, authorities said. Six soldiers were killed and 40
injured, 10 critically. The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen -- the largest of
the Muslim rebel groups here -- claimed responsibility for the mine explosions
at Kud, 50 miles north of Jammu, the winter capital of Indian-controlled
Kashmir.

Cloning Pioneers End Pig Research
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The creators of Dolly the Sheep are halting their research
into genetically modifying pigs for human organ transplants, one of the
scientists said today. The decision is motivated in part by fears that
transplanting animal organs into people could unleash deadly new viruses among
the human population. California-based Geron Bio-Med, which owns exclusive
rights to biotechnology developed by Edinburgh's Roslin Institute -- where Dolly
was created -- has decided to cut funding for the work, said Ian Wilmut, leader
of the team that created Dolly, the first clone made from an adult animal.

By The Associated PressThe Rev. Artur Erikson:
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Rev. Artur Erikson, a popular
Lutheran singer who wrote more than 600 songs, has died. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson died Thursday at his home in Gagnef, 120 miles northwest
of the capital, Stockholm, according to Swedish media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson got his start in music from his father, a singing
minister who often took his son along as he toured the country. The
boy made his stage debut at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Erikson became a minister in Sweden's dominant Lutheran
church and took his own act on the road for 15 years. He made
frequent radio appearances starting in 1956 and became a household
name in the early 1960s as a guest on Sweden's most popular
television talk show, Hyland's Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Erikson, whose repertoire spanned from gospel to psalms, topped
the local charts in 1970, with his song ''To My Sister.'' Erikson
recorded and produced 28 albums, earning six gold records.
Don Ettlinger:
</P>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Don Ettlinger, a writer for film, television
and theater, died Aug. 7 at a hospital here. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Ettlinger was born in Detroit and attended Stanford University
and the University of Chicago. While still an undergraduate, he was
hired by 20th Century Fox in Hollywood and, at 21, became one of
the youngest contract writers on the Fox lot.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ettlinger's early projects, written with Karl Tunberg,
was the 1938 film ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' starring Shirley
Temple. With Tunberg, Ettlinger also wrote ''Shipyard Sally''
(1940), which was based on a story by Gracie Fields, Tom Geraghty
and Val Valentine, and was a writer of ''The Great American
Broadcast'' (1941).
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, Ettlinger worked for Studio One
and Kraft Television Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Katrina he is survived by two
daughters, a son and four grandchildren.
Claude Hope:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Claude Hope, a horticulturist known among many
gardening enthusiasts as the father of the impatiens -- the No. 1
bedding plant in America, died July 14 in Costa Rica. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Hope died at his 200-acre farm in the Costa Rican village of
Dulce Nombre de Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Hope, through years of breeding and hybridizing,
turned the unruly impatiens of the wild into the compact, reliable
mass of blooms that now poke their heads up -- too often, its
detractors say -- in yards, window boxes and public spaces across
North America.
Pedro Lavoura:
</P>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Pedro Lavoura, a Venezuelan midfielder
playing for Portugal's Sporting Braga, was killed Sunday when his
car veered off the road and slammed into a wall, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other passengers also died in the accident that occurred
near Aveiro, about 130 miles north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   The three men were ejected from the car, a Porsche. The engine
went up in flames about 55 yards away from the wall, according to
police. It was not immediately known who was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Lavoura, 26, began playing in Portugal with Anadia, a
second-division club, in 1994. He joined Braga last year.
G. Warren Schloat Jr.:
</P>
<P>
   ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) -- G. Warren Schloat Jr., a writer and
illustrator of children's books who also worked on several of the
classic films from the Walt Disney Studios, died on July 30 at a
hospital here. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Schloat wrote and illustrated 22 children's books, including
''Andy's Wonderful Telescope,'' ''Fay Gow, a Boy of Hong Kong'' and
''Playtime for You.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had worked his way up the ranks at Walt Disney Studios,
first as an animator and later as a story editor, where he
contributed to classics like ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''
and ''Dumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia, two sons, a brother and
five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Dreaded Jury Duty Not So Bad  </HEADLINE>
By THEO EMERY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Jury duty -- words often spoken in the same
anguished tone as ''root canal'' -- may not be as painful as
commonly thought.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston newspaper for attorneys surveyed jurors and found that
once they were involved in the case they generally enjoyed weighing
the evidence and took the judgment of their peers seriously.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of respondents to the poll, published in
Monday's edition of Lawyers Weekly, said the experience was
positive, and some said it renewed their faith in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher David L. Yas was surprised by the results of the
survey, which he said was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people dread jury duty,'' Yas said. ''What we found is
that once people get in there, they're intrigued by the case,
energized by jury duty, and overall find duty quite positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, it is illegal for attorneys to speak with
jurors even after a court case, so the survey was administered by
judges.
</P>
<P>
   With the permission of State Jury Commissioner Frank Davis and
Superior Court Chief Justice Suzanne V. DelVecchio, 30 judges gave
out surveys to jurors in superior court cases. About 130 people
responded. All responses were voluntary and anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The cases ranged from contract disputes to medical malpractice
to first degree murder. One involved a lawsuit about a dog biting
another dog.
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked an array of questions about courtroom tactics,
the condition of the courthouse, the appearance and demeanor of
lawyers and court employees, the use of witnesses and exhibits, and
jurors' overall impression of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents reported not sleeping at night because of the
gravity of the case, feeling proud of being part of the justice
system, and finding the whole process to be a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our justice system may not be perfect, but it works and I am
proud to have served,'' one respondent wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another wrote: ''After several cases such as the O.J. Simpson
trial, I lost all respect for the system. This case helped restore
my respect for the system. There is hope for us.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the returned surveys were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not only a waste of my time, but the compensation was
ridiculous,'' one juror wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another complained about having to clean up the jury room and
pay for parking and gas and said jurors should be treated with more
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Yas said he has not been on a real jury, only a jury at a mock
trial for middle school students. But even that case, which
involved vehicular homicide charges against a woman who ran over a
man after a concert, was riveting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was tremendous,'' he said. ''We probably could have gone on
for hours.''

<HEADLINE> Some Delegates Use Nonunion Hotels  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic National Convention officials
tried to house participants in unionized hotels for this week, but
when those rooms ran out, they resorted to booking them into
nonunion facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, however, are not complaining, even though one
hostelry is the nonunion Loews in Santa Monica that is owned by a
major contributor to the Democratic Party and has been the scene of
a bitter union organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not even slightly'' upset with the Democrats, John W.
Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon pep rally at a downtown Los Angeles hotel, union
representatives handed pink and yellow buttons -- declaring ''We
support Loews workers'' -- to labor delegates attending the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 1,500 labor delegates waved signs, wore
colored T-shirts with the name of their union, and cheered AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney as he exhorted them to elect Democratic
candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have set the table for restoring the voices of working
families,'' Sweeney declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney also attended a later demonstration at the Loews, which
is owned by Jonathan Tisch, a major Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of union members rallied in favor of the Loews Hotel
workers, demanding they have the right to join a union. Several
speakers criticized Tisch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a moral challenge,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson told
reporters after the rally. ''The party would do a great service to
give him his money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said: ''Mr. Tisch, I know you've
been a big contributor to the Democratic Party. But the Democratic
Party must be there with the employees, must be there with the
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO and most major unions have endorsed the ticket of
Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
But the rally site has its own irony.
</P>
<P>
   Tisch, president and chief executive officer of Loews Hotels
Corp., is also a ''trustee'' donor of the Lieberman-led, centrist
Democratic Leadership Counsel. The tax-exempt group would not
disclose the contribution required to be a ''trustee.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tisch's fellow large donors as well as Jackson and
several fiscally conservative Democratic House members are staying
at the Loews. However, the Kennedy-led Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee moved its operations to a unionized hotel
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no other rooms,'' DCCC spokesman Eric Smith said of
the nonunion bookings. ''Months ago people were optimistic this
labor situation would have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel-restaurant union officials estimate only 30 percent of
the rooms in the Los Angeles area are in unionized hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking the Democrats to support the hotel workers
actively,'' Wilhelm said. ''The labor dispute erupted late,
beginning in late May.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisch, in a letter to the workers, said, ''Our position is
simple: The employees of this hotel should decide on union
representation.'' He said that ''the best way to do this is by an
election. This will ensure a fair, secret ballot election so that
employees can vote their wishes free from intimidation and
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The union opposes an election, preferring that a new bargaining
unit be recognized when a majority of the workers sign union cards.
Union officials said workers would feel coerced in an election
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has accused the other of unwarranted pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel-restaurant union contends a Loews-hired consulting
firm has intimidated workers to persuade them not to unionize.
Management has ''held captive audience meetings'' where workers
were forced to ''listen to anti-union harangues,'' said David Koff,
a research analyst with the union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Workers were threatened with arrest and with losing their
jobs,'' Koff said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Richard Mintz, a spokesman for Loews Hotels
Corp., contended the union has contacted potential members ''in the
middle of the night, screamed at them as they left the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Mintz said wage scales at the hotel range from $7 to $10 an
hour, but the figures do not include gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said their contracts for hotel workers here
range from $9.50 to $11.50 per hour.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Gabe Kapler extended his hitting streak
to 26 games, longest in the majors this season, with a single in
the sixth inning Sunday night for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two at-bats against Boston, Kapler flied out and
hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler set the Rangers' franchise record on Saturday night when
he went 3-for-3 against the Red Sox and extended the streak to 25
games. The Texas-Washington record had been held by Mickey Rivers,
who hit in 24 straight games during the 1980 season.
</P>
<P>
   The last major leaguer with a hitting streak of more than 25
games was Shannon Stewart, who hit in 26 straight games for Toronto
in August 1999.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- TV networks have given George W. Bush more
favorable coverage than Al Gore, both during the GOP convention and
throughout the presidential race, a new analysis finds.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being released Monday by the Center for Media and

</P>
<P>
   It found that 60 percent of people quoted in stories praised

</P>
<P>
   ''This is a man bites dog story for Republicans, who love to
hate the media,'' said S. Robert Lichter, the center's president.
''For the first time in memory, the GOP presidential nominee is
clearly beating the Democrat in the race for good press.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at coverage during the primaries, when
both Bush and Gore faced challenges from fellow party members. From
Jan. 1 through March 7, when the nominations were sealed, 53
percent of the comments about Bush were positive, compared with 40
percent of comments about Gore, who will be formally nominated by
Democrats this week.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage this year is the inverse of 1992 and 1996, when
President Clinton received much more positive coverage than his
opponents, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans are worried the networks will give the
Democratic National Convention more TV time this week than they
gave the GOP gathering in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson wrote to
the heads of the news divisions at ABC, NBC and CBS, saying that
while he had hoped for gavel-to-gavel coverage of the GOP
convention, he realized that was unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''A more realistic wish is this,'' he wrote, ''that based on
your commitment to fair and unbiased reporting, you will devote the
same amount of time to the Democrats' convention as you did to ours
-- but not a minute more.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday that for
Israelis and Palestinians the inconclusive Camp David peace summit
was like having a tooth drilled without anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mostly put partisan politics on hold during a speech to
members of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a Jewish
lobbying organization. Clinton is in town for the Democratic
National Convention, where he is a featured speaker Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood why both sides left the hardest issues for
last in their gradual pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like going to the dentist without anybody to
deaden your gums,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was still disappointed by the failure to get a
peace deal despite round-the-clock negotiations last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to sugarcoat it. I wanted an agreement and we
didn't get one, but I can tell you we made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   One major stumbling block was the fate of Jerusalem, as Clinton
acknowledged to the crowd at an outdoor party at a Hollywood movie
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a holy city, but it has caused a hellish lot of
problems,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to keep working at it through the remaining six
months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the meantime we will continue to stand with Israel, as we
have throughout my tenure,'' Clinton said to loud applause.

<HEADLINE> More Army Soldiers Head to Fires  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- Hundreds of evacuees were allowed back
into homes in the Elkhorn Mountains on Sunday, but wildfires still
threatened more than 2,000 homes across the state.
</P>
<P>
   So far this fire season, more than 365,000 acres of Montana has
burned -- an area larger than the city of Los Angeles -- and 169
buildings, including more than 50 homes, have burned.
</P>
<P>
   More soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, were on their way to help
fight the fires Sunday, and 79 firefighters from Australia and New
Zealand were also en route, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, 76 major fires were burning on 869,000 acres in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, the fire
center said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, a pilot was killed Sunday when his helicopter crashed
while he was making water drops on a wildfire. The blaze, in a
remote about 50 miles east of Fallon, had already consumed 37,700
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was the eighth firefighter killed fighting wildfires
this year, and the second killed in a helicopter crash this month
in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   South of Helena on Sunday, cars full of residents and their
belongings wound their way back toward homes firefighters had saved
in Montana's Elkhorn Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had gotten a break from the weather Saturday and
had made progress toward containing the fires, said Larry Humphrey,
the area's incident commander. Wildfires in the area had burned
13,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are going pretty good,'' said Erin Connelly, a fire
information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also reported progress in the Bitterroot Valley,
where one cluster of fires south of Hamilton had burned 112,000
acres and another north of Hamilton had charred 8,700 acres.
However, evacuation orders remained in effect for an estimated
1,400 households.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days with cooler temperatures and little or no wind
had given firefighters a chance to concentrate on building more
containment lines, said Mike Odegard, a fire information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, so good,'' he said Sunday. ''The fires are kind of
sitting on themselves, not making any runs.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 560 soldiers from an engineer battalion left
Fort Hood, Texas, on Sunday en route to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are helping us out because we are short on people. We're
spread awfully thin,'' said Howard Parman, a fire information
officer at the National Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion followed 500 other Fort Hood soldiers who earlier
were sent to Idaho. In addition, a battalion of Marines was sent to
the fire lines from Camp Pendleton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, a fire in Wyoming had changed direction, easing
the threat to one town.
</P>
<P>
   The 65,000-acre blaze was spreading eastward on Sunday toward
Wind River Canyon and no longer toward Thermopolis to the north.
For a time Saturday, the town's 3,200 residents had been told to
prepare to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some weary firefighters were getting a chance to take
a break.
</P>
<P>
   A group of fires in south-central Washington's Klickitat County
was declared fully contained Sunday after burning 9,000 acres. Fire
crews on that blaze already had dwindled from more than 500 on
Saturday to 180 on Sunday. ''Basically we're planning on
demobilization today and tomorrow,'' said Mark Clemens of the state
Emergency Operations Center.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Army Frees 5 Held by Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA (AP) -- Soldiers rescued on Sunday a prominent journalist
who had spent 200 days in captivity, as well as German man and
three other hostages abducted by Colombia's largest guerrilla
group, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   One guerrilla was killed in the rescue operation, army Gen.
Jorge Morga told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Cortes, 73, host of a popular weekly television news
program, owner of a Bogota soccer team and part-owner of several
news-oriented Colombian magazines, was kidnapped from his home on
the capital's wealthy northern outskirts on Jan. 22 by leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had demanded $1 million for his release.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-kidnapping squad rescued the five hostages from a
private home in the mountains between the municipalities of Medina
and Los Alpes, about 55 miles south of Bogota, Morga said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A group of soldiers successfully surrounded those guarding the
victims without them realizing it,'' Morga said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those released was Rudolf Somerciel, a German. Somerciel
did not speak to the media Sunday night and army officials did not
release any more details on his kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, the FARC is responsible for
about 30 percent of the 8,000 annual kidnappings in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am afraid for the families of Colombia after this,'' Cortes
told reporters at an air force base in Bogota.

<HEADLINE> Floods cause millions in damages, governor to have estimate on Monday </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - State officials estimated that Saturday's
heavy rains and flooding caused several million dollars worth of
damage in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges washed out, roads collapsed and dams burst after the
region was hit with a deluge of water.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said
officials would have a preliminary estimate of the damage on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman flew over the mud-soaked counties Sunday morning to view
the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County alone, the storm caused about $166 million
worth of damage, said Phil Morlock, the county's health and public
safety administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Morlock said $80 million of that total was damage to bridges and
roads. The rest was to private property, including in Newton, where
water mains were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rivoli, director of the Warren County Office of
Emergency Management, said water was breaching the Musconetcong
River Sunday afternoon. The river flows out of Sussex County and
borders Morris and Warren counties.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hackettstown were being evacuated and other towns
were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   But by 10 p.m. Sunday night, everything had calmed down and the
emergency management offices had closed, according the Warren
County communications center.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning
Sunday for parts of Morris, Warren, Hunterdon and Sussex counties,
due to river flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In Stanhope, two sides of the small dam on Furnace Pond washed
away. Police Chief Douglas Waldron said only a small section was
left this morning and the water was flowing heavily around it.
</P>
<P>
   As of 9:30 p.m., he said crews were collecting barrels from a
factory that flooded. The company manufactured paper with adhesive
backing and workers were trying to ensure nothing hazardous got
into the water, although the company moved most of its materials
before the factory flooded.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, one of the hardest-hit areas, three roads and three
bridges were destroyed by the torrential downpours, which dumped 14
inches of rain on the township, said Police Sgt. Russell Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who live in a small section of Main Street were
evacuated Sunday because fire officials feared a mudslide down a
mountain that rises above the township. Firefighters ferried
residents across metal ladders and ropes set up across fast-moving
currents.
</P>
<P>
   Several homes were blocked on one side by mud from another slide
and on the other by a road that had turned into a brown river.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter carried a small, white dog in his arms while
balancing himself on a tree trunk that had fallen across a stream.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling relieved that I'm on this side and that my kids
are here,'' said Tori Monahan, 33, with her daughters, Katie, 1,
and Kelly, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The force of Saturday's rain and flooding burst the dam on
Sparta's Seneca Lake, a small, private lake surrounded by homes in
Sussex County, the northernmost part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. Police tape surrounded the small
beach at the empty lake, which smelled of dead fish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Brunetti, 43, said the lake emptied of its thousands of
gallons of water in one hour Saturday evening. It was ''just a big
hole, and the dock floating away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 families spent the night in an emergency shelter in
Sparta Township. Steve Wille, a Red Cross volunteer who has lived
here for 30 years, said he'd never seen anything like Saturday's
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all seen sheets of rain for five, 10, 15 minutes. This
continued for hour after hour after hour after hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Preskar Earl said the combination of flooding and downed
trees diverted two ponds in the back yard of her Sparta home into a
stream that runs behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just water and trees and boulders coming everywhere,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, water supply was a major concern as rushing water
took out the town's two water mains along the Sparta Glen, said
Town Manager Camille Furgiulele.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said a nearby well was tapped to alleviate the
problem, but that the supplementary source would only yield about
20 percent of the usual supply of 1 million gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Repair crews were unable to reach the water mains because roads
were flooded and a bridge to access the area had washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Furgiulele said although there are only about 8,000 residents in
Newton, the county seat, up to 20,000 people work there.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding lakes and rivers Saturday washed out bridges in
Jefferson Township and Ogdensburg, and caused road closures in
Morris and Sussex counties.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 customers of GPU Energy were without power Sunday
afternoon in Newton, Sparta and Flemington, said Ron Morano, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Power had been restored to most of the 10,000 customers who were
without it Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year-old boy was struck by lightning Saturday while
fishing with his family in Middle Township, but wasn't seriously
hurt. The lightning bolt hit a lamp post and traveled down to a
metal railing that the barefoot boy was holding onto.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Reopen Border Liaisons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea reopened
border liaison offices Monday, four years after they were closed
because of political tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two Koreas have warmed significantly since
their leaders held a historic summit in Pyongyang, the North's
capital, in June. In follow-up talks by their deputies in Seoul two
weeks ago, the Koreas agreed to reopen the border liaison offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows that the will of South and North Korea to
faithfully implement their summit agreement is firm,'' South Korean
Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu said at the border village of
Panmunjom, 35 miles north of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The liaison offices first opened in 1992 to work as government
channels of dialogue. They closed four years later after a dispute
over a North Korean submarine that washed ashore in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Two telephone hotlines link the two liaison offices across the
border at Panmunjom, which lies inside the 2.5-mile-wide
Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Eight officials from each side will relay messages and conduct
other work in their office for nine hours a day, Seoul's
Unification Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the liaison offices came a day before the
Koreas were to exchange 100 people each for four days of temporary
reunions with long-lost relatives, the first since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June summit, the Koreas already have stopped
propaganda broadcasts against each other and agreed to reconnect a
cross-border railway which was cut off just before the start of the
1950-53 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Raiders 21, Cowboys 20  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Scott Dreisbach threw a 15-yard touchdown
pass to Willy Tate, then a 2-point conversion to David Dunn with
1:08 left, giving the Oakland Raiders a 21-20 victory over the
Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders (1-1) trailed 17-3 at halftime despite their
regulars thoroughly outplaying the Cowboys' first team. Oakland got
within 17-13, then trailed 20-13 when Dreisbach was intercepted
with little more than three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dallas (0-3) showed why it has lost 12 of its last 13
preseason games. The offense went three-and-out, forcing punter
Micah Knorr to kick from his end zone. A short punt gave Dreisbach
a second chance and he cashed it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys drove to the Raiders 41, then sent Tim Seder to try
a 58-yard field goal on the game's final play. It was way short and
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Oakland outgained Dallas 222 yards to 80. The
Raiders ran for 146 yards on 21 carries, an average of 7 per try.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, though, was that the Cowboys cashed in on two
turnovers and a big pass interference penalty. Dallas' three
scoring drives went minus-3 yards, 53 yards and 4 yards -- a total
of 54, with 33 coming by penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cowboys seemed efficient, they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Their first drive began at the Oakland 27 and went backwards 3
yards before Seder kicked a 47-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then Chris Warren scored on a 1-yard touchdown run -- without his
left shoe -- on a drive that got a big boost when Charles Woodson
was called for pass interference in the end zone on a ball Wane
McGarity wasn't likely to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fisher, a fringe candidate in Dallas' cornerback
shuffle, returned an interception 62 yards to set up a 1-yard TD
run by Michael Wiley -- but Dallas needed four plays to score.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher might have scored himself but raised an arm in
celebration at the 12 and was tackled from behind at the 4. Fisher
also had the fourth-quarter interception of Dreisbach.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was just 6-of-14 for 61 yards.
Several of the incompletions were miscommunications with his new
No. 1 target, Joey Galloway, although the speedster still had three
catches for 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's first-half stumbles were varied. Rookie receiver
Marvin Knight fumbled on the first drive and a holding penalty
stunted the second drive. The third ended when rookie Sebastian
Janikowski's 57-yard field goal attempt was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski followed with a 47-yarder to make it 10-3. The
Raiders were driving to tie it when Bobby Hoying, under pressure,
threw to an open spot that Fisher ended up filling.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying atoned for his mistake in the third quarter, running for
40 yards on one broken play then capping that drive with a 9-yard
touchdown run that put Oakland within 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-yard field goal that Janikowski cleared with ease made it
17-13, but Rian Lindell answered with a 19-yarder for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's first interception was beat for silliness in the third
quarter when Dallas' James McKnight turned a nice catch into a
54-yard gain -- then fumbled at the Oakland 6. Raiders safety
Brandon Jennings recovered at the 2, then fumbled at midfield.
Dallas' Troy Hambrick picked it up and ran 25 yards, then fell from
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped for nearly 10 minutes early in the first
quarter when Raiders receiver Terry Mickens injured his neck after
a catch. He was mobilized and taken to a hospital for observation,
although he was conscious and had feeling in his arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas lost receiver Raghib Ismail to a sprained thumb, fullback
Robert Thomas sprained a knee and rookie cornerback Mario Edwards
strained a hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' injury forced fellow rookie Kareem Larrimore to play
the entire game. Larrimore, a fourth-round draft pick, became a
starter this week when Kevin Smith left camp to contemplate
retiring. Second-round pick Dwayne Goodrich and second-year player
Duane Hawthorne missed the game with injuries.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Hall Overcomes Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Diabetes and a drug suspension couldn't keep
Gary Hall Jr. from making another trip to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant swimmer finished second to Neil Walker in the
100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic trials Sunday night,
earning a trip to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's father, a three-time Olympian, fired up the crowd at the
start of the evening by waving an American flag and chanting,
''USA! USA! USA!'' Hall, waiting under the stands at the Indiana
University Natatorium, smiled at the boisterous scene.
</P>
<P>
   Walker set a blistering pace over the first 50 meters, making
the turn more than a half-second under the world record. The
24-year-old from Austin, Texas, faded on the return lap but held on
to win in 48.71 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, closing fast, took second in 48.84 to claim the other
Olympic berth and a spot on the relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you race in an event like this, it always comes down
to a couple-hundredths of a second,'' he said. ''There's always a
possibility you might not make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Walker missed the Olympic team by one-hundredth of
a second in 1996. He's atoned for his disappointment at these
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really wasn't a negative experience now that I look back on
it,'' said Walker, who already earned a spot on the team by placing
second in the 100 backstroke. ''I turned it into positive
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 25, won silver in the 50 and 100 freestyle at the 1996
Atlanta Games, but his life has been troubled since then. He was
suspended for three months in 1998 after testing positive for
marijuana, then learned last year he has diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix resident didn't even earn a qualifying time for the
trials until a month ago and often has to give himself up to eight
insulin shots a day to cope with his disease. But he was clearly in
a fighting mood Sunday night, arriving on deck wearing a pair of
red, white and blue boxing trunks and throwing punches at the air
when his name was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to bring them out for a special occasion, and tonight
was the night,'' said Hall, who purchased the trunks at a charity
event involving Muhammad Ali. ''I really don't think I'm a showman.
I just like to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabir Muhammad missed out becoming the first black to make the
U.S. Olympic swim team. He finished last in the eight-man final,
but will get another chance in his best event, the 50 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   However, Anthony Ervin of Valencia, Calif., considers himself of
black heritage. Ervin, whose father is black and mother is white,
earned a spot on the 400 free relay after finishing fifth in the
100.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Salyards, 19, of Tempe, Ariz., upset Ed Moses in the 200
breaststroke, while Tom Wilkens of Palo Alto, Calif., provided one
of the night's highlights by finishing second to earn the other
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens was expected to make the team in the 400 individual
medley but faded to third behind Tom Dolan and Erik Vendt. In the
breaststroke, he came through in a thrilling race in which only
0.32 seconds separated the top four finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens pumped his fist when he saw his name under Salyards'
winning time of 2:13.21. The second-place finisher touched in
2:13.34, edging Brendan Hansen's 2:13.49.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a dream come true,'' Wilkens said. ''I don't think the
breaststroke is my best event.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses, who already earned a spot on the Olympic team by winning
the 100 breaststroke, was ahead of the world record halfway through
the race before slowing up. He touched fourth in 2:13.53 -- a
supposed sure bet who failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really disappointed,'' Moses said through a USA Swimming
spokeswoman. ''I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty Hyman of Phoenix won't have to compete in the shadow of
teammates Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson any longer. Hyman, edged
out for an Olympic spot in 1996, made a name for herself by holding
off hard-charging Kaitlin Sandeno to win the 200 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, 21, touched the wall in 2:09.27, while Sandeno took the
second Olympic spot in 2:09.54 -- no one else within two seconds.
Sandeno already had made the team in the 400 individual medley,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just started to hit me,'' Hyman said. ''There's so much
excitement, so much relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Torres are swimming in a league of their own among
the female sprinters. They set up another showdown in the 100
freestyle by breezing into Monday's final as top qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, went fastest in the morning preliminaries, while
Thompson came back to lead the evening semifinals in 54.41. Torres
was second in 54.92 -- the only other swimmer to eclipse the
55-second barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, edged by Thompson in a stirring 100 butterfly on
Thursday, has made a remarkable comeback after retiring for seven
years. But another 33-year-old former Olympian didn't fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Martino of Milledgeville, Ga., a six-time medalist, hoped
to make the freestyle relay team after having a baby three years
ago. But her comeback may have ended when she failed to qualify for
the 100 free final, finishing 11th out of 16 semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like an underdog. But I certainly thought I'd be on
that relay,'' said Martino, who hasn't decided whether to take one
last shot in the 50 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, who in 1996 became the first American woman to
win four gold medals in an Olympics, was fourth-fastest qualifier
at 55.37. The 27-year-old is coming back from two shoulder
surgeries in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   World record-holder Lenny Krayzelburg and 17-year-old Aaron
Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., breezed into Monday's final of the 200
backstroke. Kristy Kowal of Athens, Ga., bouncing back from the
disappointment of finishing third in the 100 breaststroke,
dominated the 200 breast semis. Wilkens came back in his second
event of the night, the 200 IM, to post the second-fastest time of
the semifinals. Dolan led in 2:01.76.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 4, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek hit
two-run singles in the third inning and the Boston Red Sox beat the
Texas Rangers 4-2 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler extended the major leagues' longest hitting streak
this season to 26 games with a sixth-inning single, but Texas had
just five hits. The Rangers have been held to seven hits or less in
four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Tomo Ohka (1-2) pitched 5 2-3 innings, his longest stint in 12
major league appearances the past two seasons for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe pitched the ninth for his 26th save in 31
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers couldn't overcome Boston's four-run burst off Kenny
Rogers (11-10).
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had struck out three of the four previous batters,
including Brian Daubach to start the third, before Boston loaded
the bases on an infield hit, a walk and a single.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett lined out before Garciaparra singled with two
strikes. Varitek's hit came after Troy O'Leary was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's third inning ended when shortstop Royce Clayton made a
diving stab of Bernard Gilkey's hard grounder up the middle and
used a backhand flip to second for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had the bases loaded in the sixth after Ohka gave up
consecutive two-out walks and was replaced by Rich Garces, who then
got Mike Lamb to foul out.
</P>
<P>
   Boston third baseman Ed Sprague ran down Lamb's popup, using a
full arm extension to make the grab before falling into the Red Sox
dugout and being caught by teammate Israel Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka, who allowed just five hits, struck out five and walked
four. Rogers, 2-5 in his last eight starts, left after eight
innings with five strikeouts and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got their two runs off Ohka after loading the bases
with no outs in the fourth. Kapler hit a sacrifice fly to center
and Ricky Ledee followed with an RBI single on a high bouncer over
second baseman Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rafael Palmeiro drew a walk in the fourth, his seventh base
on balls in the three-game series vs. Boston. ... In his 26-game
hitting streak, Kapler is hitting .371 (39-for-105) with six homers
and 21 RBIs. He finished 1-for-4. ... O'Leary went 0-for-3 and has
just three hits his last 26 at-bats. ... Garciaparra is 15-for-29
(.517) lifetime against Rogers after getting two hits.

Gore Would Seek Clinton's Counsel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- At the very moment he is trying to emerge from President
Clinton's shadow, Vice President Al Gore said today he would not hesitate to
seek Clinton's counsel if he succeeds him. ''Why would I rule that out?'' Gore
said in an interview with The Associated Press. The vice president, battling
Republican attempts to shackle him to Clinton's personal scandals, also said he
would serve his own term in the Oval Office ''according to the highest values.''
Gore spoke on the eve of Clinton's valedictory tomorrow night to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.

Koreas Reopen Border Liaisons
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea reopened border liaison
offices Monday, four years after they were closed because of political tensions.
Relations between the two Koreas have warmed significantly since their leaders
held a historic summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in June. In follow-up
talks by their deputies in Seoul two weeks ago, the Koreas agreed to reopen the
border liaison offices. The liaison offices first opened in 1992 to work as
government channels of dialogue. They closed four years later after a dispute
over a North Korean submarine that washed ashore in South Korea.

Clinton Talks About Peace Summit

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton said today that for Israelis and
Palestinians alike the inconclusive Camp David peace summit was like having a

politics aside during a speech to members of the American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee, a Jewish lobbying organization. The president is in Los Angeles for
the Democratic National Convention, where he's a featured speaker Monday night.
He said he understood why both sides left the most difficult issues for last in
their gradual pursuit of peace.

Ford: Tires Made During Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Many of the 6.5 million Firestone tires being
recalled were made during a strike at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant, Ford
Motor Co. said today. The tires are under investigation in hundreds of crashes
that caused at least 46 deaths. Ford conducted an analysis of its Firestone
tires and the complaints it had received to pin down where the tires were made.
The number of complaints was 10 times higher for the 15-inch ATX tires made in
Decatur than for the Wilderness tires, said Jason Vines, Ford's vice president
of communications. At the time, union workers at the plant were on strike, and
the plant was operating with replacement workers and managers.
Bridgestone/Firestone said the strike had nothing to do with the problems.

Colombia Army Frees 5 Held by Rebels
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA (AP) -- Soldiers rescued on Sunday a prominent journalist who had
spent 200 days in captivity, as well as German man and three other hostages
abducted by Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the army said. One guerrilla was
killed in the rescue operation, army Gen. Jorge Morga told reporters. Guillermo
Cortes, 73, host of a popular weekly television news program, owner of a Bogota
soccer team and part-owner of several news-oriented Colombian magazines, was
kidnapped from his home on the capital's wealthy northern outskirts on Jan. 22
by leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, guerrillas. The
rebels had demanded $1 million for his release.

Cloning Pioneers End Pig Research
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The creators of Dolly the Sheep are halting their research
into genetically modifying pigs for human organ transplants, one of the
scientists said today. The decision is motivated in part by fears that
transplanting animal organs into people could unleash deadly new viruses among
the human population. California-based Geron Bio-Med, which owns exclusive
rights to biotechnology developed by Edinburgh's Roslin Institute -- where Dolly
was created -- has decided to cut funding for the work, said Ian Wilmut, leader
of the team that created Dolly, the first clone made from an adult animal.

Calif., will swim on the 400-meter freestyle relay team at the Sydney Games
after finishing fifth in the 100 free. Most of the attention concerning the

<HEADLINE> Reds 3, Cubs 0  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sean Casey drove in one run with his bat and
another with his body, and Steve Parris got his first win since
July 8 as the Cincinnati Reds beat the listless Chicago Cubs 3-0
Sunday night for a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Casey homered and went 3-for-3. Pokey Reese drove in the other
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have now won four in a row and nine of their last 12 on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Cubs had been swept since Florida did
it June 23-25. It also was their first three-game losing streak
since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Parris (6-14), who had lost his last three decisions, pitched 7
2-3 scoreless innings, but the Cubs didn't give him much of a
challenge. After Sammy Sosa's three-run homer in the fifth inning
Friday, the Cubs went 22 innings without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   They loaded the bases in the eighth after Parris gave up a
single to Eric Young and walks to Sosa and Ricky Gutierrez, but
reliever Scott Sullivan struck out Rondell White swinging to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sosa's homer, the Cubs are 0-for-20 with runners in
scoring position and 2-for-34 with runners on base. They stranded
nine Sunday, adding to the 13 they left on base Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Parris scattered six hits, struck out three and walked four.
Sullivan got four outs for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Quevedo (1-4) gave up three runs and five hits in seven
innings. He also hit two batters -- forcing in a run when he plunked
Casey -- walked three and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs struggling at the plate, the Reds needed only a
couple of runs and they got them early. Reese hit an RBI double in
the second inning, scoring Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   Casey made it 2-0 with a solo homer in the fourth, his first
since July 25.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Quevedo loaded the bases when he gave up a double
to Barry Larkin, hit Ken Griffey Jr. and walked Bichette. He then
hit Casey to force in a run, giving the Reds a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before the game, Parris ran out to center field, touched
the 400-foot sign and waved to fans. Parris grew up in nearby
Joliet, Ill. ... Former Cub Ryne Sandberg sang ''Take Me Out to the
Ball Game'' in the seventh-inning stretch. ... The Reds' sweep was
their first at Wrigley Field since September 1998. ... The 22
scoreless innings by Reds pitchers marks their longest string of
the season.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Storm Causes Flash Floods  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) -- Residents of two northern New Jersey towns
were evacuated Sunday and others were put on alert in the wake of
torrential downpours that washed out bridges and roads, broke
through a dam and prompted fears of mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated that Saturday's downpour, which dumped more
than 14 inches of rain on the area around Sparta, caused hundreds
of million of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just water and trees and boulders coming everywhere,''
said Sparta resident Terry Preskar Earl.
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused about $166 million in damage in Sussex County
alone, the area hit hardest by the storm, said Phil Morlock, the
county's health and public safety administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman flew over the soaked counties Sunday
morning to view the destruction. Her spokesman said officials would
have a preliminary damage estimate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, officials evacuated some Main Street homes on Sunday
because they feared mudslides. Several Sparta homes were already
blocked on one side by a mudslide and on the other by a road that
had become a brown river. Firefighters used ladders and ropes to
ferry residents across the fast-moving current.
</P>
<P>
   Homes in Hackettstown also were being evacuated and other area
residents were put on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's got what we call a 'heads up,''' said Patrick
Rivoli, director of the Warren County Office of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   In Stanhope, a small dam holding back a pond washed away. Police
Chief Douglas Waldron said crews were collecting barrels from a
flooded factory that manufactured paper with adhesive backing and
were trying to ensure nothing hazardous got into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Three roads and three bridges were destroyed by rushing water in
Sparta, a town of about 20,000, said Police Sgt. Russell Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the water also broke through a dam holding back a
small, private lake surrounded by homes in Sussex County. The lake
emptied in about one hour Saturday evening and smelled of dead fish
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing water in Newton took out the town's two water mains,
said Town Manager Camille Furgiulele.
</P>
<P>
   A well was put into service to help make up for the loss of the
water mains, but it could only yield about 20 percent of the town's
usual demand of 1 million gallons a day, Furgiulele said.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Franklin, water was still up to the front porches of
houses Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing people row boats to their houses, that was pretty
crazy,'' said Newton resident Josh Osowski, who was passing through
Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 customers of GPU Energy were without power Sunday in
Newton, Sparta and Flemington, said company spokesman Ron Morano.
Power had been restored to most of the 10,000 customers who were
blacked out Saturday, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Says He's Done With Football  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders is finished playing
football and is enjoying life as a former running back for the
Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I wanted to play football again, all I'd have to do is just
show up (at training camp) in Saginaw or at the Silverdome, Sanders
told the Detroit Free Press on Saturday at the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders retired in July 1999, two days before the start of the
Lions' training camp. He played 10 seasons with the Lions and
gained 15,269 rushing yards, second in NFL history to the late
Walter Payton's 16,726.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said breaking rushing records or finishing with the most
touchdowns wasn't important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if that's never been important to me, then why would that
be a motivation to keep playing?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders denied his father's comments that he decided to retire
out of dislike for coach Bobby Ross and a poor opinion of the
Lions' front-office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would anyone automatically assume that other people were
speaking for me?'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My decision has nothing to do with the Lions,'' he said in a
report published on the Free Press' Web site and in its Monday
editions. ''I know that you probably don't believe me, but it has
nothing to do with the Lions. I played 10 years. And that was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross told the newspaper on Sunday that Sanders' comments only
confirmed his belief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have honestly felt that way all along,'' Ross said. ''that
was from my own gut feeling, No. 1, and secondly, he had talked to
other people in this organization and had conveyed that very same
point a number of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he was disturbed by the public reaction over his
decision to retire. He was booed when introduced at a fight at Joe
Louis Arena last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can't a man just leave his job when he's tired?'' Sanders
said. ''It doesn't have to mean anything more than just a person
who believes that his career is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sanders sent the Lions a check for $1.833 million, a
payment he was obligated to make if he doesn't play this season.
The money represents part of a signing bonus Sanders received in
1997, when he signed a six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a February decision, arbitrator Sam Kagel said Sanders owes
the Lions $1.833 million of unearned signing bonus for each year he
doesn't play during the remaining three years of his contract.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Al Gore accepts his party's presidential
nomination, the script for the night will read like an old episode
of ''This Is Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   A college roommate. An Army buddy. The mountain climber who
guided his ascent of Mount Rainier. They'll all be on hand Thursday
to tell America about their friend, the would-be president.
</P>
<P>
   A ''conversation'' about Gore is how his campaign characterizes
the night.
</P>
<P>
   An Episcopal bishop and longtime family friend, the Rt. Rev.
Jane Holmes Dixon of Washington, D.C., will run the show,
introducing each speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon has known Gore since he was a boy. Dixon introduced Gore's
sister, Nancy, to the man she would marry, Frank Hunger. Nancy Gore
died in 1984 of lung cancer, but Hunger has remained one of Gore's
closest friends, and will talk about Gore's family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among various politicos on the speaker's list will be:
</P>
<P>
   --John Tyson, Gore's roommate at Harvard University. He now works
for a Washington lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   --An Army buddy from the Vietnam War, Robert E. Delabar of
Seattle, who met Gore when both were stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   --Jim Frush, a mountain climber who guided Gore's ascent of Mount
Rainier.

   LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- A Louisiana man who lived in three
centuries and was among the oldest people in the world died at the
age of 111.
</P>
<P>
   Edward ''Pops'' Bernard was listed in the Guiness Book of World

2-3 innings Sunday night, winning his sixth straight decision as
the New York Yankees beat the Anaheim Angels 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees managed two runs off rookie right-hander Ramon Ortiz

He had no-decisions his previous three starts -- each of them
Yankees wins -- and has not lost since June 9 to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera got the last five outs for his 26th save in 30

<P>
   Ortiz (4-3), who outpitched Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martinez
with a complete-game two-hitter in his previous start, virtually
matched Clemens, winner of the 1997-98 AL Cy Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But control lapses led to both New York runs off Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took a 1-0 lead without a hit in the second, when
they loaded the bases on walks to Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada
sandwiched around Dave Justice getting hit by a pitch. Ortiz then
walked Scott Brosius on a full-count pitch to force in Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz struck out the side in the fourth, but in-between again
helped the Yankees load the bases on Justice's single and walks to
Tino Martinez and Posada. With a full count on Jose Vizcaino, Ortiz
interrupted his windup for a balk that scored Justice for a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels cut it to 2-1 on Darin Erstad's two-out RBI single in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the seventh, pinch-hitter Tim Salmon lined a
drive up the right-center field alley. But Salmon, who did not
start due to a strained groin muscle, only made it to first.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Stanton relieved and picked off Benji Gil --
running for Salmon -- without making a pitch, to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   New York then went to work on Anaheim's bullpen, with Martinez's
run-scoring single off Mike Holtz in the eighth making it 3-1. Mark
Petkovsek issued a bases-loaded walk later in the inning to Posada,
scoring pinch-runner Clay Bellinger.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz pitched three-hit ball for seven innings, but walked six.
He allowed two runs and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Salmon is listed as day-to-day. ... Erstad became only the
second leadoff batter in 27 years to reach 80 RBIs; Boston's Nomar
Garciaparra had 98 RBIs from the leadoff spot in 1997. ... Vizcaino
went 0-for-4 and has just five hits in 42 at-bats. ... Sunday
night's sellout crowd of 43,411 boosted attendance for the series
to an Edison Field-record 129,974. ... Against Ortiz's sinking
fastball, the Yankees hit only two fly balls to the outfield.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Said Ready To Open U.S. Ties  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The leader of long-reclusive North
Korea said he would open ties with the United States right away if
it removes his country from a list of terrorism-sponsoring nations,
South Korea's state media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is putting a cap of a terrorist nation on us,'' the
Yonhap news agency quoted Kim Jong Il as saying. ''As soon as they
remove it, we would open ties with the U.S. -- even tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries branded by the U.S. State
Department as a sponsor of terrorism. Under U.S. law, that bars all
but humanitarian aid to the North's government and rules out bank
loans from international financial organizations, which are heavily
influenced by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations recently held talks in Pyongyang, the North's
capital, on possibly removing the communist country from the list.
The U.S. State Department called the meeting ''productive'' but did
not disclose details.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the list because of its alleged involvement
in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in the skies near
Myanmar, also known as Burma, in 1987. All 115 people aboard the
Korean Air plane died.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's comments on ties with the United States came last week
during a meeting with executives of 46 South Korean media
organizations who visited the Stalinist North, Yonhap reported. Kim
invited the executives after he met with South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung in Pyongyang in June -- the first-ever summit between
leaders of the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The North's leader told the executives he wants to visit South
Korea ''at an appropriate time, but as soon as possible,'' Yonhap
said. He had promised a visit during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying that North Korea will
continue to develop what it calls scientific satellites for
peaceful purposes. ''The U.S. would not want to give us money, but
they want to stop our research,'' Kim was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea shocked the region by firing a rocket over Japan and
into the Pacific in 1998. It said it launched a satellite, but U.S.
officials called it a test-firing of a long-range ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with Kim Jong Il in
July, told President Clinton at a summit of industrialized nations
last month that North Korea was willing to abandon its missile
program if other countries helped it launch space satellites. U.S.
officials have expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting with executives, Kim admitted that North
Korea has been selling missiles to Iran and Syria, and that he was
not serious when he told Putin that a deal was possible to stop his
country's missile development, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had previously said it sold missiles abroad, but did
not identify customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Developing a rocket generates hundreds of millions of dollars.
How can you stop it?'' the newspaper reported him saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also appeared bemused by U.S. concerns about his country's
missile development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's assume we develop the rockets, produce inter-continental
ballistic missiles and fire two or three at the United States.
Would we be able to win? And yet, the United States makes issue
with this,'' Kim told the South Korean media executives.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate topic, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying the two Koreas
will allow more reunions between families from each side in
September and October. A first round of reunions between relatives
who have not seen for a half-century begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of South Koreans are believed to have gone to the
North voluntarily or after being drafted into the North's army
during the 1950-53 Korean War. An estimated 1.2 million North
Koreans fled to South Korea before or during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war, the two Koreas have been separated by a highly
militarized border. There is no mail, telephone or other direct
means of communication between private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first round of reunions Tuesday, South and North
Korea agreed to exchange 100 people each. It was one of a wave of
goodwill gestures set in motion by the summit between the
neighbors, and a major step toward reconciliation for a peninsula
divided into the communist North and the pro-Western South since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   The first reunions will let the 100 people from each side visit
Seoul and Pyongyang, respectively. But by next year, separated
families from South Korea will be allowed to visit their hometowns
in the North, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall relations between the North and the South have
developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and
reunification,'' Kim Jong Il was quoted as saying in a report
Sunday by the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA.

<HEADLINE> 49ers 33, Chiefs 10  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Garcia broke his San Francisco
scoring drought quickly and emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young's heir apparent, who had not been involved in a
single scoring drive in two exhibition losses, threw for one
touchdown and ran for another Sunday night as the 49ers scored on
their first five possessions en route to a 33-10 victory over the
Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia rushed twice for 12 yards, including a 2-yard TD, and was
7-of-8 for 82 yards and another 2-yard scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something the whole offensive unit wanted to try to work
through and get over that hump,'' said Garcia, a second-year pro.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys really wanted to come out fighting from the get-go
and were able to put points on the board. It's a nice feeling to be
able to go through the first quarter like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mirer replaced Garcia on San Francisco's third possession
and teamed up with Jerry Rice on a 75-yard touchdown play as the
49ers got their first win in three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   The first team defense of the Chiefs (0-2) looked terrible in
the first quarter against Garcia and the rest of San Francisco's
No. 1 offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs trailed 30-0 at halftime and did not score until
Warren Moon -- battling Todd Collins to be Elvis Grbac's backup --
found a wide open Larry Parker on a 25-yard scoring pass with 7:32
left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer also had a good night, going 5-of-6 for 114 yards,
including the big scoring play when Rice got behind rookie safety
Greg Wesley, caught the ball at midfield and sailed untouched into
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't play on any phase of the game and we've just done a
lousy job,'' Chiefs head coach Gunther Cunningham said. ''I don't
know if we're tired, we walked back in the heat or whatever we're
doing but we're making mental errors and we're getting penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed in every phase of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia teamed with Fred Beasley on a 29-yard gain on a screen
pass and gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead with a 2-yard run that capped a
7-play, 54-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   On their second possession, Garcia hit Terrell Owens for 22
yards and ran 10 yards on third-and-9 before capping the 80-yard
march with a 2-yard scoring pass to Owens.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, John Milem recovered Donnell Bennett's
unforced fumble and set up the 49ers on the Kansas City 35, leading
to Wade Richey's 40-yard field goal and a 23-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession for Kansas City, Moon's pass bounced off
tight end Troy Drayton and into the arms of Winfred Tubbs, who
returned it a yard to the 15. Mirer hit tight end Justin Swift for
14 yards, then Terry Jackson bulled his way across and put the
49ers up 30-0.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging note for the Chiefs was the debut of rookie
Sylvester Morris. The first-round draft pick, who missed almost
three weeks of training camp as a holdout, caught two passes from
Moon for 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Stoyanovich hit a 25-yard field goal for Kansas City in the
fourth and Richey had a 29-yarder with 2:25 to go..
</P>
<P>
   The teams will meet in the regular season on Nov. 12 in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We executed better in this game,'' San Francisco coach Steve
Mariucci said. ''We converted some third downs and hit a big screen
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Garcia appeared to be more confident than he had
been earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good couple of drives for him. It was nice to see --
one touchdown run and one touchdown throw,'' Mariucci said. ''He
did some good things out of the shotgun. He executed like we've
seen him execute before.''

<HEADLINE> Ervin Swims Into US Olympic History  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Anthony Ervin is poised to make history as
the first swimmer of black heritage to earn a spot on the U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, of Valencia, Calif., will likely swim on the 400-meter
freestyle relay team at the Sydney Games after finishing fifth in
the 100 free Sunday night. The top four automatically make the
Olympic squad, and there's usually room for the next two as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been proud of my heritage,'' he said. ''I don't
think of my swimming in terms of race. I've always considered
myself color blind, so I don't even notice it that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin's father, Jack, is 75 percent black and 25 percent
American Indian. His mother, Sherry, is white. The light-skinned
Ervin said in describing himself, ''I don't look black.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention concerning the first black to make the
team has focused on Sabir Muhammad of Atlanta. He was also in the
100 free final but finished last in the eight-man field.
</P>
<P>
   Both men plan to swim the 50 free preliminaries Monday. That's
Muhammad best event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a disappointing race,'' said Muhammad, who finished
more than two seconds behind winner Neil Walker. ''But all my
marbles weren't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, 19, won the 50 free for California at this year's NCAA
meet with a short-course world record of 21.21 seconds. He also won
the 100 free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty new to the national scene,'' he said. ''I wasn't a
contender until this year.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cal, Ervin said he ''checks off a bunch'' of boxes on forms
asking for his racial background.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad owns the American short-course record in the 50
butterfly. His international experience includes the 1995 Pan
Pacific championships and the 1999 Pan American Games. He didn't
medal in either meet.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad swam at Stanford, where Tiger Woods advised him on
handling the media and attention surrounding his swimming. His
father, Sabir Muhammad Sr., is a reporter covering the trials for
the Muslim Journal.

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Leader Said To Skip Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has
declined an invitation by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch to
attend the Sydney Olympics, South Korean reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In letters sent last week, Samaranch invited the North Korean
leader and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to attend either the
opening or closing ceremony of the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president has yet to respond to Samaranch's
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Kim Jong Il told a group of 46 South Korean media
executives who were visiting his communist country that he did not
want to go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than becoming an actor at the Sydney Olympics, I'd
rather go to Seoul first,'' South Korean media quoted Kim as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's remarks were made public after the South Koreans returned
home from their eight-day visit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached during a historic summit with his
South Korean counterpart in June, Kim Jong Il promised to visit
Seoul, the South Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il told the South Koreans that he will send one of his
close confidants -- Kim Yong Sun -- to Seoul in September to fix the
date of his Seoul visit. The confidant heads the Asia-Pacific Peace
Committee, a powerful semiofficial organization handling economic
and other exchanges with South Korea and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the IOC accepted a proposal by the North Koreans to
drop the two national flags from the opening ceremony and allow the
athletes from both countries to march together under the Olympic
flag.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay VP Vote Too Close To Call  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's vote for a successor to its
slain vice president appeared extremely close Sunday, with early
returns giving the opposition candidate a slim lead over the late
politician's son.
</P>
<P>
   The special, one-office election is seen by the opposition as a
chance to diminish the power of the Colorado Party, which has ruled
this South American country for 53 years. The post of vice
president has been empty since Luis Argana was gunned down in the
street in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will enter a unique and possibly unstable governing
situation: an elected vice president alongside a beleaguered
President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, whose popularity has plummeted
since he was thrust into his post -- without benefit of elections --
amid the chaos following Argana's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   With ballots counted from around 90 percent of the polling
stations, the Paraguayan electoral board Sunday evening said
opposition candidate Julio Cesar Franco had 47.77 percent of the
vote. The ruling party's candidate Felix Argana, the son of the
slain vice president, had 46.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials reported no incidents of violence during the
voting on a chilly and cloudy winter day. Some 2 million
Paraguayans were eligible to vote. The electoral board said final
results are to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a balcony at Liberal Party headquarters, the
48-year-old Franco told some 5,000 supporters they were on the
verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people have spoken in free, democratic, and transparent
elections,'' he bellowed into a microphone, his neck wrapped in the
party's royal blue flag. ''I want to ask you all to vigilant as
they count the final votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a doctor, has suggested that if elected he would work to
have Macchi removed from office. A faction of the Colorado Party
has been strongly critical of Macchi, and Franco could look for
their support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Faces were long at Colorado party headquarters. Argana, 43, had
earlier declared victory, citing his own party's exit polls. But in
the evening, he offered no comment. The Colorado party has ruled
Paraguay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in Paraguay's history that a vice president
is chosen outside of a presidential election. Macchi has refused to
hold an election to validate his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi, the former Senate president, took office after Raul
Cubas resigned as president in the wake of Argana's death. Cubas
was suspected of being involved in Argana's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi's popularity has dipped to less than 20 percent as
Paraguay struggles through a grinding recession.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls predicted a tight race between Franco, of the
opposition Liberal party, and Argana. The third candidate, Ricardo
Buman of the Humanist Party, was considered a long shot. No run-off
is required if the winner falls short of a 50-percent victory.
</P>
<P>
   Argana, an architect and Asuncion city councilman, voted Sunday
morning after visiting his father's tomb. He has said he does not
intend to overshadow Macchi but to be a stabilizing force in his
troubled administration.
</P>
<P>
   Argana supporters have suggested his election to office would be
a first step toward justice for his father's death. Argana's murder
remains unsolved, although a Paraguayan judge has accused Lino
Oviedo, an army chief and former political ally of Cubas, of
masterminding the killing.
</P>
<P>
   After casting his vote in downtown Asuncion, Franco
enthusiastically flashed his ink-stained forefinger to supporters.
Voters are required to dip their fingers in ink after voting in
order to prevent fraud.
