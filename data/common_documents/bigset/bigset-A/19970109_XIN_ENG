<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Admits Mishandling Civil Service Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
admitted it mishandled the country's biggest nationwide strike by
civil servants last August which cost the country over 100
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro, who for some time was principal government negotiator,
said apparent lack of negotiating skills had been observed on the
part of the government.
</P>
<P>
''During the strike, it was also observed that the lack of
skills was also with the employer. Everybody needs to be trained
on how to handle and appreciate labor relations,'' Chitauro said
when opening a three-day workshop on collective bargaining in the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
A two-week work stoppage by government workers paralyzed
delivery of essential services and the government responded to
the industrial action by dismissing the bulk of the over 162,000
employees, refusing to enter into any dialogue with them until
they resumed work.
</P>
<P>
Hardline stances adopted by both the government and the
workers resulted in a lot of suffering for the public and have
been widely criticized.
</P>
<P>
The strike had brought to the fore the absence of laid down
procedures, poor communication, poor organization and poor
representative structure on the part of associations, the
minister said.

WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Newt Gingrich narrowly won re-election as Speaker of the
House Tuesday despite defections by nine Republicans troubled by
his admission of ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
-- A special White House panel concluded Tuesday that it
could find no evidence that exposure to chemical weapons had
hurt the health of Persian Gulf war veterans, but it sharply
criticized the Pentagon's investigation of the issue and said
further study was needed.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- South Korean President Kim Young Sam said Tuesday that a
"big misunderstanding" by workers about controversial new labor
laws was to blame for strikes that have hobbled the nation for
nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
-- An apologetic Newt Gingrich was reelected House speaker
Tuesday after a frantic lobbying campaign that convinced all but
nine House Republicans that his ethical violations should not
deprive him of another term.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Peru's president Fujimori said he will not give in to
"blackmail" by prominent Amaru guerrillas holding 74 prominent

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Foreign Minister Visits Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz arrived here today to coordinate stances with Syria
on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the Syrian-Lebanese border point by his
Syrian counterpart Farouq Al-Shara and other senior officials of
the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival on his official visit, Boueiz said in a statement
that he will consult with the Syrian foreign minister about the
current regional developments, Israel's practices after having
long delayed the Middle East peace process and the future
prospects of the peace march as well.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed Syrian sources, the Lebanese-Syrian
talks will cover the latest developments in the Middle East in
general.
</P>
<P>
The passenger bus explosion in the Syrian capital of Damascus
on December 31 will be also be dealt with in particular, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Syria claims that the Damascus terrorist act was perpetrated
by Israeli intelligence agents with the object of separating the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks and undermining the peace
process. However, Israel has denied any involvement in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the Syrian and Lebanese foreign ministers
will seek to unify their views, and coordinate their stances in
facing the challenges posed by Israeli extremist and intransigent
policies, the same sources added.
</P>
<P>
Farez Boueiz' trip is the first one by a senior Lebanese
official to Syria since the Damascus bombing, which killed nine
people and wounded some 40 others.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) and
the World Bank are to hold a conference in Brussels on January 9
and 10 in preparation for a meeting, set for early March, of
donors providing aid for reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission, the emergency projects begun in
1996 must be pursued, while developing longer-term objectives for
the country's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
After promising 1.2 billion US dollars at the 1996 donors
conference, of which 720 million US dollars has actually been paid,
donors are expected to commit to 1.4 billion US dollars for 1997,
according to Commission sources.
</P>
<P>
Initial funding was used to renovate several rail lines and to
re-open Sarajevo's commercial airport. Some 15,000 housing units
are under construction and basic services such as electricity and
running water have been re-established.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commission said, with a significant amount of this
last year's pledges already spent or earmarked for specific
projects, fresh money would be needed in time to prevent delays in
Bosnia's reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production in Bosnia reportedly doubled over the
past year, but is still 10 to 15 percent below pre-war levels.
Unemployment, which stood at 90 percent in December 1995, has
fallen significantly, but half of the working population is still
without a job.

<HEADLINE> China Dominates World Cup Short-Course Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hosts China took the limelight
by capturing a total of seven golds out of the 17 on offer here
Wednesday at the World Cup Short-Course Swimming tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing leg was the second of the eight-stop World Cup
series this year, with two in Asia -- Hong Kong and Beijing -- and
six in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese female swimmers made a more brilliant performance
than their male counterparts as they clinched six out of eight
titles in the women's competitions.
</P>
<P>
The two lady's crowns slipped from the hosts hands went to
Olympic Champion Claudia Poll of Costa Rica in the 200-meter
freestyle and Lin Chi-chan of Chinese Taipei in the 800-meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Poll, 24, Olympic gold-medalist in the women's 200-meter
freestyle, again proved the superiority in her speciality. She
clocked 1:57.02 in the 200m freestyle, 1.60 seconds short of her
own world record of 1:55.42 set at the World Cup Short-Course
Championships in Rio De Janeiro in December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the results," Poll said, "I haven't
participated in the international competition for more than five
months." the 1.91-meter-tall slim girl from the tiny South
American country said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong competitions was her first major international
appearance since the Atlanta Olympic Games." said Francisco Ricos,
who have coached the Costa Rican swimmer for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Lin came out just a "underdog", but she surprisingly dashed the
Poll's dream of winning the second gold of the night by taking
away the title of 800m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
She touched the pad in 8:30.35, just 0.63 seconds ahead of more
fancied rival Poll at 8:30.98.
</P>
<P>
Butterfly specialist Liu Limin of China grabbed the 100m gold
in her strong event. The world record-holder finished the distance
at 59.07, 0.39 shy of her own best time.
</P>
<P>
"She had a two-month layoff after the Olympic Games," said
Liu's coach Zhao Ge, "She is now back on her normal form."
</P>
<P>
Liu bagged two silvers for China in Atlanta, in the 100m
butterfly and 4X100m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Another 17 golds will offer on Thursday. The next leg
competitions will be held in Espoo, Finland through January 22 to
23.

<HEADLINE> France Remembers Mitterrand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The French people today
commemorated the first anniversary of the death of President
Francois Mitterrand, who ruled France for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac asked his chief of staff, Admiral
Jean-Luc Delaunay, to place a wreath on the tomb of the late
president, in Jarnac in the central department of Charente.
</P>
<P>
People early this morning began placing roses -- the flower for
commemorating the dead in France -- at 9 Avenue Frederic le Play,
in Paris, where Mitterrand died a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party's first secretary, Lionel Jospin, said that
although the assessment by socialists of their former leader was
varied, they had a "common will to pay homage to Francois
Mitterrand, to prolong and relaunch the socialist force."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily,l'Humanite, said in its editorial
that the anniversary marked the beginning of a debate over the
future of the leftist forces in France.
</P>
<P>
The daily, Liberation, said that one year after he died,
Mitterrand seemed to have only a "remote relationship with the
politics and socialism" of France. He was more talked about by
"the big circulation press than in the socialist conclaves."
</P>
<P>
Other newspapers discussed stories about his cancer, and
revelations in books about his last days of presidency.
</P>
<P>
As for descriptions of Mitterrand, they range from
machiavellian to the psychological portrait in the books of
Francois Mauriac.

<HEADLINE> Inflations Rate Down in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflations rate at the
end of 1996 was running at 7.5 percent against 8.1 percent at the
end of 1995, the National Statistics Service (ESYE) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation broke the 8 percent barrier in November for the first
time in 25 years, falling to an annual 7.7 percent against 8.3
percent in the preceding month of October.
</P>
<P>
ESYE attributed the decline in inflation to a 0.9 percent
increase in the cost-of-living index in December against a 1.0
percent rise in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, price increases were recorded in December in
fish, vegetables and "served food", beverages, coffee, barbershops
and beauty parlors, "served drinks" and taxi fares due to the
Christmas bonus. Long-distance bus fares also rose. Decreases in
the prices of fruit and petrol counterbalanced the increases to a
degree.

JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa today celebrated its 85th
anniversary at its headquarters here, calling on all its members to
consolidate the national democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In a summary of the January 8 statement entitled "1997 -- A
Year for Reaffirming the ANC cadre", ANC's Deputy
Secretary-General Cheryl Carolus said that the party will
collectively rededicate itself to building an ANC cadreship to
carry forward the vasting transformation process starting after
the 1994 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The summary focused on calls to various sectors within the ANC
and the nation to dedicate themselves to rebuilding the economy,
deepening productivity, and enhancing their own skills.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela, as usual, will deliver the full
anniversary speech at a national rally in Free State Province on
January 12, said Carolus.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, established in 1912 and banned most of the time

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
started an Asia tour to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier
today in an effort to promote trade cooperation with these
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long trip, Major is scheduled to hold separate
talks with Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda, Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina and Pakistan's caretaker Prime Minister
Meraj Khalid to exchange views of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Major is taking one of the largest delegation of British
business and industry leaders, highlighting the commercial
significance of his last foreign trip before the general election.
</P>
<P>
One government source said that the growing importance of India
as Britain's major trading partner means the visit makes good
commercial sense.
</P>
<P>
"This is about cementing relationships and opening doors for
the future," he said, adding British trade with India has almost
doubled over the past four years to around 3.5 billion pounds
(5.95 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
British Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang, who is
traveling with Major, said earlier that "India and Pakistan
represent two of our key markets" in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arms Exports Rise in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's arms exports rose by
65 percent in the first nine months of 1996 over the same
period of the previous year, local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The total value of exports of arms and ammunition during the
period amounted to 1096 million Swedish kronors (about 170 million
U.S.dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> New York City Trial Judges to Undergo Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Under a new system which will
be introduced for the first time in New York City courts, many
trial judges will now undergo annual evaluations and could face
demotion.
</P>
<P>
The review system covers only the so-called acting justices,
who are drawn primarily from the criminal and civil courts for
newable one-year appointments to the State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The annual evaluation will be carried out by senior judges.
Those judges who handle too few cases, make too many mistakes or
generate too many complaints could face demotion.
</P>
<P>
The plan comes after a year in which a number of judges through
the New York State came under withering attacks for wrongheaded
rulings and lenient treatment of defendants.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, a panel of senior administrative judges
from the State office of Court Administration will review the
performance of acting justices with the administrative judges in
each county. The justices' workload, courtroom behavior and legal
reasoning will all be part of the evaluation. The panel will make
a recommendation to the chief administrative judge of the New York
State court system, who will make the final decision on whether
the acting justice should be appointed for another year.
</P>
<P>
In the past, judges were reviewed informally, and the standards
of evaluation were usually unknown.
</P>
<P>
"This is a merit-based system, and it looks at performance,"
Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the New York State court system
was quoted today by the New York Times as saying.

<HEADLINE> Philips to Become Passive Minority Shareholder in Grundig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch electronic concern
Philips announced today it had decided to further disconnect
itself from Grundig to become a passive minority shareholder in
the German company.
</P>
<P>
It said that the background to this decision was twofold: the
single brand policy that Philips is moving towards, particularly
in the markets for sound and vision, and the negative returns on
its investment in Grundig AG.
</P>
<P>
Philips has already announced the implementation of the single
brand policy in the United States by the Philips-Magnavox dual
branding.
</P>
<P>
The next step, the company said, was to implement this policy
in Europe. "As a consequence, the Grundig brand name was no longer
vital for Philips," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philips started negotiations with the Max Grundig
Foundation to unwind the contractual relationship between Philips
and the Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Philips said that the company, no longer being in control,
would deconsolidate Grundig AG December 31, 1996.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Worries About Children at Risk in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan children in eastern Zaire
are starving because of the lack of food, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, UNICEF expressed deep concern at the
deteriorating condition of the Rwandan refugees and internally
displaced people in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) as saying that some 120,000 refugees and displaced people
have settled in Tingi-Tingi, seven kilometers southeast of Lubutu,
and a further 60,000 people are sheltering in Amisi, 70 kilometers
southeast of Lubutu. Most of them are women and children. The
mortality rate in the area has increased dramatically in the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, 23 deaths were reported, 12 of whom were children
under five, according to UNICEF. On average, in the preceding
days, three children died every day. Reports from Amisi suggest
that the condition of the people there could be even worse, UNICEF
said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF noted that the lack of food and the outbreak of
disceases like diarrhea and malaria are major causes of the rising
death rate. It said, "Refugees are weak and vulnerable to disease
after a long journey with little sustenance. Mothers are often too
poorly-nourished to breastfeed their babies or to give adequate
care to their children."
</P>
<P>
Besides refugees, local communities are also affected by the
present lack of food, said UNICEF, adding that the problem is
going worse because of difficulties in delivering food to the
area, where there is only a small airstrip and where roads are
often inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF-chartered plane is shuttling three times a day between
Kisangani and Lubutu, carrying urgently needed supplies of high
protein food for malnourished children and therapeutic milk to
supplement existing stocks at Lubutu, UNICEF said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Is Confident of Winning Election, Says Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tony Blair, British Opposition
leader, said today that Labor is confident of winning the general
election due by May 22.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference similar to a presidential-style one
by Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday that Labor's confidence
"is born of our unity and our strength of purpose".
</P>
<P>
It is also born of "the incompetence of the opposition and its
weak leadership, the people coming to us from all walks of life
and above all an agreed set of policies that meet the needs of the
people...", Blair added.
</P>
<P>
While launching the election campaign, Blair spared no efforts
to condemn  Major as "an uncertain prime minister" who could not
hold his party together.
</P>
<P>
"In uncertain times Britain can not afford an uncertain Prime
Minister. And Britain cannot afford as its Government a party
incapable of being led," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his own party, Blair said, Labor is now "a party
in the center ground of British politics, that will govern in the
center ground too".
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in a generation, Labor goes into a general
election with real confidence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair reiterated that education, designed to give Britain the
skilled workforce needed for the 21st century, would be the key
concern of his government.
</P>
<P>
On the question of personal taxation, which the most British
people are concerned for, Blair did not imply whether he would
increase or not, if he comes to power.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to rule out the possibility that taxes might
rise.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Reach 7-Year High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain jumped
through two million last year to their highest level for seven
years and was 4.12 percent ahead of the 1995 total, according to
figures released Tuesday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Total sales for the year were 2.03 million, the third highest
level on record and not far below the 1989 peak of 2.3 million
units.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that the market was helped by a buoyant December
in which new car sales rose 9.23 percent compared with the same
month in 1995, to more than 78,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the society described the number of private sales as
disappointing and said the sales recovery was still patchy.
</P>
<P>
Sales to private buyers rose only 2.3 percent in 1996 and as a
percentage fell from 47 percent in 1995 to 46 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers of private buyers were 14 percent higher
last month than the same month in 1995, this year could prove
tricky as uncertainty was triggered by the general election.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT predicted that demand this year may grow by only
between one and two percent, to a maximum 2.07 million units.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bombardier Wins Record Sale Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian plane maker Bombardier
Inc. has won the largest single aircraft sale to build 30 Canadair
regional jets for the U.S. based Atlantic Southeast Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Southeast has placed firm orders for the jets and has
options on 60 more, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"It's a major, major order," said Bombardier spokesman Colin
Fisher, adding that the deal should be concluded within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Delivery of the 50-seat regional jet will start in August and
continue at a rate of one a month.
</P>
<P>
The 30 firm orders and spare parts for the aircraft are worth
600 million U.S. dollars to Bombardier. If all options are
exercised, the value of the contract could rise to 1.8 billion
dollars, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The sale would tighten Bomdardier's grip on the growing
regional aircraft market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The company's share of that worldwide market rose to 45 percent
last year from 27 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Urge Implementing Signed Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and Jordanian heads of
state today stressed that just and comprehensive peace in the
Mideast should be achieved by implementing all the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan who
arrived in the southern city of Aswan earlier today for a
lightning visit, were speaking at a press conference at the end of
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary that just peace be attained so that stability
would prevail in the region and cooperation can be established in
the different domains," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt and Jordan, basic partners in the peace
process, are awaiting what would come out of the ongoing
negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Egyptian president has warned that Israel's
insistence on a hardline policy would mean cutting relations with
all Arab countries and bring the peace process to zero point.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed hope that Palestinians and Israelis could
reach an agreement that "would satisfy both peoples" and attain a
lasting solution that is based on sound foundations.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron itself
have already been concluded, but the last obstacle blocking the
signing of the deal centered on the timetable for further Israeli
troop pullbacks from the rural areas of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders preceded their meeting with a motorcade tour of
Aswan, 900 kilometers south of Cairo, and then visited the site
of the High Dam, which was completed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, King Hussein and Mubarak also met with the
chief editors of Egyptian newspapers during a 45-minute session,
which was also attended by senior Egyptian and Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's visit came within the framework of continued
contacts which the Egyptian president makes with Arab leaders to
consolidate common Arab action.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries to have signed
peace treaties with Israel.

Turkey which were contaminated with a virus considered by the
Ministry as posing a threat to the health of consumers.
</P>

Following the decision, wholesale merchants are expected to

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Expresses Support to Somali Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today told the 26 Somali political movements who
recently formed a National Salvation Council here that his
country will support the implementation of their new peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry was quoted by
the Ethiopian News Agency as saying that the Ethiopian prime
minister made the remarks when he was talking with leaders of the
26 Somali political movements at his office.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Meles said Ethiopia is committed to working
with the newly established National Salvation Council and with
the Somali people with a view to forging international assistance
towards ensuring the realization of the new peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia is working for the restoration of peace
and stability in Somalia not only because it was mandated by the
Organization of African Unity and the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development, but also the present political crisis
in that country affects Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He also said the formation of a legitimate government in
Somalia will help foster the socio-economic activities of the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Council of Somalia was formed on
January 3 following six-week high level consultative meeting of
leaders of the 26 Somali political movements at Sodere, about 120 km
southeast of Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> Wide Gap Exists Over Clinching Hebron Deal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- While U.S. envoy Dennis Ross
continued his mediation today, Palestinian officials said wide
gap still exists between the Palestinians and Israelis over
signing the long-delayed Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who held five-hour talks with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Tuesday night, today held another round of talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to explore ways to
bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials described the talks as hitting a snag
as Israel refused to honor the Oslo accords by delaying further
troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to European visitors today, Arafat called on
European Union to exert pressure on Israel to honor the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader reportedly has rejected the
U.S. compromise proposal over the timetable for further Israeli
troop pullbacks during his meeting with Ross.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian minister Marwan Knafani described the Arafat-Ross
meeting Tuesday night as "extremely tense," warning that the
Israeli position could destroy all hopes for reaching a Hebron
deal. Due to the deadlock, a scheduled summit between Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was cancelled in the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel renews its accusation of the Palestinian
side for refusing to sign the Hebron deal. Moshe Fogel, Director
of the Government Press Office and Israel's spokesman on the
Hebron talks, blamed Arafat for delaying conclusion of the
Hebron deal in order to gain international support.
</P>
<P>
Fogel said the Hebron deal had been virtually sealed for the
past six weeks, it could not be signed until now just because
the Palestinian side tried to raise other issues beyond the
Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arafat to sign the Hebron deal first in order to
push forward the peace process. "Our feeling is that Mr. Arafat
is not in rush, and it is really up to him when we can go
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday night, Netanyahu said it would become clear
very soon if the Hebron deal could be reached. He demanded the
Palestinian side to show good will to reach the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle blocking the signing of a deal centered on
the timetable for further Israeli troop pullbacks from rural
areas of the West Bank, which should be completed by September
this year under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu only promises to complete further troop pullbacks
by spring 1999, but Arafat insists on Israel's accurate
implementation of the Oslo accords which call for the completion
of the process by September this year. Ross is suggesting a
compromise date of summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Netanyahu is seeking delay of further
pullbacks in order to retain more territorial cards pending the
upcoming final-status talks with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israelis Killed in Clashes With Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and six others wounded in an attack by guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the casualties,
the heaviest suffered by the 1,000-strong Israeli forces in south
Lebanon since this year, has not been officially confirmed by the
Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut tonight, the Islamic
Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, announced that its
guerrillas thwarted an infiltrating attempt of an Israeli
commandos force later this afternoon into an area controlled by
the Shiite fundamentalist party.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Israeli force was trying to advance from an
outpost near Deir Siryan village in the occupied border strip and
was blocked by the guerrillas at the Litan River basin.
</P>
<P>
A fierce clash erupted between the Israeli force and the
guerrillas in which several Israeli soldiers were killed or
wounded, said the Hezbollah statement.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli occupation
forces fired heavy artilleries tonight at the Litan river basin
as well as vicinities of south Lebanese villages in the nearby
areas.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for an earlier bombing attack on an Israeli
patrol, Israeli forces opened violent artillery fire at guerrilla
bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon reported that Israeli
artillery fired more than 150 shells at Hezbollah targets in
Iglim Al-Toffah and Western Beqaa since this morning without
causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one squad of its fighters detonated a mine at
6:00 a.m. (0400 GMT), targeting an Israeli force attempting to
advance toward Abu Rashid village.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group said that five Israeli soldiers were
wounded in the explosion, adding that they were evacuated by
Israeli military helicopters from the battle scene.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio confirmed the attack taking place in the eastern
sector of the Israeli self-carved buffer zone in south Lebanon,
claiming that three Israeli soldiers were wounded, including one
in serious situation.
</P>
<P>
Today's escalation in south Lebanon came just as a five-nation
committee monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli
border wound up this morning its first meeting in 1997 without
blaming anyone for alleged cease-fire breaches just before the
year end.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the
cease-fire monitoring committee urged the Israeli forces and
Lebanese guerrillas, who are engaged in a war of attrition in
south Lebanon, to prevent civilians from being hurt in military
operations.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises France, the United States,
Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was established under a cease-fire
understanding brokered by the U.S. and France last April between
Lebanon and Israel, which put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It urged the conflicting sides in south Lebanon to keep
their commitment to the April understanding, which warns against
attacks at or from civilians areas, and demands civilians be
kept away from all dangers of military actions.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect the Jewish settlement in northern
Israel from crossing-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Build New Desalination Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will build a new
desalination plant to alleviate the fresh water shortage on this
East Mediterranean island country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced here today by Minister for
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides
after a cabinet meeting which approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the plant will be put in tender by
April.
</P>
<P>
This plant, which will supply Nicosia with fresh water, will be
linked with another one now under construction.
</P>
<P>
He added that the water shortage will be eased to a great
extent once these two plants become fully operational.
</P>
<P>
The island relies mainly on rainfall for its water supply.
</P>
<P>
This year the government plans to further cut water supply to
deal with a more severe shortage due to a dry winter.
</P>
<P>
Water supply to the household would be cut by up to 20 percent,
compared with that of 10 per cent last year. Water for farming
purposes would be cut by up to 70 percent in comparison with the
drop of 35 percent the year before, official estimates said.

Athens, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos had a meeting today with U.S. ambassador to Greece Thomas
Niles to discuss Cyprus' decision to purchase Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., along with several European countries, has expressed
concern about a possible escalation of armaments programs in the
region. Turkey has outrightly condemned the purchase while Athens
has strongly defended Nicosia's decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Government Spokesman Dimitris Reppas, Pangalos and
Niles set out their respective governments views on the Cyprus
decision.
</P>
<P>
He added that Washington's reservations about the multi-million
dollar deal signed in Moscow last Saturday had also been conveyed
to Greece's ambassador in the U.S. Lucas Tsila.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the State Department's official representative for
Southern Europe Carey Cavanaugh's visit to the region this
weekend, covering Nicosia, Athens and Ankara, Reppas replied that
the government had not been informed about the issues which the
U.S. envoy intends to raise.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the procurement of the S-300 system could be
canceled "tomorrow" if a program was implemented immediately
for the total demilitarization of the island.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: Military Build-up in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The "excessive rearmament" of
Greek Cyprus poses a threat to the atmosphere of peace on the
Mediterranean island, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
This also adversely affects the efforts in finding a solution
to the Cyprus problem, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will not tolerate anything which would harm the security
and territorial interests of the Turkish Cypriots or upset the
Turkish-Greek balance on the strategic island, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned the Greek Cypriot side "in the strongest
terms" not to drag the island into "new adventures with unforeseen
consequences."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cypriot ministers and representatives of the
Russian state-controlled Rosvoorouzhen company concluded an
agreement in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia on buying S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Russia-made missiles, with a range of
150 kilometers, will be deployed to protect naval and air bases
under construction on the west coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The bases are being built under a joint defense pact between
Cyprus and Greece, agreed in November 1993 to face possible
Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal between Greek Cypriots and Russians has drawn
strong opposition from both Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, the only
country in the world to recognize the self-claimed "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktash also accused Moscow of
displaying enmity toward Turks on the island by selling missiles
to Greek Cypriots, warning that Cyprus was on the verge of an
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO allies, are at odds over this
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the
Turkish troops landed on the island and took control of the
northern part following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Canada, US to Renew Fight over Dairy Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The long-running dispute between
Canada and the United States over the former's protection of its
dairy and poultry industries will be renewed soon after a NAFTA
panel ruling in Canada's favor.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is about to start a probe of Canada's new dairy
pricing system to see if it violates the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Canada sets the price of milk used in cheese and other dairy
products, which the U.S. says may violate NAFTA and international
trading rules, since some of its production is exported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it believes Canadian cheese exports to the U.S.
was helped by government subsidies ranging from 57 U.S. cents to
95 cents a kilo.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada is allowed to export up to 70,000 kilos a
year to the U.S. duty free. By the end of last November, it has
exported about 55,000 kilos.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the U.S. is expected to renew its attack on
Canada's protection against dairy and poultry products coming into
the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lost a NAFTA panel ruling last December which found
that Canada's new import duties on dairy and poultry products,
some as high as 350 percent, were legal under NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, the U.S. dairy and poultry industries are
lobbying the Congress to push pressure on the Clinton
Administration to open up the Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
Dave Redmond, a spokesman for the U.S. House agriculture
chairman Bob Smith, said he expects the Canadian dispute will soon
become a major issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly foremost in the minds of many members of the
committee, especially those with dairy and poultry concerns," he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has already indicated that it will not
negotiate any concessions on dairy and poultry even when
international farm talks resume in three years.

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Attacks Northern Israel Amid High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tension escalated in south
Lebanon tonight following a spate of exchanging fire between
Israeli occupation forces and the Lebanese guerrillas of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted security sources said in south
Lebanon that several Katyusha rockets were fired into the western
Galilee in northern Israel tonight, and no word on casualties was
available.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said that another 12 Katyusha rockets landed
on the outskirts of Markaba village only 200 meters away from the
Lebanese-Israeli border, claiming that no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah denied any link with the attack, and no group in
Lebanon has claimed responsibility for the Katyusha attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah used to fire Katyusha
rockets, the most advanced of which has a range of 40 kilometers,
usually when south Lebanese civilians were killed or wounded by
Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
But a cease-fire understanding brokered by the United States
and France between Lebanon and the Jewishs state in April barred
the guerrilla group from using the weapon, supposedly provided
by Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut tonight, the Islamic
Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, announced it thwarted
an infiltrating attempt of an Israeli commandos force late this
afternoon into a Hezbollah-controlled area at the Litani river
basin, killing and wounding several Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Israelis fired heavy artilleries at the Litani river
basin as well as vicinities of south Lebanese villages in the
nearby areas, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Israeli bombing today. In retaliation for
a dawn bombing attack on an Israeli patrol, Israeli artillery
fired more than 150 shells at Hezbollah targets in Iglim Al-Toffah
and Western Beqaa since this morning without causing casualties,
according to Police sources in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that five Israeli soldiers were injured in a mine
explosion early this morning in the eastern sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Today's escalation in south Lebanon came just as the
five-nation committee monitoring a limited truce on the
Lebanese-Israeli border wound up this morning its first meeting
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting, the
committee urged the Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas to
prevent civilians from being hurt in military operations.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising France, the United States, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel was established under a cease-fire
understanding brokered by the U.S. and France last April, which
put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from crossing-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

In the visit, Annan told reporters, he is going to meet
President Bill Clinton and U.S. legislators. He said he was not
bringing any specific issues to the meeting but would make the
case to U.S. officials "that we all need the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the issue of reform as well as the related
matter of the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars the United States owes the
United Nations were expected to come up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has attacked the United Nations as bloated,
inefficient and wasteful and balked at paying off the U.S.
debt to the institution until it is reformed.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan seemed to have different views regarding the
reform. At a meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher
Tuesday, Annan emphasized compromise on the issue of reform
instead of large reduction of the U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
"Governments need to come to an understanding what they want
the United Nations to do," said Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a good leader must also be a good follower," Eckhard
quoted Annan as telling Christopher.

<HEADLINE> Report: Stolen Remains of Turkish Tycoon Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The corpse of Turkey's late
tycoon Vehbi Koc was believed to have been found after it was
missing for 75 days, Turkish private TV Channel D reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Some unidentified men called Channel D and claimed that they
had sent Kov's remains back.
</P>
<P>
Then the police did find a body a few yards away from the Koc's
empty grave at the Zincirlikuyu cemetery in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Several people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the
incident, but no detailed reports are available.
</P>
<P>
Rahmi Koc, son of Vehbi Koc, said that the found body would
soon be identified.
</P>
<P>
The body of Vehbi Koc, Turkey's No.1 businessman, was stolen on
October 24. The incident shocked the whole country and drew strong
condemnation from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish press reported that thieves had robbed the grave to
demand a ransom of 30 or 40 billion Turkish liras (about 300,000
or 400,000 U.S. dollars) from the Koc family.
</P>
<P>
Vehbi Koc, founder of Turkey's largest corporation, Koc
Holding, was 95 when he died in February.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet UN Secretary-General Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will hold his first formal meeting with new United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on January 23 at the White House, the
White House said today.
</P>
<P>
The issue of U.N. reform and the debt of 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars that the United States owes the U.N. were expected to be
discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said outgoing
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told Annan during a
meeting Tuesday at the United Nations that the Clinton
administration was confident it could "now begin again to renew a
close relationship" with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Clinton wanted to meet Annan at a time
when the Congress was in session so he could meet U.S. legislators
to win their support for paying off the U.S. debt, which is more
than half the 2.3 billion dollars owed to the U.N. by its members.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters at the United Nations that he was not
bringing any specific issues to the meeting but would make the
case to U.S. officials "that we all need the United Nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) will
arrive here on Friday to attend the Angolan National Assembly,
Second Deputy Speaker Jaime Chinguimbo said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied an earlier claim by UN envoy to Angola
Blondin Beye that the UNITA deputies will arrive next Friday.
</P>
<P>
The assembly has created all necessary conditions for the
return of the UNITA deputies, said Chinguimbo.
</P>
<P>
UNITA deputies and members of the future government of
national unity and reconciliation will be arranged in four
high-graded hotels in the capital at the beginning, he said.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, the largest opposition party in the southern African
country, won 70 of all the 223 seats in the assembly in Angola's
first multi-parties elections held in September, 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, only seven UNITA deputies so far have inaugurated due
to the outbreaking of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Foreign Currency Reserve Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's foreign currency
reserves have dropped nearly 60 percent over the past year, to 518
million U.S. dollars, said Lyubomir Filikov, president of the
Bulgarian National Bank, today.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria sold off much of its foreign currency reserve in the
first few months of 1996, down to a level of 667 million dollars
in May, in an effort to curb the drastic devaluation of the
Bulgarian leva against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The payments on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had amounted to
billions of dollars, also contributed to the decline in the
foreign currency and worsened the weakened economy.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government is expecting the sale of big,
state-run enterprises can improve the situation.

BONN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
today that he was optimistic about the eastwards expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Kohl told a news conference here that he believed NATO could
reach consensus with Russia and Ukraine on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He said a "new boundary maker" should not be created again
between NATO and Russia following the cold war era.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that he believed with reason that the two sides could
reach rational compromise through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
He could understand Russia's misgivings, as well as Russia's
hope of receiving interest compensation.
</P>
<P>
But when holding talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
last week in Moscow, Kohl stressed again that nobody could veto
NATO's eastwards expansion.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Output up 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial output in
1996 increased by 13.1 percent to reach 1,906 billion yuan,
according to a report released today by the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the nation's industry enjoyed stable
growth rates in the past four quarters at 13.6 percent, 13.1
percent, 11.8 percent and 15.7 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Non-state industries registered higher growth rates than that
of the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the value-added output by the state
enterprises saw a growth rate of 6.7 percent, while that of the
collective operations increased by 17.7 percent, and that of
other economic sectors went up 13.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's light and heavy industries basically
developed at the same pace, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The light industrial growth rate was 13.5 percent, 0.8
percentage points higher than that of heavy industry's 12.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The gap was much lower than 1994's 3.1 percentage points and
1995's 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 production of most of industrial products was carried
out in line with market demand, said the report, adding that the
output of energy products and raw material products enjoyed a stable
increase.
</P>
<P>
The output of primary energy in the country last year reached
1.26 billion tons of standard coal, up 6.4 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that China's sales rate against industrial
production was 95.86 percent in the whole year. The figure in the
fourth quarter was 98.9 percent, progressively increasing from the
first quarter's 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the bureau noted, the national industry's economic
efficiency was still low, especially in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It urged governments at all levels to take effective measures to
help solve the economic difficulties facing those enterprises in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Japan Oil Spill Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- An oil spill from a wrecked
Russian tanker continued spreading over the Sea of Japan today,
washing ashore along 300 kilometers of coastline and threatening
local economies by damaging marine products and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Patches of oil were found on the coast alongside the towns of
Tango and Amino in Kyoto Prefecture, and nearby Kasumi in Hyogo
Prefecture, about 450 kilometers west of Tokyo, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The oil slick also reached coastal areas near Mikuni in
northern Fukui Prefecture. It was in this area that the front part
of the 13,157-ton Nakhodka ran aground Tuesday after breaking up
on January 2 in stormy waters in the Sea of Japan and drifting,
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was estimated to have held 17,000 kiloliters (15,300
tons) of fuel oil when the vessel broke up, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The oil has since spread and slicks are scattered from waters
off the Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture to the sea off the Noto
Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
More oil was likely to come ashore along the coast of Ishikawa
and Fukui prefectures, and the current might spread some to the
northern shore of the Noto Peninsula, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Asks Italy to Return Historical Relic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
today decided to send a delegation to Italy in a few weeks in an
effort to speed up the return of the Axum Obelisk looted by
Italians during colonial time.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a high-level meeting of the "Return
Our Obelisk" Committee established by the concerned government
departments and well-known personalities in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
After listening to a report on technical and legal
preparations over the issue in the past few months, the meeting
decided to send a delegation to Italy to discuss with Italian
officials on matters relating to the return of the obelisk to its
original place.
</P>
<P>
Technical experts in the delegation are expected to carry out
detailed consultations on the removal and transport of the
obelisk with their Italian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The meeting recalled that the Axum Obelisk now in Rome was
looted on the express orders of Benito Mussolini, the leader of
facist Italy 60 years ago in 1937.
</P>
<P>
"Although it was agreed in the peace treaty in 1947 and in the
Ethio-Italy agreement of 1956 to return the obelisk to Ethiopia,
Italy has not complied with the agreements," the meeting pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
It called upon "the Italian government to take prompt measures
to bring the matter to its proper conclusion without delay."
</P>
<P>
Axum obelisks are most striking relics of ancient Axum Kingdom
established about 2,000 years ago in Axum, an ancient city
located 600 kilometers north of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
They are made of single blocks of granite carved in the
representation of multi-storey buildings. The tallest, now
fallen, stood over 33 meters high and represented a building of
13 storeys. The biggest obelisk still standing is 23 meters high
with about 10 storeys.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Thierry Dubois, a French skipper joining the Vendee Globe
sailing boat racing across the world, was winched to a helicopter by
Australian marines Wednesday evening, after taking refugee in one of
his two life rafts near the Australian coast. The Australians are
now rescuing a second skipper in the racing, Tony Bullimore of
Britain. A third skipper, Canadian Gerry Roufs, has been missing
since Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Australians have complained about the cost for the rescue
work and asked the French organizers of the competition to choose a
racing route which is less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
-- Although the Swiss federal authorities were forced to set up a
fund of aid for the victims of Holocaust and their descendants, the
associations in Israel are threatening to boycott all Swiss banking
institutions for the refusal by the Swiss authorities to give back
some 7 billion dollars of properties deposited by Jews in Swiss
banks before and during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government nominated a mediator for facilitating the
search in the banking files about the Jewish properties, but so far
only 45,000 francs (9,000 U.S. dollars) have been repaid to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright
Wednesday confronted Senator Jesse Helms by calling for more
expenditure on U.S. diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
-- The South African government of President Nelson Mandela is
planning to outlaw the dogs of war -- former Apartheid white
soldiers turned mercenaries fighting in central African countries
such as Zaire. The Pretoria government is more and more annoyed by
the activities of a Pretoria-based company of guns for hire,
Executive Outcomes, which has been recruiting mercenaries for the
wars in other African states.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Temperature Normal, Treatment Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
hospitalized overnight with "the first signs" of pneumonia, had a
normal temperature this morning and treatment is being continued.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said today that Yeltsin is being
treated for pneumonia with the help of modern antibiotics and is
also undergoing a course of general supportive therapy.
</P>
<P>
"The president had a normal morning temperature," the service
said. It quoted doctors, who examined Yeltsin in Moscow's Central
Clinical Hospital, as saying that "treatment continued as
prescribed."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also had a 15-minute telephone conversation with
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin this morning, the press
service said. They discussed "present-day matters of national
importance".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, underwent heart bypass surgery last November 5,
and returned to the Kremlin in late December. He had been
bedridden in his country residence outside Moscow with a high
temperature since Monday. But Kremlin doctors have insisted that
his current condition was unrelated to the surgery.
</P>
<P>
Russian Public Television's evening news broadcast, "Vremya",
said overnight that doctors had decided to hospitalize Yeltsin for
several days because they had discovered what appeared to be the
first signs of pneumonia after an evening observation of the
president.
</P>
<P>
United States cardiologist Michael DeBakey, a senior adviser
for Yeltsin's November 5 operation, told British BBC radio that
Yeltsin would fully recuperate in one week's time.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's present indisposition was of catarrhal nature and
not dangerous for his heart, DeBakey said. Yeltsin had virtually
recovered fully from the bypass operation, which enabled him to
return to active work, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Reemployment, Bankruptcy Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- To help state enterprises
prevail over their current difficult situation, a new competitive
structure should be created to eliminate excessive workers,
standardize bankruptcy and encourage more mergers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on the reemployment of workers
from state firms today, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji recalled the
achievements made in the country's economic sector in the past
year, noting that all the country's macro-economic control targets
have been reached or exceeded.
</P>
<P>
Senior government and CPC leaders Li Lanqing, Wu Bangguo, Ren
Jianxin and Luo Gan were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said the country's economy has been showing a sound development
trend, thanks to the macro-control efforts of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1996, the government maintained a high
development speed as it simultaneously reduced the inflation rate
to as low as six percent, increased the foreign exchange reserve
to 105 billion US dollars, kept the issue of currency within 100
billion yuan and increased tax collection from industrial and
commercial firms by nearly 106.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He listed the issues of grain production and tackling the
difficult situation challenging state enterprises as two major
tasks for the government's work to improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
China's grain reserve had hit the historic high of 297 billion
kg by the end of 1996, a 68.8 billion kg increase over the
beginning of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government has raised the official purchase prices of grain
by 50 percent over the 1995 figures, and domestic grain prices as
well as the prices of imported grains are higher than the
production costs, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, local farmers will not be harmed by low prices, as
the country has experienced good grain harvests for two successive
years, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government price hike in grain prices
is one of the main causes of the decrease in profits made by the
country's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Other factors responsible for the state firms' hard times
include the official price-rise in the transport and energy
industries, the adoption of the new accounting system, the fact
that individuals are getting a larger share of the distribution,
and also the illegal levies on these firms by local governments,
Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized three bigger problems that are
plaguing state companies: low-level competition due to the
establishment of too many firms of the same kind; market disorder
caused by the influx of smuggled goods; and excessive numbers of
employees and outdated management styles.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government will deal with the state firms'
troubles by strengthening the leadership of these firms, laying
off unnecessary staff, standardizing the procedure of bankruptcy,
and encouraging these companies to merge instead of going
bankrupt, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy should not be conducted by way of sole transfers or
purchases, he said, stressing that in each bankruptcy case, assets
must be cashed in and all employees must be dismissed, while
personnel from the bankrupt firms must be helped to find new jobs
through reemployment programs.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier promised interest-exemption on the inherited
debts for firms that have bought into bankrupt companies, and
reduction or exemption of interest on loans for firms that cannot
go bankrupt and must lay off part of their staff.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that bankruptcy could only take place in 110
pilot cities, disclosing that the government has earmarked no more
than 30 billion yuan to cover the bad loans for banks due to
bankruptcy of state firms.

<HEADLINE> Security Panel Essential for Democratic System: Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the Council
for Defense and National Security (CDNS) was "absolutely essential
for the health of parliament and democratic system", said a high
Pakistani official here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Caretaker Defense Minister
Shahid Hamid said it would ensure there was no "element of
friction or misunderstanding" between the president and the prime
minister in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hamid said the CDNS would block forever the president to
dissolve the National Assembly under a controversial clause in the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive governments have been dismissed by three
presidents since 1988. President Farooq Leghari last dissolved the
National Assembly and the government of Benazir Bhutto on November
5 last year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rational behind the establishment of the CDNS,
which caused objections among most political parties who are busy
preparing for the forthcoming elections on February 3, he said the
president is to take an active part in the affairs of the state.
</P>
<P>
He said the president over the last 10 years had been
participating in matters of vital security issues and hence the
establishment of the CDNS had formalized the arrangement which was
already there.
</P>
<P>
Leghari set up the 10-member council to "aid and advice" the
government on matters including declaration of emergency,
determination of national strategy and fixation of priorities in
terms of over-all national security.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Guaranteed in Macao: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stationed in Macao said tonight that the Portuguese-style
pebble-stone road, portuguese food and the Portuguese buildings in
Macao will not be altered together with the capitalist system for
at least 50 years after 1999 when China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao. .
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told a group of middle and high-ranking civil servants of the
Macao Government, who are to visit Beijing and Harbin City in
northeast China between January 18 and 24, that China takes a
serious attitude towards the implementation of the 'one country,
two systems' policy."
</P>
<P>
"Anything that is not against the basic law of Macao, not
affecting China's resuming the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao, and is in line with the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration,
will not be changed after 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those things include the Portuguese food, pebble-stone roads,
the Macao Governor's Office Building and other Portuguese-style
buildings, as well as those localized laws, according to the
director.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wang said that the future government of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR) opens warm arms to the
Macao-born Portuguese, so long as they will stay on in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The Macao-born Portuguese people have long resided along with
other Macao residents and have done their parts in the development
of Macao," he said. "They can live in harmony with other residents
in Macao so long as they will."
</P>
<P>
The director assured the civil servants that the Chinese side
hopes the civil servants of the Macao Government would stay on and
serve the future MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhiliang, director of the Macao Foundation and one of the
leaders of the visiting group, said that all members of the group
will stride over 1999 and serve the future MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The group of civil servants' visit is at the invitation of the
Macao Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council. They will visit Beijing University, the Ministry of
Personnel and some other departments.

<HEADLINE> Newly Appointed Minister in Nepal Expelled by Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali lawmaker, who was
appointed a cabinet member Wednesday, has been expelled from his
own party, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A Central Secretariat meeting of the Nepal Workers and
Peasants' Party (NWPP) has decided to expel Bhakta Bahadur Rokaya
from the party's general membership, charging that he had breached
party discipline.
</P>
<P>
Rokaya, a lower house MP representing the NWPP party, was
appointed state minister for land and soil conservation by Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in the latest reshuffle of his cabinet
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its decision to expel Rokaya, The NWPP party said
Rokaya's involvement in the government is against the party's
official decision to remain in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The NWPP meeting, held late Wednesday after the cabinet
reshuffle was announced, also decided to demand that the speaker
of the lower house vacate Rokaya's membership in the house.
</P>
<P>
Despite his party's decision to back a no-confidence motion
against the coalition government tabled by the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML),
Rokaya was absent from a special house session on the censure
motion last month.
</P>
<P>
The special house session later rejected the opposition motion
with a vote of 101 in favor and 84 against in the 205-seat House
of Representatives. The motion required a majority of 103 votes to
pass in the house.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets HK Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said here
today that the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) shall be responsible for the formation
of the first SAR government before Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Provisional Legislative Council shall prepare
for the legislation for the SAR, although it will not gain the
full extent of its authority until July 1, this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a delegation from the Chinese General Chamber
of Commerce of Hong Kong led by its Chairman Tsang Hin Chi, Lu
said Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chief Executive, must nominate the
principal officials of the future SAR government, report them to
the central people's government for appointment, and also
designate members of the Executive Council in accordance with the
decision adopted at the National People's Congress, before July 1.
</P>
<P>
To do all of this after July 1 will only complicate the
formation of the SAR government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the entire legislative process of the
Provisional Legislative Council will not be accomplished until the
zero hour of July 1, when the Chief Executive signs a decree.
</P>
<P>
All of its work before July 1 is only to prepare for the
legislation of the SAR, and avoid a legal vacuum, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Lu said it is less than half a year before Hong Kong returns to
the motherland, and Hong Kong is currently operating well overall,
thanks to the efforts made over the years by the majority of the
Hong Kong people, including those present.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong
will continue to carry forward the spirit of loving the motherland
and Hong Kong, go all out to participate in the work concerned
with Hong Kong's return, and contribute to the region's smooth
transition and its prosperity and stability.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt Is Building Future of People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU SIMBEL, southern Egypt, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said here today the country is going all
out for the benefit of future generations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who unveiled a gigantic project aimed at adding
Egypt's arable land by 30 percent and inhabiting the vast expanses
of the south Egypt through digging a canal, made the remarks in
his inauguration speech.
</P>
<P>
The president called the canal a "fortress of security and
peace, a bridge of civilization." He said that it is based on what
has been accumulated for over 30 years of scientific research and
planning.
</P>
<P>
It is rather a "necessity for the whole people" when the
over-crowdedness in the Nile Valley is just getting intolerable
and urbanization is growing to the brink of danger, Mubarak said,
dismissing an accusation that the project is conducted out of
"political motivation."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed Canal, the so-called New Valley Canal, is located
50 kilometers south of Abu Simbel, the southernmost city of
Egypt. It is just the beginning of an integrated development
project to divert people from the crammed Old Nile Valley to new
communities in the Western Desert in two decades.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation potential is estimated at 2.2 million feddans
(924,000 hectares), equal to the capacity of the Aswan High Dam,
which had added 30 percent to the total cultivable area of Egypt
when its ten-year construction was completed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Under the first stage, the 30-kilometer-long canal will be able
to irrigate at least half a million feddans (215,000 hectares)
with water diverted from the Aswan High Dam through the Toshki
Depression, where surplus water from the Lake Nasser has been
accumulating.
</P>
<P>
The president, relaxed and smiling, quipped with some of the
VIPs attending the inauguration ceremony and shook hands with some
of the reporters covering the event.
</P>
<P>
"We are building the future of the people of Egypt in the Old
Valley (the Nile Valley) with new communities, agriculture,
industry, tourism, everything (we plan) might happen," Mubarak
told Xinhua immediately after he addressed the inauguration of the
Sheikh Zayed Canal.
</P>
<P>
This canal is planned to be accomplished by installing a pumping
station, the largest in the world, at the Toshki Depression to
pump 30 million cubic meters of water a day from a level of 150
meters to a level of 200 meters into the new canal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also reviewed the blueprints for a number of other huge
national projects, known as "Egypt's 21st century project."
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the 30-kilometer-long canal will open the
door to investments in agriculture, land reclamation, industry,
mining, tourism and establishment of integrated urban communities
to absorb the expected population increase till the year 2017,
according to an earlier statement by Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The integrated works will provide necessary infrastructure to
open the door for industrial, agricultural and tourism schemes on
the map of the New Delta.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, in his speech, said
the mammoth project would be funded through several means.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 300 billion Egyptian pounds (88 billion
U.S. dollars), the government's contributions, only 20 percent of
the development costs, are limited to providing the area with an
infrastructure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France to Re-examine Army Deployment in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- France will re-examine its pattern
of army deployment and the layout of military bases in Africa to
improve their operational capacity, French Defense Minister
Charles Millon said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on local television Europe 1, Millon said: "For an
identical operational efficiency, France could without doubt
re-examine the bases and rotation of soldiers."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made the suggestion after French troops
clashed earlier this week with mutinous soldiers of the Central
African Republic, which has the largest French military base in
Africa after Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
France would have full consultations with the local governments
which had defense treaties with Paris, before making any changes
to military bases, said Millon.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the alteration would be "marginal"
and only concern logistical support and troop rotation.
</P>
<P>
France has 8,200 troops deployed in several French-speaking
African countries, considered to be traditional interest zones of
France.
</P>
<P>
Millon made a number of tours in Africa in 1996 and has
reaffirmed France's intention to fully maintain its military
presence in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Lauds Taxation Workers for Record Tax Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
has commended the country's taxation workers for their diligent
efforts to collect record-breaking taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics show that China's industrial and
commercial tax revenue grew by more than 100 billion yuan to 644.6
billion yuan (about 77.6 billion US dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time that the tax revenue expanded by more than
100 billion yuan year-on-year, and the fourth consecutive year
that it grew by more than 96 billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
The record industrial and commercial tax revenue, which also
means that China overfulfilled its tax target for six years in a
row, was up 19.7 percent over 1995 and represented 107 percent of
last year's goal.
</P>
<P>
Zhu wrote in a report by the State Administration of Taxation,
"Please pass my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to all the taxation
workers for the great achievements they scored in 1996."
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that the domestic value-added tax and
consumption tax, two major tax items under China's new
revenue-sharing taxation regime introduced in 1994, rose 14
percent to 365.7 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
When corporate income taxes and other earnings are included,
China's fiscal income exceeded the mark of 700 billion yuan to
714.7 billion yuan in 1996, up 16.8 percent over a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will focus more on
restructuring industry to better cater to local economic
development, according to a vice mayor of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to give an overall boost to the sector's
strength and competitiveness in markets, Yang Anjiang revealed at
an industrial work conference here today. And the comprehensive
strategic improvement will give priority to the rearrangement of
local industrial structure, framework of enterprises, and product
mix, as well as production allocation.
</P>
<P>
More developments are scheduled for the hi-tech,
high-value-added, environmental-friendly, and profitable
industrial projects, rather than the low-efficiency and
high-consumption items such as textiles, leather and plastics,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In the urban areas, emphasis will be placed on the development
of commercial and service trades, as well as the re-allocation of
industrial capital and assets.
</P>
<P>
The city intends to develop 75 industrial name-brand products
this year with sales exceeding 50 million yuan each, and 40
surpassing 100 million yuan each. And priority will be given to
technological upgrading for production of 14 name-brand products,
including program-controlled switchboards, color kinescopes made
by a Matsushita-funded business, and computers produced by Legend
Group.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Beijing plans to develop 50 new industrial
products, and put more projects into operation to make more
than 50 new items with sales expected to surpass 10 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city will also promote 10 new industrial technologies,
involving microelectronics information and comprehensive
power-saving for steel-smelting in furnaces. It will also resort
to new technology to improve traditional industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The city now has nearly 10,000 industrial enterprises at or
above the county level, with fixed assets reaching 100 billion
yuan. It ranked second in China after Shanghai in its 130 billion
yuan-worth of industrial output value in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is famous nationwide for its electronics, machinery,
automobiles, metallurgical, and chemical industries.

<HEADLINE> PICC Takes a Big Slice of Insurance market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC), the country's leading insurer, has worked out an
ambitious plan to drive its annual premium income up to 150
billion yuan by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, PICC's income from life insurance will
reach 71 billion yuan by that time, nine billion yuan more than
that from the property insurance.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past years, the company's life insurance
income has always lagged behind that generated from property
insurance.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people will spend more money on life insurance, and
more insurance products will be generated, with more and more of
them becoming well-off," Wu Xiaoping, vice-president of PICC, said
at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
"There is great potential to be tapped in China's insurance
market," he added.
</P>
<P>
The company's premium income will balloon by an average rate of
25.8 percent in the coming years, he said, adding that the company
will still hold most of the home insurance market in hand, even
though China promised to open its insurance sector to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
China now has three nationwide insurance companies, four
overseas offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou cities, and some other
regional and specialized companies.
</P>
<P>
And the number of insurance companies continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
But the PICC's will only be able to keep three-fourths of the
total domestic market shares, as the World Bank estimates that
China's booming insurance market will be around 2,000 billion yuan
by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Before 1988, PICC was the sole state-owned insurance company in
China. The company was reorganized last July and shaped into a
commercial liability-limited enterprise that was to operate
according to market rules.
</P>
<P>
The company's premium income last year was about 63.4 billion
yuan in both domestic and overseas markets, up 25.2 percent from
1995. PICC Life, one of its three subsidiaries dealing in life
insurance, also set a new record in income growth last year.
</P>
<P>
PICC Life earned 21.2 billion yuan in premium income last year,
up 40 percent from 1995. The company now is focusing on China's
giant economic cities, targeting the more prosperous residents who
are likely to buy insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
PICC Property and PICC Reinsurance, the company's two other
subsidiaries, also have witnessed a stable increase of
income: PICC Property earned an income of 35 billion yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PICC chalked up a 35.1 billion-yuan-worth bill in
duty redemption in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Highway Transport Maintains Momentum in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The country's highway system
remained a formidable opponent in the increasingly fierce market
competition throughout China's transportation sector in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While the number of train passengers dropped by 12.3 percent
last year, highway passenger transport volume rose by 9.5 percent
to 11.4 billion people. The passenger turnover reached 506 billion
people per km, a rise of 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Remaining the most important mode of transportation in China,
highways shipped 10 billion tons of goods last year, an increase
of 6.4 percent. The turnover was 500 billion ton/km, a rise of 6.5
percent, as compared with minor increases in train transport of
1.4 and 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese highway officials attributed the growth to the unique
household-to-household system of highway transport as well as to
the rapid development in highway construction, especially the
building of high-grade roads and expressways, and the improvement
in rural roads.
</P>
<P>
According to a telephone conference held by the Ministry of
Communications here today, China completed 25,000 kilometers of
highways last year, bringing the total length to 1.18 million
kilometers. Of this amount, 17,800 kilometers are high-grade roads.
</P>
<P>
Last year was a milestone for the development of expressways in
China, with 1,117 kilometers of the roadways completed, bringing
the total to 3,258 kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's railway departments need
a strong market mechanism to meet fierce competition from road and
air travel, Railway Minister Han Zhubin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Han called for the establishment of special marketing
organizations and a high level team of staff at railway
stations.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at an ongoing annual high-profile working
conference of central and local railway officials.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that trains carried a total ridership of
942 million last year, a 12.3 percent drop over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, local railway bureaus will be given more
rights in terms of management in order to cater in a better way to
market operations.
</P>
<P>
Local units and railway enterprises will be entitled to rent
and contract slow trains, tourist trains, as well as dining,
container, and baggage cars in other trains. Railway sections can
also be rented out.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, local railway bureaus will be entitled to
readjust train schedules in line with concrete situations, and set
prices for some high-standard or express train services, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways will take measures to improve
services. A computerized ticketing network will be first used at
44 large stations, and other stations along four trunk lines --
Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Harbin, and
Lianyungang-Lanzhou, and will be spread to all other stations.
</P>
<P>
In order to be more competitive in terms of travel time, the
ministry plans to start 64 "arrive-in-a-night" return passenger
trains from April 1 of next year, when a new railway transport map
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
And higher speeds will be introduced for trains that go as far
as 1,000 to 1,500 kilometers from the seven major railway hubs of
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Wuchang, and

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here today that after July 1, 1997, the country will
never interfere in affairs to be handled by the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a delegation from the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce of Hong Kong led by its Chairman Tsang Hin Chi, Jiang
said it has been a long-established state policy to implement the
principles of "one country, two systems," "the Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
These principles not only benefit the six million Hong Kong
compatriots, but also work in the interests of the whole country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Hong Kong is a prosperous center of
international trade, finance, shipping and tourism, adding, "We
attach great importance to the unique role that Hong Kong is
playing."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the successful practice of the "one country,
two systems" concept cannot be realized without the unified
efforts of the Hong Kong people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong compatriots have contributed to maintaining Hong
Kong's prosperity, stability and stable transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the process of attaining this goal, "we place our great hope
on the Hong Kong compatriots and wish them continuous
contributions to this end," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability after July 1, 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said it is imperative to bring the chamber's fine
tradition of loving both the country and Hong Kong into full play,
and to more extensively unite the Hong Kong industrialists and
businessmen in order to contribute more to Hong Kong's smooth
return to the motherland and its long-term prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference and minister of the United Front Work Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and Lu Ping, director
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Wool Prices Likely to Increase in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices were likely to
increase in the second half of the season due to gradually
strengthening demand in Western Europe and steady demand in China,
Wool International (WI) said today.
</P>
<P>
In its January Insight newsletter, WI said that the eastern
market indicator was expected to average 620 Australian cents (496
US cents) a kilogram clean in the second half of the season, after
averaging 580 Australian cents (464 US cents) a kilogram in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
WI, the statutory body charged with selling Australia's wool
stockpile, had earlier forecast an eastern market indicator for
1996-97 of 620 Australian cents a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for fleece wool in the 19-25 micron categories have
declined during the six months to December, with fine wool most
affected," WI said.
</P>
<P>
"However, prices for wool in the 26-31 micron categories were
generally steady or improved slightly over this period."
</P>
<P>
WI said that auction offerings for the first half of 1996-97
totaled 1.76 million bales, 20 percent higher than in the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The pass-in rate at auction averaged 12 percent during the
first six months of the season, compared to 21 percent for the
same period last season, when prices were falling.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Kicks Off Mammoth Canal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU SIMBEL, southern Egypt, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak today unveiled an ambitious project that
aims at adding Egypt's arable land by 30 percent and inhabiting
the vast parches south through digging a canal.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed Canal, the so-called New Valley Canal, is just the
beginning of an integrated development project to divert people
from the crammed Old Nile Valley to new communities in the
Western Desert in two decades.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation potential is estimated at 2.2 million feddans
(924,000 hectares), equal to the capacity of the Aswan High Dam,
which had added 30 percent to the total cultivable area of Egypt
when its ten-year construction was completed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Under the first stage, the 30-kilometer-long canal will be able
to irrigate at least half a million feddans (215,000 hectares)
with water diverted from the Aswan High Dam through the Toshki
Depression, where surplus water from the Lake Nasser has been
accumulating.
</P>
<P>
This will be accomplished by installing a pumping station, the
largest in the world, at the Toshki Depression to pump 30 million
cubic meters of water a day from a level of 150 meters to a level
of 200 meters into the new canal.
</P>
<P>
At the site of the envisaged canal, Mubarak will review the
blueprints for a number of other huge national projects, known as
"Egypt's 21st century project."
</P>
<P>
The integrated works will provide necessary infrastructure to
open the door for industrial, agricultural and tourism schemes on
the map of the New Delta.
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration ceremony, he will also unveil the
incentive packages planned by the government to encourage
investment in the areas, where 25 new heavy industry sites will be
set up.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said earlier the
project was not merely for digging a canal, it aims at providing a
stable environment for building an agricultural community and
achieving sustainable and comprehensive development.
</P>
<P>
It will ease the imbalance of population distribution, enabling
58 percent of Egypt's land to be inhabited. At the moment, 99
percent of the population crams in the Nile Valley, which forms 4
percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
However, the costs are mammoth. Of the total 300 billion
Egyptian pounds (88 billion U.S. dollars), the government's
contributions, only 20 percent of the development costs, are
limited to providing the area with an infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the bills will be footed by international companies
and Egyptian and Arab private sectors, Xinhua learned.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has assured the Egyptians that the giant project would
be carried out over four five-year plans in accordance with
Egypt's potential and resources.
</P>
<P>
"The first phase of the 30-kilometer-long canal will open the
door to investments in agriculture, land reclamation, industry,
mining, tourism and establishment of integrated urban communities
to absorb the expected population increase till the year 2017," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, who has recently inspected Toshki work site twice,
said the new projects, will incur investments to 61.3 million
feddans to cover mining, industrial and agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive irrigational, geological and agricultural
research and lengthy plans have been conducted over the past
several years by specialized research centers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said to reclaim 500,000 feddans in the first phase
would need 5 billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
The first study of the New Valley development project was
conducted in 1960s, but it was reportedly delayed by preparations
for the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Pardons Iraqis with Illegal Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has announced a pardon for Iraqi nationals who maintain illegal
connections with foreign forces, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The phrase of Illegal connections with foreign forces is an
euphemism for spying.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the presidency office said
that Saddam has decided to grant a full pardon for those who
were recruited by foreign intelligence agencies or maintained
unauthorized links with foreign parties.
</P>
<P>
Those covered by the pardon should surrender themselves to the
authorites concerned as from Thursday and until the end of the
holy month of Ramadan, the Islamic lunar year which falls on
January 11 this year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the month of Ramadan, Muslims are forbidden to eat,
drink and hold parties from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted the presidency office as saying those who want to be
pardoned can report directly or indirectly to the authorities such
as the intelligence service, military intelligence, internal
security or any Baath party organizations.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two spy rings, one worked for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), the other for Israeli Mossad, have been
uncovered in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> HK Fully Committed to IPR Protection after '97: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is fully committed
to the protection of intellectual property rights and will
continue to maintain a strong local IRP system to the highest
international standards after the handover, a ranking official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meet-the-media session this afternoon, Stephen
Selby, director of Intellectual Property, said that much work had
been done by the Department of Intellectual Property in the past
year in updating and modernizing IP legislation.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the Intellectual Property (World Trade
Organization Amendments) Ordinance 1996 in May last year was a
good example of Hong Kong's efforts in IPR protection, Selby said.
</P>
<P>
"Its enactment enables Hong Kong to meet its obligations under
the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which
Hong Kong is a founding member," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the main features of the ordinance are new copyright
piracy offense provisions to help tackle masterminds of
cross-border piracy activities more effectively.
</P>
<P>
A patents bill which establishes an independent patent system
in Hong Kong for the protection of inventions in line with
international standards, was introduced here last June.
</P>
<P>
In addition, three bills, namely, Copyright Bill, Registered
Designs' Bill and Trademarks Bill, has been drafted.
</P>
<P>
On the other developments over the past year, closer
cooperation has been forged between the Intellectual Property
Department (IPD), the Customs and Excise Department and
TPR-related enforcement agencies in China to combat piracy.
</P>
<P>
On the progress of computerization, Selby said the department
established a computerized Trade Mark Registry System in the past
year and a Patents Computerization System would be implemented in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
Looking into 1997, Selby said the department is planning to
launch a major public education campaign at a cost of 1-2 million
HK dollars in conjunction with the private sector to promote
understanding and protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
And if the current measures fail to prevent piracy from further
spreading, provision of laws would be proposed so that the IPD
could take actions as in the fight against drugs and prostitution,
Selby said.

HANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has handled over a hundred patent disputes in recent years, most
of which have been settled.
</P>
<P>
Now, the number of such disagreements has been curbed,

Over the past decade, 11 patent administrative agencies and
nearly 30 patent affairs offices have been set up across the
province, receiving more than 20,000 applications for patents and
granting over 10,000 patent rights.
</P>
<P>
The newly-added value brought in by the patented products has

HANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in east China's
Zhejiang Province are encouraged by local authorities to play a
greater role in science research.
</P>
<P>
Special awards have been set up to encourage enterprises as
well as research institutes to advance local economy by using more
sophisticated technology, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
At an annual ceremony to honor major scientific achievements,
the majority of the 300 prize-winning projects were joint efforts
involving enterprises and research institutes. More than 80
percent of the achievements targeted national economic sectors,
and half deal with energy, communications, materials,
petrochemicals, machine building, and light and textile industries.
</P>
<P>
Many of the successes have played an important role in the
renovation and upgrading of enterprises, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, 300 achievements have yielded 20
billion yuan-worth of newly-added value, provincial statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has asked major enterprises to set up
their research organs and try to upgrade their products on their
own.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China will issue one billion
yuan (about 120 million US dollars) in bonds for the gigantic
Three Gorges Project, the China Yangtze Three Gorges Development
Corp., the issuer, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue, the first by the corporation inside China, has
been approved by the State Planning Commission and rated AAA- by
the China Chengxin Securities Rating Co. Ltd. The bonds fall into
the category of corporate bonds for enterprises directly run by
the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Raising funds through issuing bonds fits perfectly well into a
large project like the Three Gorges Water Project," an expert said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the water conservancy project, the largest in the
world, will take a long time to build and will need extensive
funding at the early stage of construction.
</P>
<P>
However, it will produce a huge return during the later stage
of construction, and power generated by the project will sell
well, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"Pooling funds directly from the market is an important
guarantee for the smooth construction of the Three Gorges
Project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Approved and authorized by related governments, the issuer will
guarantee the bonds in full value with a special construction fund
for the Three Gorges Project, which is expected to cost 90 billion
yuan in fixed current prices and scheduled to be completed in
about 20 years.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said in Beijing today that the Guatemalan government is to
be held fully responsible for all consequences arisen from its
actions which went against the basic principles of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
Although it is a good thing to accomplish peace in Guatemala,
he noted, it is regrettable that its government invited the
so-called "Foreign Minister" of the Taiwan authorities to attend
the signing ceremony of the peace agreement, turning a deaf ear to
repeated advices from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Shen's comments came at a press conference in response to
remarks made by Guatemalan Foreign Minister on Monday, who said he
hopes that China will not veto a UN resolution on sending peace
observers to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan government should not expect co-operation from
China at the UN Security Council when it blatantly goes against
the basic principles and aims of the UN Charter and when its
actions are detrimental to China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported the peace process in Guatemala and
expresses its welcome to the peace agreement reached by the two
parties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan government's actions, which are in violation
of the UN Charter and UN resolution No.2758, have seriously hurt
the national feelings of the Chinese people and undermined the
political basis for co-operation between the two countries at the
United Nations," Shen said.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China has closed 81.2 percent of
its small factories with serious pollution problems, according to
the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the State Bureau of Environment Protection
show that the 57,430 factories that were closed include small

Twelve provinces and municipalities that have closed their
polluting factories are now trying to find ways of preventing
the closed factories from resuming production, said an official
with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and northwest
China's Shanxi Province have taken the lead in these actions, with

<HEADLINE> China's Gold Output Tops 120 Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's gold output reached
120.6 tons in 1996, up 11.8 percent from the previous year, having
overfulfilled the state production plan of 92-95 tons for the year.
</P>
<P>
Ai Dacheng, Deputy Director of the Gold Administration under
the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry (MMI), said at a press
conference here today that last year's gold output was 6.1 times
and 2.4 times that in 1978 and 1988, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 108 tons of gold in 1995, marking the first
time that the country's annual gold output exceeded 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiao Zhi, Director of the Gold Administration,
China has a verified gold reserve of 4,500 tons, 1,100 tons of
which are gold mines associated with other non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the existing gold reserve is far from
enough to meet the fast-growing gold industry and the national
economy. Therefore, great efforts should be made to find more gold
mines.
</P>
<P>
Jiao said that the central government each year grants 400
million yuan of low-interest loans to support gold mine
prospecting.
</P>
<P>
Except for Shanghai, all Chinese provinces and autonomous
regions have gold resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Ai, 27 out of China's 31 gold-producing provinces,
municipalities, autonomous regions and cities with independent
planning had exceeded the production target of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, the leading gold producer in the country, turned out
29 tons of gold last year, up 13.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Regarding overseas investment in the country's gold industry,
Jiao Zhi said that so far, no overseas funds have entered into the
sector, but some overseas-funded projects are being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
China plans to turn out 150 tons of gold in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hebei to Use More Overseas Fund in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is expected to utilize 2.2 billion US dollars of overseas
funds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government says that all trades, regions and
departments in Hebei will be open to overseas funds, except those
monopolized by the government.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Hebei utilized two billion US dollars of overseas
funding, with 500 million US dollars in loans and 1.5 billion US
dollars in investment, up 27 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Provincial Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, has stressed that all departments should
make efforts to attract overseas funding, including World Bank
loans, commercial loans and free economic aid. He said cooperation
can also be expanded into the fields of culture, sports, tourism
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Hebei was one of the first 14 provinces to open to the outside
world. Cheng pointed out that, however, Hebei's extent of opening
was far from enough for such an economically large province.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the province will continue to organize activities in
Hong Kong, Shijiazhuang and Xiamen to attract domestic and
overseas investments. The provincial government will also make
efforts to find diversified ways of attracting overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
The province will make public a list of projects costing over
ten million US dollars each for cooperation, and ensure the
projects receive a good service. About 100 state-owned enterprises
will utilize overseas funds to reform themselves in the next three
years.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Unhappy Over Punk Culture Among Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today expressed his unhappiness over the spread
of punk culture by the West among the Malaysian youth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students of the Malaysia North University in Sintok
near Alor Star, some 460 kilometers north of here, he said he was
amazed how this negative culture could be taken up by these youths
who at the same time ignored many virtues in life.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as
asking what was the use of the punk culture which he said
advocates violence and unhealthy behavior and "where is the beauty
in nice hair being glued together."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir advised people specially students to have a high level
of self-discipline in their daily life and in pursuing knowledge
and carrying out their duties.
</P>
<P>
Only with a high level of discipline could a person achieve
success in his various endeavors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Students should ponder over their main aim of entering
university and not look upon campus life as a period to just enjoy
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also wanted students and other people in the
country to enhance their management skills which are important for
the country to realize its vision of becoming a developed nation
by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's successes could be attributed to efficient
management and this has placed Malaysia among the most successful
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Unified Seed Supply Play Big Role in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The unified supply of improved
seed strains has proved to be an important factor in the good
harvest of farm produce in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 80 percent of seeds planted in Shandong were
provided by local seed companies. Nearly 95 percent of land for
grain, cotton and vegetable production was sown with improved
seeds.
</P>
<P>
Experiments have shown that replacing a single seed generation
would raise the output by at least 10 percent. The practice helps
to prevent seed degeneration and a decline in production,
according to a local agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Shandong has spent 54 million yuan to
research, develop and popularize improved seed strains. It has
built 20 seed production bases which offer 1.5 billion kg of
improved seed in five categories.
</P>
<P>
Seed improvement will continue to be a key element in achieving
the goal of raising the annual grain output to 45 billion kg by
the year 2000, set by the provincial government, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming four years, the province plans to develop 50
high-yielding seed strains, which are expected to raise the unit
grain output by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The role played by agro-science in agricultural production will
rise to 50 percent by the end of this century, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Restates Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today reaffirmed Moscow's opposition to the planned
eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), demanding a voice in the alliance's decision-making
concerning Russia's "vital interests."
</P>
<P>
Outlining Russia's foreign policy in 1997, Primakov said that
Moscow would welcome NATO's offer of a new relationship between
them if the Western military alliance proves its willingness to
take into account Russia's concerns.
</P>
<P>
He said the major indicator of NATO's "seriousness of
intentions" is whether it agrees adjustments to the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), which sets limits of Soviet
weapons in Europe, and whether it consults with Russia on
important issues.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to reach agreement on the modernization of
CFE ... and to create a mechanism for making joint decisions with
NATO concerning Russia's vital interests and other issues, we will
sign the appropriate document (on a special relationship),"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Itar-Tass news agency at the
end of his first year in office, the minister called on NATO to
step up efforts to build a special relationship with Moscow, which
NATO proposed in a December meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Officially the talks on this issue (working out a document on
special relations) have not started yet," he said. "They are steps
in the right direction, but they are partial and insufficient."
</P>
<P>
Russia considered NATO's plan to take in eastern and central
European countries, which possibly means nuclear deployment on
Russia's border, a serious threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that NATO is likely to invite some of the 11
applicants for joining the bloc to participate the NATO summit in
June. Among the favorite candidates are Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Moscow has no right to veto NATO's expansion,
Primakov said that "no one, including NATO members, can veto our
right to defend our national interests."
</P>
<P>
He warned that NATO's enlargement will lead to "new divisions
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia will continue to seek favorable external
conditions for democratization and economic reform and to remain
one of the influential centers in the multi-polarized world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Russia's foreign diplomacy in 1996, he said
Russia's effort to reverse its "excessive inclination" towards the
West and to cement ties with Asian neighbors in the past year had
proved successful.
</P>
<P>
Having tremendous interests in Asia, Russia "purposefully and
actively developed political dialog and economic ties with leading
Asian countries," including China, India and Japan, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"Extraordinary progress has been made in Russia's relations
with China," he said, noting that in last year the border issue
overshadowing bilateral relations had been solved for the first
time in history.
</P>
<P>
"We will complete border surveying in 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Russia did not want to revive the ideological
union between the two giants in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians and the Chinese agreed that an equal and trustful
partnership aimed at strategic cooperation in the 21st century
would better serve both countries' interests," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine "Comfort Women" Picket Japanese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of former Philippine
"comfort women," or sex slaves of Japanese soldiers during World
War II, held a protest rally in front of the Japanese Embassy here
today, demanding official compensation and apologies from the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Waving banners and flags and singing songs, about 60 aged women
picketed the Japanese Embassy for about one hour this afternoon.
One of them collapsed on the scene because of sunstroke.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the Japanese parliament adopt a draft
compensation law, which will provide for "individual state
compensation and official apologies" for the "comfort women"
survivors.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their determination not to accept compensation
provided by the private Japanese group Asian Women's Fund (AWF)
and called on the Japanese government to act now because "they are
dying."
</P>
<P>
Police did not intervene in the brief rally, which was jointly
organized by two non-governmental groups, Lila Pilipina and Asian
Women's Human Rights Council.
</P>
<P>
Nelia Sancho, chairwoman of Lila Pilipina, told Xinhua that
today's rally is just the start of a series of actions her group
will organize to keep up pressure on the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
"After we strove for four years, the AWF agreed to come here
next week for fact-finding. But there is still no official
response from the Japanese government," Sancho said.
</P>
<P>
She said five more rallies will be held in front of the
Japanese Embassy by the end of March. The next rally will take
place on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Maloo Sabado, a member of Asian Women's Human Rights Council,
said there were a total of 169 documented Philippine comfort women
during the World War II, but the actual number was much higher.
</P>
<P>
According to Sabado, there are more than 100 comfort women
still alive in the country.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, many women in the Korean Peninsula, China,
the Philippines and some other Asian countries were forced by the
Japanese military to act as "comfort women."
</P>
<P>
After the war, the Japanese government had denied this atrocity
for decades until 1996, but it refused to give individual state
compensation and make official apologies to former comfort women.
A so-called Asian Women's Fund was later created to pay
compensation to former comfort women.

of industrial projects, and increase its industrial output value
by more than 40 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Commercial Town Described in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in east China's
Jiangxi province have found an ancient architectural complex in
the province. They describe it was a commercial town built during
the early and late periods of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Discovered in Egret (Bailu) Village in the Ganxian county, the
streets and buildings remain intact, and are seen as a rare museum
for the study of the ancient commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Located at the foot of a mountain and besides a limpid stream,
the newly-excavated town, in a shape of crescent moon, is one
km long and 0.5 km. wide.
</P>
<P>
Among more than 50 buildings in the town, each has a bright and
spacious hall circled by carved banisters with colorful paintings,
said Zhang Sijie, curator of the county museum.
</P>
<P>
He added that the buildings all have quite different styles of
decorations, such as sculptures of lions, fish and phoenix, as
well as the kylin, a legendary animal.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the complex would benefit the study of
archaeology, classic architecture and art, as well as the
development of villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
The town, after renovation and preservation and protection
work, is also expected to be turned into a new sightseeing spot,
according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Plans to Impose Corporate Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is considering to
introduce corporate taxes by the year of 2000 as part of its
plans to rationalize the state's finances, according to Kuwaiti
financial sources.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Planning Minister Ali Al-Zumai while explaining a
financial program of action said Wednesday that Kuwaiti
government is considering "taxes on profits of companies and
institutions."
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative would be among a series of measures
aimed at streamlining state finances to prevent the state budget
deficit from growing again in the future.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti budget deficit which hugely rose after the Gulf War
was forecast at more than five billion US dollars for 1995-96
fiscal year, but the actual figure has been slashed to a little
more than two billion U.S. dollars due to higher oil prices
since last June.
</P>
<P>
Oil earnings from production of some two million barrels a
day currently account for about 85 percent of the state revenues
of the small oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Kuwaiti five-year plan of 1996-2000 was
aimed at helping the country diversify its financial resources
and increasingly shed the oil dependency.
</P>
<P>
He said customs fees on imported goods and government public
administration services could be raised as new measures to
increase non-oil financial resources.
</P>
<P>
At present, only foreign firms pay taxes in Kuwait, and
Kuwaiti government recently said these taxes would be cut to 30
percent from the current 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the state expenditure, Zumai did not rule out a government
reduction of subsidies on state-run services. mainly the
electricity and telecommunication services which together
account for 40 percent of the government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"The government only needs to rationalize expenditure in
these two sectors," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Kuwait has no plans to impose income tax or
any other form of taxes on individuals before the year of 2000.

<HEADLINE> 350 Cars Stolen In Australia Each Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian cars are stolen at
the rate of 350 a day, worse than the level of vehicle theft in
the United States, Canada and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In preliminary figures from a paper to be issued later this
month, Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology Adam
Graycar said the Australian motor vehicle theft trade was a
billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
"Data shows the figure is around 643 million Australian dollars
(514.4 million U.S. dollars) for the 1995-96 financial year. The
figure did not include indirect costs such as police and court
expenditure, loss of earnings and higher insurance premiums,"
Graycar said.
</P>
<P>
Young males were still the major perpetrators, and most of
these crimes were by amateurs for joy riding.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed the number of cars, station wagons and
four-wheel drives has doubled since 1965 in the country, with 84
percent of households now having at least one vehicle. More than
70 percent of Australians use a car each day, compared with 33
percent who walk, 9 percent who take public transport and two
percent who ride a bike (some people use more than one transport
each day).

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli Soldiers Used As Guinea Pigs in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) has been testing a nerve gas antidote and other drugs on
soldiers for decades, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Army Surgeon General Brig.-Gen. Yehoshua Shemer Wednesday
admitted such a thing, but dismissed charges that the soldiers
are forced to participate in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
Shemer's statement came following a report on the state-run
Israel Radio that soldiers were forced to take drugs in the
1970s and 1980s, some of which were reportedly banned.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the soldiers of the elite Givati Unit have been
involved in the lates experiments and their parents have urged
them to quit, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no secrets here," Shemer told Army Radio, adding
that the drug being tested was Pirsiglobin. "It protects against
the very grave effects of nerve gas. If you take it before being
exposed it neutralizes most of the serious effects of nerve
gas."
</P>
<P>
Shemer argued that the army recruits today are being used in
the medical experiments only on a voluntary basis and soldiers
must sign a waiver to participate.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that any and all medical research in the IDF is
first approved by the Helsinki Commission on Human rights. He
also admitted that there were other experiments being conducted
as well. However, he declined to reveal details.
</P>
<P>
Shemer said the nature of the drug demanded that soldiers be
tested in pressure situations and that recruits presented the
best suitable group.
</P>
<P>
He continued that medical checks were done two months after
the experiments to determine if there were any side effects, but
none were found.
</P>
<P>
"We are six years after the Gulf War. At that time, when we
did not have solutions to the threat (of chemical attack), we
were very severely criticized. It is important for the public to
know that we continue to increase our capability to present a
package of protection that not only protects, but also
neutralizes the threat," Shemer said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto, Hashimoto Will Not Touch Contentious Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who arrived here
today for a three-day visit, are unlikely to raise contentious
issues in their bilateral talks, officials from the Indonesian
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss efforts to maintain and
cement the two countries' bilateral relations rather than
controversial issues, such as Indonesia's national car policy and
human rights in East Timor, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's program on the first day of his first official
visit to Indonesia is primarily ceremonial. This includes a
courtesy call on Soeharto and Vice President Try Sutrisno and a
state banquet to be hosted by Soeharto at the state palace in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks Friday and are
expected to cover domestic, regional and global issues.
</P>
<P>
This is the third leg of Hashimoto's eight-day tour of five
Southeast Asian countries, namely, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Vietnam and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Indonesia's leading trading partner and biggest source
of aid and investment.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment in Indonesia nearly doubled to about 7
billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from 3.8 billion dollars in the
previous year and 53 percent of Japan's vital imports of raw
materials pass through Indonesia's sea lines.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is also Japan's third largest foreign source of oil
and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto will leave for Vietnam Saturday before proceeding to
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Some Beijing Kindergartens Turned into Old Folks Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Several kindergartens in
Beijing's urban areas have been restyled into an old folks home,
and experts here believe that such merging will become a trend in
large Chinese cities in the future.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the four kindergartens on Yongwai Street
in the capital's Chongwen District annually enrolled some 500
children. But in 1996, they only registered a total of 79
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, people over the age of 60 accounted
for 18.3 percent of the street's total population of 80,000. Many
are chronically ill, and do not have family members available to
help with health care.
</P>
<P>
To tackle both problems, residents on Yongwai Street raised
money and transformed three of the kindergartens into a residence
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The new old folks home, which can accommodate 50 people, has
bedrooms, gym facilities, color TVs, sofas and games.
</P>
<P>
The work staff are all women who have been laid-off, who have
prior experience in taking care of the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Rising Tax Revenues from Foreign-Funded Enterprises in Yantai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The steady inflow of overseas
investment in Yantai, a coastal city in east China's Shandong
Province, helped the city lead the province last year to take in
390 million yuan in tax revenues from local foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, Yantai ranked first among the provincial big
cities in its nearly 49 percent growth in tax revenues, 127
million yuan more than in the previous year,
</P>
<P>
Among the total amount, nearly 96 million yuan was retrieved
in the Yantai Development Zone, more than double the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of overseas funds into Yantai began in 1985, when
the city had only eight foreign-financed enterprises, collecting
only 130,000 yuan of taxes from them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 a large amount of overseas investors have rushed
into the city, bringing the number of foreign-funded enterprises
to 3,735.

<HEADLINE> Schools For Poverty-stricken Counties In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1996, every
poverty-stricken county in China's outlying and mountainous areas
had at least one school, thanks to a charity.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Youth Development Fund (CYDF), all 592 of the
poorest counties in China recognized by the central government
have built "Hope Schools", with money donated by people all across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Since "Project Hope" was launched in 1989, money has been
raised by private and institutional donations to help the poor
students return to school.
</P>
<P>
CYDF's Beijing headquarters invested more than 22 million yuan
(2.5 million US dollars) last year in building schools, and its
many branches in different provinces have done all they could to
help.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 16 million square meters of
dilapidated classrooms that are in need of repair, and the money
shortage problem has still not been solved, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticultural Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticultural
earnings are expected to reach 150 million U.S. Dollars in 1997,
up from last year's 100 million U.S. Dollars, economists said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The forecasted growth of the horticultural industry will be
fueled mainly by new export markets being explored by local
producers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Auctions in the Netherlands have been the biggest outlet for
Zimbabwean horticultural products. But the market demand is
changing rapidly in Europe with falling prices and environmental
concerns forcing producers.
</P>
<P>
So far some have successfully diversified exports from the
Dutch auction system to new markets in Japan, Taiwan, Dubai,
Mauritius, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, citrus exports this year are anticipated to be much
higher than the 30,000 ton record last year, mainly due to the
introduction of new high-yield varieties of better quality in
terms of colour, taste and shape.

<HEADLINE> China, Sweden to Boost Parliamentary Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Buhe, vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said in Beijing today that parliamentary exchanges between China
and Sweden will help promote friendship and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a meeting with a Swedish
parliament delegation composed of members of the country's largest
party, the ruling Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Buhe said Sweden was the first western country to establish
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For over
40 years, since the two countries forged official ties, bilateral
relations have greatly advanced, with increasing exchanges between
the two parliaments. He said he hopes such exchanges would further
the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Marianne Carlstroem, head of the delegation, said Sweden is
presently faced with problems similar to China, citing particular
concerns over economic growth and a population problem. She added
that she believes the current visit to China will help deepen
understanding of the country.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting the NPC vice chairman also briefed the
guests on China's economic development, and the NPC's efforts in
setting up the legal framework for a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish delegation arrived in Beijing on January 4 at the
invitation of NPC for a 12-day friendly visit.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Calls for National Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Opposition today
called the coalition government to develop a national population
policy and stated they could contribute to building a responsible
bipartisan population policy.
</P>
<P>
Opposition immigration spokesman Duncan Kerr said in a
statement that on current birth rates and excluding net migration,
Australia population would begin to decline around the year 2036
and continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
He said such a trend, if not checked, would lead to a grim
outlook for jobs and general prosperity.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report issued earlier, the country's
population at the end of 1995 was 18.1 million, and there was a
clear long-term trend declining from current rates of between 1.0
and 1.3 percent annually to between 0.2 to 0.5 percent by 2051.
</P>
<P>
If there was no net gain from overseas migration, the rate of
growth would be even slower. In this case the projected population
could peak at around 20.7 million in the year 2033 and decline to
20.1 million by 2051, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition was not advocating a particular population
target, but urged the government to abandon its current emphasis
on the short-term and not to allow itself to be pushed into a
corner by "ill-informed and narrow-minded people", Kerr alleged.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Jailed in Kuwait Visited by Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanians jailed in
Kuwaiti prisons since the Gulf War in 1991 met their relatives on
January 6-8, a statement issued by the Kuwaiti-based
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "34 Jordanian citizens imprisoned in Kuwait
after the Gulf War met their family members between January 6 and
8 through an ICRC-organized humanitarian operation."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Interior Ministry sources said the visit, the third
time by the relatives of the prisoners, was made possible through
intensive cooperation and coordination between the two countries'
ministries of interior and foreign affairs and was financed by
the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti state security court sentenced dozens of Jordanians,
Palestinians and others to long imprisonment on charges of
assisting Iraqi troops during Iraq's seven-month occupation of
Kuwait in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Strained relations between the two countries caused by
Jordan's support for Iraq during the Gulf War have shown signs of
ease since 1996 as contacts and exchange of letters were made
between their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah has voiced hope that 1997 would see
reconciliation of relations between Kuwait and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti sources said that the new visit is also an
evidence that Kuwait is keen in consolidating humanitarian
treatment with prisoners.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 61 out of the 71
man-made dams in Arusha Region, northern Tanzania, have dried up
for lack of rains between last October and January this year.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel Njoolay, said on
Wednesday that Monduli District was most seriously hit.
</P>
<P>
He explained that usually the region received rains between
October and January, but this time, a
number of districts received little rain or no rain at all.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay gave an example of Arkatan village in Monduli District
as a drought-hit area where villagers were compelled to buy a
20-litre tin of water for domestic use at the price of 300
Tanzania Shillings (about 0.5 U.S. Dollar).
</P>
<P>
He cited Babat District as the second drought-hit area where
all dams have dried up. Other districts with more or less similar
problems include Mbulu, Karatu, Ngorongoro and Arumeru in

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Landlocked Shaanxi Province in
northwestern China is putting wireless telecommunications at the
top of its list of information projects, and will develop an
advanced wireless communications network by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's "China Electronics News," the province
will have two expansion projects for its satellite telecom network
by the year 2000, and double 1995's business figure.
</P>
<P>
The three wireless telecom channels now in use will be expanded
to eight, and the business volume will increase by seven times by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the provincial capital, will become a hub for China's
longest SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) digital microwave
trunk, which connects the provincial capitals Wuhan and Lanzhou.
The trunk will form a high-speed information corridor east and
west together with the Jinan-Taiyuan-Chengdu microwave line, which
also crosses Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that a sophisticated communications network will
take shape in Shaanxi by the end of 1997, combining such new
technology as optical fiber, satellite, microwave, and emergency
telecommunication technology into a unified province-wide web.

<HEADLINE> Some 800 Relics Salvaged from Famous Sunken Warship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 relics including
shells, rifles, stationery, and private seals have been salvaged
from a famous warship sunk in the Yangtze River by Japanese
military aircraft 58 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Among the more valuable items, according to experts, is a
copper plate bearing the inscription "Zhungshan Cruiser," used for
identification of the ship, which was named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen
(Zhungshan), the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions such as "Do not fear death and do not covet money"
were found on the rifles.
</P>
<P>
The relics were discovered when divers were clearing away sand
and mud in the cruiser to assist the salvage work. More than 1,100
work hours were spent to remove over 1,000 tons of sand and mud in
the ship.
</P>
<P>
The divers are now trying to place 20 steel cables under the
sunken cruiser to form a steel net so that the shop can be lifted
out of the water intact.
</P>
<P>
The salvage project, drawing an investment of some 100 million
yuan, began on November 12.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
Wednesday night rejected the Iraqi allegation that Iran was
involved in a blast in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the official
news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted a spokesman of the ministry as saying "such
baseless charges are merely aimed at distracting the public
opinion from Iraq's internal problems."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad blamed Iran for a bombing near the headquarters of the
anti-government organization of Iran -- People's Mujahedeen
Organization (PMO) -- in central Baghdad Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesman said that
linking internal problems and impotencies to foreign elements was
an "old useless and tired propaganda attempt."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iranian Law Enforcement Forces killed two
PMO members and arrested two others in recent clashes in western
Iranian border region.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMO staged a series of bombing around the country
during the fourth parliamentary elections. Tehran government
reacted by staging an air raid on PMO base inside the Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
Massoud Rajavi is PMO's leader who lives in Iraq at the
moment. There are reportedly about 20,000 anti-government forces
in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Megawati-led PDI Not Allowed to Campaign for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not allow Megawati Soeharnopuri's faction in the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) to stage election campaigns on its own
behalf, Home Affairs Ministry Spokesman Hsa. Yussac said.
</P>
<P>
"The government's stand has since the beginning been clear that
only the PDI under the party leadership elected at the Medan
Congress will be permitted to organize election campaign," he said
Wednesday in Yogyakarta, Central Java, reports reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
A government-backed PDI congress was held in Medan, North
Sumatra, last June. At the congress, Soerjadi, a veteran party
member, was elected party chairman to replace Megawati who gains
strong support from most of the party members.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, however, has refused to accept the congress's outcome
claiming that the congress had been held in violation of party
rules.
</P>
<P>
Yussac said any request from Megawati's camp to be permitted to
hold an election campaign would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian people are expected to hold a general election
on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the internal frictions in the PDI, Yussac said the
government was quite aware of them. "The government knows there
are still problems within the PDI but they are the party's
internal affairs and the government hopes the conflicting sides
will eventually reunite," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three officially-recognized parties, the ruling Golkar,
PDI and the United Development Party (PPP), will compete in the
forthcoming elections for 425 seats in the parliament.
Seventy-five other seats are to be filled by members of the
Indonesian Armed Forces appointed by the president. The armed
forces do not cast votes in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has won each of the five general elections held in the
country since 1971.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find 890-year-old Buddist Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Seven ancient grottoes and a
number of Buddist statues have been found in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region along the route of the famous Silk
Road.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that the grottoes were created on a rock
hill 890 years ago in the Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The biggest cave is 6.3 meters wide and 10 meters long, and
contains more than 10 Buddist niches. However the Buddist statues
that would have originally been placed in them are missing.
</P>
<P>
There was a 30-centimeter-high Buddist statue above the cave,
which was surrounded by 42 smaller statues.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have found a number of statues in another two of
the caves, but the rest were empty.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes, though not as grand and famous as those at
Yungang and Longmen, are still significant for the study of
ancient politics and culture, as well as the myths of the famous
Silk Road, a trade route linking China with central Asia,
archeologists said.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Firms Go in for Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lianfa Industrial
Corporation in Central China's Henan province has signed a
contract to manage 6,600 hectares of grain farmland in the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
It is another big step by the company towards farmland
activity, following breeding of smaller animals.
</P>
<P>
By entering the agricultural sector, Lianfa has developed in
three years into a large firm with assets of 100 million yuan,
from its initial one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The firm is now listed seventh in the province's 50 top
agricultural companies.
</P>
<P>
Lianfa is not the only example of industrial and commercial
firms to launch themselves into farmland industries in Henan, a
major grain producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
More firms than ever are casting their eyes on farming
businesses as a means of seeking high returns.
</P>
<P>
The province has also given full support to firms moving into
farming. It plans to provide 100 million yuan in loans to 50 firms
engaged in farming and agricultural products processing this year.
</P>
<P>
The local government noted that the industrial firms will bring
with them more funds, advanced techniques and management expertise
to farming, helping to promote the rapid development of
agriculture. In return, they will enjoy high profits from
large-scale farming production.
</P>
<P>
Lianfa has invested more than two million yuan in
buying advanced large agricultural machinery and building water
conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
With the efforts, the company's farmland is likely to yield
more grain, and this is expected to provide the firm with a
investment return as high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developing large-scale farm production, some
firms have put their money into barren mountains and wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some agricultural products processing firms
extending their processing capacity, have begun to stablize their
supply of raw materials by setting up their own raw material
bases. Farmland has become the "first workshop" of the companies.
</P>
<P>
Luoyang Chundu Group, with its brand product of "Chundu"
sausage, has launched an animal husbandry project. According to
the plan the suburb areas of Luoyang city will provide the group
with more than five million pigs a year by 2000.

SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Hi-tech industries in Shanghai
developed rapidly in 1996, with total output topping 50 billion
yuan, a 6.4 billion yuan increase over the previous year,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the hi-tech sector made up 12 percent of the city's

</P>
<P>
Among the hi-tech companies, Sino-foreign joint ventures and
solely-foreign-funded firms experienced a fast development in
1996, with their total production making up 42 per cent of the
sector.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army repulses Tamil Rebels Attack In North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
today successfully repulsed a heavy attack by the Tamil rebels in
the Northern province of the island country, Defense Ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that early this morning at 04:00, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels launched a heavy
attack on task force 2 area at Elephant Pass and Paranthan Army
camps.
</P>
<P>
The raid was successfully repulsed by the government troops,
the sources said, adding that the LTTE is withdrawing its cadres
now, by boat and land towards the East.
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, over 1,000 rebel cadres had
besieged the Paranthan Camp and they had broken through the
forward defense lines of the camp. The rebels were later driven
out of the camp perimeter.
</P>
<P>
Paranthan Camp is one of several small camps in the narrow
stretch of territory now held by the government troops stretching
from the major Elephant Pass base, the gateway to Jaffna Peninsula
which is heavily protected by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the LTTE rebels who have been fighting
for a separate Tamil state since 1983, suffered severe reversals
with their heartland Jaffna Peninsula recaptured by government
troops and they themselves forced to retreat into Jungle hideouts
in the north and east.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Against Arms Build-Up in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has warned against an arms
build-up by Greek Cypriots on the Mediterranean island, saying
that it would lead to a disaster, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News, in a story carried today, voiced
its opposition to military confrontation in the island and termed
surface-to-air missiles to be purchased from Russia as "suicide
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Daily New quoted a military source, who asked not to be named,
as saying that in event of an all-out military confrontation, the
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, which Greek Cypriots are to buy from
Russia, would be disastrous for the small Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, however, can not change the military balance
on the divided island, and the Turkish troops still have the
power to defend the north part of Cyprus, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been rapidly increasing in Cyprus after Greek
Cypriots singed a contract with Russia Saturday to buy the
offensive surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkey government claimed that it would take
necessary actions if the situation in Cyprus continued to
deteriorate, reiterating that Turkish troops were strong enough to
protect Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicolas Burns Monday criticized
Greek Cypriots for purchasing the missiles from Russia, saying it
would only serve to complicate the efforts aimed to achieve a
lasting peace in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
But Greek Cypriots rejected the criticism of the
U.S. government and stressed its purchase of missiles from
Russian was completely for defense purpose.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974 when the
Turkish troops landed on the island and took control of the
northern part following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices Drop in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Shell Uganda, the leading oil
products dealer in the country, cut petrol and kerosene prices on
Wednesday, the local newspaper "The People" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The petrol price fell by 11 cents to about one U.S. Dollar per
liter, the first time that petrol prices have been cut since last
August in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The petrol prices rose in the country in August last
year and went up successively in October and November.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the price cut is that Uganda's local currency
Shilling has since last November appreciated against the U.S.
Dollar, ending a steady trend of depreciation since July last
year.

<HEADLINE> Football Hits Saves Student's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A freak football accident has
saved the life of a Chinese teenager in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
High school student Wu Xinhui was rushed to hospital in severe
pain after a football struck him in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
When doctors operated on the 17 year old, they discovered two
life-threatening tumors - both fist sized - on his liver.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons have now removed the tumors and Wu is out out of
hospital and is in good health after intensive medical care in
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xinhui, a high school student from Guandong's Shixin county,
was playing in a football game last April when suddenly the
football hit him in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
Wu fainted with the pain, and when he was rushed to a nearby
hospital, where doctors gave him a medical check by cutting open
his stomach. They found there two fist-sized tumors on his liver,
and they were broken and bleeding after the accident.
</P>
<P>
Wu was unaware that he had the liver tumors. As the tumors were
too large, and located right in the center of the liver, the
doctors decided not to risk operating on them. Instead they
carried out some repair work and tried to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Later Wu had another operation, but it was not successful.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago Wu turned to the South Hospital, and doctors
there found the tumors had caused pathological changes to his
liver, and if they could not be removed in time it would endanger
Wu's life.
</P>
<P>
After careful preparation, doctors successfully cut off the
tumors and the post-operative medical care helped Wu resume his
good health within two weeks. Now Wu is healthy again.

<HEADLINE> Solar Breakthrough Can End Highway Ice Age Misery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Treacherous ice-covered highways
could become a thing of the past following the invention in China
of a highway material that stores solar heat.
</P>
<P>
Its use will melt snow, avoiding the trail of death and
destruction caused by freezing road conditions.
</P>
<P>
The wonder material can also be used in the construction of
airport runways. It will also be useful in house construction -
averting the need for any heating during traditionally cold winter
months.
</P>
<P>
The scientists in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region
have developed the new material which is able to efficiently
absorb and store solar energy.
</P>
<P>
They say their solar heat storage material can be used to build
highways and airport runways of the future, according to Xing
Dengqing, a senior engineer at the Tibet Solar Energy Research and
Test Center.
</P>
<P>
He said the material is made from mirabilite - a type of salt -
and borax, which are abundant in Tibet's salty lakes, together
with some other additives.
</P>
<P>
Its performance tops other materials of a similar kind in the
world and can be used for 15 to 20 years. Some similar materials
developed by foreign scientists can only last for about ten years,
Xing said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its application in road construction, the
material has broader possibilities, the senior engineer said. It
can make light and warm clothes, and prevent freezing on major
highways, airplane runways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
It can also be used to make curtains and used together with
asphalt concrete for housing materials, with the houses built in
this way needing no heating facility in winter.
</P>
<P>
The invention will be very promising in Tibet where other forms
of energy are lacking, Xing said.

<HEADLINE> Slowing Price Increases in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, east China's booming
city, saw price increases slow down in 1996, according to the
lastest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Municipal Bureau of Commodity Prices
show that the price increase range last year fell by eight
percentage points over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and the price index of consumer goods
rose by five percent and nine percent in the whole of 1996,
respectively, far below the planned targets set by the government.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices remained stable after May 1996 thanks to
sufficient supplies on the market. The prices of vegetables,
sugar, wine, fruit and household electric appliances even fell
to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
Although the state readjusted the prices of crude oil and mail
services in the fourth quarter of last year, the impact was not
strong.
</P>
<P>
Prices currently controlled by the government account for
less than five percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
To sustain the slowdown of price increases, Pan Jianxin, vice
director of the Municipal Bureau of Commodity Prices, pledged to
crack down on the practice of forcing up prices, and price
cheating.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sends Back Home 135,000 Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 135,000 illegal
immigrants were sent back home in 1996, the South African
Department of Home Affairs said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
From January to November last year, 135,408 illegal immigrants,
including more than 113,000 Mozambicans, were repatriated to their
home country, a Johannesburg-based daily "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
These aliens also included 13,667 Zimbabweans, 3,117 Basothos,
1,853 Malawians, 1,424 Swazis and people from another 61
countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Paul Alfred, Head Inspector of the Durban Border Policing and
Internal Tracing Unit, said they had their hands full during the past
year, with the arrests of 301 illegal immigrants without proper
documentation, 111 with fraudulent or expired documents, while another
16 people were caught for illegally assisting aliens by providing
employment or accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alfred said most illegal immigrants gained entry by
sneaking past border posts which were usually situated in areas
surrounded by dense bush or by entering with a visitor's permit and
then overstaying their visit.
</P>
<P>
Although the exact number of aliens currently living in South
Africa is available, the Department of Home Affairs put it
between 3.2 million and 5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of a cabinet decision early last year, South
Africa allowed, under certain conditions, the aliens from the Southern
African Development Community countries to apply for permament
residence in the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Preventing Prawns from Getting Epidemic Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- New technology developed in
China has prevented prawns from contracting a deadly viral
epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
The method has now passed a joint assessment by the Hebei
Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Provincial
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed after years of research by
Professor Wang Anli from the Biology Department of Hebei
University.
</P>
<P>
Viral epidemic disease in prawns spreads rapidly and causes a
high death toll. It is one of the key problems in the artificial
breeding of prawns.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the epidemic disease of the prawns in China
has resulted in over 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in
direct economic losses each year.
</P>
<P>
Wang developed an agent for enhancing the immunity of the
prawns, placing it in prawn ponds during different periods of
prawn breeding.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested environmental improvement of prawn ponds in
an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues applied the new technology in 266
hectares of prawn ponds along the coast of Tangshan City in the
past few years, and prawns in the experimental ponds survived
after the spread of epidemic diseases. Most of the prawns in other
(untreated) ponds died from the diseases.
</P>
<P>
And 1,500 kilograms of quality prawns were collected per
hectare after the application of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Wang carried out experiments in 3,333 hectares of ponds
in Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong provinces, with his new technology
also proving to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Prawn breeding experts have suggested the application of the
new technology nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Youths Join in Fight Against Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian youths have organized to
join the national fight against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
An organization named "Youth Movement Against Drug Abuse"
(YOMADA) has been set up on the initiative of Lusaka school
leavers to supplement the State Drug Enforcement Commission
(DEC).
</P>
<P>
YOMADA's objectives will involve awareness campaigns on the
danger of drug abuse through the use of brochures, school lectures
and drama. It will hold seminars all over Zambia to sensitize
the youths on the adverse effects of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"While the DEC has done a commendable job in fighting the drug
abuse, there is still need to supplement their efforts through a
grassroot organization like YOMADA," said Malimba Muwela,
chairman of the youth organisation.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is getting rampant in Zambia. It reached pandemic
levels in 1996 in the country.
</P>
<P>
The DEC has intensified its action against drug trafficking

<HEADLINE> Beijing Unemployment Rate Under One Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in China's capital
been kept at under one percent for the 11th successive
year. Economists say that Beijing has done a marvelous job in
keeping down its jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
The level is counted in fractions, even though 100,000 job-
hunters swell the ranks of the city's labor force each year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 200 employment agencies, 100
occupation training centers and dozens of labor dispute
arbitration institutes.
</P>
<P>
The occupation introduction, employment training, unemployment
insurance and labor service companies, have been the four pillars
serving the local labor market, creating an orderly system.
</P>
<P>
A new unemployment insurance system guarantees 189 yuan (about
22.7 US dollars) in relief per month for each laid-off worker in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that the number of people in the local labor
market is greater than the number of jobs available. And there
were 205,300 people who registered for jobs at employment agencies
in the third quarter of 1996, with only 149,000 openings available
in 6,830 companies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels are doing their utmost to ensure jobs
for laid-offs, and to help jobless people maintain their minimum
living standard.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Soldier Killed, 8 Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- One Isralei soldier was
killed and eight others wounded in a day of fierce fighting
in south Lebanon that lasted into late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the second time in the past two months, at
least one Katyusha rocket landed in western Galilee of
northern Israel, though no damage or casualty was caused.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday evening, an Israeli squad on ambush duty came
under fire from a group of Hezbullah gunmen in Shomriya
region of the central sector of the Israeli self-claimed
security zone. One soldier was killed and five others wounded
in the close-range encounter, it was not clear whether there
were casualties on the Hezbullah side.
</P>
<P>
Israeli gunners pounded Hezbullah targets in exchanges that
continued for several hours, with Hezbullah gunmen also shelling
Israeli troop positions in the eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
After the katyusha rocket attack, Israeli warplanes struck at
Hezbullah targets north of the zone. An Israeli army spoeksman
said that the pilots reported accurate hits of the targets.
But Hezbullah denied responsibility for launching the Katyusha
attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, three Israeli soldiers were wounded after
one of them stepped on a mine near Soujud in the
northeastern sector of the zone. The soldier who detonated the
anti-personnel mine lost a foot in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched retaliatory attacks against Hezbullah
targets after the incident, while Hezbullah returned mortars at
Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
Amiram Levine, Israeli army's northern commander, issued a
stern warning Wednesday night to Hezbullah that it was
"walking a tightrope" and would lead to a heavy Israeli
response to its recent escalation in hostilities.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Hezbullah for violating the ceasefire understandings
reached after April's Grapes of Wrath operation by firing from
villages.
</P>
<P>
Livine said that there was a limit to Israel's restraint
and it might prove necessary to hit back harder to cease
the firing. And in that case, Hezbullah should be held
solely responsible for bringing the fighting into civilian
areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Intensify Investment Campaign in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is planning to initiate
an investment campaign in 1997 to draw fresh incentives for its
national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that from January to October last year, 920
million U.S. Dollars had been invested in the country, creating
9,038 jobs and representing a significant growth over the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1997 poses very good prospects for investment.
However, our ability to attract investment will be underpinned by
the promotional activities that we will undertake," said Nicholas
Ncube, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Investment Center,
</P>
<P>
Ncube urged the government to expedite the launch of the
second phase of the economic reform program to boost investor
confidence and set the pace for economic development as the
country moves towards the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government is campaigning to improve
investors' confidence and to lower high interest rates which were
considered major barriers to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Further liberalisation of exchange controls, an improvement in
the telecommunication services and macro-economic stability would
also enhance the country's investment campaigns, he noted.

<HEADLINE> More Help For Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China has issued more
funds to aid poor college and university students who excel,
today's China Youth Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the 400,000-yuan stipend has gone to
outstanding students majoring in agriculture, forestry, water
conservancy, geology and mining, oil and gas, as well as coal,
metallurgy and mapping.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China
launched the move together with the All-China Students'
Federation, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It was hailed by students with financial difficulties, the
paper quoted Han Huipeng, deputy director of the Education
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that among the total college enrollments, poor
students account for an average 20 percent, including seven
percent with great financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of poor students in some colleges attached to the
Ministry of the Coal Industry and the Ministry of Forestry
respectively were 30 percent and 10 percent, and 17.8 percent in
agriculture-related colleges.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the first segment of a 1.2 million yuan
fund was issued to poor students in 29 higher learning
institutions in the 11 provinces last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China Securities Regulatory
Commission will soon start to handle applications for business in
shares for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to get required material ready if securities
businesses, either domestic or foreign, wish to receive an
admission approval," said a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
According to a set of rules issued in mid-December, securities
institutions, both inside and outside China, will need to acquire
an official permit in order to remain in the securities business
to deal in shares for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the brokerage business of such shares, overseas
securities companies need to have a minimum asset value of 50
million yuan, an official guarantee by their own government, at
least two years of experience in foreign securities business,
efficient management personnel, and a good record in abiding by
the law, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Application forms are available for domestic securities
companies in local offices of the commission, while overseas
companies need to acquire them directly from the commission's head
office in Beijing.

So far 2,911 Zaireans have fled mainly from the towns of
Uvira, Yungu, Fizi and Malindi in eastern Zaire, arriving by
UNHCR boats to Kibirizi Port although some found their own way
through Lake Tanganyika by illegal means.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Has Most Urban Phone Users in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital registered
450,000 more urban telephone users in 1996, bringing the total
number to 1.95 million.
</P>
<P>
There are now 29 telephones for every 100 people in Beijing,
and among the urban city dwellers the figure is 42 per 100, ranking
in first place among Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Officials are predicting that every household in Beijing is
expected to have phone access by the year 2000. If every household
has at least one phone, there will be 42 phones for every 100
people, and in the urban districts the figure will reach 62, with
local switchboards having a handling capacity of 70 million lines.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to poor services in the telephone sector, the city
has vowed to improve its image by cutting the phone installation
time to within three months for urban users and 45 days for
suburban users.
</P>
<P>
If telephone applicants hand over installation fees, but
cannot get phone access for six months, the applicant will be
exempted from routine service charges for one month.
</P>
<P>
Private phones now account for 71.3 percent of the total figure
in China. About half of households in China's largest metropolis
of Shanghai have phones.
</P>
<P>
China readjusted rates for its telephone services last
December, with charges reduced for international phone calls, and
costs increased for calls within cities.
</P>
<P>
The country added 15 million lines to its telephone switching
capacity in 1996, bringing the total to 100 million lines.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Inject Funds into Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry is to
start injecting 70 billion baht (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) into
the ailing property sector this month to boost market and
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, a 50-billion-baht (2 billion dollar)
resolution trust fund will be established to help projects with
liquidity problems, according to Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan,
who is also a deputy prime minister in charge of financial
matters.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the fund was one of the four measures
adopted Wednesday at a joint meeting of the Finance Ministry, the
Bank of Thailand, the Government Savings Bank and the Government
Housing Bank.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies, commercial banks and the Bank of Thailand
will contribute jointly to the fund to buy such projects.
</P>
<P>
The measure also aims to lift foreign investor confidence in
local financial institutes and reduce non-performing loans
extended to developers.
</P>
<P>
The assistance, which will initially last for one year, will be
extended only to projects with liquidity problems but with growth
potential. Those that appear doomed will not enjoy the privilege.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the resolution trust fund, the Government
Housing Bank, the Government Savings Bank and the Bank of Thailand
will establish a 20-billion-baht (800 million dollar) fund to
extend low-interest loans to government and state enterprise
officials to buy their first homes.
This measure is aimed at absorbing excess housing.
</P>
<P>
The third measure is the formation of a secondary mortgage
corporation to further boost liquidity in the property sector,
which has been sluggish for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, land or house used as collateral for loans
for housing estates will be allowed to be made into credit
instruments to mobilize funds from the financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, a law will be needed to put this measure into effect
and the process will be time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
As the last measure, the government will support its agencies
and state enterprises to buy completed office buildings and those
due to be completed within this year.
</P>
<P>
This measure will encourage additional demand.
</P>
<P>
The Land Department will be asked to stop issuing new property
licenses.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on foreign ownership of land would also be
relaxed, opening the way for foreign investors to purchase homes
for personal use.
</P>
<P>
A foreigner can now purchase up to one rai (0.16 hectares) of
land, but only with the approval of the Interior Minister.

<HEADLINE> Air Lanka To Seek More Flights To Indian Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Air Lanka, Sri Lanka's national
airline, will seek more flights to Indian cities at civil aviation
talks due later this month, Air Lanka official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Air Lanka will in particular seek
permission to fly to Bangalore and Hyderabad, the cities in south
India where business is booming.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Air Lanka's two flights to New Delhi
every week are doing well as they are the only direct flights
between the two South Asian capitals, Colombo and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka wants now to introduce a third weekly flight to cope
with the rush. As many as 42 ambassadors and high commissioners
based in New Delhi are concurrently accredited to Colombo and
often commute between the two capitals, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka now flies to five Indian cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai
(Bombay), Chennai (Madras), Thiruvananthapuramm (Trivandrum) and
Trichy (Tiruchchitappalli). All flights are reported to be going
full.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Sri Lanka now wants to suggest to the
Indian authorities that the number of seats be increased from
3,500 per week at present to 5,500 on its flights from Colombo to
India and India to Colombo as well.
</P>
<P>
This means that Air Lanka is expecting to fly 286,000
passengers a year from Colombo to India and as many from India to
Sri Lanka, an increase of 64 percent in seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the demand for an increase in seat
capacity indicates that more Sri Lankans and Indians are visiting
each other's countries for business, holidays and pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan businessmen buy Indian goods worth 500 million U.S.
dollars every year. Many of them travel to India on a regular
basis. In the same manner, a large number of Indian businessmen
also travel to Sri Lanka, the sources added.

DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cargo handling at Chittagong Port,
the biggest sea port in Bangladesh, declined for the first time in
four years in 1996 by 12.17 percent, according to Port Authority
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the turn-around of the vessels decreased to
4.69 days in 1996 from 5.07 days in 1995. The handling of vessels
also declined from 1,444 in 1995 to 1,384 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11.077 million tons of import and export cargo were

cargo was handled in 1996, over 1.514 million tons less than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the import of fertilizer, salt, sugar

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Trains carried 942 million
travelers in 1996, a 12.3 percent drop from the previous year,
latest statistics issued by China's Ministry of Railways have
revealed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.62 billion tons of cargo were delivered by railway
transport last year, up 1.4 percent. Statistics show that trains
transported 720 million tons of coal in 1996, 46.6 million tons
more than in 1995. The transport volume of other goods dropped by
23.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the country's transportation market is becoming
fiercer. More travelers are turning from rail to air, bus or
waterways for faster and cheaper services.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicts that 920 million people will travel by
train in 1997, and 1.61 to 1.62 billion tons of cargo will be
moved by rail, bringing the annual revenue from railway transport
to 78.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rail income, however, is still on the rise, due mainly to
increasing numbers of travelers preferring sleeping cars, which
provide a more comfortable service, and also higher charges for
hard seats. Early last year ticket prices for train sleepers were
nearly doubled, and the prices for hard seats were slightly
increased.
</P>
<P>
Rail transport contributed revenues of 75.6 billion yuan last
year, up nearly 20 percent over 1995.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Consumers'
Association and local consumers groups will progress their efforts
to safeguard consumers rights in 1997 by continuing a campaign for

The Chinese consumers' association (CCA) has 2,809 county-level

needed to cope with the problem," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The theme is not just a "propaganda slogan", he said, and

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Jailed Ex-President May Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's former president
Hossain Mohammad Ershad is expected to be set free today after
spending more than 6 years in jail following a bail granted by the
supreme court in the radar purchase case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who took power as president of the military regime in
Bangladesh in 1982, was taken into custody within 6 days after his
forced step-down on December 6, 1990 and implicated in as many as
19 corruption and criminal cases by the previous government of
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
So far, Ershad, the 69 year-old general, was granted bails in
17 cases.
</P>
<P>
"Pending disposal of the appeal, let the accused-petitioner be
released on ad-interim bail to the satisfaction of the deputy
commissioner (of the Dhaka Central Jail)," ordered the full bench
of the supreme court including Chief Justice A.T.M. Afzal while
granting the bail to Ershad in the radar purchase case.
</P>
<P>
Ershad is likely to be freed from prison today on completion of
necessary formalities, his counsel Yousuf Hossain Humayun said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Jatiya (national) Party, of which Ershad has
been the chairman, also confirmed that their leader is likely to
be released in the afternoon around 02:00 PM after his counsel and
his young brother Golam Kadar furnish the bail bonds at the deputy
commissioner's office and the JP is planning a reception for their
chief.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the move to release Ershad has produced
mixed reaction among different political quarters.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition BNP said that there had been a tacit
understanding between the ruling Awami League and the JP since
1982 and charged that the ruling party said many things against
corruption, but they were releasing the corrupt people.
</P>
<P>
Ershad was granted bail as the court deemed it fit and there
was nothing to be surprised about it, General Secretary of the
ruling Awami League Zillur Rahman said, adding that the law would
take its own course and it was the normal practice throughout the
world.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Roving Diplomats for Remote Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai foreign Ministry is
considering to send Bangkok-based officials as roving ambassadors
to remote countries in Africa, South America and the breakaway
republics of the former Soviet Union, instead of opening embassies
there.
</P>
<P>
The idea took shape after the ministry ordered a temporary
closure of the Thai Embassy in Nigeria on November 30 last year
due to safety reasons, according to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Sakthip
Krairiksh said that the unwillingness of officials to be stationed
in these countries also fueled the idea of sending short-term
diplomatic missions to the countries.
</P>
<P>
The missions will be sent twice a year and last a few weeks
each time, Sakthip said, adding that the measure will make the
officials more enthusiastic about their work.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's ambassadors-at-large, directors-general, and
deputy permanent secretaries for foreign affairs who intend to
serve in Bangkok for several years would be eligible for such
missions, Sakthip said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local newspapers said that Thailand has five
embassies in Africa and they are in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Senegal
and South Africa to oversee 50 countries there.
</P>
<P>
In South America, Thailand has three embassies, respectively in
Argentina, Brazil and Chile.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of law suits
involving infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR)
handled by Chinese courts is increasing, a senior judge in charge
of IPR cases told China Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of last year, Chinese courts heard
341 cases concerning copyrights, up 6.2 percent over the same
period of 1995; 493 computer software cases, up 36.9 percent; 251
trademark infringement cases, up 22 percent; and 845 patent
infringement cases, up 14 percent, said Li Guoguang,
vice-president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Some new IPR cases, such as infringement on the use of person's

</P>
<P>
China's judicial protection of IPR has developed rapidly in
recent years. From 1991 to June 1996, the courts handled some

<HEADLINE> Nepali Cabinet Reshuffle Sees Backfire in Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A cabinet reshuffle by Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Wednesday has seen backfire from his
main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's decision to reinstate four resigned ministers from the
National Democratic Party (RPP), the second largest ruling partner
of the coalition government, stunned his NC party colleagues who
earlier asked him not to do so, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In a move to stabilize his three-party government, Deuba
Wednesday reshuffled his cabinet, or council of ministers, to
reinstate several resigned ministers, who last month quit the
cabinet and voted in favor of an opposition-tabled no-confidence
motion against the government in parliament.
</P>
<P>
NC party president Girija Prasad Koirala, who was in the
eastern Nepali city of Biratnagar, Wednesday publicly criticized
the prime minister through telephone after learning about the
cabinet reshuffle, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"I totally disagree with your choices of the ministers. You
will soon face the consequence of this move (reshuffle)," the NC
president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Koirala declined to say whether his party would take
action against Prime Minister Deuba, who is also parliamentary
leader of the NC party.
</P>
<P>
A group of NC MPs early this week warned Deuba against
reinstatement of the resigned RPP ministers, who on Monday
reasserted their support for the government after the
no-confidence motion tabled by the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the main opposition, was
rejected last month by the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The resigned ministers sat on the opposition bench during a
special house session on the no-confidence motion two weeks ago
and voted in favor of the motion.
</P>
<P>
The MPs from Deuba's own party threatened to vote against the
government when it seeks a vote of confidence in parliament later
if Deuba reinstates these "immoral" RPP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's three-party government has been reduced with only
minority parliament support as 101 MPs voted for and 84 MPs
against the opposition-sponsored censure motion in the 205-seat
house last month.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Deuba would seek a vote of confidence for
his government in the upcoming winter session of parliament, which
will probably begin in February, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy experienced a downward
inflation throughout last year, according to figures released
today by Italian statistics institute (Istat).
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 saw an average inflation rate of 3.9 percent: 5.5
percent in January and 2.6 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
But officials of Istat also confirmed the warning of Prime
Minister Romano Prodi who said Tuesday that figures of this
January may not be so good as those of recent months.
</P>
<P>
They attributed this situation largely to technical reasons
seeing that new items for calculating the inflation rate was
introduced, which were expected to push the rate up to 2.7 or 2.8
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
However, Prodi predicted that the figures would once again be
"good" in February.

ULAN BATOR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The population of Mongolia
reached 2.35 million by the end of 1996, 35,800 more than that of
the previous year, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia encourages child birth due to its vast areas, with its
population increasing from 772,400 to 2.15 million between
1950-1990, the peak period of population growth in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate slowed down in recent years because of
the change in people's view on population and their living
standard.

<HEADLINE> Sandinista Warns of Protest in Nicaragua Against Supreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Angered by a Supreme Court
decision of wiping out dozens of laws, Nicaragua's Sandinista
leader Daniel Ortega warned today of protest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, speaking in the final session of the outgoing National
Assembly, said his party would launch even violent protest to
defend the stricken laws.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court overturned by a 9-3 vote Tuesday night all
the bills approved by the Sandinista Front of National Liberation
Party and its allies in the National Assembly since November 22,
including the 1997 budget bill, the tax reform bill and the
procedure bill.
</P>
<P>
The bills were passed during the last session of the outgoing
National Assembly, which were boycotted by legislators who
supported Sandinista's rival Arnoldo Aleman, the president-elected.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who is also the head of the Liberal Alliance coalition,
will be inaugurated Friday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Supreme Court ruling "a coup d'etat", Sandinista
congressman Rafael Solis said the decision will affect the
economic growth in the country, provoke instability and encourage
people to disregard institutions.
</P>
<P>
"It puts the country in a crisis situation with unpredictable
consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, who was president of the Latin American country during
the 1979-1990 Sandinista government, accused the Supreme Court of
conspiring to strike down the laws and "break the constitutional
order" and called for the removal of Supreme Court magistrates.
</P>
<P>
He would not say whether protests were planned for Aleman's
inauguration, which was to be held in Managua's Rigoberto Lopez
Perez Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened around the stadium and some key
plazas and hotels as well.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, former mayor of the country's capital of Managua, takes
power among high hopes and predictions of soaring economic
growth. But tough challenges remain as he has inherited the second
poorest country in Latin American.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Increase Investment in Forestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government
announced today it will increase the investment in forestry to 236
billion pesos (575.6 million U.S. dollars) this year, 34.241
billion pesos (83.5 million dollars) more than that of 1996, to
support this weak sector.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Carlos Mladinic said focus will be placed
on improving and protecting natural resources and updating
technology, with 52.144 billion pesos (127.1 million dollars) and
41.374 billion pesos (100.9 million dollars) allotted to each of
them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 48.071 billion pesos (117.2 million dollars) will
be used in developing water resources and irrigation, and 1.09
billion pesos (2.6 million dollars) in opening up new markets.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the sustained growth of farm exports which in 1996
totaled 2.478 billion dollars, about 18.3 percent over 1995,
Mladinic said, the most dynamic sectors of fruit, vegetable, wine
and dairy helped offset the poor performance of forestry.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Belarus rose 2 percent in 1996 over the previous year,
reversing the downward trend in the past five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
However, the sales issue was not solved as the nation still
overstocked goods valued 10 trillion roubles (about 400 million
U.S. dollars) at the end of 1996, which accounted for 6 percent of
last year's GDP total, according to the Interfax news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Belarus will speed up the privatization of commerce and
tertiary industry in 1997 in a bid to bail out the debt-laden
state-run enterprises, Interfax quoted a ranking government
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country will also promulgate a bankruptcy
law. But the law will not cover large state-run industrial
enterprises at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the large enterprises could extricate themselves from
economic predicament through the establishment of financial and
industrial groups and trans-national corporations, the officials
said.

WELLINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand MetService
has warned that the northern part of North Island will be hit by
18 hours of torrential rain and winds gusting up to 130 km an
hour.
</P>
<P>
It said Cyclone Drena, now passing Norfolk Island east of
Australia, will reach the north of North Island tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
MetService chief forecaster Angie Auger advised campers in the
far north to go home now because Drena has the potential to be
more damaging than that of Cyclone Fergus, which produced heavy
damage to the middle part of North Island at the end of last
month.
</P>
<P>
Drena would bring severe flooding and slips on the main routes
in the north and cause rivers and estuaries there to swell.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, civil defense staff are busy getting ready for the
imminent cyclone. Staff members, the police, and fire and
ambulance services are being supplied with the latest weather
information, TVNZ reported.

<HEADLINE> German Government Cuts Aid to Eastern States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Financial aid to the eastern part
by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany will drop to
178 billion marks (about 115 billion U.S. dollars) this year from
1996's 184 billion marks (119 billion dollars), said a senior
government official.
</P>
<P>
If the money backflow such as tax is deducted, only 130 billion
marks (84 billion dollars) will go to the eastern part, 4 billion
less than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Friedrich Bohl, minister in the Chancellor's Office, said that
this is part of the government's plan to gradually cut and finally
stop aid to the eastern states.
</P>
<P>
Bohl did not say when and by which means should the aid be
stopped, but noted that future aid should be concentrated on basic
infrastructures and some key programs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the government of the Federal Republic of
Germany offers 1,174 billion marks (762 billion dollars) to the
eastern states from 1991 to 1997, or 879 billion marks (566
billion dollars) if tax and management fees are excluded.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Offers New Funds for Farmers in Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has made new
funds available to farmers to clear their debts incurred on the
so-called "unorganized" money market.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned bank for agriculture and agricultural
cooperatives (BAAC) has allocated 2 billion baht (80 million US
dollars) to make loans to farmers over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who have borrowed from local loan sharks or mortgaged
their land with unorganized lending sources can apply for BAAC
loans and can use the proceeds to redeem the mortgaged land.
</P>
<P>
The loans would be for a maximum of 200,000 to 300,000 baht
(8,000 to 12,000 dollars), with 8 percent annual interest and
repayment periods of 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
It is the second attempt by the BAAC to help free farmers from
the grip of the unorganized money market.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, it determined that about 4,500 farmers had this
particular kind of debt problem, and it spent two billion baht to
help them.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Majority Leader Reveals New Congress Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate majority leader
Trent Lott said today that the Congress in its new term will focus
on a Republican 10-bill package, including some 150 billion
U.S. dollars of tax cuts and a balanced budget amendment.
</P>
<P>
The 105th Congress took oath into office Tuesday with a
Republican majority in both the Senate and the House. Republican
Newt Gingrich was re-elected speaker of the House and Lott keeps
the post of the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
The 10-bill package will be introduced the day after President
Bill Clinton's inauguration on January 20, Lott told the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are committed to a balanced budget constitutional
amendment," adding that "I believe we're going to come up with a
balanced budget plan this year that will get us to a balanced
budget over a period of years by the year 2002."
</P>
<P>
Tax cuts, which the Republican Congress and the Democratic
Administration were fighting for in the past years, will be
incorporated into the package, probably including relief for
families with children, reduction of capital gains and estate
taxes, said Lott.
</P>
<P>
"We need still more tax fairness in the tax code... I'd like to
see us obviously cut capital gains tax rates and not just the part
that applies to homes," he said, adding that some 150 billion
dollars' tax cuts over a couple of years could promote growth.
</P>
<P>
Lott said Clinton has made a good start by proposing to
eliminate capital gains taxes on most home sales but "knows he's
going to have to do better than that,"
</P>
<P>
During budget talks early last year, Clinton indicated a
willingness to approve a broader-based capital gains cut as part
of an overall budget deal.
</P>
<P>
Other likely bills are an anti-crime bill providing the death
penalty for so-called drug kingpins, a ban on certain late-term
abortion and permission for companies to offer compensatory time
off instead of paid overtime, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
He also said renewal of the Superfund program to clean up toxic
waste sites and changes in product liability laws would be other
priorities in the new legislative discussions.
</P>
<P>
He added that there could be an early action on giving the
president fast-track authority to negotiate international trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the House on Tuesday, Gingrich also stressed tax-cut
issue, saying, "Whether we go towards a flat tax, or whether we
replace the income tax with a sales tax, or what we do. But to
begin a process that frankly may take four to six years, but is
the right direction for the right reason."

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Industrial Exports Up 0.7 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export value of
industrial goods last year was only 0.7 percent higher than in
1995, falling far short of the 8 percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
The business economics department blamed global economic
slowdown, volatile fluctuations of the dollar and yen and high
production costs for the disappointing export performance.
</P>
<P>
However, the department predicted that exports of Thai
industrial products would grow 10 percent in 1997, from 844
billion baht (33.76 billion US dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The department based brighter prospects for the sector on a
global economic recovery, government initiatives to make Thai
products more competitive, and the fruition of efforts begun in
the third quarter of 1996 to boost the value of exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's overall exports growth in 1996 were expected to be
near zero.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the trade and current account deficit, the Commerce
Ministry is considering restrictions on imports of luxury
products, such as many types of consumer goods and automobiles,
which are not essential and hurt the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also launch 'buy Thai' campaigns to encourage
people to buy Thai products.

<HEADLINE> Poll Sets Fashtion in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Swimming has become one of the
favorite sports in Costa Rica, a soccer-mad country, and that's
mostly because of a tall, slim girl: Claudia Poll.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old freestyler, winner of the women's 200m
freestyle of the Beijing Leg World Cup Short-Course Wednesday,
grabbed the first Olympic gold in Atlanta last summer for her tiny
South American nation, which only has a population of three
million.
</P>
<P>
She won the women's 200 meter freestyle in 1:58.16.
</P>
<P>
"Now In Costa Rica quite lot of young people are interested in
swimming, specially those young ladies, " said Francisco Ricos,
who began to coach Claudia when she was seven.
</P>
<P>
"Swimming has come into fashion in my country and I know that's
due to Claudia," the coach added.
</P>
<P>
Claudia shot to prominence when she shattered the 200m
freestyle world record at the World Short-Course Championships in
Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, in December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Silvia Poll, Claudia's elder sister, is also a swimming star
and favor in Costa Rica, but has never succeeded like Claudia --
an Olympic crown -- before her retirement in two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Silvia, nicknamed Magic girl, clinched a silver medal in the
200m freestyle at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988.
</P>
<P>
For Claudia, swimming has been dominating over her all
things. She could hardly imagine what's her life like without
swimming.
</P>
<P>
"She likes swimming, even crazy about it, and works hard,"
Ricos said.
</P>
<P>
"She began a new training program after winning the Olympic
gold and never kept herself away from training since then. Can you
imagine that?"
</P>
<P>
Beijing is her second major international competition since the
Atlanta Games. She participated the Hong Kong leg World Cup
Short-Course tournament, where she accumulated a total of three
golds and one silver.
</P>
<P>
Claudia also added a silver medal in the 800m freestyle to her
gold Wednesday when she was beaten by a surprising winner Lin
Chi-chan of Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"The long distance event is quite different from the middle
one," Claudia explained.
</P>
<P>
the 200m and 400m are Claudia's strongest events. "She is the
world number one in the two disciplines," her coach said. Anyway,
Ricos was quite satisfied with her timing because she swam her
personal best time in the event.
</P>
<P>
But the confident swimmer wants more.
</P>
<P>
"I always take myslef as the number one opponent. I like to
make challenge to myself," said Claudia, who made entries in total
of four events here.
</P>
<P>
She wants to find out more strong events. The 800m freestyle
was one of those attempts though she has fewer chance than she won
in the 100m.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) --The Sri Lankan government has
called for foreign investment in the country's mineral resources
sector, Industrial Development Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that development of the mineral resources
sector requires large capital investment and involves high risks
and therefore the sector has been dominated by corporate giants
capable of spreading risks over large geographic and commodity
areas.
</P>
<P>
Foreign participation is therefore essential for the
development of mineral-based industries, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Three Japanese firms had shown interest in "quartz" while other
countries such as Norway, Korea, Japan, Australia and the US were
keen on investing in mineral sands, other minerals and salt,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) of Sri Lanka has
made special facilities to meet the needs of investors in the
mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
The services of several World Bank consultants have been
obtained to work with the GSMB on geological exploration as well
as to advise on additional regulations required for the safety of
workers, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Commander Disobeys Order to Return to Barracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tensions increased again in
war-torn Tajikistan Wednesday as a brigade commander of the
country's rapid reaction forces refused to return to barracks as
ordered by the president.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dushanbe, capital of the mountainous
republic, Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev, who led an
anti-government revolt a year ago, ignored a deadline given by
President Imomali Rakhmonov to start pulling out his troops back
to its base in the southern town of Kurgan-Tyubeto by 16:00 local
time (11:00GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The brigadier instead moved his troops and arms towards an
aluminium plant in the town of Tursunzade, some 54 kilometers west
of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Khudoyberdyev's troops clashed with an armed band led
by a local strongman. Khudoyberdyev said his troops had moved to
Tursunzade to disarm the band which had stolen weapons from his
troops.
</P>
<P>
Khudoyberdyev was apparently targeting the aluminium plant in
Tursunzade and the eastern part of the town. The commander
demanded that the administrator of the town be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Tursunzade, which produced some 237,000 tons of aluminium in
1995, has been the site of clashes between armed groups fighting
to control Tajikistan's metal trade.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a reason Khudoyberdyev refused to obey Rakhmonov's
order to withdraw was that the government was slow to investigate
the killing of one of his men late last month.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Azimov has left for
Tursunzade to hold talks with representatives from the concerned
parties.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force stationed there also began mediating
between the parties on Wednesday in an effort to find a peaceful
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government this week has been holding peace talks
with the Islamic opposition in the Iranian capital Tehran. The two
sides have signed several ceasefire agreements since civil war
broke out in 1992, but a lasting peace has never achieved.

<HEADLINE> Aid Scheme Helps Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Living on less than 100 yuan (12
US dollars) each month in Beijing means that finding sufficient
food and proper maintenance can on many occasion create dilemmas
for the very best and brightest students.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, about ten percent of the 3,000 students in the
Beijing Forestry University must manage to survive on that meager
sum, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the poverty line in Beijing soars high about
at 170 yuan (22 US dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, about seven percent of the total three
million college students are trapped by such grinding poverty.
The Chinese Communist Youth League Central Committee estimates the
average student survives on about 120 yuan (14 US dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
The committee yesterday distributed 400,000 yuan (48,000 US
dollars) in relief aid to financially trapped college students in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
About 500 of the poorest students across the country will
receive 800 yuan (96 US dollars) subsidy each, including some from
the Beijing Forestry University. Last year the number was 630 in
29 colleges and universities of 11 provinces and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive year the youth authority has
reached out to help students trapped by insufficient funds and the
high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
This year, the money will go to schools under the ministries of
geology and mineral resources, coal industry, metallurgical
industry and agriculture and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The government and schools try to make sure that not a single
college student drops out of school because of poverty.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that the United States will maintain its effort to
see sanctions remain in force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Congress, covering the period from November
4 up to the present, Clinton said: "Iraq remains a serious threat
to regional peace and stability. I remain determined to see Iraq
comply fully with all of its obligations under U.N. Security
Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to having jets patrol the no-fly zones
over Iraq, the United States will continue to maintain a force in
the Middle East large enough to deter Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under an oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the U.N. in May
last year, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil in every six months.

<HEADLINE> Audio-Video Chain Stores to Be Built in Post Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's first State-owned
audio-video leasing chain store company was established yesterday
in Beijing, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the Ministry of Culture, Zhong You
Audio-Video Leasing Co Ltd was built by the China Audio-Video
Association (CAVA) and the China Post under the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The company will operate chain store rental shops of audio and
video tapes inside urban and rural postal offices nationwide.
Tapes will include Chinese and foreign movies, TV dramas, popular
science and education as well as agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People yesterday,
a government official said it was a wise decision by the
government to curb intellectual property rights (IPR) violations
and combat pornography and other illegal publications.
</P>
<P>
CAVA estimates that at present, there are more than 100,000
audio-video rental locations nationwide, nearly all of which are
privately-operated. Many of them rent pirated and pornographic
tapes.
</P>
<P>
Sources with Zhong You said that they plan to establish 2,000
rental shops in 1997, and gradually set up shops in nearly 61,900
post offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
They said that each rental shop will carry 600 kinds of
audio-video tapes.
</P>
<P>
Annual rental business is estimated to reach at least 230
million yuan (27.7 million US dollars), they said, basing the
estimate on the fact that the rental of each tape will cost two
yuan (24 cents).
</P>
<P>
More than 500 post offices in Liaoning Province and in cities
of Hangzhou, Fuzhou and Nanjing have become the first since last
month to install rental shops on a trial basis.

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Romania will take advantage of
the U.N. "oil for food" resolution to import Iraqi oil and export
Romanian products, the Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen Gilda Lazar said a Romanian delegation will go to
Iraq in February to discuss details of oil imports, while Romanian
companies will, through the country's embassy in Baghdad, discuss
the export of food, medicine and other humanitarian materials to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi economy has been devastated by an international
sanction since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people, the
U.N. Security Council passed a resolution in April last year to
allow Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil half a year
so that it can buy products for everyday use.
</P>
<P>
The resolution went into effect last December.

<HEADLINE> Overheating Threat Still Looms in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (central bank)
Governor J. Soedradjad Djiwandono said the national economy has
started to cool but warned that a relaxed monetary stance could
cause it to overheat again.
</P>
<P>
The governor told an annual bankers dinner here last night that
monetary policy this year would continue to focus on strengthening
internal and external macroeconomics stability.
</P>
<P>
Overheating still overshadowed Indonesia's economy in 1996, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
High imports had worsened deficit of current account, money
supply growth was high and banks have over spent on property and
consumer sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
People should be vigilant on the rising current account
deficit, he said. The deficit, which stood at 8.8 billion US
dollars, is expected to reach 9.8 billion US dollars in 1997/98
fiscal year beginning on April 1.
</P>
<P>
He also warned about the rapid growth of private offshore
borrowing, which constituted almost 50 percent of the country's
outstanding foreign debt of 110 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's debt service ratio -- the ratio of debt servicing
obligations to export revenue -- is 31.7 percent, of which 15.5
percent is contributed by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
An inefficient use of foreign borrowings would only create
future problems given the large foreign debt and high debt service
ratio, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
"Our high priority is to cool down the economic overheating
while avoiding drastic measures that could pose unintended
shocks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, has been trying to maintain a balanced
budget to achieve substantial government saving for repaying
external debt service and funding development.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would maintain a prudent monetary
policy. Inflation rate would be kept at a low rate which in 1996
reached 6.5 percent. The rate in the previous year was 8.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth would remain at over 7 percent in 1997. The
main objective is to keep domestic demand growth in line with
economic capacity, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's economic growth was estimated to be at
7.8 percent.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh Wednesday stressed that deregulation, liberalization

fundamental business philosophy, while foreign investors could
expect more relaxed rules for them.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit unveiled the key elements at a luncheon here when Thai

<P>
Privatization of state enterprises will be accelerated and
foreign investors will be allowed to hold an ownership share of
15-30 percent in state enterprises, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in state enterprises will help cut the
country's current account deficit, he added.

Deputy prime minister Amnuay Virawan echoed the prime
minister's statement that liberalization of all sectors would be
the government's goal over the next two years, according to local

<HEADLINE> Guatemala's Court Appealed to Suspend Amnesty Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Alliance
Against Impunity in Guatemala today presented a legal petition to
the constitutional court for a partial suspension of the National
Reconciliation Bill.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala City, capital of Guatemala, said the
alliance, with the participation of the 1992 Nobel peace
prize-winner Rigoberta Menchu Tum, said that the amnesty bill
violates at least three articles of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The petition was aimed at preventing the ordinary crimes
committed by servicemen and guerrillas from avoiding punishments.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the alliance said the Reconciliation Bill violates
three articles of the constitution, including guarantees for
individual rights, people's access to justice and the duties of
the congress.
</P>
<P>
Hellen Mack, leader of the Mirna Mack Foundation and the
alliance, said the amnesty bill was manipulated to favor
servicemen who are trying to avoid trials for the massacres and
assassination of peasant, leaders of unions and students as well
as other crimes.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal to Make $100 Million Extra Profit in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal will earn
more than 100 million U.S. dollars of extra income from its direct
profits in the year 2000, Panama Canal administrator Alberto
Aleman Zubieta said today.
</P>
<P>
"The canal is in a process of development, expansion and
improvement that will continue until the year 2005," Zubieta said.
</P>
<P>
Increase in toll charges will be the prime source of the extra
income.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the Panama Canal has agreed to
increase toll charges by 8.2 percent this year and by another 7.5
percent in 1998 as part of a two-stage financial restructuring
program.
</P>
<P>
A latest report from the canal authorities showed that income
from the canal in the 1996 fiscal year will amount to 463 million
dollars. And Zubieta also predicted the total income will exceed
500 million dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The administrator said the definitive return of the
transoceanic canal on the part of the United States in accordance
with the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties will also be conducive to
the increase of additional income.
</P>
<P>
"Panama will own 100 percent of the shares of the Panama Canal
in the year 2000, which will benefit the Panamanian economy
directly," he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Dining Places Per Thousand Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Food has become a leading
clarion call in China's reform and opening policy.
</P>
<P>
As the country's rags-to-riches transformation has taken place,
China's food industry has dished up a fast development.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants, fast food outlets and street food stalls provide
almost 2.5 million dining places, and employ over seven million
people.
</P>
<P>
And the food industry's business volume in the first half of
1996 was 87.3 billion yuan (10.5 billion US dollars), according to
the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure registered an increase of 26.3 percent over that of
the same 1995 period, with its growth rate ranking first among the
whole country's businesses.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that by the end of 1995, there were two
dining places for every thousand Chinese people, 1.88 more than
the figure in 1978. The industry yielded a business volume of 158
billion yuan (19 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Food has been one of China's booming industries in recent
years, and by the end of 1995, there were almost 2.5 million
dining places and 7.1 million staff employed, 21.3 and 6.8 times
over the 1978 figures.
</P>
<P>
Among the restaurants and food stalls, over 90 percent are run
by individuals, with fewer than 10 percent state or collectively
owned.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and open-door policy was initiated in 1978,
the Chinese people have developed a special enthusiasm in the
pursuit of delicious and tasty food.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim that as more overseas tourists flock to China,
and local people show greater interest in good food, the Chinese
food industry will enjoy even further development.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Law Released in Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh government today
released the 1997 Budget Law which prescribes a revenue of 177
billion Tenge (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) and a spending of 200
billion Tenge (2.7 billion dollars) for the year.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the state treasury is to make 32.8 billion Tenge
(0.44 billion dollars) in loans, thus registering a budgetary
deficit of 55 billion Tenge (0.74 billion dollars), about 3
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is estimated at
1,740 billion Tenge (23.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that 58 billion Tenge will be used to boost
production of local commodities -- 1.6 times that of last year,
while 165 billion Tenge will go to the national defense and social
security system.
</P>
<P>
However, the law decrees the nation's investment focus will
remain on industries, including metallurgy and exploitation of
oil, natural gas and minerals, on which Kazakh economy depends
heavily.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Budget Law was approved by the Kazakh parliament last
Christmas and signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev on December
31.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has passed two regulations to promote the importance of
environmental protection and encourage local officials to toughen
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
One regulation clarifies the penalties for government officials
who violate environmental protection laws and regulations, "China
Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
Officials can be punished for serious mistakes in comprehensive
policy-making in economic development and environmental
conservation that result in ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
If government officials do not tackle pollution problems in
their jurisdictions within a certain time, or approve projects
that aggravate pollution without authorization, they will face
administrative punishment.
</P>
<P>
If serious pollution problems occur, the responsible official
will face penalties.
</P>
<P>
Legal representatives of enterprises and units in this province
also are subject to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The other regulation concerns regular evaluations of government
official's conservation efforts, according to the Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The evaluations will be used to determine their promotions,
demotions, prizes and penalties.
</P>
<P>
About 1,990 small factories that seriously pollute the
environment were closed in Shandong last year. About 860 factories
must resolve their pollution problems by the end of this year to
clean up major rivers in the province.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Credit Increases in November 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The consumer credit in the
U.S. increased by an annual rate of 7.4 percent last November,
the biggest jump since July, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the consumer borrowing in the U.S. reached
1,190 billion dollars in the month, 7.4 percent higher than the
revised figure of 1,183 billion last October.
</P>
<P>
The revolving credit in the month grew at an annual rate of 8.5
percent to 460 billion dollars. But the biggest gain was in the
miscellaneous categories such as loans for education, travel,
boats or trailers. The consumer credit in this sector rose to
352.8 billion, 12.3 percent more than in October.
</P>
<P>
Car and truck loans increased by a small 1.5 percent to 377.7
billion dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
Consumer borrowing in the U.S. has slowed a bit in the second
half of the year but it seems that the borrowing quickened its
pace at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have worried that many Americans are saddled with
too much debt and will be forced to scale back their spending,
resulting in slower economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Will Build Strong Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State-designate Madeleine Albright, said today that the United
State will be working to "build a strong bilateral relationship
with China" despite the differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at her
confirmation hearing that one of U.S. priorities in Asia is to
"successfully manage our multifaceted relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to expand areas of cooperation, reduce the
potential for misunderstandings, and encourage China's full
emergence as a member of the international community," Albright
said
</P>
<P>
Despite "important differences," she said, "we also have many
interests in common and have worked together on issues, including
the Korean Peninsula, crime, the global environment and nuclear
testing."
</P>
<P>
Albright said she knows U.S. policy towards China has been an
issue of controversy in Congress, "but there should be no doubt
about the importance of this relationship and about the need to
pursue a strategy aimed at Chinese integration, not isolation."
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Albright outlined the Clinton administration's
global strategy, saying the United States will continue to build
"a new framework, adapted to the demands of a new century."
</P>
<P>
In so doing, she said, U.S. armed forces "must remain the
best-led, best-trained, best-equipped, and most respected in the
world." But it also "need first-class diplomacy," she added. She
asked Congress, which forced big cuts in foreign affairs spending
in recent years, to "invest the resources" needed to maintain U.S.
global influence.
</P>
<P>
Albright is the incumbent U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
and was nominated on December 5, 1996, by re-elected President
Bill Clinton to take the place of outgoing Warren Christopher as
the secretary of state. If she is confirmed by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, she will become the first highest ranking
woman ever in any president's administration.
</P>
<P>
The new framework she will try to realize if she becomes the
first woman secretary of state includes "measures to control the
threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, seize the
opportunities that exist for settling dangerous regional
conflicts, maintain America as the hub of an expanding global
economy" and defend Western-style democracy, which is in no way
wholy welcomed around the world.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the center of the framework is to maintain key
alliances and relationships with U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
The Czech-born woman said the United States must be a European
power, and NATO "must keep open the door to membership to every
European nation." She envisaged NATO's expansion this summer when
NATO invites several Eastern European states to begin negotiations
to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
The NATO expansion has met with strong objections from Russia,
which sees the Western move as a new threat to its security after
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Albright disclosed that President Clinton will invite Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to Washington, apparently to try to
alleviate the Russian leader's worries over the expansion.
</P>
<P>
As regards Asia, Albright pledged "U.S. commitment to regional
security" by maintaining military presence in the Western Pacific,
working with its allies, Japan and South Korea, and broadening its
diplomatic and security ties in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
She also promised to devote much of her attention this dynamic
region, which is undergoing breathtaking economic development.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and the Middle East will be on her agenda when Albright
is confirmed to become the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goal in Bosnia, she said, is to continue to implement
the Dayton accords and reduce the need for an international
military presence by establishing a stable military balance.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the Israelis and Palestinians to conclude a
Hebron agreement as it will "lay the basis for future progress
toward a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Appeals for Saving of Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today appealed to the United States, Europe and countries in the
Middle East to put together their efforts to help the Arab-Israeli
peace process go out of its present deadlock.
</P>
<P>
During a traditional new year's meeting with the diplomatic
corpse in Paris, Chirac warned that the current deadlock in the
peace process risks to bring about a renewal of violence in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"In five years, the peace process has seen progress which was
inconceivable not long ago. But these achievements are seriously
threatened today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked Israel to respect its agreements signed with the
Palestinians by the Labor government of Prime Minister Yitzakh
Rabin, such as complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank town of Hebron and the freeze of building new Jewish
settlements on Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
The conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has refused to withdraw troops from Hebron and given the
green light to the building of new settlements, including one in
an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The present impasse risks to conduce to violence, terrorism
and destabilization, which can gain ground little by little," said
Chirac, who promised that France would continue to make its own
efforts in helping push forward the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Heads Team Canada Mission to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Team Canada, led by Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, sets out today on its third trade
mission to Asia, this time to South Korea, the Philippines and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is the largest to date, is made up more
than 350 business executives, nine of the 10 provincial premiers
and the two territory leaders.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials predict that the mission is
expected to generate at least 1.46 billion U.S. dollars in
business during the two-week visit.
</P>
<P>
Chretien has led two Team Canada trade missions to Asia: one to
China in November 1994 and the other to India, Pakistan, Indonesia
and Malaysia in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two missions brought to Canadian companies a total of 259
new business deals, worth an estimated 12.64 billion U.S. dollars,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Canadian business delegation are expected
to complete and sign numerous contracts and agreements, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The current mission marks the first time in three such
missions, dubbed Team Canada by Chretien in 1994, in which the
Quebec premier has participated.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec premier's involvement highlights the growing
importance of the trade missions, a cornerstone of trade policy
under the Chretien government, experts say.
</P>
<P>
"These missions are helping us to increase exports and create
jobs for Canadians. They also demonstrate what we can accomplish
when we work together," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the mission is expected to focus on key Canadian
sectors, such as agri-food, the environment, transportation,
energy and natural resources, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade of goods and services between Canada and the
three Asian countries combined totaled 6 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The potential for more business with each country is
considerable, since they are among the fastest growing economies
in the Asia-Pacific region, the officials noted.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Renews Appeal for Int'l Intervention in E. Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today renewed his appeal for the launching of an international
intervention force in the Great Lakes region in central Africa,
where the refugee crisis is far from ending and violence is
raging.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Lakes region appeals more than ever for an
international intervention. The refugee crisis there has not
ended. The destabilization forces remain threatening," Chirac
said in a traditional new year meeting with the diplomatic corps
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish that "Americans and Europeans together
find a lasting solution to the human tragedy" there.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the remarkable action of humanitarian organizations
which have to shoulder the job of a multinational force, our
states should mobilize their means and rescue hundreds of
thousands of abandoned men, women and children," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the refusal by the United States to
back a multinational force in central Africa, Chirac said, "This
epoch is no more for the rivalries of the other age."
</P>
<P>
The United States has refused to support the dispatching of a
multinational force to eastern Zaire, despite a resolution by the
United Nations Security Council in November calling for an
international intervention to end the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) said today in Geneva that the number of refugees who died
in the past several days in eastern Zaire has increased
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The daily death rate among refugees in the Lubutu region, 170
kilometers southeast of Kisangani, is now 2.1-3.8 among 10,000
people, close to those of Ethiopia and Somalia in their drought
disasters in the early 1980s and early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Election Results in Nis to Be Recognized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government expects
the election commission in Nis to repeal its decision on repeating
the vote in 17 precincts and recognize the results of the
elections, said a statement issued by the Serbian Information Ministry
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government had examined at today's
session the findings of the Justice Ministry, at the order of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, to the effect that the truth
be established regarding the municipal elections in Nis and the
public duly informed.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry had admitted that the opposition coalition
Zajedno had won 37 seats, the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia 32
and the Serbian Radical Party one seat in the municipal assembly
of Nis, the second largest city located in southern Serbia, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released by the official Tanjug news agency,
said the conditions for determining the final results in all the
election precincts were met, following procedures by election
organs and competent courts.
</P>
<P>
The government ordered the Justice Ministry to take measures to
establish accountability for those responsible for the
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
This is apparently a concession made by the government after
the Zajedno coalition staged daily demonstrations in the center of
Belgrade over the past 50 days to protest against the annulment of
the local election results. Zajedno claimed it had won 15 out of
18 largest cities in Serbia in the November 17 elections for local
assemblies and demanded the election results be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe which visited Belgrade for a fact-finding mission
confirmed the opposition's victory in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The government's statement said the above measure showed that
"problems, omissions, errors and abuses can be resolved
efficiently only in the institutions of the system," because
everything that had been resolved regarding the local elections
had been done so in legal institutions, not in the street.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever irregularities are made, regardless of protests, will
be set right in line with regulations and in legal institutions,"
said the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi men confessed today
that they were involved in espionage for Israel's Mossad spy
agency, the Iraqi television reported.
</P>
<P>
The televised confessions came less than three weeks after
four other Iraqis confessed that they had been working for the
American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was denied by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The three men said that they gathered and provided Iraqi
military intelligence for Israel. They said that in return, they
received a large amount of funds from Mossad, the Israeli
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
Jamal Majid Nadir, a businessman who traveled several times to
Turkey and met with Israeli agents there, admitted that he and
his two partners have served Mossad from 1995.
</P>
<P>
They attracted the Iraqi authorities' attention from the very
beginning, they said on television.
</P>
<P>
The TV report gave no indication of when the men were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi intelligence service uncovered a spy ring working
for the CIA recently.

<HEADLINE> Zairean President to Return to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Sese Seko Mobutu
will return Thursday to France, where he stayed from November 4 to
December 17 last year in his private villa at
Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, southeast France.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy in Kinshasa confirmed to the AFP the issuing
of a visa to Mobutu, his wife and his entourage, but failed to
tell which date the president will leave for France.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mobutu and his family can go to France whenever they
want. We are neither Switzerland nor the United States," AFP
quoted a French diplomat as saying in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland refused to renew the visa of Mobutu after he had a
prostate cancer operation in the Swiss city of Lausanne in August
last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States has refused entry of Mobutu for years, except
in New York, the site of the United Nations, for a limited stay.
</P>
<P>
After he returned to Zaire in December, Mobutu set up a crisis
government, reshuffled the army leadership and made preparations
for a counter-offensive against the Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels in
the eastern Kivu region of the country.
</P>
