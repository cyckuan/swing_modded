<HEADLINE> Hainan Evolves From National Defense Outpost to Booming Province (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost island
province, celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding today
amidst hails of economic miracles achieved over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The tropical province, China's second largest island,
separated from Guangdong Province and became a province in its own
right and China's largest special economic zone in April 1988.
</P>
<P>
Covering 34,000 sq.km., Hainan is home to abundant mineral and
tourism resources. However, ancient emperorers exiled prisoners to
the island due to its remoteness.
</P>
<P>
Following the founding of New China in 1949, the island was
designated as a national defense "outpost" because of its
strategic location in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The long-term status as an outpost seriously retarded the
island's economic construction and Hainan was one of the poorest
regions in China prior to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the island has emerged as a booming province
and a world-class holiday resort.
</P>
<P>
Ten key projects involving overseas financing were initiated
today to mark the island's 10th anniversary. The wide-ranging
projects, all of which are considered to be pillar for future
economic development, cover infrastructure, information
technology, tropical farming and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of guests attending today's celebrations were deeply
impressed with the island's beautiful and busy highways,
expressways and airport. Few were aware that traffic conditions a
mere ten years earlier were so underdeveloped that the island
lacked a single traffic light, even in Haikou, the provincial
capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist chief Gennady
Zyuganov said Monday that his party and two other leftist groups
would again reject Sergei Kiriyenko's premiership candidacy in the
second round of vote in the State Duma (lower house of the
parliament).
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to doubt our firmness," Zyuganov said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is expected to hold the second round vote on
Kiriyenko's nomination on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, Yeltsin must dissolve the State
Duma, if deputies reject his candidate for premier three times.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Kiriyenko lost the first round nomination vote in
the State Duma.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Air Force (IAF) will
soon upgrade more than 120 Soviet-made MIG-27 fighters to build a
modern weapons system, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PTI quoted IAF Chief Marshal S. K. Sareen as saying that
"the modernization is very much on the cards and will mainly
involve upgradation of the existing radar system, avionics and
weapon system."
</P>
<P>
There are seven squadrons of MIG-27 fighters in the IAF with
the total number of aircraft put at 120 to 130.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Indian Air Force was planning to buy more
sophisticated aircraft, Sareen said: "If we can upgrade what we
have, it will be more than sufficient."
</P>
<P>
An expert team would first study the present requirements of
the air force before suggesting areas in which the aircraft
requires modernization.
</P>
<P>
The team would then work out which equipment needed to be
imported from abroad, Sareen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian company,
had done "excellent work" for the air force and was capable of
upgrading the MIG-27s.

<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A cold wave, accompanied by snow
and rain, has been striking France since Sunday, on the eve of the
Christian festival of Easter on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Snow fell Monday morning in a great part of southwest France,
including Poitou coastal area bordering the Atlantic, and the
central Limousin region and Massive Central mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
Flake fell from Sunday night in some parts of southeast France,
but the sky cleared up later Monday.
</P>
<P>
In northern France along the line from the western port of
Brest to the eastern city of Metz, it was cloudy and rainy for a
better part of the day.
</P>
<P>
Only the Mediterranean region enjoyed sunshine Monday due to a
strong warm wind from the west.
</P>
<P>
The national weather forecast institution Meteo France said
that more rainfalls and snowfalls are expected to continue on
Tuesday, and temperature will remain lower than normal in most
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Shower will hit the coastal area along the English Channel, the
northern region bordering Belgium and the Ardennes mountainous
region in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Snow, flake and rain will come down in the region ranging from
the central to the eastern Alpes until the island of Corsica,
while the western wind will drive away the cloud over the
Mediterranean coast region of France.
</P>
<P>
Frosting fog and rain will fall on the western coastal area,
including Bretagne, Vendee, Charente, Aquitaine and the Pyrenees
mountainous region bordering Spain.

<P>
The island's one million agricultural reclamation workers
account for some 14 percent of the total population and are
amongst those most entitled to proclaim the success story.
</P>
<P>
The main responsibility of farms in the past was to reclaim
waste land and defend the frontiers under quasi-military standard
management. Now, however, they have been transformed into China's
largest tropical farming conglomerates involving overseas-funded
businesses and diversified operations.
</P>
<P>
Tourists have flocked to previously isolated Hainan, a tropical
paradise which has been designated by the World Tourism
Organization as one of the best tourism destinations.
</P>
<P>
"We've entered a new era. Many of the over 100 former
militiamen in our village are now engaged in tourism and related
businesses," according to the 65-year-old Lu Caidong, Party
secretary for Hongxia Village located on Yalong Bay near Sanya
City.
</P>
<P>
Yalong Bay, which features blue seas and white beaches, puts one
in mind of the Cote D'azur in France and the area has been
transformed into a national holiday resort. Hainan, which has a
population of 7.3 million people, hosted well over 7.9
million tourists in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Arab Action to Face Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday urged Arab
countries to "take action" in case Israel fails to deliver its
commitments in the peace process, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Arab countries should take action if Israel did not launch
army redeployment in the West Bank by the middle of 1998 in
accordance with the Hebron agreement signed early last year,"
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked for more
than a year over Israel's settlement expansion and long-delayed
pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Al-Hayat newspaper, Moussa explained that
the Americans, acting as a main sponsor of the negotiations, could
have provided a way out of the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told the Arabic-language daily that the U.S., a staunch
supporter of the Jewish state, is currently "paying off the bills
of the Israeli policies."
</P>
<P>
He his call on Washington to make public its peace initiative
and avoid practicing double standards, saying that such a move
would reflect "honesty of the broker."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat voiced suspicion of the recent
Israeli proposal to implement the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425 and withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli premier's dealings with the Palestinians has set
an example to the Lebanese and the Syrians," he said. "Why should
they go into an adventure whose end is known in advance?"
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel approved the adoption of the Resolution 425,
but conditioned its troop withdrawal on Lebanese government's
ensuring the security of its border areas.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria, which agree not to make peace with
Israel separately, have rejected the Israeli offer. They insist
that the Jewish state withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally
as the U.N. resolution demands.

Communications was extremely difficult a short 10 years ago
when the island had no program-controlled telephones. Today,
however, Hainan has established program-controlled telephone,
cellular phone and Internet links to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Even when reviewing the island's remarkable achievements,
provincial officials could not help but recall the time when
Hainan was forced to purchase thermos bottle, pans, spoons,
basins, soaps and even a common screws from other provinces in
order to fulfill local demand.
</P>
<P>
"The vicissitudes of Hainan represent the epitome of China
which has adopted economic construction as its central task and is
marching forward to the international arena," according to Chi
Fulin, vice-president of China (Hainan) Reform and Development
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The government's priority concern has been to adhere to the
opening policy and economic development, while at the same time
altering the aloof and conservative image of the island,"
according to Wang Xiaofeng, acting governor of Hainan.

<P>
A gigantic painting of Deng Xiaoping recently placed in Wanlu
Garden, the largest park in Haikou, has attracted flocks of local
residents and tourists.

The people of Hainan have special reasons for fondly
remembering the greatness of Deng Xiaoping who once said: "It

economic upsurge."

ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish security forces
captured two leading members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in northern Iraq on Monday, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The security forces staged an operation against Semdin Sakik
and his brother Hasan in Dohok in northern Iraq at 8:00 local time
(0500 GMT) and brought them back to Turkey at 14:30 local time
(1130 GMT), a statement issued by the Turkish General Staff said.
</P>
<P>
Sakik reportedly surrendered to Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic
Party, one of the two factions fighting for control of northern
Iraq, on March 15 after he fell out with PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces have been monitoring his place of
residence and his activities since then, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish forces closed in on him in after a request for Sakik's
extradition was refused by the Iraqi Kurdish party, it added.
</P>
<P>
PKK rebels have been fighting a separatist war since 1984 in

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Economy Grows by 8 Percent in 1997: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- President Joaquim Chissano told
the National Assembly Monday that Mozambique's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by eight percent in 1997, exceeding the
previously estimated five percent.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano said in his state-of-union address to
parliament: "I am satisfied with the economic performance last
year."
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that the growth rates in most economic
sectors in 1997 were higher than those in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the inflation rate of 1997 was 6.5 percent and
Metical, the currency of this southern African state, only
depreciated 2.2 percent against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We are more confident in our currency," Chissano said, adding
that his government has created a better environment for trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Mozambican president admitted that
external debt has long been one of the major restrainers of the
economic and social development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other
creditors have recently selected Mozambique as one of the
heavily-indebted poor countries for receiving debt relief, which
he said will reduce Mozambique's debt to 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars
by June 1999 from some 5.6 billion Dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
In his view, debt relief is significant for Mozambique. After
the write-off, Chissano said, the government will invest more
into education, health and utilities and rehabilitate
infrastructure such as roads, which in turn will promote the
development of the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on his people to actively
participate in the local elections scheduled on June 30 in 33
towns and cities so as to guarantee the transfer of power to the
people.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Forge New Relationship with Russia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said on Monday that Pakistan wants to forge a
brand-new relationship based on equality and mutual cooperation
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while briefing a visiting delegation of the
French Institute of Higher Studies on Defense Affairs about
Pakistan's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The tensions in our relations with the former Soviet Union
have been overcome," he said. "Both countries want to move away
from the suspicions of the past and build a new equation based on
cooperation and mutuality of benefit."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to Moscow
later this year would be an important milestone in the
Pakistani-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistani-U.S. relations, he said the upcoming visit of U.S.
special envoy Bill Richardson and U.S. President Bill Clinton
would result in greater U.S understanding of Pakistan's genuine
security concerns and its emphasis on building a mutually
beneficial relationship, particularly in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said Pakistan enjoys close and
cooperative ties with all East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"China has been a friend that has stood by us in difficult
times," he said. "Our traditional friendship with China will
continue to be a cornerstone of our foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Japan, he said, had emerged as one of Pakistan's major trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with the Islamic world will continue to be of
fundamental importance for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, he said, Pakistan has a vital interest in
the restoration of durable peace in the war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
This, however, must emanate from the Afghans themselves, "it
cannot be imposed from outside," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is in contact with all Afghan factions in order to
promote the peace process, he added.

<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Five policemen of Angola's rapid
intervention police force have been missing since they were
kidnaped last Tuesday in central Angola's Huambo Province by the
remnant soldiers of the former rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
The Angola News Agency Monday quoted officials from the
provincial government of Huambo as saying that the five policemen
were kidnaped and missing during an attack last Tuesday in
Chilata Town, Huambo Province, by militiamen of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Reports said four other policemen were also missing during an
earlier ambush at Catavola Town in the same province by UNITA
ex-fighters.
</P>
<P>
Huambo, capital of the central Huambo province, is the second
largest city in the country, a stronghold of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
During the 19-year civil war, the province has been a target
vied heatedly for by both sides. The government snatched back
the city in November 1994 after the two sides signed the Lusaka
peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's influence in the province is so great that three years
after the peace accord was signed, the situation there is still
unstable and national authoritative institutions could hardly be
established in the UNITA-occupied regions in the province.

Mordechai said that Israel is now watching closely how intensively
and for how long PNA will continue efforts against terrorist
infrastructure in areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's remarks came at a time when Palestinian security
forces have rounded up dozens of Islamic militant group members,
including senior figures, for questioning over the killing of
Hamas bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif.
</P>
<P>
PNA said that Sharif, who was found dead in the West Bank city
of Ramallah on March 29, had been killed by fellow Hamas activists
in an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Hamas rejected the findings of PNA's investigation, held Israel
responsible for the murder and vowed vengeance. Some Hamas
members further accused PNA of collaborating with Israel in
Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought PNA could deal with challenges from Islamic
radical groups, Mordechai said that if PNA and Arafat decide to
"do what is necessary to do, they can do it and they can succeed."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also blamed PNA for having not done enough in
curbing terrorist infrastructure, saying that it should continue
to do everything necessary against terror.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that its second redeployment of troops in
the West Bank is conditional on fulfillment of PNA's commitments
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to bridge the gap between Israel and PNA over the
extent of the further withdrawal, the United States Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross is to visit the region next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a telephone conversation with Ross on Sunday,
PNA President Yasser Arafat urged the U.S. to make public its
peace proposal, which reportedly calls on Israel to hand over
some 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the
second pullback.

<HEADLINE> WFP Donates 1,300 Tons of Maize to Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) has donated some 1,300 tons of maize to people in Singida
Region in central Tanzania, the news agency of Shihata reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Mnjeja, executive director of the International Islamic
Relief Organization (IIRO), said recently that the districts
which benefited from the relief supplies are Singida Rural,
Manyoni and Irambax, with 600 tons, 600 tons and 100 tons
received respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mnjeja said the region which needs 6,300 tons of food has so
far received only 1,400 tons, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The poor state of the roads has hampered transportation and
distribution of relief supplies, he said, adding that
consignments from the Mwanza Region on the shore of Lake Victoria
have to be transported by train to Manyoni and later by trucks to
Singida.
</P>
<P>
Mnjeja said sometimes they were forced to establish a center
where the relief food was stored and people from out-of-the-way
villages were told to walk to the center to collect their shares
of food.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the distribution of relief supplies will be stopped
next month to let authorities concerned evaluate whether the
areas will harvest sufficient food or not.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached at the end of last month during a
joint meeting of the IIRO, the Prime Minister's Office, the WFP
and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
People in many areas of Tanzania have suffered from famine
since this east African country was struck by drought and floods
successively last year.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Alliance Names Team for Talks With Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's northern alliance
has announced a nine-member team of senior officials for talks
with the rival Islamic Taliban militia, an alliance spokesman said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance team will join a joint steering committee
with Taliban members to arrange for a meeting of Ulema (religious
scholars) from the two sides, said Ahmed Zaki, spokesman of
Junbish-I-Milli, one of the anti-Taliban alliance factions.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two-thirds of Afghanistan, named
five senior members for the Taliban-proposed steering committee
last week. The first meeting of the steering committee is expected
to be held in Islamabad within seven days.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be the first between the Taliban and the
opposition northern alliance since the former captured Kabul in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who had previously rejected a 45-member list of
the northern alliance, say that the steering committee should
discuss only the composition of the Ulema commission and the
qualification, strength and powers of its members.
</P>
<P>
However, the northern alliance argue that the steering
committee should also discuss the cease-fire, exchange of
prisoners, formation of a broad-based government and opening of
routes.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has also proposed to the Taliban to increase the
number of its members for the committee. It has agreed to hold the
first meeting of the committee in Islamabad but insisted the next
meeting be held in "any other neighboring country."
</P>
<P>
The alliance has also suggested that United Nations and
Organization of the Islamic Conference representatives supervise
the steering committee's meeting and record all its proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Export Natural Gas to Jordan, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is studying plans to export
natural gas to Jordan and Libya, its eastern and western
neighbors, the Middle East News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Petroleum Minister Hamdi Ali Abdel Wahab Al-Banbi said
the gas export to Jordan will make use of a 220-kilometer-long
pipeline that is being built to convey gas to the Sinai peninsula
for a national land reclamation project there.
</P>
<P>
He said the pipeline will then be extended to Taba on the Gulf
of Aqaba and cross the gulf underwater to reach Jordan. After
completion it is expected to pump 4.25 million cubic meters of gas
per day from offshore fields in the Mediterranean to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, in cooperation with some European companies, has
reportedly planned to set up a gas company to buy Egyptian gas and
sell it to the Jordanian National Electricity Company.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi said studies are also being carried out by Egyptian
and Libyan experts to build pipelines for transferring crude oil
and natural gas between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will provide Libya's eastern cities with about 7.06
million cubic meters of natural gas each day while 150,000 barrels
of Libyan crude will be carried to a refinery in Egypt's
Mediterranean port of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi's statement came three days after he announced Egypt
suspended talks with Israel to sell gas to it because of
"political differences" and Israel's "incapacity to erect a gas
network."

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt announces Modified Export-Import Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Monday
announced a modified export and import policy for 1997-2002 with
an aim to stimulate exports and ease import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde told a press
conference that the modifications to the policy included shifting
340 import items from a restricted list to open general license in
line with India's commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to phase out the remaining import tariff on over 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
The government set an ambitious target of 20 percent export
growth to reach 41 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year
1998-99. Indian exports in 1997-98 are expected to be little more
than 34 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
India would enhance export competitiveness through simplified
procedures and concessions to key export sectors like gem and
jewelry, garments, chemicals, agro-industries and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Hedge said he was confident his country would achieve the 20
percent export growth target, saying that the measures announced
in the export and import policy would help make Indian exporters
competitive by tackling various problems faced by them.
</P>
<P>
On the demand of exporters for adjustment in the value of the
rupee in the context of the Southeast Asian currency crisis, the
minister said the exchange rate management would have to balance
the needs of exporters and other macro-economic requirements.
</P>
<P>
To allay the fears of the exporters, Hedge announced that the
Duty Entitlement Pass Book Scheme introduced last year to
neutralize the basic customs duty would be continued.
</P>
<P>
He also announced extension of this scheme to 300 other export
items, thus taking the total items eligible for the scheme to
1,900.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that a new directorate general of
anti-dumping, responsible for investigations and subsidies, would
be in place soon.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Rwandans Killed Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 103 people have been
killed in violence perpetrated by Interahamwe militiamen since
Rwanda commemorated the fourth anniversary of the 1994 genocide
last Monday, said a report reaching here Monday from IRIN.
</P>
<P>
In the latest violence, the report of the U.N. humanitarian
information unit (IRIN) said, 10 people were killed in two
separate incidents in Nyamabuye Commune, central Gitarama
prefecture on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Five people died when their vehicles came under fire, while
five others -- all genocide survivors -- were killed in their
homes, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Desire Nyandwi, prefect of Gitarama, narrowly escaped death
when his vehicle was ambushed. His driver was killed. IRIN
quoted army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro as saying that a search
was underway for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
In nearby Tabwe sector, five women -- also genocide survivors
-- were reportedly hacked to death with machetes, knives and
hoes.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, 24 people were slaughtered in Gitarama's
Musambira Commune, the report said. Two families were almost
entirely wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said a group of unidentified people, some
wearing military uniforms, others dressed in long overall coats
and armed with guns and traditional weapons, descended on the
homes of the two families, killing people while they slept. Some
of the victims, including babies, had been allegedly decapitated.
</P>
<P>
Military sources blamed the carnage on the Interahamwe and
said an investigation was underway, IRIN said.
</P>
<P>
In northern Ruhengeri Prefecture, a total of 33 people were
killed on Thursday in an attack on a displaced camp in Nyarutovu
Commune. The report said local residents estimated 500 Hutu
militiamen raided the camp, initially killing 28 people and
wounding 36. A further five died of their injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Twenty assailants were reportedly killed by the army. Agence
France Presse quoted military sources as saying a new offensive
had been launched against the rebels following the attack. The
French news agency also said 11 soldiers were killed in a rebel
attack earlier last week in Nyamugari Village, Ruhengeri
Prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Britain of Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi diplomat on Monday lashed
out at a British proposal to hold an international conference on
speeding up delivery of humanitarian supplies in Iraq as an
interference in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Negm, Iraqi permanent delegate to the Cairo-based Arab
League, told reporters that the British idea is also in violation
of the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Negm reiterated his country's opposition to such a "suspicious
approach hiding political motives far from any humanitarian
targets."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's National Assembly (parliament) Saturday turned down the
British call for a meeting in London of various bodies and aid
organizations of the oil-for-food program to work out ways of
speeding up the delivery of humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Negm said that holding such a conference completely contradicts
the resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council and all
measures related to the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now allowed to sell up to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months later this year, from the present 2
billion dollars, to buy food and medicines for its people
suffering from the crippling U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever concerned with the humanitarian conditions of the
Iraqi people has to call for lifting the prolonged U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq since 1990," Negm added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Britain of trying to capitalize on its current
presidency of the European Union to rally support for American and
British plans and to dodge the latest Iraq-U.N. agreement and
prolong the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The February agreement, signed by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, opened Iraq's eight
previous "off-limits" presidential sites to inspections and
averted military strikes threatened by Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council would lift the sanctions after Iraq
is given a clean bill of health on weapons of mass destruction by
arms inspectors.

inspections by the IAEA Nuclear Monitoring Group from October 1,
1997 - April 1, 1998 were carried out with no prior announcement.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 15 IAEA experts "were able to complete
their mandated tasks and were provided practical cooperation from
the Iraqi counterpart" in investigations of Iraq's presidential
sites from March 26 - April 3 this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
IAEA joined of the special group set up under the memorandum of
understanding agreed between Annan and the Iraqi Government on
February 23, 1998 in investigating Iraq's eight presidential
sites.

were provided with practical cooperation from the Iraqi
counterpart," the report said.
</P>

of prohibited materials or equipment or of the conduct of
prohibited activities with respect to the mandate of IAEA", it
went on.

BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad held talks on Monday in
Syria's resort Latakia to coordinate stances on Israel's offer to
withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, House Speaker Nabih
Berry, Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Sharaa also attended the talks, the Lebanese
independent Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not released. But the news agency
said the leaders are expected to reiterate their rejection to
Israel's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, which demands a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. But in the meantime, it said that
it would not pull back its troops before security arrangements are
negotiated with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which view it as an attempt to drive a wedge
between them, have rejected the offer. They insist the Israeli
withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon
to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks
by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which is stationing 30,000 troops in Lebanon
as peacekeepers, have agreed not to make peace separately with the
Jewish state.

Syria wants return of the strategic Golan Heights, which was
captured by Israel in the 1967 war.

PNA announced that Sharif was murdered by his fellow Hamas
members in an internal power struggle.
</P>

But Hamas rejected the findings of PNA's investigation, saying
that Israel should be responsible for the death of Sharif. Some
Hamas members further blamed PNA for collaborating with Israel in

TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A court here has rejected the
protest of Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi against his
detention since April 4, the hardline newspaper Resalat reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an informed source, the daily said the court discussed

According to Iranian laws, the accused's attorney should be
present in all interrogations, Keshavarz said. However the court
has not yet invited him to attend any interrogations since the
mayor was detained for alleged financial scandals.

He said the he was also banned from making contact with
Karbaschi, even on telephone and urged the judicial authority to
respect Karbaschi's right to defend.
</P>
<P>
The moderates and the hardliners, represented by the Majlis
(parliament), have been in confrontation over Karbaschi's
detention and sharply attacking each other for more than a week.
Both sides called for intervention of the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei in the issue.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet under Khatami Sunday night called on the people to
remain calm and to refrain from holding demonstrations in support
of Karbaschi, stressing that the society needs peace and
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
However, the pro-government student group the Unity
Consolidation Office announced to hold a rally on Tuesday to
protest Karbaschi's detention and support the government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here said the country has run into a
political disturbance over Karbaschi's detention as the case has
been politicized by both the moderates and conservatives.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Robust Growth Rates in African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A lot of African states will
achieve economic growth rates of about 5 percent this year and
the trend looks set to go on over the medium term, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF said
the biggest upturn would be seen in Algeria, where growth would
be seen reaching 4.8 percent this year from just 1.3 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
In Morocco, the fund also predicted the growth of 7.6 percent
after a 2.2 percent contraction last year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy was forecast to expand by 2.7 percent this
year, up from only 1.3 percent in 1997, while growth in South
Africa was expected to rebound to a rate of 2.2 percent in 1998
from 1.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
While the overall outlook for Africa was good, and consumer
prices remained in check, the IMF predicted that Nigeria's
economic growth would slow down to 2.7 percent this year from 5.1
percent last year since the country has been hard hit by power
and fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
The fund said recent improvements in African economic
performance appeared to have resulted mostly from improved fiscal
reforms and progress in implementing structural reforms, rather
than international trade developments.
</P>
<P>
Several states such as Botswana and Mauritius did liberalize
their trade regimens and their economies have outperformed the
rest of Africa by a wide margin, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and acting Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko discussed on Monday the
priority of tasks facing the government, according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
After the talks Kiriyenko told reporters that he and the
president also viewed the outcome of last Friday's vote on his
candidature in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko noted that the program of top priority actions of
the government should be implemented from now on, since it has
already been drafted.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the implementation of the government program
will largely depend on budget revenues.
</P>
<P>
On the Russia's 1998 budget, the acting prime minister said
that there is no need for sequestration of the 1998 budget, which
implies that all spending items will be carried out depending on
the actual arrival of money.
</P>
<P>
"The fulfillment of items of spending directly depends on the
amount of revenues we manage to collect," Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
A considerable increase in tax revenues emerged in Russia, he
noted, "there are still big reserves" to be tapped to increase
budget revenues.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ready to Participate in Talks Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expressed its readiness on
Monday to participate in any process for a solution to its
protracted division, provided it does not undermine its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to reiterate we are ready to take part in any process
aiming at a Cyprus solution, which in no way will mean undermining
the legitimacy of the Cyprus Republic,", Cyprus' government
spokesman Christos Stylianides told his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on reports that in their forthcoming viist,
Richard Holbrooke and Thomas Miller, the United States envoys for
Cyprus will try to promote a Dayton or a Camp David-style process
for the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said any talks for a solution to the Cyprus issue should be
held according to the United Nations framework, under which the
Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots negotiate directly under the
bi-communal and bi-zonal formula.
</P>
<P>
Miller is expected to visit Cyprus right after the Easter and
Holbrooke in early May, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. envoys ended a round of mediation early this
month, during which they failed to persuade Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Denktash says he will not hold talks with Cypriot President,
Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides unless his breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is recognized as an equal
party.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway entity, which is only recognized by Turkey.

MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Monday denied that he had forcibly occupied farmers'
land in Malehice region in south Mozambique's Gaza Province.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at parliament here Monday, the
Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chissano admitted that he had applied to the government for
allocating a piece of land to Gaza Province, his home towne,
under the program, but "all is done
according to the law."
</P>
<P>
However, about two years after that, he said, some people
claimed that some part of the land were theirs, which brought
about some trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the reason (for the trouble)," the president
noted, adding for this he had given up nine hectares of land,
leaving out the disputed area of just two hectares.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the dispute is created by "some inciters with
ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
The land dispute cropped up this February when a man named
Armando Machava went to the Human Rights Federation of
Mozambique, claiming that his land was seized by the Mozambican
president.

</P>
<P>
Cohen will discuss with government leaders of the five
countries a wide range of issues including bilateral military ties
with Washington, Middle East peace process, relations between
Turkey and Greece, and Iraq, U.S. officials said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continuing in East S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Fighting is continuing in eastern
Sierra Leone's diamond-rich district of Kailahan and Kono as the
west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) pushes on toward the
remnants of the fleeing junta forces and allied rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here Monday night, ECOMOG has launched the "final"
offensive from eastern and southern Kono which seemed to have
made progress.
</P>
<P>
The number of the junta forces and rebels is yet to be known,
but the report said the junta leader, Johnny Paul Koroma and some
of his colleagues who are hiding in Kono are mobilizing more
forces, including civilians, to put up resistance against ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the junta forces are re-grouping at
the border area between Sierra Leone and Liberia and were
sometimes moving back and forth from Liberia, especially Lofa
county in northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has denied a recent allegation by
ECOMOG that junta forces from Sierra Leone are being trained in
Lofa.
</P>
<P>
While ECOMOG has captured some towns during recent mopping up
operations in eastern Sierra Leone, the junta's allied rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has refuted the victories.
</P>
<P>
"As guerrillas we don't want to fight in the big towns," said
a RUF leader, adding that the rebels will go into the jungle and
continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader vowed not to allow ECOMOG to take Kono, which
might be the last stronghold of RUF and the junta forces, saying
they would fight "as much as they (ECOMOG) want us to fight. They
will not succeed."

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-oil Exports Drop by 3.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Non-oil Exports dropped by
3.1 percent to 3 billion U.S. dollars during the past Iranian year
(ending March 20) while its imports rose by 5.7 percent to 15.8
billion dollars, a report from Iran Customs said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian major newspapers Monday quoted the customs' report as
saying that the country's non-oil exports in weight reached 8.27
million tonnes, showing an increase of 17.5 percent, but in value
it showed an 3.1 percent decrease compared with the respective
figures of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that of the total non-oil exports, industrial
products shared 83.2 percent in value and 59.2 percent in weight,
fetching 1.78 billion dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports of agricultural products dropped to 555
million dollars, having a fall of 40.7 percent compared with that
of last Iranian year, it said, adding that the main reason for
the drop was the ban of European countries on imports of Iranian
pistachio on the pretext of bad quality.
</P>
<P>
Iran's mineral exports during the year were registered at 40
million dollars, also having a decrease of 40.7 percent from that
of last year, the report said, without specifying other non-oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, the Iranian government made
desperate efforts to promote the non-oil exports and reduce the
country's dependence on oil, however, instability of relevant
policies seriously retarded the growth of non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari said in January that
the country only earned 10 billion dollars from non-oil exports
during the first three years of the Second Five Year Development
Plan (1995-2000), which expected 27.5 billion dollars for the
five years.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage non-oil exports, the government announced
last December to allow exporters to keep 100 percent of their
foreign exchange revenue from exports. Some officials believed
that with the new policy Iran's non-oil exports would reach five
billion dollars in this Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Two Major Banking Mergers Announced in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two huge banking mergers were
announced in the U.S. today, accelerating a wave of building up a
few giant financial powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and
BankAmerica Corp., based in San Francisco, are involved in a
stock-for-stock transaction with a value of 59.3 billion U.S.
dollars. The deal is to create a coast-to-coast banking giant.
</P>
<P>
Banc One Corp., based in Ohio, is combining with First Chicago
NBD Corp. in a 29.8 billion U.S. dollars union to create the
dominant bank in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The two megamergers announced today follow last week's planned
merger of banking giant Citicorp and brokerage and insurer
Travelers Group, which has pressured other financial companies to
accelerate their consolidation.
</P>
<P>
The NationsBank-BankAmerica merger would be the second-largest
corporate marriage ever behind the planned 76.4 billion U.S.
dollar Citicorp-Travelers union, which would form the nation's
largest financial services company.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank has its strength across the nation's South and
midsection. BankAmerica spreads east from its San Francisco base.
Together they will have 570 billion U.S. dollars in assets, making
it the nation's biggest bank ahead of Chase Manhattan Corp.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank, which will take the BankAmerica name, will
operate in 22 states. It will have 4,800 branches and 15,000
automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
The banks have 180,000 employees and the merger will eliminate
5,000 to 8,000 positions, according to early estimates of BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
The Banc One-First Chicago combination will create the
fifth-largest banking company in terms of assets, at 230 billion
U.S. dollars. The company will retain the name of Columbus,
Ohio-based Banc One but will have its headquarters in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The new Banc One will have more than 2,000 branches and 9,150
ATMs. The companies said the expense of job cuts and other
merger-related costs will reduce its earnings by 1.25 billion U.S.
dollars. They did not provide specific numbers for jobs to be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The mergers speed up the already rapid makeover of the nation's
banking industry as Congress is trying to remove Depression-era
barriers that block banks from getting fully into the insurance and
brokerage businesses.
</P>
<P>
Like the Citicorp-Travelers deal, the mergers announced today
will combine banking and investment services such as mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica and NationsBank both purchased investment firms last
year to broaden their options. BankAmerica acquired Robertson
Stephens &AMP; Co., while NationsBank took over Montgomery Securities.
Banc One and First Chicago also have money-management businesses.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank has become the third-biggest banking company
through aggressive acquisitions. It has 310 billion U.S. dollars
in assets.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Capture of Kurdish Rebel Leaders Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) of Iraq on Monday accused Turkey of capturing two leading
members of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish militia.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, in a written statement faxed to Xinhua, said
that Turkey's action not only undermine good relations between
the two sides but also constitute a violation of the human
rights of the captured.
</P>
<P>
Semdin Sakik and his brother, both ex-leaders of the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), were kidnaped by Turkish special
forces in Dohok in northern Iraq early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
They, along with several KDP bodyguards, were flown to
Turkey by a helicopter which landed shortly after the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Sakik reportedly surrendered to the KDP on March 15 after
he fell out with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"The KDP strongly condemns and deplores this action by
Turkish forces and hold the Turkish authorities for this serious
act and for the safety of the kidnaped people including our
own men," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the KDP had set up an inquiry commission to
investigate this "tragic incident".
</P>
<P>
The KDP, one of the two factions fighting for the control of
northern Iraq following the Saddam regime's defeat in the 1991
Gulf War, has maintained a close relationship with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
PKK rebels have been engaging a guerrilla war against the
Turkish government since 1984 in a bid to establish an independent
Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, U.S. officials Hold Talks on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian and
U.S. officials held talks in the West Bank city of Jericho on
Monday in an effort to pave the way for visit of U.S. Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross in the region next week.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center, a Palestinian press service, Palestinian top negotiator
Saeb Erekat and U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem John Herbst
discussed the latest development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about Israeli refusal of a U.S. peace
proposal, which reportedly calls on Israel to hand over some 13.1
percent of the West Bank during the second redeployment in return
for the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ross failed in his trip to the region last month to reach
consensus with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the
extent of the next pullback.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that a redeployment of 13 percent was
unacceptable, saying it would damage Israel's national security
interest.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, in a telephone conversation with Ross
Sunday night, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat urged the U.S. to make public its peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also met respectively with British Consul General
in Jerusalem Robin Keeley and Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammad Bassioni on Monday in Jericho in a bid to win support
of the international community for the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Ross was expected to be back in the region soon with a revised
proposal which reportedly demands Israel to turn over 9 percent of
the West Bank to full Palestinian control and 3 percent more to
Palestinian civil control.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Liberians Demonstrate against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 Liberians displaced in
the last civil war Monday staged a violent demonstration in the
capital Monrovia against free repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The displaced Liberians from 35 camps surrounding Monrovia
marched into the offices of the Liberian Refugees Repatriation
Commission where they assaulted the commission's director.
</P>
<P>
The displaced people reportedly said diplomacy had failed to
address their plight and that it was time for action, according
to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The director's shirt was torn off and his watch was removed
while the displaced people forced him out of the building, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Some of the commission staff who were trying to protect him
also sustained from bruises and minor injuries before riot police
moved in to restore order.
</P>
<P>
The commission director was quoted as saying Monday evening
that the action was masterminded by certain people who allegedly
have been illegally benefiting from the food rations issued to
the war-affected people in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Liberian government and international community in
Monrovia are satisfied with the resettlement packages including
food, building materials and tools for those who wish to return
home.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the items are to be distributed to the
displaced people on their arrival to their final destinations.
</P>
<P>
But he alleged that because of doubt the displaced people want
to sell their packages in Monrovia and then re-apply for more.
They are reluctant to leave the camps.
</P>
<P>
Although the director was assaulted by the displaced people,
he said he was happy because the action had stopped on the
negotiation and dialog with them.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government halted earlier this year food supply
to the internally displaced people who flew into the capital from
across the country, in a bid to force them to go back home.
</P>
<P>
But the displaced argued that they could not go home because
of poor transport.

LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Pitra Neto, Angolan Minister of
Public Administration, Employment and Social Security, disclosed
Monday that the country's unemployment rate has now reached 30 to

According to the minister, given current unstable situation in

restricted, with few job opportunities.

Therefore, he said, 55 percent of those employed in Angola are
working in informal economic sectors.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Re-deploys Staff Out of Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- As the protracted crisis between
Britain and Nigeria over their bilateral air services pact seems
not to be ending, the British Airways has started re-deploying
several of its managers in Nigeria to other African states.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Monday quoted a British Airways
source here as saying that several of the airlines' managers have
been posted to South Africa, Cameroun and Ghana, where it enjoys
flight services.
</P>
<P>
According to the unnamed source, most of the unaffected
airline managers are uncertain about their jobs as more than 70
percent of them have had their salaries stopped for several
months and have been directed to stay away until the situation
improves.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said that as a result of the
development, most offices of the carrier have now been deserted
while its office at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport
operates skeletal services.
</P>
<P>
The row between the two countries started last year when
Nigeria's Ministry of Aviation imposed a retaliatory ban on
British airplanes from flying into Nigeria on May 15, following
the British ban on all Nigeria registered aircraft from flying
into its airspace on alleged unsafety reasons.
</P>
<P>
Various efforts at brokering a truce have been unsuccessful
despite a reported agreement between the two aeronautical
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Nigeria's bilateral air services
agreement with Britain had, before the British ban, stipulated a
15-weekly British Airways flights into Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, while causing huge losses from both airlines, has
encouraged other airlines from Germany and Holland to ask for
more flight frequencies into Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Bellview Airline, one of Nigeria's
domestic airlines, has reached an agreement with the national
carrier, Nigeria Airways, to start flight operations to Amsterdam
and will link its passengers to Paris, Brussels and Rome.
</P>
<P>
In a move to boost its operations, the airline has offered a
special package of about 744 U.S. Dollars as incentive to
passengers for a return fare.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's industrial
production dropped slightly in 1997 with the metals industry
showing the biggest decline, the Census and Statistics Department
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The index of industrial production, which reflects changes of
local manufacturing output in real terms, edged down 0.8 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Output of the basic and fabricated metals industry dropped 5.6
percent while the wearing apparel (except footwear) industry
recorded the second biggest fall of 3.8 percent, a survey by the
department found.
</P>
<P>
Electrical and electronic products and the food, beverages and
tobacco industry also declined by 3.8 percent and 0.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But textiles (including knitting) output increased over the
year by 2.4 percent with paper products also doing well, rising
2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local manufacturing sector has been shrinking over the past
years with its contribution to GDP dropping from 18 percent in
1990 to nine percent in 1995. Many factories have moved to South
China for lower labor and land costs.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 percent of products manufactured in Hong Kong were

<P>
Energy prices dipped 1.2 percent in the month, the fourth drop
in a row. Gasoline prices at the pump fell 3.5 percent and are
down 14.7 percent from a year earlier. Natural gas costs increased
but fuel oil was unchanged and electricity declined.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were unchanged in March for the second consecutive
month. Pork prices fell 1.2 percent, the most in more than three
years. Fresh fruit fell a seasonally adjusted 2.6 percent and
fresh vegetables, 0.3 percent, recovering from earlier price
increases when El Nino's rains drown winter vegetable crops in
California.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices inched
just 0.1 percent higher in March. They've increased at a 2.4
percent annual rate so far this year. That's about the same as the
so-called "core" inflation rate of 2.2 percent for all of 1997,
the lowest since 1965.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco prices fell 2.6 percent after a slightly bigger drop
the month before. But, because of earlier increases, they still
were 6.7 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Computer prices fell 2.8 percent. Their cost, along with the
cost of many other manufactured goods, have been declining, helped
by a reduction in the cost of imported parts caused by Asia's
sharp currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
However, the department noted that inflation remains strong in
certain services. Airline fares rose 2 percent in March and were
4.5 percent higher than a year ago. Education costs which include
tuition, fees, books and childcare, climbed up by 0.6 percent and
were 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report released today by the Commerce
Department, retail sales unexpectedly declined 0.1 percent in
March, pulled down by drops in the sale of autos, building
materials and furniture. The monthly figure followed healthy gains
of 0.7 percent in February and 1 percent in January. Sales were
helped in the winter by unseasonably mild weather.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Decline in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales dropped
0.1 percent in March, but generally speaking remained healthy, the
Commerce Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the retail sales amounted
to some 218.4 billion U.S. dollars, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The February retail sales increase was revised to 0.7 percent
from 0.5 percent, which followed a huge January jump of 1.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly drop was blamed mainly to sales of durable goods,
including hardware and furniture, which took a relatively small
0.4 percent hit compared to big gains of 1.4 percent in January
and 0.8 percent in February, when shoppers were lured by
post-Christmas sales and warmer-than-usual weather.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the weather, high consumer confidence in a strong
economy that has been marked by low unemployment and inflation
have supported retail sales this year.
</P>
<P>
In March, sales of nondurable goods, such as clothing and food,
were up 0.2 percent, rising for the third straight month.
</P>
<P>
Department and specialty stores sales were up 0.2 percent in
March, after an increase of 1.4 percent in February. Clothing
sales specifically rose 1.4 percent following a 1.2 percent
February gain.
</P>
<P>
Grocery stores also posted a 0.2 percent sales increase in
March after a rise of 0.4 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Demand at hardware and garden supply stores has been helped not
only by good weather this year, but also a plunge in mortgage
rates which touching off a boom in home sales. They reported a 0.6
percent loss in March, only a slight drop from February's huge 1.7
percent gain. Furniture store sales were also down 0.6 percent,
after going unchanged in February.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales were down 0.7 percent after a 0.9 percent pick-up in
February.
</P>
<P>
Sales at gasoline service stations also continued on a downward
trend, dropping by 1.4 percent in March along with prices brought
down by plentiful world supply.
</P>
<P>
Restaurant and bar sales were down 0.2 percent after a 1.2
percent increase in February.

<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese leader Li Ruihuan
has called on leading officials at various levels to study
theories on social sciences, at the same time acquiring knowledge
of the natural sciences and professional skills.
</P>
<P>
The national focus on economic expansion and the policy of
using science and education to revitalize the nation have
encouraged more people who are engaged in natural sciences to
assume leading positions, Li said, adding that as leaders at
various levels, they must have rich knowledge in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many of the current problems have resulted from
vague understanding of theories on social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li, a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, made the remarks in a speech delivered on
Monday at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Addressing trainees studying the theory and practice of the
united front work and multi-party cooperation, Li emphasized the
importance of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and enhancing their
Marxist level.
</P>
<P>
He urged trainees to take full advantage of their time at the
school to nurture good reading habits and raise their analytical
competence.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which commenced on March 30, has attracted the
participation of leaders of China's non-Communist parties and

MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday ordered Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to finalize the
ratification of the START-II nuclear weapons treaty with the State
Duma (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin resubmitted the START II protocol, which was signed by
Russia and the United States on September 26, 1997, to the Duma on

</P>
<P>
The protocol is an inseparable part of the START II treaty,

The treaty, including the protocol, met Russia's interests,
said presidential spokesman Serger Yastrzhebsky.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- France denied on Tuesday that
Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha will be allowed to
attend the 1998 football World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no such a request, nor invitation," said French
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper Observer said that Abacha was determined
to attend the World Cup Football matches in France in June and
July, because football is highly popular in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abacha would take advantage of this in his presidential
campaign if he put himself forward as a civilian candidate, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) imposed sanctions against Nigeria after
 the military junta executed nine Ogony minority leaders,
including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the EU has decided to grant an exemption to the ban on
travel to EU countries by Abacha, after the Nigerian national
football team qualified for the World Cup finals in France.

ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces have
staged a new operation in the border area near Iraq in a bid to
wipe out rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said warplanes took off from the military bases in
Diyarbakir and Erhac, southeastern Turkey, early Tuesday morning
to bombard the regions of Beste, Dereler, Senoba and Ortabag and
Cudi and Dugun mountains near the border, where PKK militants have
been seeking shelters.
</P>
<P>
No information about the casualty is so far available, said
the agency.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the security forces captured Semdin Sakik and his
brother Hasan Sakik, two leading members of the PKK, in Dohok in
northern Iraq and brought them back to Diyarbakir, the center of
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting a separatist war since 1984
in eastern and southeastern Turkey. They sought shelters in
northern Iraq after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was rendered
ineffective in controlling the area in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 people, including PKK militants, government
troops and civilians have been killed in conflicts since PKK

<HEADLINE> Cloning Can Cure Parkinson's, Alzheimer's Diseases: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Cloning techniques could lead to
a cure for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and even mend
broken spinal columns, Professor Ian Wilmut, the scientist who
cloned "Dolly" the sheep, said in Melbourne on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The medical benefits of cloning had been overshadowed by fears
that it would be used to reproduce human beings, as depicted in
the film Boys from Brazil, Wilmut said at the beginning of a
conference on cloning at Melbourne's Monash Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a frightening technology - these sort of Boys from
Brazil scenarios belong on the TV screens," Wilmut was quoted by
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the film Boys from Brazil, a group of latter-day Nazis try
to clone Adolf Hitler from the cells taken from the dictator's
body.
</P>
<P>
"If we can contribute to a treatment for Parkinson's disease, I
would be proud of that," Wilmut said.
</P>
<P>
"So many things in life have got this double edge. Now, I don't
have any doubt that the potential from these technologies ... is
far greater for good than for bad."
</P>
<P>
Wilmut gained international fame when his team from the Roslin
Institute in Edinburgh successfully cloned Dolly from a ewe's
mammary cell.
</P>
<P>
Dolly was now approaching her second birthday and was expecting
her first offspring in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Wilmut said cloning would not extend human life by very much.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will have a very long lifespan, but what it
would mean is that we would have a chance of a fuller life," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wilmut said he did not lie awake at night worrying about
possible abuses of the technology he helped to invent.
</P>
<P>
Professor Alan Trounson, deputy director of Monash University's
Institute of Reproduction and Development, which is hosting the
conference, said that among the possible applications were
regenerating damaged and diseased cells, repairing broken spinal
columns, treating Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and
possibly wiping out malaria.
</P>
<P>
Some of these breakthroughs would be made within the next 10
years, the professor added.
</P>
<P>
Supported by scientists and sociologists, many governments have
adopted a very cautious approach towards the issue by banning
government funding for human cloning research.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the United
States would probably ride out much of the Asia crisis, but the
American markets were vulnerable to a major fall in the stock
markets. This assessment was contained in a survey of world
economics, published as finance ministers from around the world
were arriving in Washington to evaluate the effect of Asia's
currency shocks.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton and the First Lady gave 840,000
dollars from the proceeds of Mrs. Clinton's best-selling book "It
Takes A Village" to charity over the last two years, their tax
returns show. The 1997 tax returns also showed that the Clintons
reported income of 569,511 dollars and paid 91,964 dollars in
Federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. Monday said they
would join forces in a 60 billion-dollar merger to create a
banking behemoth that would cast a shadow over all but a few
megabanks and usher in a new era of nationwide banking.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's personal lawyer launched a broadside at
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, charging in a letter
released Monday that Starr cannot "credibly or appropriately"
investigate allegations that key White-water witness David Hale
was paid off by conservative activists.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Air-safety initiatives are to be announced by Vice-president
Gore and other officials Tuesday as the administration outlines

pressing problems facing the industry. It focuses on crashes into
high ground, engine failure, loss of pilot control, and safety in
the cabin.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China To Tighten Management of Ephedrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to tighten the
management of ephedrine, the primary material for manufacturing
the drug known as "ice", as part of an extensive effort to ensure
the health of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 United Nations Pact which banned the smuggling of
narcotics and hallucinatory drugs listed ephedrine as one of 22
chemicals subject to strict controls.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China, a major producer and exporter of
natural ephedrine, has witnessed increasing collaboration between
domestic and international drug-trafficking rings.
</P>
<P>
The rings have established either joint ventures of private
chemical manufacturing enterprises which either smuggle ephedrine
or derivatives out of the country or engage in the illegal
production of "ice".
</P>
<P>
A recent notice called on governments at all levels to punish
enterprises engaged in the illicit manufacturing of ephedrine in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that the government will retain the right
to buy and sell ephedrine, and will introduce a system designed to
tighten controls on the production, trade, use and exportation of
the product. Related Customs offices will handle exportation
procedures.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Tuesday denied
reports that the Gulf small emirate was contacting with Iran to
conduct joint military exercises in the Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters, Kuwait's first Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber said
no contacts have been made with Iran to hold joint Maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
He said that "there is a possibility of Iranian-GCC contacts in
this regard, but we have not conducted any such contacts."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Menafi Rodsari,
Iranian commander of navy military drills which started Sunday, as
saying recently that "some GCC states informed us of their wish to
hold joint naval exercises."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) groups Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have been
warming up since the start of last year after nearly two decades

</P>
<P>
Iran said that the strategy of the new government of President
Mohammad Khatami is to develop good neighborly relations on all
spheres with the GCC states.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Educational Authorities Keep Geomancy Away From Campus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Educational authorities in southern
China's Guangdong Province disapproved the practice of teaching
geomancy in universities and are considering a rectification of
college curriculums in the province.
</P>
<P>
A provincial educational official said that geomancy has
superstitious color, therefore it is improper to open
geomancy classes at universities that hold science and technology
as the highest principles, according to Monday's Yangcheng Evening
News which arrived here today.
</P>
<P>
In China, many people hold that the location of a house or tomb
is supposed to have an influence on the fortune of a family. The
practice of geomancy was eradicated as superstition after the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and went with
it the geomancers.
</P>
<P>
In its last Friday issue, the Yangcheng Evening News reported
that a university in Guangzhou, the provincial capital, has opened
a class called "geomancy and architecture" since last year which
has attracted a growing number of students.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not give the name of the university.
</P>
<P>
The educational official pointed out that curriculums'
designing should follow the principle of fostering proletarian
outlooks and right value judgements while teaching contents
should be wholesome and scientifically reliable.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong for the university to open geomancy class and
impart the immature or even superstitious theory to the
students. Such a doing runs counter to the state principle," the
newspaper quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The educational department will conduct a check on the
teaching programs of colleges and universities in the province and
will resolutely cancel those that are detrimental to the healthy
development of the students, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Launch S.O.S. Program for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola will launch a S.O.S.
Program for Children to protect the children's rights, Angola's
National Institute of Children said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program stipulates that all Angolan people have the rights
and responsibilities to report on any abuses of children, Manuela
Coelho, Chief of the Children Protection Office of the institute,
said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Manuela said that the S.O.S. program protects all children in
Angola, no matter they are street children or they are living
with parents.
</P>
<P>
She said that the National Institute of Children will work
with the national police, churches and the non-governmental
organizations in Angola and abroad to form a joint commission and
to take joint actions with them to protect children from unlawful
persecutions.
</P>
<P>
As to the few police officers who assaulted the street
children physically, Manuela said that the police authority will
punish these officers and those who abused the rights of
children.
</P>
<P>
Everyone in Angola should report in time on the violations of
children's rights so that the proposed joint commission can take
effective measures to punish those who abuse the children's
rights, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
While implementing the program, she said, the national
institute will carry out broad campaigns to make every family
aware of what rights their children enjoy and how to protect
these rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institute will provide vocational education for
the street children so that they can master a kind of skills to
live by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged civil wars in the southern African country have
orphaned nearly 70,000 children, most of whom are often wandering
in the streets.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Is Much Safer: Earthquake Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese seismologists say here
today that an earthquake measuring 4.7 on Richter Scale hit
Tangshan today but will have no near-term, major impact on Beijing
and neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
"Aftershocks following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake are normal,
with slight tremors being nothing more than part of an expected
series," according to Ding Jianhai, a senior expert with the
Earthquake Warning Center attached to the State Seismological
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale devastated
Tangshan on July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the aftershocks of a strong quake will
last from several years to several decades. However, more than 94
percent of the overall energy of the 1976 quake had dissipated by
the end of that particular year," according to Ding.
</P>
<P>
"More than 20,000 aftershocks have occurred since 1976 however,
with the strength ranging from strong to weak."
</P>
<P>
"Today's quake released more energy and, at least to a certain
degree, we can say that Beijing and neighboring areas are much
safer than before," said Ding, adding that there is only a remote
possibility that the region will be hit by destructive aftershocks
measuring above five on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The SSB center forecast today's quake as early as March 26, and
pointed to the possibility that quakes measuring between four and
five on the Richter Scale would hit Tangshan or neighboring areas
in the first half of this month.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and neighboring areas are home to China's most advanced
earthquake monitoring network which can record slight quakes
measuring as low as one on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists are closely monitoring crustal movements around
Beijing. In addition, more than 1,000 earthquake monitoring and
warning centers across the country are monitoring quakes
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
The SSB provides monthly and weekly data analyses on crustal
movements in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Region and areas in and
around the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
"Seismologists work around the clock," according to Ding.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan May Achieve Wheat Production Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- There is hope Pakistan would
achieve its planned wheat production target of 18 million tons set
for this year, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"But we will give our exact estimates by the first week of
May," Abdul Sattar Lalika, minister for food and agriculture and
livestock, told reporters late Monday night in Karachi, Pakistan's
largest city, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan boasts 22 million hectares of fertile land,
but still has to import wheat in large quantity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope his country would become self-sufficient
in wheat by the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the target could be achieved by increasing the per acre
yield of the crop.
</P>
<P>
"We plan institutional help to farmers so that they could take
care of their wheat crop," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government is also making all-out efforts to cut the food
import bill by half in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's consumption of wheat has been increasing steadily
due to a growing population. Wheat production last year was about
15 million tons and the country imported 4 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Harbin Auctions State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Cao Guangliang, mayor of Harbin in
northeast China, announced here today that the city government
plans to auction property rights of 123 small- and medium-sized
state-owned companies to local and foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
The firms with a total value of 3.26 billion yuan, come from
the light industry, textile, machine-building, chemical,
electronics, pharmaceutical and food processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine of the companies have debt ratios of 60 percent or
more, with other 33 suffering from debt ratios below 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The auction is the first of its kind ever held in Harbin,
capital of northeastern China's Heilongjiang Province. More
state-owned enterprises are likely to be auctioned in coming
years, according to Cao.
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted that related companies fall into three
categories, including some which feature efficient operations and
low debt levels. He said related companies seek additional funding
needed to carry out technological upgrades and increase output.
</P>
<P>
In the second category, according to Cao, are companies which
are operating efficiently and enjoy good market prospect, but
nonetheless need to restructure operational mechanism, expand
their production scales and upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>
He defined the third category as poorly operating firms which
suffer from high debt ratios, but which nonetheless boast large
tracts of land, equipment and skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted that the city government has formulated 40-odd
preferential policies for potential buyers, including personnel
issues, property management and debt, as well as land, taxation
and levies.
</P>
<P>
Investors will be permitted to use various forms to purchase
related companies, including partial purchases and down payments,
as well as barter agreements. They will also be allowed to
complete transactions using either cash or bonds.
</P>
<P>
Local economists noted that the move will remove some small- to
medium-sized state-owned companies from the state sector and will
at the same time reinvigorate related firms and promote ongoing
efforts to restructure the sector.
</P>
<P>
They also point out that it will help create new opportunities
for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Harbin is one of China's oldest and largest industrial
bases.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raises Exchange Rate for Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- In order to save badly-needed
foreign capitals, Iran announced Tuesday to raise the foreign
exchange rate for tickets of all airlines to prevent more Iranians
from traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory office in charge of airline companies and
airport affairs affiliated to the National Aviation Organization
has issued a directive to raise the exchange rate to 4,750 rials
against one U.S. dollar instead of the previous rate of 3,000
rials, Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The new rate will go into effect as of May 1 for a six month
period, IRNA said, adding that the directive is retroactive and
includes all the tickets issued before May 1 for travels after
that date.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) also raised
the rate for the dollars sold to Iranians traveling abroad from
3,000 rials to 4,800 rials, pushing the rate in the black market
as high as 6,300 rials to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary foreign travels by Iranian citizens should be
prevented in order to save the country's limited foreign
currencies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
With drastic fall in oil revenue as a result of oil price drop
last year, the Iranian government is hard up for foreign capitals
to meet domestic demands and pay its foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> China Formulates Plan to Curb Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China has formulated an ambitious
plan to curb soil erosion on 50,000 sq.km. annually in each of the
next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on soil conservation projects on the
Loess Plateau, upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and
desert areas in north China, according to Tong Weili, an official
with the Ministry of water Resources.
</P>
<P>
China is currently faced with soil erosion problems affecting
some 1.95 million sq.km., including 450,000 sq.km on the Loess
Plateau and 500,000 sq.km in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
The nation has lost nearly three million ha. of cultivated land
to soil erosion in recent decades. Desertification has also
affected over 200,000 sq.km., with deserts encroaching on
additional 160,000 sq.km. due to soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Tong noted that the most effective methods for controlling soil
erosion centers on planting trees and building terraced
fields. Statistics for the past five years show that the country
has built more than 11 million ha. of terraced fields which have
increased the grain output by some 12.75 billion kg annually.
</P>
<P>
China's water and soil conservation program has also included
the afforestation of over 50 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Tong pointed to difficulties in funding and welcomed
international cooperation. He also pointed to major achievements
thus far achieved in related efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nepali New PM Outlines Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister-designate
Girija Prasad Koirala said Tuesday that law and order will be his
top priority and the new government will try to address the issue
of insurgency of the ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have stepped up their campaign in recent months
and about 135 people have been killed since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told the press at a tea party attended by political
leaders and MPs that inconsistency of policies, code of conduct
for elections and unemployment would also be on the top agenda of
the new government.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, who was named prime minister Sunday by King Birendra
following the resignation of Surya Bahadur Thapa last Friday, will
assume office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said he would try to reach consensus with all the political
parties and run the government with their cooperation, and would
try to win the confidence of the people.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would help attract foreign investment to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Due to failure to find a ruling partner, the Nepali Congress
(NC) led by Koirala, the largest party in the lower house of
parliament, has decided to form a minority government on its own.
</P>
<P>
Coalition or minority government is a choice facing the
political parties in the lower house after the mid-term polls in
November 1994 produced a hung parliament where no single party
holds a majority.
</P>
<P>
After taking office, Koirala will have to obtain a vote of
confidence in the House.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and some parties have decided to
support Koirala.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa resigned in accordance with an agreement he
had reached with the NC, one of his ruling partners, before he
took power last October. The deal committed him to vacating the
premiership for the NC to head a new government.

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt Japanese Companies Leave Behind Huge Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Bankrupt Japanese companies left
behind 15.1 trillion yen (116.3 billion U.S. dollars) in debt in
the 1997-98 fiscal year ending March 31, a record since the Second
World War, a leading credit research agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The private Tokyo-based Teikoku Databank Ltd. said in a monthly
survey that debt was 65 percent higher than the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The number of corporate bankruptcies rose 17.4 percent to
17,439, the highest in more than a decade, it said.
</P>
<P>
The research firm attributed the soar in bad debts to a weak
Japanese economy and troubled financial system, which has made
banks reluctant to extend new financing.
</P>
<P>
"Turbulence swept through the Japanese economy in fiscal 1997
as a result of the decline in domestic demand, extremely sluggish
private consumption, the failures of general construction
contractors, disorder in the banking community and the credit
crunch," said the agency.

<HEADLINE> Net Profit of HK's TGI Insurance Quadrupled in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Top Glory Insurance
(TGI) announced Tuesday that the company recorded a 325-percent
net profit growth in 1997 despite the fact that the recent Asian
financial turmoil has brought about monetary fluctuations
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
TGI Executive Vice Chairman and President Andrew Yang told a
press briefing Tuesday morning that the company's net profit in
1997 was 31 million HK dollars (3.97 million U.S. dollars) and its
total premiums amounted to 1,315 million HK dollars (168.59
U.S. dollars), a rise of 47 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, the number of in-force policies of TGI accumulated
to 226,000, which represents a 20 percent year-on-year growth,
and the total assets rose 44 percent to two billion HK dollars
(256.41 million U.S. dollars), Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the company's achievement to its prudent
financial management.
</P>
<P>
"We have implemented certain strategic plans to withdraw our
investments in Southeast Asia prior to the Asian financial turmoil
which successfully eliminate any adverse impact caused," Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
Top Glory Insurance, incorporated in 1985, is the largest
Chinese funded life insurance company in Hong Kong managed by a
team of home-grown professionals.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, TGI has become the third largest life insurance
company in Hong Kong following two foreign funded companies.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's press briefing, Yang said that the company's
activities in China's inland areas are developing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
It won approval to establish representative offices in Shanghai
and Guangzhou in 1997, further strengthening its position in
China's inland areas, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
TGI also worked with the People's Insurance Company of China on
various agency management training programs, Yang added.

said today that he would have in-depth exchange of views with
government leaders in Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on
issues of common concern during his upcoming official good-will

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in separate meetings with Japanese

Both Japan and ROK are good neighbors of China, Hu said, adding

the two countries. He would also have wide contacts with people
from all walks of life in the two countries during the visit, he
added.
</P>

soon after taking the office as Chinese vice-president.
</P>
<P>

effect to the all-round reinforcement of ROK-China friendly

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Mourns Mine Disaster Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has sent condolences to the bereaved families of miners who lost
their lives in Arusha in northern Tanzania, Dar es Salaam
newspapers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have received with profound shock and grief reports of the
disaster at Mererani mines," said the president in his message
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who was on a state visit to China, urged the bereaved
families to be tolerant during the hard time of mourning.
</P>
<P>
He was also relieved to hear that some of the victims were
rescued and commended those who facilitated the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
At least 90 miners were trapped as far down as 300 meters
after a downpour caused a landslide on April 10 at a Tanzanite
mine in Mererani, some 40 km southeast of the Arusha town.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanite is a semi-precious stone unique to Tanzania and is
mined using relatively primitive methods, often without safety
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The rescue team has gathered a list of 55 people known by
authorities to have entered the mine who were missing and
presumed dead, said the Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel ole
Njoolay.
</P>
<P>
But the death toll could be higher since more miners might
have entered the area to work illegally. Four bodies had been
retrieved by Monday by the poorly equipped task force while 21
lucky miners were rescued by their colleagues who responded to
SOS calls.
</P>
<P>
Although the Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel Njoolay, has
managed to get some pumps to suck out water from the 14 collapsed
pits, the rescue operation urgently needs more pumps, as well as
bulldozers and caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay said a team of experts failed to reach the disaster
area because of the floods which has made roads impassable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arusha Regional Medical Officer, Dr. N. Ole
King'ori, has expressed his fears that rotten bodies could
trigger an outbreak of cholera and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, Frederick Sumaye, visited Arusha Sunday
and ordered all mining activities in the disaster area to be
stopped until rescue operations are completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved 10 more special tribunals for the trial of suspects
responsible for failed banks, The Punch newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources from the Federal Ministry of Finance

tribunals will be located in Abuja, Jos, Kaduna and Ibadan, and
will be inaugurated very soon.

addition to the current eight, is an obvious response to the
concerns expressed by some sectors of the society over the slow
prosecution of suspects.
</P>
<P>
The report said some of the bank chiefs facing the tribunals
have been held for about two years without a clear resolution of
their cases.
</P>
<P>
In response to the widespread of distress in the country's
bank sector, the Nigerian government promulgated the failed banks
and financial malpractices in banks decree in 1994, which
provided for the establishment of special failed banks tribunals.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report, over 400 suspects have been
arrested since then, while a loss of seven billion naira (over 80
million U.S. Dollars) has been recovered.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has signed a trade
agreement worth 25 million Namibian Dollars (five million U.S.
dollars) a year with Democratic Republic of Congo President
Laurent Kabila during one of his visits last year, said a report
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Namibian Finance Minister Nangolo Mbumba,
responding to a question last week on whether the Namibian
government had loaned Kabila money, said Kabila approached the
Namibian government about borrowing the equivalent of 25 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said his treasury was empty after being plundered by
the late Zairean president Mobuto Sese Seko, Mbumba said.

the Democratic Republic of Congo since Mobuto was overthrown in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government offered to facilitate trade worth 25
million Namibian Dollars, telling Kabila it was not in the
position to lend him money, Mbumba told the National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leaders Meet Over Tehran Mayor's Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- It seems that only the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will be able to ease, if not
end, the political struggle involving the detention of the Tehran
mayor, according to a conservative newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami, Chief Justice Mohammad Yazdi,
Parliament Speaker Al Akbar Nateq-Nouri and Chairman of the State
Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani called on Khamenei Sunday
night after they failed to reach a compromise over Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi's case.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times quoted an informed
source as disclosing that at the meeting, Khatami strongly
advocated the release of the mayor. Yazdi opposed the release and
argued that the concerned judge has already turned down the appeal
for his release.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Karbaschi's all-out support in the presidential
elections, Khatami won a landslide victory over Nateq-Nouri, a
conservative leader who had Yazdi's support.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-led judiciary detained Karbaschi on April 4
on charges of embezzlement and mismanagement in Tehran
municipality, triggering a new round of factional struggle
between the moderates headed by Khatami and the conservatives led
by Yazdi and Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's supporters said that the charges and his detention
was politically motivated and was a retaliation to Khatami's
victory in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In order to quell the growing factional struggle, Khamenei
summoned the four leaders last Wednesday night and asked them to
solve the issue through close coordination. The four leaders met
on Saturday but failed to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion, the source said, Yazdi suggested
that none but the leader, using his constitutional authority, can
issue order for Karbaschi's release.
</P>
<P>
The source, who was not identified in the report, said "both
Mr. Khatami and Mr. Yazdi or either of them should write a request
to the leader for revoking the detention order."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran Times quoted another source as saying that
there was difference of opinion among the cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
As Karbaschi's close allies, government spokesman Ataollah
Mohajerani and Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri strongly attacked
the judicial authorities for detaining the mayor, according to the
newspaper. Nouri even set up a center to display the achievements
of Tehran municipality during Karbaschi's mayoralty.

<HEADLINE> Sending Children to Armed Forces Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) is strongly opposed to the recruitment of children into
armed forces or sending them into combat situations of any kind.
</P>
<P>
This should be considered a war crime by the proposed
International Criminal Court (ICC), UNICEF's Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said in a statement here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whether children are assigned to combatant or supposedly
non-combatant roles, they are vulnerable to the horrors of war and
to manipulation by adult soldiers and commanders," said she. "To
allow this to continue would constitute a complete violation of
child rights."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is making its views known now as a contribution to the
ongoing public debate which will culminate in formal consideration
of the ICC at a conference in Rome, Italy this June.
</P>
<P>
The proposed court would look into cases that involve alleged
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It would be a
permanent international body, rather than an ad hoc tribunal, such
as those established by UN Security Council resolutions in Rwanda
and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF wants an optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child to raise the minimum age of military
recruitment from 15 to 18. To her disappointment, Bellamy said,
the international community has not yet adopted it.
</P>
<P>
"We still hope to achieve this optional protocol and that this
change will be reflected in the statutes of the ICC."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF also stressed that the proposed ICC should act against
recruitment regardless of whether children are used as front-line
combatants or in support roles, such as messengers, drivers or in
other capacities.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that places where children should be safe
and protected are being targeted in hostilities," Bellamy
said. "The ICC should give a clear signal that atrocities
committed against children will not go unpunished."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that on any given day there are 250,000
children under the age of 18 involved in armed conflicts around
the world, according to UNICEF.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President's Case Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Former South African state
president P. W. Botha appeared in the George regional court in
the Western Cape province Tuesday morning before the case was
postponed, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The case was originally postponed for one hour but as talks
between the opposing legal teams continued, the postponement
dragged on.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a chance the parties may resolve their
differences," Botha's advocate Lappe Laubscher said.
</P>
<P>
After the postponement, TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu told
reporters: "We are still waiting. The negotiations are going on."
</P>
<P>
He said he had received a report from the TRC's legal team.
</P>
<P>
The important thing was that all the TRC wanted was for Botha
to appear before it. "And that is all we have said. We do not
seek to humiliate him (Botha), we do not seek to prosecute him."
</P>
<P>
Media reports speculate that the talks between Botha's legal
team, the TRC and Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn are
likely to save Botha the embarrassment of a conviction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act,
Botha could face a fine of 20,000 Rand (4,000 U.S. Dollars)
or/and two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Botha has agreed to appear before the TRC
if the charges were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Before the postponement, Laubscher said the TRC never had the
authority to summon Botha to appear at a hearing on December 19
last year.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the TRC's life was extended only on December 10
last year. Therefore the commission had no authority on December
5, 1997, to call on any person to appear before it on any date
subsequent to December 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the commission had never taken a valid
resolution to summon Botha, because a meeting to do this had
never been duly convened.
</P>
<P>
Laubscher argued that only four of the 17 TRC commissioners
had attended a meeting on December 19 which dealt with Botha's
appearance before the TRC. This did not constitute a quorum, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC laid charges against Botha after he failed to appear
before it for a third time last December.
</P>
<P>
He was subpoenaed to give evidence on the activities of the
former State Security Council which he chaired at the peak of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Botha and the TRC flared up when he told an
Afrikaans newspaper in mid-November last year that he would
rather be prosecuted than cooperate with the TRC.
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old Botha, who was president between 1984 and
1989, refused to apologize for his government's apartheid
measures and accused the TRC of being a revenge camp against the
Afrikaaner. He also called the TRC a "circus".

<HEADLINE> Abacha Won't Resign for Election, Says Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Head of the Nigerian military
government, General Sani Abacha will not resign to contest the
August 1 presidential election, his special adviser, Alhaji Wada
Nas has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Cable News Network (CNN) Monday night, Nas,
the former Internal Affair Minister said it is the wish of
majority Nigerians that Abacha should run for the next civilian
president.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Abacha will run as a general or a civilian, the
special adviser said, "he (Abacha) will as General Sani Abacha".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue of Abacha's silence on his intention,
Nas said, "...when the time comes he will come openly and tell
Nigerians his intention. So there is no hurry."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on the CNN was Gambo Lawan, Chairman of the
Grassroots Democratic Movement (GDM), one of Nigeria's five
registered political parties.
</P>
<P>
Lawan criticized the U.S. President Bill Clinton for excluding
Nigeria from his recent six-nation African tour, saying that
Clinton should have encouraged Nigeria by at least stopping by to
show his concern on Nigeria's trying period.
</P>
<P>
In his words, Nigeria is now having its trying period, just as
the U.D. was during the civil war, so "all its friends...should
rally around Nigeria in its trying period to ensure that Nigeria
succeeds in its democratization process."

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF Rebels to Meet Again for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) peace negotiators will meet anew
next week to continue discussions on the identification and
recognition of MILF controlled areas in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Tuesday quoted MILF spokesman and
chief negotiator Ghadzali Jaafar as saying that the MILF will push
forward the subject at the talks to be held on April 22-23 in
Cotabato city to prevent skirmishes between government troops and
MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, MILF military affairs chief Al Haj Murad threatened
that the MILF will boycott peace talks unless the government
includes the issue inside the agenda of the next round of peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The existing ceasefire agreement we signed with the government
would not be effective unless the government recognizes our
territories because military troops can always attack our camps
out of a slightest provocation from either side," Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The government ceasefire panel, chaired by Southern Command
chief Major General Joselin Nazareno, proposed that the government
will only apply "hands-off" policy on two MILF major camps in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF claimed to have 13 major camps and 20 satellite camps
in Mindanao and they wanted the government not to encroach in such
areas to prevent skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has replaced the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
as the country's largest rebel group after the MNLF signed a final
peace agreement with the government in September, 1996.

TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister
Price Saud Al-Faisal will visit Iran soon to deliver Saudi king's
invitation to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to visit Riyadh,
Iran's newspaper Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source was quoted by the paper as saying that
Al-Faisal would confer with senior Iranian officials, including
Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on bilateral
relations and regional issues. But the source did not say when the
Saudi foreign minister would visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Khatami would visit Saudi Arabia to
finalize the agreements already reached between the two countries.
However, no specific time of Khatami's visit to Riyadh was given.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-Riyadh ties warmed up following the election of
Iranian President Khatami last May and were pushed forward by the
eighth Islamic summit held in Tehran last December.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani visited Saudi
Arabia in February.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Unemployment to Reach 13.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 13.4 million people, or
nearly 15 percent of Indonesia's 90 million-strong workforce, will
be unemployed by the end of March next year, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
The current monetary crisis, which has brought many enterprises
on the brink of bankruptcy, is the main cause of the increasing
unemployment in the country, Minister of Manpower Theo L. Sambuaga
was quoted as saying by the "Jakarta Post" daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said after meeting President Soeharto Monday that
4.8 million of those projected to be unemployed would be carried
over from last year, while another six million would be young
people entering the job market for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
Government officials predicted last week that the economic
crisis, which started in July last year, would likely force the
economy to contract five percent this year.
</P>
<P>
They said the economy needed to grow at least five percent
annually simply to absorb the millions of young people entering
the job market each year.
</P>
<P>
A labor expert warned Monday that the actual unemployment
situation could be far worse than indicated by official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Government statisticians define employment as at least two
hours of work per week.
</P>
<P>
Payaman J. Simanjuntak, an aide to the minister of manpower and
a labor economics lecturer told a seminar Monday that the number
of people working less than 35 hours a week was estimated at 31
million, while the number of people working less than 14 hours a
week was put at seven million as of the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
With the economic situation worsening, the disguised
unemployment rate will likely increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
Theo said the government is allocating 598 billion rupiah (75
million U.S. dollars) to finance labor-intensive projects
nationwide for unskilled workers who have lost their jobs because
of the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The projects, set up as part of the government's social safety
net scheme to cushion the impact of the economic crisis, include
cleaning up river and gutters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his office was also working on a scheme to
channel some 65,000 skilled workers to work in rural cooperatives.

SINGAPORE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) lost another 25.36 points to close at
1561.55 points on Tuesday.
</P>

Dealers said that the stock prices fell because investors
awaited lower prices and market-moving incentives. They said that
with shares having rebounded from their bottom in recent weeks and
the market at fair value, buying interest was lackluster.

One broker said that there was no reason why investors should
rush into the market to buy stocks, unless they see a further

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The far-right National Front is fully established in the
southern region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, which was a hotbed of
fascism in the 1930s and maintains a tradition of radicalism and
populism which seduces the working class and the wealthy people as
well.
</P>
<P>
-- The government force of Cambodia is now controlling Anlong
Veng, the headquarters of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas which is 16
kilometers from the Thai border. The government troops bombarded a
hill on Monday north of Anlong Veng, where the last group of some
200 guerrillas, including Ta Mok and Pol Pot, are holding out.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In a report published in Washington on Monday, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) condemned the plan by the French
government to implement 35-hour work week plan. IMF said the
reduction of work hours by law will aggravate the problem of
structural unemployment rather than bring it down. Without naming
France, the report said that the failure by Europe to reform its
labor market is clearly the "Achille's heel" for the project of
European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, the president of the
far-right National Front Jean-Marie Le Pen said that to adopt the
single currency euro means "abdication of the independence of
France."

<HEADLINE> Industrial Businesses Lack Strength to Increase Investment: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent study by the People's
Bank of China of 5,000 industrial manufacturers found that quite a
few would like to increase investment, but can't do so, today's
"China Securities News" reports.
</P>
<P>
Market demand and fierce competition are the main reason for
increasing investment, but government interference caused a great
deal of perplexity in the past. And 38 percent of the enterprises
believe that the lack of proper fund-raising channels is the main
thing blocking investment. About 37 percent of the money losers
were unable to raise funds by themselves and couldn't get bank
loans easily. Some enterprises with a certain amount of
accumulated capital could not get the required 30 percent of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for not investing this year include unfinished
construction projects, unclear investment prospects, no proper
investment projects, and restructuring of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
One proposal is for a quick study of fund-raising methods
applicable to different enterprises and a multi-faceted
fund-raising system.
</P>
<P>
Government departments need to establish investment
consultants, acquaint companies with scientific and technological
developments, and to direct companies in their investment and
publish investment information on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises also need to be encouraged to keep improving
product quality to meet market demand, the study says.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate up by 50 Percent This Year in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate increased by
50 percent in the first three months of this year, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All state chief police officers have been instructed to take
action to reduce the 53.2 percent increase in the crime rate to
38,987 cases for the first three months this year compared with
that for the corresponding period last year, Bernama quoted Kuala
Lumpur chief police officer Kamaruddin Mohamed Ali as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the crimes, especially petty thefts, reported
in Kuala Lumpur, involved addicts or ex-addicts, Kamaruddin said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the ways to reduce the crime rate is to
eradicate drug activities.
</P>
<P>
"If we (the police) can reduce the number of addicts, the
number of minor crimes like motorcycle and bicycle thefts and
house breaking will automatically be reduced too," he was quoted
as telling reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
The police officer said more policemen would be deployed to
conduct more frequent patrols to keep the crime rate down.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day conference for state chief police officers which
ended last Friday, Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor
gave them two months to find ways to reduce the crime rate.

<HEADLINE> No Casualties Reported from Minor Quake in Tangshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Shijiazhuang, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A minor earthquake measuring
4.7 on the Richter Scale hit Tangshan City in north China's Hebei
province at 10:47 a.m. today, and no casualties were reported so
far.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebei Provincial Seismological Bureau, the
epicenter was at Guye District of Tangshan City, which is at 39.44
degrees north latitude and 118.27 degrees east longitude.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yunqi, an office director of the bureau, said some chimneys
and old walls in the city's Dongkuang (Eastern Mining) District
tumbled or collapsed, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The watchtower of a jail at Pijiadian also toppled, he added.
</P>
<P>
In some apartment buildings, thermos bottles and TV sets fell
to floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that no houses have been found collapsed so far.
</P>
<P>
After the quake, staff members of the Seismological Bureau
of Hebei Province rushed to the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
The situation is normal in Tangshan, where the life of local
residents was not affected.
</P>
<P>
The quake was within the scope of the main areas under constant

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Talks Extended for Two More Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from North and South
Korea today agreed to stay here two more days for their first high
level contact in four years, though they are still far apart on
terms for the South's fertilizer assistance to the North.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed in principle that the South gives us
fertilizer, but we have yet to narrow differences on details,"
Chun Kum Chul, counsellor of the Administration Council of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), today said at his
first news briefing since the talks opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chun, also head of the five-member DPRK delegation, said, "We
agree to continue the talks," but the schedule for the next round
of talks is yet to be fixed today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Prior to today's third round of full meeting between the two
sides, Chun said the talks might end today. A chartered flight,
which is said to have been on stand-by to take the DPRK delegation
home, left Beijing for Pyongyang earlier today.
</P>
<P>
However, Jeong Se Hyun, vice-minister of the National
Unification who heads the delegation of the Republic of Korea
(ROK), said today's talks "made no progress".
</P>
<P>
The North wants the South to provide half a million tons of
fertilizer, while the South would give no more than 200,000 tons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want some reciprocity here. The North cannot go away with
fertilizer, " he said, adding the South insists the fertilizer
supply be linked to progress on the issues of reunion of separated
families and envoy exchange.
</P>
<P>
The North should agree on a timetable for establishing a
reunion site and a mail exchange centre on the inter-Korean
border, Jeong said.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the talks claimed, "Although the talks were
proceeding in a very hard way and have produced no tangible
results, it is of great symbolic meaning after the two sides were
cut off by a hiatus of nearly four years."
</P>
<P>
Today's talks started at 10:10 and ended at 12:20, followed by
two news briefings given respectively by Chun and Jeong, which
lasted about two hours.
</P>
<P>
The landmark Beijing talks follow an inconclusive second round
of Four-Party Korean peace talks, which ended in Geneva on March
21 after six days.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Loan to Philippine Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank (ADB) Tuesday approved an additional loan and equity
investment of up to 4.8 million U.S. dollars to a private
oleochemical company in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The ADB assistance will help Primo Oleochemicals Inc. start up
commercial operations of a plant that converts coconut oil into
oleochemical products for the domestic and export markets, the
bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The bank sees its participation in the project as an important
contribution to the industrial development in the rural areas of
the Philippines. The project will generate export earnings by
processing coconuts produced by millions of farmers in the country
and benefits will be shared with rural communities," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the ADB also agreed to restructure and
reschedule its existing loans to the company, but it did not
reveal the amount of the existing loans.

<HEADLINE> Projects Implemented to Develop Lake Region in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Lake Basin Development
Authority (LBDA) has made contributions to the national economy
and food security in the country by implementing various
agricultural projects in recent years, according to a Daily
Nation report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A small scale fish farming project is set to start at a cost
of more than 2 million U.S. Dollars with a view to improving the
standards of living of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Fish farmers in the region are being trained by the authority
on modern farming techniques while more than 20 million
fingerlings have already distributed to local fish farmers.
</P>
<P>
Under its Livestock Development Project, LBDA has provided
good quality dairy cattle to farmers in order to increase milk
production which stands at 1.5 million liters annually as a
result of the project.
</P>
<P>
The authority has already established livestock multiplication
centers in Migori, Busia, Kisumu, Gungoma and Rachwonyo
districts.
</P>
<P>
A Poultry Development Project is being implemented with LBDA
providing broiler and pullets to farmers and the project is aimed
at establishing a hatchery with a capacity of one million chicks
per year.
</P>
<P>
The authority is also undertaking a Western Kenya Rain-fed
Rice Project which covers 12,000 hectares in 10 districts at a
cost of more than 6.6 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are provided with credit and inputs, and assured
of a market for their produce.
</P>
<P>
To promote rice production in the region, the authority has
put up a milling complex with a capacity of 24,000 tons every
year.
</P>
<P>
LBDA plans to establish demonstration plants for brick and
tile making in all districts in the region, providing high
quality but low cost building material for local people.
</P>
<P>
LBDA set up in 1979 is charged with the responsibility of
planning, co-ordinating and implementing development projects in
the Lake Victoria catchment area covering Nyanza and Western
provinces and parts of the Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
The area covered by the authority has immense natural
resources which, if properly developed, could make the region one
of the country's richest areas.

<HEADLINE> European Banks Ready to Lend More to ASEAN Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- European banks are ready to
provide fresh loans to help ASEAN countries overcome the regional
currency turmoil and to enhance their presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries are suffering deteriorating credit ratings, many
European banks are still studying what strategies they will take
in managing possible risks when making further inroads into the
ASEAN financial market, according to a just-concluded survey of
market possibilities for European banks.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted recently by The Nation newspaper, quoted
European businessmen as saying that most European banks with ASEAN
exposure have offered medium-size loan facilities of between 5
million to 10 million dollars to corporate borrowers.
</P>
<P>
With a "balanced credit-decision process" precondition,
cash-flow lending and certain-project financing were still
available to ASEAN borrowers, they said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that many European banks were wary of the
volatility of the ASEAN financial market and wanted to take
precaution.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing a borrower's ability to repay, lenders should
focus on the company's ratio of earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization over its interest expenses and
payments on other current bank debts, the survey suggested.
</P>
<P>
To ensure continuing profits in a volatile region, some
European businessmen have proposed the setting up of a
risk-control department with no profit responsibility which would
report directly to the head office or board of directors,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The department should be manned by high-caliber individuals
capable of withstanding enormous pressure, said a market analyst.
</P>
<P>
"A risk manager should understand the importance of the whole
banking process, marketing versus control," he said.
</P>
<P>
For cash-flow loans, lenders should assume that any long-term
loans must be rolled over in the next two years as well as 50
percent of short-term loans, excluding trade facilities, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
It said the key principle for successful lending in ASEAN was
that collateral should never be viewed as a prime source of
repayment and mortgages on commercial properties should always be
viewed as unsecured loans.
</P>
<P>
Lenders should be assured that funds can't be used to bail out
ailing affiliates and that they have contingencies for
foreign-exchange devaluation, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Interruptions Hit AT&AMP;T Data Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Serious interruptions Monday
hit a data network of AT&AMP;T, which was used by hundreds of
multinational companies to send computerized information between
offices.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T described the interruptions as the worst ever for the
company's frame relay network, the largest in the United
States. It said that the problems started about 3 p.m. EDT and
were nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The cause has not yet been identified, though analysts
speculated that a software error could have caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
Companies would use the network to connect branch offices to
each other and to headquarters -- and to connect computer
terminals to central databases. The network also carries
electronic mails and documents.
</P>
<P>
Airlines, banks, travel agencies, insurance and credit card
companies were among those possibly affected.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 6,000 companies have frame relay
networks. AT&AMP;T, on a revenue basis, has 40 percent of the market.

<HEADLINE> Relief Distribution Starts in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Relief workers in Zamboanga city,
the southern Philippines, Tuesday started the distribution of
goods and other materials for those affected by the El Nino
drought.
</P>
<P>
The workers, from the City Social Welfare and Development
Office, said the goods will be distributed to already identified
beneficiaries in 14 villages hardest hit by the drought.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare officer Francisco Barredo said no politicians
will be allowed in the process in case they will "buy votes" for
the coming May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
The southern Philippines had been plagued by the drought
brought about by the El Nino abnormal weather phenomenon since
early this year. It was reported that at least 42 people had died
of hunger due to food shortages.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Misamis Oriental provincial government
asked for 30,000 bags of rice from the National Food Authority to
help those affected in the food crisis.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Sell Windows 98 June 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. will begin
selling Windows 98, the next generation Windows operating system,
on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade will cost the same as Windows 95 with a suggested
retail price of 109 U.S. dollars, but likely will be sold for between
89 and 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the product has been widely anticipated. It is
intended to fully integrate the company's Internet browser technology
with the Windows operating system, a market in which the company has
a commanding share.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the U.S. Department of Justice has been
examining whether to block the release of Windows 98 because
Microsoft has integrated the browser into Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft is in effect forcing computer manufacturers to ship
its browser, in violation of antitrust law. But Microsoft claims
that it has the right to add new features to the operating system,
and that Web browsing is one such feature.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Island Province Doing Better After Several Years Of Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The economy of China's Hainan
Province has finally improved after a decade of economic ups and
downs and bottoming out and local people have become more
sober-minded after paying dearly for their shortsightedness.
</P>
<P>
The island province is China's youngest and its largest special
economic zone and had fairly rapid economic growth in its early
days. In 1992, it reported a 40.2 percent increase in its GDP, but
that number plummeted to 4.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic change was attributed to the bubble economy, with
its overheated real estate sector. By the end of 1993, there were
an astonishing 480 firms in the real estate business, or a tenth
of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
An immediate result was that many buildings remained
uncompleted and went to waste because of a lack of industrial and
individual customers and the empty shells were occupied by
transient laborers.
</P>
<P>
By 1993, provincial officials began to feel the ill effects of
this overheated growth, and started some macro-economic
restructuring to turn Hainan into a new industrial center, a more
efficient tropical agriculture base, and a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the years of corrective measures began to pay off
when, last year, the province reported a GDP rise of 6.7 percent,
lower than the national average level but still a sign of
recovery. And for the past few years, the island has had
double-digit growth in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Some major industries are being formed in petrochemicals,
automobiles, beverages, food, chemical fiber, textiles,
pharmaceuticals, paper pulp, and building materials.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province had 7.9 million tourists, a number that
is larger than its population, and had 6.16 billion yuan in output
value.
</P>
<P>
Most important, the people of Hainan have given up the old
dream of getting rich overnight and are using more down-to-earth
methods. One change has been putting infrastructure like highways,
ports, airports, and telecommunications higher up on the list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
A decade may be a fairly short period in Chinese history, but
it was long enough to give Hainan a lesson about having a longer
period of economic development, experts say.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen atom bombs have been found
in the Incirlik air base in Adana, southern Turkey, Hurriyet, a
leading Turkish newspaper, reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the bombs, which have nine times destroying power
than those dropped in Hiroshima, Japan during the Second World
War, are now under the control of the U.S. troops stationed in
the base.
</P>
<P>
This has been confirmed by a report prepared by several
experts with the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Committee, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, however, did not say when the atom bombs, which
can be dropped by B-61 bombers, were deployed in the air base.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that they might be part of the U.S. military
deployment in the Middle East during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities concerned are reportedly discussing with
the U.S. side how to dispose of these powerful weapons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build Better Image for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism industry is to
use more than one million U.S. Dollars to help restore its past
glory abroad between now and end of June, according to a Daily
Nation report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting chaired by Minister for Tourism and Wildlife
Henry Kosgey, participants agreed that the money would be used as
a short-term strategy to promote Kenya as a preferred tourist
destination in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister who just returned from a promotional tour in
Europe told the meeting that some tour and travel operators
abroad had expressed willingness to assist in marketing Kenya
through brochures, posters and electronic media.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kenya Airways had volunteered to offer 75 free
seats to journalists and travel writers so that they can visit
Kenya and ascertain the actual situation in the East African
country.
</P>
<P>
As a long-term plan, the meeting recommended that a total of
10 million Dollars would be required almost immediately during
the 1998/99 financial year to aggressively market the country.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the tourism industry, Kenya will take some
measures including a national tourism conference to be held soon
to map out suitable strategies which would prepare the sector to
compete more effectively with their rivals in other African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and
Caterers showed that hotel bookings in Kenya's coast fell by more
than 50 percent in the first two months this year compared with
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hotels in the South Coast of Mombasa recorded booking of 35.2
percent in January compared to 73.9 percent for January last year
while February figures showed a drop from 72.3 percent to 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in Kenya has suffered a sharp decline
since the second half of last year because of the political
violence in Mombasa prior to last year's General Election, the
post-election killings in the Rift Valley Province, disease
outbreaks in parts of the country and a general breakdown of the
infrastructure caused by the El Nino-induced heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Tourist Board had predicted losses amounting to some
283 million Dollars by July this year and said that the industry
was now at the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry, the biggest foreign exchange earner for
Kenya, earned the country 433 million Dollars in 1996 and the
figure dropped to 133 million Dollars last year.

LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka police have uncovered
another house where stolen vehicles are stripped for parts and
later resold, Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe as
saying Monday that police following a tip from the public raided
the house in the capital city of Lusaka but the owner fled
through the backyard before police could apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
Seven vehicles and a combat military jacket were found in the
house.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that police failed to use fire arms when
the suspect fled from the house because it was during day time
and there were so many people, who may have been injured if
police opened fire.
</P>
<P>
Last week, police raided the home of Mudu Gwiza Handa and
discovered a number of cars suspected to have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe also confirmed that police has received reports of
a possible syndicate involving police and Handa has since
re-instituted the investigating team.

South Korean airliners to expand their commercial activities through
code-sharing and airplane leasing.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-Singapore Water Pact Not Affected by Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday the water shortage in parts of the
country will not affect the Malaysia-Singapore water agreement.
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think so. We have enough water. The water shortage
is in some places. So far there is no drying up of catchment areas
that supply to Singapore, so there is no problem," he said when
replying to questions from reporters after addressing a seminar on
Virtual Reality at Seri Kembangan near here.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are scheduled to sign an agreement for
Malaysia to extend water supply to the island republic beyond 2061
upon expiry of existing contracts signed in 1961 and 1962.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia supplies 214 million litres of raw water daily to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The new water agreement was discussed by Mahathir and his
Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong during the latter's visit to
Kuala Lumpur in February and again at a bilateral meeting during
the recent Asia-Europe Meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said then that the two countries were nearing
agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who visited
Singapore last week, said the fundamental issues on the new water
agreement have been resolved, and that Malaysia was committed to
ensuring adequate supply to Singapore but the terms would be
discussed later.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, water shortage has been reportedly
experienced in a number of areas including the federal capital,
affecting some one million people.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Biggest Opposition Party to Contest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's largest opposition
party, United National Independence Party (UNIP), which boycotted
the country's general and presidential elections two years ago,
has agreed to participate in the forth-coming local government
elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the party cadres at a gathering held Monday in
Livingstone, the country's southern border city, UNIP Chairman
Malimba Masheke said that his party has finally agreed to
participate the polls scheduled for late this year, Zambia Daily
Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNIP, the former ruling party under the leadership of former
President Kenneth Kaunda, boycotted the 1996 general and
presidential elections because Kaunda was disqualified as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Masheke told the UNIP cadres that the change of stance by UNIP
is that they would like to put things right through the ballot,
while asking them to be geared for the elections.
</P>
<P>
He noted that boycotting local government elections will mean
allowing the ruling Movement for Muti-Party Democracy (MMD)
government to continue with "one-party state type of governance".
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, UNIP District Secretary Robert Munkegami
advised all UNIP members to prepare for the ballot battle, adding
that the UNIP cadres should go flat out to sensitize members
about the new development.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that all party cadres are out in the provinces to
ensure that the party is very strong at the grassroots and gets
majority of the seats in local governments.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the ruling MMD has never been strong at the
grassroots and the opposition should take advantage of the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants Talks With IMF, WB reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Nigeria has
been canvassing the reopening of talks between the country and
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the
Medium-Term Economic Program (MTEP), the Daily Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its belated economic report for the first half of last
year, the central bank said the country should reopen negotiation
on the MTEP so as to get realistic debt relief.
</P>
<P>
It would also boost the inflow of foreign direct investment
into the country's economy, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Unless a major step is taken to put the MTEP talks back on
course, the existing high debt obligations would continue to have
adverse effects on the economy, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The MTEP is a major condition required by both the IMF and
World Bank from heavily indebted countries before such nations
could qualify for debt relief package.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is expecting to obtain a clean bill report from the
two institutions to enable it to conclude negotiation with the
Paris Club of creditors on debt cut.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club portion of Nigeria's external debt is estimated
at 27 billion U.S. dollars, which accounts for more than 65
percent of the country's total foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, the country has not been able to achieve breakthrough
in its efforts due to lack of agreement on few grey areas of the
MTEP, which the bank did not disclose.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the economic program which has been on for
over four years was stalled by the government's reluctance to
abolish the dual exchange rate and achieve full deregulation of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, in the half-year report, also claimed that
the dual exchange rate "has tended to foster speculative
influence that could undermine the gains already made in foreign
exchange management".

LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Development Fund
under the European Union has decided to offer Angola a package of
aid totaling 200 million U.S. Dollars by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Salvador Rodrigues, an EU official was quoted by Angolan News
Agency as saying Tuesday that about 45 to 60 percent of the money
would be used in the economic development programs in southern
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Huila Province would be the focus of the aid among the six
provinces in southern Angola, with the restoration of
agricultural production, the security of food, reconstruction of
schools, hospitals and tap water systems, and roads high on the
aid list, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
The key in revitalizing the economy in the province, he said,
is training of qualified personnel for economic construction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The southern province, with ample rains and agreeable climate,
used to be an agricultural base in the country, producing more
than enough grain and vegetable for its own consumption.
</P>
<P>
Huila has been a key target for EU aid.

KAMPALA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Cholera deaths increased from 28
last week to 68 in district of Bundibugyo, western Uganda, The

</P>
<P>
The total cases of the epidemic also increased from last
week's 598 to 1200, said Edward Masiga, the Resident District
Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The drastic death increase is contributed to lack of medical
care for the local people.
</P>
<P>
Medical staff in the district said people in the mountains do
not have drugs at all. Local hospital and other health facilities
have been overwhelmed by the sharp increasing number of patients.
</P>
<P>
Masiga appealed for an emergency medical help to cope with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic was caused mainly by contamination of water
sources. Recent rains in the area damaged poor sanitation

<HEADLINE> S. African Cellphone Giant to Promote Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South African cellular
network giant, Vodacom, has planned to invest 2.5 billion Rand
(500 million U.S. Dollars) in increasing its network capacity
this year.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom, which is 50 percent-owned by state-controlled
telecommunications utility Telkom, said the money would be spent
mostly on infrastructural equipment, the Business Report daily
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The investment was entirely self-funded, Alan Knott-Craig, the
chief executive of Vodacom, was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom and MTN, another existing cellular network operators
in South Africa, are growing exceptionally despite the threat of
a third, or even fourth, cellular network licence being granted
this year.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom has just reached its one million milestone in active
users. MTN, its only rival, recorded about 850,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Both networkers are adamant they will not carry the new
cellular network, which may be issued to black empowerment
bidders.
</P>
<P>
Some studies indicate that the cellular industry in the
country has enough room for more than two cellular network
operators.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Economic Turmoil, Direct Result of Virtual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday the current economic turmoil
experienced by Asia today was a direct result of the application
of virtual reality to business and making virtual business
possible and real.
</P>
<P>
"Where before, we have to deal in real money, goods and
services, today none of these are really necessary and there seems
to be no limit to the amount of business that can be done and
profits made," he said at a seminar and workshop on "Virtual
Reality" organized by University Malaysia Sarawak at Seri
Kembangan near here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that unfortunately, in the process, real money,
real jobs and real business can be very badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Currency trading is a very good example of how "virtual money
can be used for trading and considerable real profits or losses
made," he said, apparently referring to Asian economies severely
affected by speculative currency attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said, "In currency trading, a trader can
borrow millions of units of any currency without actually taking
or handling the money (with) figures changed on the computer
screen to show that the money has been borrowed."
</P>
<P>
The trader then sells the currency by recording the transaction
on computers and this change appears on the screen on all the
computers in the trading room of banks and currency traders, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, the trader can buy the currency without actually
taking possession of the currency...only the figures on the
computer screen change to record the transaction," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the rule of the game devised by the currency's traders
nowadays, the value of currency depreciate every time it is sold,
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said in normal commodity trading, the price remains so long
as there is a willing buyer and willing seller, but currency
traders dealing with virtual money are not constrained by the
supply of the currency.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said vast sums of money can be borrowed, sold and
bought without a single coin or note becoming involved or in other
words, the money traded was virtual not real.
</P>
<P>
"It is not surprising that in one day 1 trillion U.S. dollars
are traded, that is, about 20 times the trade in goods and
services worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said although the trading is in virtual money but the effect
of devaluation is very real. To date whole countries and regions
are impoverished due to currency trading and in some cases by 400
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Approached by reporters after addressing the seminar, Mahathir
said the Malaysian economy, which was seriously affected by the
current economic turmoil in Asia, is already gaining strength with
effective interest rates and the tight credit situation easing
slightly.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of the economy are not so much a natural
phenomenon, but more on how we manage it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Tourism Becoming Part of Northwest China's Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of foresters
in China's Shaanxi Province are replacing logging with forest
tourism as the way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, forest tourism earned the province more than 20
million yuan, a year-on-year growth of nearly 50 percent, helping
the local economy a lot, government sources say.
</P>
<P>
The province is cut in two by the Qinling Mountains, whose rich
biodiversity supports 12 rare species of animals like the panda
and dozens of primitive plants.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province put more than 50 million yuan into 200
scenic forest spots and, by year's end, had 10 nature reserves, 34
forest parks with 126,000 hectares that are useful for tourism.
</P>
<P>
At the Fengyu Forest Park, for example, one cooperative
four-million-yuan deal built the Dabagou Forest Vacation Mountain
Villa, raising its annual income from 300,000 yuan to 2.25 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another example was a state-owned tree farm on Taibai Mountain
where 40 workers who made a living from logging, turned the farm
into a forest part in 1991 and repaired its historical sites. In
1997, the park had nearly 300,000 visitors and earned 6.44 million
yuan, encouraging 235 other state forest farms to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, forest parks alone spent 1.16 million yuan on
environmental protection, and now, more of them are joining the
effort to protect the local ecosystem in order to attract more
visitors.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Clothing Popular With Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some Tibetan herdsmen have turned
to selling clothing on Bargor Street, the commercial center of
Lhasa, Tibet's capital, because of its popularity with tourists.
</P>
<P>
One woman, Ngawang Qozen, sold more than 10,000 items of
Tibetan clothing and various jewelry and ornaments in 1997,
bringing her 100,000 yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
An industrial and commercial official on Bargor Street says
that these sellers have been successful because of the increasing
number of tourists and the changing ideas about business.
</P>
<P>
A man who runs an arts and crafts shop says that he had an
income of 140,000 yuan in 1997 from home-made Tibetan clothing and
dress adornments.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans used to make these adornments only for their personal
use, according to Cering Puncog, a handicraft expert, who started
increasing the production scale of his company several years ago
to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
According to one official, sales of Tibetan clothing are
increasing at an annual rate of 30 percent, with sales in Lhasa
last year valued at more than 90 million yuan for the first
time.

<HEADLINE> Drought Adversely Affecting Spring Planting in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A drought has been threatening
the farmland of northeastern China, the country's leading grain
base, since early spring.
</P>
<P>
The major part of northeastern China and the eastern part of
Inner Mongolia recorded less precipitation and higher temperatures
in April, resulting in a lower amount of soil moisture, according
to a recent agricultural forecast.
</P>
<P>
The region received little rainfall after summer and autumn of
last year although there was a little precipitation in mid-March,
and western and southern parts of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces
received no more than 4 mm. of rainfall, while Liaoning and Inner
Mongolia recorded no rain at all. Temperatures in the region were
as much as three to seven degrees higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the moisture in the topsoil of the southwestern
part of the plain between the Songhua and Nengjiang rivers and in
many parts of the plain between the Songhua and Liaohe rivers has
been anywhere from 30 to 55 percent, and some areas had a layer of
dry soil 3 to 5 mm. thick.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists have asked farmers to change the ratio of acreage
for dry farming and paddy rice and to promptly fight the drought
when planting.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Collection Fails to Reach Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh collected 96.94 billion
taka (about 2.107 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue in the first
nine months of the 1997-98 fiscal year, 7.46 percent short of the
targeted 104.76 billion taka (about 2.277 billion dollars), a
press report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, represented a rise of 10.23 percent over
that in the July-March period of the last financial year.
</P>
<P>
The government has fixed the target of revenue collection in
the current fiscal year beginning July 1, 1997 at 150 billion taka
(3.26 billion dollars), but may not be able to achieve it as there
are only three months left, The Independent, a national English
daily, reported.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the total shortfall in revenue
collection at the end of the fiscal year might exceed 10 billion
taka (0.217 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in revenue collection may ultimately force the
government to go for a large-scale borrowing from commercial banks
to meet the governmental expenditure, the report quoted a Finance
Ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will have to slash the Annual
Development Plan drastically to keep the expenditure within the
limit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government had restructured taxes on different items
through upward revision in the middle of the fiscal year, and it
is now not willing to go for further escalation of taxes prior to
the budget for the next fiscal year and the donors' mid-term
review meeting scheduled for mid-May, the report added.

<HEADLINE> More Forest Fires Hit Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 740 forest fires occurred
across Vietnam from late last year to April this year, the Vietnam
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires damaged nearly 11,200 hectares of plant
coverage, including 7,600 hectares of forest, a six-fold increase
over last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is being blamed for causing the adverse weather that
has hit the country since late last year.
</P>
<P>
The hot spells and low rainfall that have frequented the
central highlands and southern regions for months are expected to
last until June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Vietnamese officials warned that fires remain a
threat to almost all the country's 10.3 million hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
At a conference held in Ho Chi Minh City last weekend,
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Cong Tan urged taking
drastic measures to cope with forest fires.

<HEADLINE> R &AMP; D Spending Up by 6 Percent in Singapore Last year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall spending on
R &AMP; D (Research and Development) increased by six percent from the
amount in 1996 to reach 1.9 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 and the country is to continue its
efforts to attract R &AMP; D investment.
</P>
<P>
According to a Straits Times report on Tuesday, Singapore is
expecting to attract about 1.14 billion Singapore dollars (about
712.5 million U.S. dollars) in research and development investment
commitments this year, the same amount as last year, despite the
regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was the amount of money companies were likely to commit to
R &AMP; D, and which could be spent over several years, the report
said. The Singapore National Science and Technology Board (NSTB)
said that this was expected to be maintained because R &AMP; D is a
long-term investment which companies need to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
NSTB Chairman Teo Ming Kian said that like any other sectors, R
&AMP; D would not escape the impact of the currency turmoil. But he
said he believed that most companies would still be looking long
term and would see it as a capability development of the future.
</P>
<P>
As for last year's R &AMP; D investment, the NSTB noted that local
enterprises accounted for 58 percent of investment commitments,
with electronics receiving the biggest share of 50 percent of the
total sum.
</P>
<P>
Singapore gross expenditure on R &AMP; D is expected to reach two
percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2005, the
NSTB said. At present, however, Singapore's gross expenditure on R
&AMP; D accounted for 1.33 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
This showed that Singapore is still behind countries like
Sweden (3.02 percent in 1995) and Japan (2.84 percent in 1994),
the NSTB noted.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Hopes for Equal Cross-Continent Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries
hope the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (ALCA) will
benefit all countries involved.
</P>
<P>
ALCA will be a major topic of the Second Summit of the Americas
to be convened on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the summit, which will last for two days in the
Chilean capital of Santiago, will negotiate the ALCA agenda.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the fast development of trade and economic
relations between the European Union and Latin America, the
U.S. proposed creating ALCA at the First Summit of the Americas in
Miami in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. presented an agenda in Miami, proposing the year 2005 as
the deadline for the establishment of ALCA.
</P>
<P>
Amid economic globalization, most Latin American countries have
positively reacted to the U.S. initiative. Thirty-four countries
across the continent are expected to join ALCA.
</P>
<P>
ALCA, which will embrace a population of more than 700 million
and a total gross domestic product of 10 trillion dollars, will become
the biggest free trade zone in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the agenda faces strong opposition from some Latin
American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, two important
economies in the region and members of Mercosur (Common Market
of South America).
</P>
<P>
Brazil proposes that interests of all member countries should
be taken into consideration, instead of favoring some members.
</P>
<P>
It says different levels of economic development among member
states should also be considered.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and Argentina insist that Mercosur join the
negotiations as a regional bloc in order to strengthen its
position and negotiating weight.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur members, namely Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay, wish to keep their identity and insist that ALCA should
not be just an extension of Nafta (North America Free Trade
Agreement).
</P>
<P>
Mercosur says that existing bilateral and regional agreements
should be form the basis for future negotiations of ALCA, and ALCA
regulations should be compatible with those of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the ALCA scope must be well-balanced, applying
no trade barriers against non-ALCA nations.
</P>
<P>
Other Latin-American countries also differ with Washington over
the negotiation schedule, suggesting that health regulations,
environment and labor laws, rather than trade barriers, should be
discussed first.
</P>
<P>
Another interesting topic at the Second Summit of the Americas
would be when U.S. congress will grant the "fast-track" authority
to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Latin American nations believe that the fast-track dispute
between the White House and the Capitol Hill will affect the trust
of other countries in the perspectives of ALCA negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The fast-track authority allows U.S. congress to simply approve
or reject trade agreements negotiated by the government, but not
amend them.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export in terms of
U.S. dollar in March continued to rise, and the country recorded a
trade surplus of 138 billion baht (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars)
in the first quarter, according to figures released by the Customs
Department available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of exports in March was 4.65 billion, compared
with 4.49 billion in February and 4.28 billion in January.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent appreciation of the baht caused export
value in baht terms to fall to 198 billion baht in March, compared
with 220 billion baht in February and 219 billion in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports value in baht declined to 156.95 billion
baht last month, compared with 169.03 billion baht in February and
173.69 billion baht in January. The trade surplus in March was
41.1 billion baht compared with 51.8 billion baht in February.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the record low of 57 baht against the green back
in mid-January, the Thai currency bottomed out to the recent 40
baht against the dollar.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry has set the target to export 210,000 workers overseas
next year, according to the Bangkok Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The export of Thai workers to foreign countries is aimed at
easing the mounting unemployment caused by the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The ministry planned to draw about 100 billion baht (2.5
billion U.S. dollars) into Thailand from labor exports next year.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the ministry has worked out ways to boost
the export of workers such as giving incentives to registered job
placement agencies which can find overseas jobs for many workers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has contacted many commercial banks to grant
low-interest loans to Thai workers wanting to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the ministry, a total of 10,550 Thai
workers applied for overseas jobs with the ministry in January
this year and 12,236 workers in February.

<HEADLINE> Newly-discovered Altar Provides Ancient Chinese City Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered the ruins of an imperial sacrificial altar near Datong
city in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the imperial sacrificial altar will help them
locate the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534).
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Emperor Xiaowen of the
Northern Wei Dynasty moved the capital to Pingcheng. However, the
exact location of the 1500-year-old city remained a mystery,
despite of many excavations in northern Shanxi since the beginning
of the century, archaeologists say.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered ruins, 2.5 kilometers to the southeast of
Datong, could provide an outline of the ancient city, they say,
since buildings used for ceremonies at that time were usually
built in the southeastern part of the capital.

Mexico, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala Foreign Minister Eduardo
Stein said Monday that Guatemala hoped the Summit of the Americas
to be held in Chile will be the starting point of negotiations on
the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
He believed the summit would promote negotiations on setting up
the FTAA. He said negotiations between the economic groups would
be the ideal way to establish the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
All the economic groups, the Rio and Andean Groups, the South
American Common Market, the Central American Common Market and The
Caribbean Community should have their own voices in joining the
FTAA.
</P>
<P>
The coming summit would symbolize the beginning of broad
negotiations between the economic groups, the minister said,
speaking in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
At the first summit of the Americas, held in December 1994 in
Miami, in the United States, leaders from 34 American countries
committed themselves to establishing the hemisphere-wide free
trade area by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
A consensus document on establishing the FTAA is expected to be

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has been making some progress in stopping its farmland from being
eaten up in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province lost 12,900 hectares
of farmland in 1997, but that was 33.7 percent less than in 1996
and the lowest amount in the years after 1991.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a number of measures like putting a
freeze on plans to turn counties into cities and making a thorough
check of land used for non-agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
Henan is one of China's leading agricultural centers and
produced 38.95 million tons of grain in 1997, accounting for eight
percent of the nation's total grain output.

<HEADLINE> Dry Spell Threatens Paddy Harvest in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Paddy farmers in Malaysia
are facing the prospect of failed harvest due to the prolonged dry
spell.
</P>
<P>
The drought is threatening to destroy 20,000 hectares of paddy
fields within the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA)
region in the northern state of Kedah and another 9,400 hectares
of paddy fields outside the MADA region in the state, a major
national newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MADA area alone can produce an average 80,000 tons of rice
annually.
</P>
<P>
The English Daily "New Straits Times" quoted state Agriculture
Committee Acting Chairman Abdul Razak Hashim as saying Monday the
MADA region had received only 133mm of rainfall for the first
three months this year compared to 304mm during the same period
last year and the average of 208mm over the last 62 years.
</P>
<P>
The report said the dry spell was expected to affect some
12,000 MADA farmers and 10,000 others.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 paddy planters in North-West Selangor and Sabak
Bernam areas are in dire straits as they could not cultivate some
5,000 hectares of land due to the drought, according to the
federal government's Deputy Agriculture Minister Tengku Mahmud
Mansor.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia produces 72 percent of its annual rice needs, but
might be forced to import more if the drought persisted, he said.

WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday that he has not yet decided whether to visit
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with George Mitchell, the Northern Ireland peace
mediator, at the White House, Clinton told reporters that he has not
consulted Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Northern Ireland's political parties about
a visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
"If it would help, of course I would be willing to go," Clinton
said. But he suggested that the decision should be made by British
and Irish leaders.
</P>
<P>
"If they think I should go, and they've got the biggest stake
and the closest sense of the public, I would be happy to do it.
But I have not decided to do it and it's really completely up to
them," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
In mid-May, Clinton is scheduled to attend the summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations plus Russia in
Birmingham, England. There has been much speculation that he would
visit North Ireland during that trip.
</P>

U.S. officials and congressmen expect Clinton to visit
Northern Ireland to generate support for the implementation of

<HEADLINE> Philippine International Reserve Reaches 11 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank's
gross international reserve (GIR) has risen to 10.8 billion U.S.
dollars due to new borrowings and the issuance of global bonds.
</P>
<P>
Business World Tuesday quoted Central Bank governor Gabriel
Singson as saying that the new GIR level includes 750 million
dollars from the recently concluded club loans from 15
international banks and a 500 million dollar infusion from the
government's global bond.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he was happy with this GIR level and it is enough
for the country's imports. However, analysts said that the amount
was not enough for three-months' imports, an international
standard to measure whether a country has adequate GIR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singson added that he has received a new offer from
New York-based Chase Manhattan to issue a 250 million Euro
seven-year benchmark that will make the Philippines the first
Asian country to have access to the European market.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reiteration of the confidence of the banking
community on the country... and this attests to the
credit-worthiness of the Central Bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chase Manhattan's offer came just after the country
successfully launched its 500-million-dollar global bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' GIR reached its highest level of 12 billion
U.S. dollars in March last year. But to defend the peso which
depreciated sharply in the financial turmoil starting last July,
the Central Bank sold large sum of dollars in the foreign exchange
market, having the GIR fallen to a low of 8.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Currency Expected to Appreciate Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso, which has
been recovering during the past two months, is expected to
appreciate further against the U.S. dollar since it remains
undervalued by about 18 percent, says a U.S. financial firm.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Tuesday, the U.S.-based Morgan
Stanley said that the gradual appreciation of the peso puts
Filipino exporters in a more competitive position that should also
further shore up Philippine exports in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
From 26 pesos to the dollar before the currency crisis hit East
Asia last July, the currency plunged to a low of 46:1 earlier this
year but has since then gradually appreciated to the present 37-39
pesos to the dollar range.
</P>
<P>
The influential U.S. financial house said the peso is likely to
remain undervalued even with the Philippines' inflation forecast
at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Philippines will emerge from the current
East Asian financial turmoil as the least affected among the
region's economies.
</P>
<P>
While other countries are asking the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for economic bailout packages, the Philippines exited
from IMF tutelage on March 28 after 35 years of supervision by the
Fund.

SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first steel pop-top cans
production line has begun work in the city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It was built at a cost of 30 million U.S. dollars by a joint
venture of the Baoshan Steel Works Group, which owns 70 percent,
and French and Dutch partners who hold the rest. Key parts of the
line were imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
It can produce 1,800 cans per minute for China's soft drinks
market. In a two-month trial operation, it produced more than 8
million steel pop-top cans for two big soft drinks companies in
China.
</P>
<P>
When a second production line is installed in the near future,
the company is expected to be able to produce 1.6 billion pop-top
cans annually.
</P>

Compared with aluminium pop-top cans, the steel cans cost low

WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson may return to the
ring in November if Nevada boxing officials give him back the
license they revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears, an
adviser to Tyson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wald, who has been advising the former heavyweight
champion since his split with promoter Don King, said a November
date would probably be the earliest Tyson could fight again
because of time needed to train and put together a fight.
</P>
<P>
Tyson can apply for reinstatement July 9, the first anniversary
of his license being revoked by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission for biting Holyfield in the third round of their June
28 heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
Wald, though, said no decision has been made on whether Tyson
will reapply for his license immediately. Earlier, he said it
might be late August or early September before Tyson asks for his
license back.
</P>
<P>
Nevada boxing officials say they have heard nothing from Tyson
or his new advisers on a possible bid for his boxing license. If
Tyson is rejected by the commission, he would have to wait another
full year before reapplying.

MADRID, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Albert Costa of
Spain came from a set down to beat Nicolas Lapentti at the
Barcelona Open tennis tournament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Costa eventually mastered the wind to beat the Ecuadorian 4-6,
6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
But the tricky conditions helped unseat two seeds, Andrei
Medvedev and Fabrice Santoro who went out to Spain's Roberto
Carretero and American Jeff Tarango respectively.
</P>
<P>
Carretero, a qualifier, bridged a gap of nearly 300 places in
the world rankings to beat 1993 winner Medvedev of the Ukraine and
clock up his first tournament win since last year's French Open.
</P>
<P>
He won 7-6, 7-6 over the 11th seed while Tarango beat Frenchman
Santoro, seeded 10, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Doubles specialist Francis Roig's reward for a 6-1, 3-6, 6-4
victory over fellow Spaniard Julian Alonso was a second round
clash on Tuesday with number one seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov.

<HEADLINE> Merger Creates First National U.S. Banking Franchise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- BankAmerica, the biggest bank
in the West and third-largest in the United States, and the East
Coast powerhouse NationsBank Monday announced a definitive
agreement to merge.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which establishes a company with 570 billion
dollars in assets and a market capitalization of 133 billion
dollars, will create the first truly national United States
banking franchise.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 to 8,000 employees from the new bank's
180,000-strong workforce will be reportedly laid off. As
BankAmerica would move its corporate headquarters from San
Francisco to NationsBank's corporate officers in Charlotte, North
Carolina, San Francisco mayor Willie Brown said that this would be
a shock to the city's economy and he would meet with his economic
advisors to talk about the impact of the merger.
</P>
<P>
But BankAmerica confirmed that its large global banking
operations will stay in San Francisco. Operating in 39 countries,
the bank is one of the world's strongest international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Merger mania has swept the financial industry in the United
States over the past three years. Banks, brokerage firms and
mutual fund companies have paid record prices for each stocksage,
and their stocks have risen to new highs.
</P>
<P>
In a separate banking merger, Bank One Corp. is combining with
First Chicago NBD corp. in a 29.8 billion dollars union to create
the dominant bank in the country's Midwest.
</P>
<P>
In an area of intense global competition among financial firms,
BankAmerica executives believe that the merge with NationsBank can
save hundreds of millions of dollars and strengthen their products
and services by merging on a huge scale.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1904, BankAmerica with assets of 258 billion dollars
has 1,900 branches in the country's 11 states and business offices
in 47 states. NationsBank, founded in 1847, has 300 billion
dollars of assets and 1,931 branches.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
bounced back above 9,000 Monday, shaking off early losses with
help from a new round of stunning bank mergers that lifted a key
component.
</P>
<P>
At around 1:00 pm, Dow was down almost 70 points. It finished
the day with a gain of 17.44 at 9,012.30. It was the only close
above 9,000 since the average of 30 blue-chips first passed that
milestone a week earlier with a record close at 9,033.23.
</P>
<P>
After NationsBank and BankAmerica announced plans to create the
nation's first coast-to-coast bank and First Chicago NBD and Banc
One said they would merge and create a dominant Midwest bank,
banking shares rose broadly. Among the big gainers for the Dow was
J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators were mostly lower in active trading
but finished above their lows for the day.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled 563.91
million shares, slightly higher than Thursday's modest 546.42
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 0.98 to 1,109.69, and
the NYSE composite index fell 0.58 to 577.77, but the Nasdaq
composite index rose 4.69 to 1,824.93.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.48 to 479.56,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index fell 2.29 to 738.32.

<HEADLINE> Few U.S. Parents Aware Kids Using Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Parents in the United States
recognize the severity of the drug problem, but few sincerely
believe their children are exposed to drugs, said a report
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study found that there was a
"dramatic gap" between what the children were doing and what their
parents thought of them.
</P>
<P>
While 21 percent of parents thought their teen-age children
might have used marijuana, 44 percent of the teens surveyed said
they had tried it.
</P>
<P>
The study found that only 43 percent of parents think it would
be easy for their children to find marijuana while 58 percent of
teen-agers say it would be easy to get it.
</P>
<P>
Also the report said a third of parents said their teen-agers
viewed marijuana as harmful, but only 18 percent of the teens
surveyed said it was.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, 71 percent of the teen-agers said they had friends
who used marijuana, but only 45 percent of parents believed their
children had pot-smokers as friends.
</P>
<P>
And 59 percent of teens said they were offered drugs in 1997,
up from 54 percent in 1995 and 46 percent in 1993, the survey
found. Only 38 percent of parents believe thus a situation.
</P>
<P>
"Even though we've seen significant increases in adolescent
drug use, parents surprisingly still underestimate the reality of
drugs in their children's lives," said Richard Bonnette, president
and chief executive officer of the study group.
</P>
<P>
Bonnette noted that children see drugs all around them and many
deal with the pressure to experiment with little help from home.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Supports Yemen's Poor in Building Low-Cost Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 20,000 Yemenis
living in poverty will be able to construct their own low-cost
houses through an 8.8 million U.S. dollars initiative, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is supported by the UNDP, the U.N. Capital
Development Fund (UNCDF) and the government of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said the project aims mainly to assist the country's
poorest individuals, many of whom are women, by offering them
loans to finance new homes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to housing, access roads will be built, water
supplies installed, electrical services connected, and sewer and
drainage systems expanded.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new houses will be constructed near a planned
export free zone outside of Aden, where many of the residents are
likely to find employment, the UNDP added.
</P>
<P>
The UNCDF is a UNDP-administered organization that helps reduce
poverty in least-developed countries by strengthening local
government and community institutions, fostering growth of the
private sector and creating systems for providing credit to the
poor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises in New York Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen Monday although Japan was expected to intervene the market to
boost its currency for the third straight session.
</P>
<P>
The yen's rise boosted the dollar against the German mark in
thin trading as most of Europe's financial trading was closed for
Easter Monday.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 129.60 yen,
up from 128.69 yen late Friday. The U.S. currency also was
changing hands at 1.8249 marks, up from 1.8229.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was riding high two weeks ago. But it was pressured
last Thursday after Japan announced a plan that received some
initial support from investors and as the country's central bank
intervened in foreign exchange markets, buying yen and selling
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell significantly Friday on another round of
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.5100 Swiss francs, down from 1.5152; 6.1125 French francs, up
from 6.1090; 1,801 Italian lire, down from 1,802; and 1.4344
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4230.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6775 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6734 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. NationsBank Plans to Merge With BankAmerica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The NationsBank Corp., the
U.S. No. 4 bank, announced Monday its plan to combine with
BankAmerica Corp., forming a 59.3 billion U.S. dollar deal to
create a coast-to-coast banking giant.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Banc One Corp., the seventh largest bank in this
country, is combining with First Chicago NBD Corp. in a 29.8
billion dollar union to create the dominant bank in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The two large proposed mergers came following last week's
planned union of banking giant Citicorp and brokerage and insurer
Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
The NationsBank-BankAmerica merger would be the second-largest
corporate marriage ever behind the planned 76.4 billion dollar
Citicorp-Travelers union, which could form the U.S. largest
financial services company.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina state, has
built its strength across the nation's South and midsection while
the BankAmerica spreads east from its San Francisco base. Together
they will have 570 billion dollars in assets, making it the
country's biggest bank ahead of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank will use the name of BankAmerica and operate
in 22 states. It will be based in Charlotte, and will have 4,800
branches and 15,000 automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank chairman and CEO Hugh McColl, 62, will lead the
merged bank.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank will have 180,000 employees. The merger will
eliminate 5,000 to 8,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
The Banc One-First Chicago combination will create the
fifth-largest banking company in terms of assets, at 230 billion
dollars. The company will retain the name of Columbus, Ohio-based
Banc One but will have its headquarters in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The new combined bank will have more than 2,000 branches and
9,150 ATMs. Like the Citicorp-Travelers deal, the mergers
announced Monday will combine banking and investment services such
as mutual funds.

<P>
TUNIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Libyan ministries and civilians
have filed a lawsuit against nine Americans they held responsible
for mounting air raids on Tripoli and Bengazi 12 years ago,
according to reports reaching here from Libya Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Tripoli Criminal Court opened trial of the case Monday but
adjourned at the request of the prosecution in order that the
accused could be informed of the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
It is not known who the nine Americans are. On April 15, 1986,
U.S. fighters bombed the two Libyan cities in retaliation for an
explosion that killed two people in a Berlin nightclub, a place
U.S. soldiers frequented. The U.S. charged that Libyan agents were
behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. raids killed 41 people and injured 226 others, and
inflicted extensive damage to buildings as well as public and
private properties.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan News Agency reported that bringing up the lawsuit
are Libyan ministries of defense, justice, public security,
foreign affairs, health, education, housing, agriculture and civil
aviation. They are demanding reparations for material damages
caused by the air raids.
</P>
<P>
The families of air raid victims are also pressing the charges
and demanding compensation for the death and injury of their
beloved ones.
</P>
<P>
The court asked the prosecution to present medical records of
the dead and the injured as well as technical reports on the
damages done to buildings and establishments as evidence to be
attached to the file.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged the nine Americans with such counts as
premeditated and attempted killing of innocent civilians,
terrorizing people, jeopardizing public safety, and destroying
public and private properties.

<HEADLINE> UN Predicts Rice Shortage in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) said on Monday that Indonesia will
expect a below normal rice harvest and record imports of the grain
this year.
</P>
<P>
UNDP said the conclusion was reached by a UN team made of food
and agricultural experts who made a recent visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
UNDP said the delayed and irregular rainfall, reduced
fertilizer use, and plantings of low-quality seeds are to blame
for poor yields.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the food-security situation of the
poorest in the country and hope to help them through emergency
food assistance for a limited period," UNDP Resident
Representative Ravi Rajan said.
</P>
<P>
Although rice yields will shrink, harvests of most "secondary
crops," such as maize, soybean and cassava, are likely to increase,
offsetting some of the rice shortage, UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP also said if the drought continues, as many as 7.5
million people in 15 provinces could face food shortages until
early next year.

CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Statistics released by the Tunisian Trade Ministry
showed that Tunisia's imports from the Arab Maghreb countries
dropped to 250 million U.S. dollars last year from 290 million
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Tunisia's trade deficit with the
Arab Maghreb countries decreased from 68 million dollars in 1996
to 30 million dollars in 1997. Libya is Tunisia's largest Arab
Maghreb trading partner.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Central Bank of Iran decided Sunday to abolish
selling the U.S. dollar at the official rate as from next Thursday.
</P>

pay more for U.S. dollars. The rate of U.S. dollar against Iranian
riyal has risen from 3,000 to 4,795.

At present, Iranians are allowed to buy 300 dollars at the

<HEADLINE> IMF: Japan's Economy Grim With Zero Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for Japan's
economy is grim and its output growth is projected at zero this
year and 1.3 percent next year, according to a report issued by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan would be hit more than other major industrial nations by
Asia's economic turmoil because of its strong trade links and high
volume of lending to the region, the IMF said in its semi-annual
report World Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of Japan's merchandise exports in 1996 were to
the five Asian countries most affected by the financial turmoil,
while about 17 percent of imports originated from these countries.
</P>
<P>
"Zero growth in real GDP is projected in 1998, with continued
weakness expected in domestic demand," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Zero could be hard to achieve," IMF chief economist Michael
Mussa told a news conference introducing the report.
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if during the first half of the year we are
looking at GDP heading down.... The fiscal stimulus offers some
reasonable hope that in the second half there will be some
resumption of positive growth," Mussa added.
</P>
<P>
Economic conditions in Japan deteriorated sharply in 1997
following a temporary surge in activity prior to the April
consumption tax increase, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence was undermined by continuing strains in the
financial sector and concerns about spillover effects from the
financial crises elsewhere in Asia," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lower confidence, in turn, put downward pressure on equity
prices toward the end of the year, weakening the capital base of
the banks and reinforcing doubts about their ability to deal with
nonperforming loans.
</P>
<P>
These factors are likely to continue to adversely affect
business investment of Japan further this year.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal reform package, announced last week, includes 4
trillion yen (31 billion U.S. dollars) in tax cuts and 10 trillion
yen in extra government spending.
</P>
<P>
Only four months ago, the IMF forecast the Japanese economy to
grow by 1.1 percent this year, after 0.9 percent in 1997. The
latest report forecast 1.3 percent growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The near-term outlook for Japan has deteriorated further.
Though exacerbated by the difficulty of many of its Asian trading
partners, the faltering of Japan's recovery last year can be
largely attributed to home-grown problems," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Although sound macroeconomic policies are critical to
supporting recovery in Japan, more rapid implementation of
structural reforms and further deregulation measures are also
necessary to help reinvigorate the Japanese economy," the report
said.
