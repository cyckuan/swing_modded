<HEADLINE> NASCAR Denies Hendrick Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The National Stock Car Racing
Commission said Friday that it has denied Hendrick Motorsports'
appeal of penalties levied after Jeff Gordon won the Chevrolet 400.
</P>
<P>
   In postrace inspections, Gordon's car was found to have an
unapproved intake manifold. The finding did not cost Gordon the
victory in the Sept. 9 race in Richmond, but his team was stripped
of 100 owner and driver points and fined $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   During the appeal, Hendrick officials argued the magnesium
manifold was supplied by General Motors and presumed approved by
team officials. The team also argued that NASCAR rules do not
specify the material a manifold should be made from and said the
penalties were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the commission agreed that the Winston Cup Rule
Book does not specify the material to be used in making a manifold,
but said all parties acknowledged during the proceedings that the
approved intake manifold, as listed in the rule book, is to be made
of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of the source of an unapproved part on a race car,
the race team that officially enters the car in a NASCAR race and
competes with that race car is ultimately accountable for that race
car's conformance, or non-conformance, to the rules,'' the ruling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who qualified fifth Friday for Sunday's NAPA 500 at
Martinsville Speedway, said the team was disappointed, but moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like we had to appeal,'' he said. ''We felt like we
had a reason to, but the decision has been made. It's done with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and team owner Rick Hendrick also noted that the part did
not give Gordon a competitive edge in his third victory of the
season, and Hendrick said he is considering taking the appeal one
step further.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling was unanimous.

   After gaining only bronze in the long jump Friday, Marion Jones
looks for another two by running in both of the women's relays on
the final day of track at the Olympics.
MEDALS:
</P>
<P>
   There will be 41 gold medals awarded Saturday.

Canada's Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
CLOSE CALL:
</P>
<P>
   The American men's basketball team survived a scare Friday night
from Lithuania, 85-83, only by Sarunas Jasikevicius missing a

<HEADLINE> Finance task force has closed hearing with lawyer for accused swindler </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A French citizen accused of laundering $5.3
million he and others allegedly made in a stock swindle has become
involved in a Justice Department investigation of campaign funding
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   They had a hearing before a federal judge that was closed at the
request of the suspect, Philippe V. Hababou, according to court
papers. It could not immediately be determined if prosecutors with
the Campaign Financing Task Force joined in the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of Thursday's proceeding was not disclosed, and U.S.
District Judge William G. Bassler sealed the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and Hababou lawyer Kevin H. Marino did not
immediately return messages left Friday regarding the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said, ''If hearings
are sealed, we can't discuss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 people prosecuted by the task force, seven have
pleaded guilty in connection with fund-raising during the 1996
campaign of Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Cresskill commodities broker David Chang, who has
been cooperating with investigators since he admitted in June that
he funneled $53,700 in illegal contributions to Torricelli's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has said
he had no knowledge of illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a congressman representing Bergen County before
raising $9.2 million to defeat U.S. Rep. Richard A. Zimmer. His
fund-raising ability helped him gain appointment as chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said the senator did not
know Hababou.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign records show that Hababou mailed a $2,000 donation in
1996 that was returned three days later, McGrath said. The records
do not indicate why it was returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A possible reason: foreigners are not permitted to contribute to
federal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour hearing was reported in Friday's editions of The
Record of Hackensack, whose reporter entered the courtroom and was
told by Bassler there was a compelling governmental interest in
closing the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in court were Robert J. Conrad Jr., the task force
chief, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hababou, 45, was living in New York when he was arrested by U.S.
marshals at Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City in
December 1998 on a fugitive warrant issued by his homeland in
February 1996. The U.S. Customs Service later said the arrest also
stemmed from an investigation with the FBI into currency
transactions at casinos that began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hababou was held without bail due to risk of flight. Born in
French Tunisia, he holds French and Israeli citizenship, is married
to a Swiss woman, and one of their two children has Swiss
citizenship, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in
Newark in June 1999 charged that he and unnamed others profited by
selling stock in which they held a hidden interest and whose value
they inflated.
</P>
<P>
   His trial was to begin Sept. 12 before Bassler but did not take
place, said the prosecutor handling the case, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jayne K. Blumberg.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the sealing order, Blumberg declined to comment further.

<HEADLINE> FBI Focus on Bush Employee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite her denials, an employee of George W.
Bush's media consultant remains the focus of an FBI investigation
into how a videotape of his debate preparations were sent to an Al
Gore confidant, a federal law enforcement official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was comparing Yvette Lozano's fingerprints with those
found on the inside and outside of the package mailed from Austin,
Texas, to Washington, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic evidence developed by the FBI links Lozano to the
package, The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions, citing
unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   The label on the Express Mail package received by Gore adviser
Tom Downey on Sept. 13 also corresponds to the date and time Lozano
was filmed by a security camera mailing a package in the Austin
post office, the newspaper reported. Downey turned the package over
to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano has denied mailing the debate materials. She and her
boss, Bush media consultant Mark McKinnon, have said the package
she mailed Sept. 11 contained Gap pants that she was returning to
the company for exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said late Friday that the FBI has
given the campaign no indication of forensic evidence linking
Lozano to the package. ''We have every reason to believe that what
Ms. Lozano stated are the facts,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   One federal investigator cautioned that fingerprints found on
the package would not necessarily be conclusive since Lozano may
have touched items in the normal course of business at the ad
office and had nothing to do with sending the debate videotape and
other documents.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lozano told ABC News that FBI agents earlier that
day had taken a second set of fingerprints from her and had seized
her computer.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Justice Department's criminal division's Public
Integrity section are trying to decide whether the facts they have
amount to a violation of federal law. The most likely statute,
officials said, would be one that makes it a crime to steal
something from a federally funded activity. The Bush campaign has
accepted federal funding. But it isn't a federal crime unless the
item stolen is worth more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano could be prosecuted for false statements to an FBI agent
if the government decides or is prepared to show that her denials
were false.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's firm has been at the center of speculation in part
because of his prior work for Democrats. The master copy of the
Bush debate practice videotape was kept at his offices, as well as
a briefing book, the contents of which were copied and sent to
Downey with the tape.

expected through the weekend as the storm grows stronger and moves toward the
Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane watches were issued for parts of the Yucatan
peninsula. Meanwhile, Hurricane Joyce weakened into a tropical storm Friday and
kept losing steam, with top sustained winds dropping to 50 mph as it churned
westward across the Atlantic. Residents in the Lesser Antilles were told to

Saginaw, Mich., said today he supports opening 1.5 million acres of the refuge
to drilling to decrease the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Vice

implement agreements to boost economic exchanges between the two Koreas. The

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government opened an investigation today into another

accidents in which two people died and 12 were injured. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said it has received 167 complaints about the
Steeltex R4S and A/T light truck tires since Aug. 1. The tires are original
equipment on Ford F250 and F350 pickups, the Ford Excursion, General Motors'
Suburban and G Van, a commercial vehicle. ''The majority of the complaints
occurred at highway speeds and allege a blowout, tread separation or other major
failure,'' NHTSA said.

two-hitter and extended his scoreless streak to 25 innings. Sheffield hit a solo
shot in the eighth to match Duke Snider's mark set with Brooklyn in 1956.
Sheffield broke his career high of 42 with Florida in 1996. The drive also gave
the Dodgers a franchise record of 209 home runs this season, besting the
previous mark of 208 set by Brooklyn in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Report: Dead Student Struck in Head  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leader of a gay campus group at the nation's
only liberal arts university for the deaf was found dead in his
dormitory room after being struck in the head repeatedly, police
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Franklin Plunkett, 19, of Burnsville, Minn., who was deaf
and had cerebral palsy, was found in his room at Gallaudet
University on Thursday night after a student asked an official to
check on him, police Cmdr. Jennifer Greene said. Plunkett had not
been seen for more than a day, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office ruled Plunkett's death a homicide.
Although police said they had no motive or suspects, they said an
item was found that may have been the weapon. Investigators would
not say what the item was, or whether there were signs of forced
entry into Plunkett's room.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett was secretary of the Lambda Society of Gallaudet
University, a gay and lesbian organization comprised of about 20
students.
</P>
<P>
   Police have no evidence to suggest Plunkett's death was a hate
crime, Greene said. Sgt. Joe Gentile, a police spokesman, said he
had no information that Plunkett or any other students at Gallaudet
had been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Gallaudet University, which was established by Congress in 1864
and serves students who are deaf and hearing impaired, has a
student body of about 2,000. School officials
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most welcoming places on the face of the
Earth,'' said Mercy Coogan, a university spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett lived in a single room on the first floor of a
four-story dormitory reserved for freshmen, Coogan said. Other
first-floor students were moved to other floors Thursday night, she
said. The dorm is kept locked and entry is possible only with a key
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Students described Plunkett as friendly, somewhat shy and handy
with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a very sweet guy. He had high expectations for his
future,'' said Jean Frink, a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   While students at Gallaudet consoled each other, staff
officials, psychologists and social workers at Plunkett's old high
school in Faribault, Minn., met with the 160 students Friday to
talk about his death, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't imagine him having an enemy in the world,'' Linda
Mitchell, superintendent of the Minnesota Academy for the Deaf,
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett graduated second in his class at Minnesota State
Academy. Mitchell said he had wanted to become a psychologist.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Games: Greatest or Grandest  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Sydney Games aren't quite over, but
the International Olympic Committee is already handing out praise.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the close of the games, IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch announced Saturday he was awarding the Olympic Cup to the
people of Sydney for their efforts and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can be happy tomorrow. We will close a grand Olympic
Games,'' said the 80-year-old Spaniard, who is officiating over his
last Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch uses the 1992 Barcelona Games as the benchmark for
Olympic supremacy, although IOC insiders are saying the IOC chief
may have no choice but to bestow the honor of ''best games ever''
on Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC senior vice president, said he couldn't
speak for Samaranch, but he'd give it ''10 out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been fabulous, everything we hoped for seven years ago
when we said, 'low risk high reward in Sydney as opposed to high
risk and perhaps superlative reward in Beijing.' What we hoped for
is what we've got,'' Pound said. ''I've always had very high
expectations for Australia. There was never a doubt that Sydney
would put on a superb games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney beat Beijing by two votes in IOC balloting for the 2000
Games in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   IOC director general Francois Carrard said the people and the
place had contributed to the success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was going to be the games for the sports-loving
people and the athletes, and this has been brilliantly confirmed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Cup, one of the IOC's highest honors, is given to a
person or group for ''outstanding contribution'' to the Olympics.
It has gone to several other Olympic host cities, although Atlanta
was bypassed for the cup after the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The cup will be presented to Sydney in a ceremony at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recipients are the people of Sydney and New South Wales
for their wonderful spirit,'' Carrard said. ''It's a symbolic
gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   At a two-hour meeting of the IOC general assembly, Samaranch
heaped praise on Sydney organizers, citing organization, transport,
enthusiastic crowds and their example of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out the long jump final duel between Australia's Jai
Taurima and eventual champion Ivan Pedroso of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before jumping, the Cuban, all the people in the stadium are
shouting for him,'' he said. ''We have been very much impressed by
the success of the games. They are wonderful games, with excellent
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the games would come
to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anything has marred the Olympics,'' Howard said.
''They have been well organized and I congratulate unreservedly the
people responsible for organizing the games. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've got the technological side of the games right
and I think we've got the human side of the games right.''

   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Gary Sheffield tied the Dodgers franchise
record with his 43rd homer and Chan Ho Park struck out 13 and also
homered in his first major league shutout, leading Los Angeles to a
3-0 win Friday night over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Park (18-10) pitched a two-hitter and extended his scoreless
streak to 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit a solo shot in the eighth to match Duke Snider's
mark set with Brooklyn in 1956. Sheffield broke his career high of
42 with Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Park homered leading off the eighth to give the Dodgers a 2-0
lead. Two batters later, Sheffield connected off Woody Williams
(10-8).
</P>
<P>
   Park's drive gave the Dodgers a franchise record of 209 home
runs this season, besting the previous mark of 208 set by Brooklyn
in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Park retired the final 13 batters. He has not allowed a run in
his last three starts, having given up just 10 hits with 33
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who had already established a career high for wins,
allowed singles to Phil Nevin and Greg LaRocca. Park walked one and
did not permit a runner past first base.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave up three runs on six hits. Williams lost to the
Dodgers and Kevin Brown in his last start when he allowed two
unearned runs in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin led off the game with a ground ball a few steps to
LaRocca's left between first and second. LaRocca first bobbled the
ball, then stumbled and fell as he attempted to pick it up for an
error.
</P>
<P>
   After stealing second, Goodwin scored on Shawn Green's two-out
single to center.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sheffield came into the game with just two hits in 26
at-bats against San Diego this season. ... With his next RBI, Green
will join Sheffield (108) and Eric Karros (106 RBI) as the only
trio in Los Angeles history with 100 or more RBI in the same
season. ... Padres infielder Damian Jackson missed the game as his
wife, Tana, gave birth to a boy.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rich Aurilia hit a tiebreaking homer and drove in
three runs, and the San Francisco Giants clinched at least a tie
for the best record in the major leagues by beating the Arizona
Diamondbacks 4-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win sent the Giants (96-64) two games ahead of Atlanta and
St. Louis in the race for home-field advantage in the NL playoffs.
The Giants' record also is two games better than Chicago's in the
AL with two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has not had the best record in baseball since
1962. The 1905, 1913 and 1924 Giants also were the winningest team
in those years.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (17-11), who lost to Brian Anderson and the
Diamondbacks on Sunday when he gave up a season-high eight runs,
allowed two runs in eight innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched out of jams twice in his last three innings,
and his only serious mistake was giving up a homer to Matt Williams
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his career-high 41st save, giving
up a run on Luis Gonzalez's grounder. Nen walked the first two
batters, then converted his 28th straight save chance since July 2.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 2 when Jeff Kent hit a leadoff triple in
the Giants sixth. After two outs, Aurilia drove his 20th homer, the
best of any NL shortstop, into the left-field grandstand off
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (11-7), who went into the game tied with Greg Maddux
for the best walks-to-innings ratio in the NL, issued a career-high
five walks. He gave up seven hits and four runs in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Bernard had an RBI single for the Giants in the third,
making Anderson pay for a leadoff walk to Bobby Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco went up 2-1 in the fourth when J.T. Snow singled
with two out and scored on a double by Aurilia. Steve Finley chased
Aurilia's drive to the warning track in center field and got his
glove on it, but dropped the ball as he fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks struck quickly in their half when Williams, the
first batter, homered into the swimming-pool pavilion in right
center.
</P>
<P>
   Williams walked and scored Arizona's first run on an error by
Kent, who threw the ball low to first trying to complete a double
play in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona had runners on the corners in the sixth, but the
inning ended when Jay Bell struck out and Estalella threw out Craig
Counsell trying to steal second. ... Hernandez was hit by his
attempted bunt in the third, becoming the Diamondbacks'
franchise-record 1,199th strikeout victim of the season. ...
Aurilia and Kent became the first middle-infield combination to
each hit at least 20 home runs in back-to-back seasons. ...
Hernandez finished with 254, passing Houston's Jose Lima (251) for
the most in the league. ... Hernandez is 6-2 in his last eight
starts. ... The Giants are 6-5 against Arizona this year, 4-0 in
Phoenix. ... Bell is 0-for-17 against Hernandez in his career.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Takes Bronze In Time Trial  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Lance Armstrong came to Sydney
determined to win a gold medal. He's going home with bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Tour de France champion fattened his crowded trophy
cabinet by finishing third in the 33-mile Olympic time trial
Saturday (Friday night EDT), but it wasn't the goal he set for
himself at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Viacheslav Ekimov of Russia, who races with Armstrong on the
U.S. Postal Service trade team, won the gold medal with a time of
57 minutes, 40 seconds over the 33-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Ullrich of Germany, who won the road race Wednesday, took
the silver, seven seconds behind Ekimov. Armstrong, wearing a
teardrop-shaped helmet to reduce wind resistance, was 33 seconds
behind Ekimov.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong targeted the time trial as his event for Sydney, a
decision that took on greater importance when he broke a neck
vertebra after colliding with a car while training in rural France
one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished 13th in the road race, Armstrong's last option
was the time trial. The Australian fans knew it too, and they gave
the American a big cheer to send him onto the race course.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Ekimov are close friends. Last month, they warmed
up for Sydney by teaming up to win the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx time
trial. That was two days before Armstrong was injured in the car
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The American seemed to take his cues Saturday from Ekimov,
coming within one second of the fast splits established by the
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   But Ullrich was there for each stroke of the pedals, and he
moved into second place five seconds behind Ekimov's time with one
lap remaining. That dropped Armstrong to third, eight seconds
behind Ekimov.
</P>
<P>
   At the final interval check with about six miles left, Armstrong
was in second, seven seconds behind Ekimov. Just over a minute
later, Ullrich crossed the checkpoint for a five-second lead over
Ekimov.
</P>
<P>
   But Ullrich couldn't maintain the pace and he slipped to the
silver, ensuring the bronze for Armstrong. Ekimov watched from the
pits, smiling and accepting handshakes as his victory became
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   While Armstrong won't get the gold he wanted, at least he has a
medal. After the road race, he was 0-for-4 in Olympic events dating
back to the 1992 Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Armstrong was suffering from testicular cancer that
had spread to his lungs and brain by the time it was detected two
months later. He went through chemotherapy and surgery before
resuming his racing career in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, another Postal Service team member who rode for
the Americans, finished 10th in 59:26.
</P>
<P>
   Ekimov won the Olympic pursuit gold medal for the Soviet Union
in 1988 at Seoul and was one of the first from his nation to turn
pro in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday (Friday night EDT), Mari Holden got the
Americans off to a great start by delivering a silver medal in the
women's Olympic time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Leontien Zijlaard of the Netherlands won her third gold medal of
the Sydney Games, covering the 18-mile women's course in 42 minutes
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, of Colorado Springs, Colo., finished in 42:36, powering
her way through the two laps. Mechanical problems and a crash had
eliminated her from Tuesday's road race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was definitely motivated today,'' Holden said. ''I was just
hoping for no flats.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli of France won the bronze in 42:52. Karen
Kurreck of Los Altos Hills, Calif., finished 16th in 44:33.
</P>
<P>
   By her split times, Holden clearly was in the medal chase. But
since she was the fourth of 12 riders in her flight, the only
question was whether her fast times would withstand the challenge
of later riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my head, I thought I could win a medal,'' Holden said.
''But I think I was the only one to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second cycling medal for the United States, coming
after Marty Nothstein's gold in match sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Holden had the fastest midpoint interval of any rider except
Zijlaard. Holden finished the first of two laps in 21:12 and the
time held up until Zijlaard came around in 20:46.
</P>
<P>
   Zijlaard has dominated women's cycling in Sydney. She won gold
medals in the road race and 3,000-meter individual pursuit, where
she set a world record, and took silver in the points race.

<HEADLINE> California Tribe Eyes Casino  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORRES-MARTINEZ INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) -- For nearly a
century, the murky, foul-smelling Salton Sea has blanketed about
half of this remote reservation, rendering 11,800 acres unusable
for the tribe's hundreds of members.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government awarded the land with the mistaken
assumption that the water would recede. Despite presidential
orders, acts of Congress and legal rulings, the tribe never gained
use of the land or compensation for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after decades of struggle, the tide could be turning for
the impoverished Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.
Legislation moving through Congress would allow Torres-Martinez to
extend its borders and claim choice real estate to build a casino.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which cleared the House last week, would grant the
tribe new land for a casino, raising concerns that a precedent
could be set allowing other tribes to acquire choice
off-reservation land and expand gambling nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has already started a precedent. It clearly demonstrates
that we have federal law that has run amok,'' said Cheryl Schmit,
co-director of Stand Up for California, an activist group that
vainly fought the legalization of Indian gambling in California.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow the tribe to acquire a total of 11,800
acres -- including 640 acres for a casino 12 miles north of the
existing reservation -- and provide $14 million for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The bill resolves federal lawsuits brought in the 1980s and
1990s by the U.S. government and the tribe against the water
districts responsible for flooding the reservation and creating the
Salton Sea, California's largest lake. Although a tourist draw, the
381-square-mile lake suffers periodic fish and bird kills.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's sponsor, Rep. Mary Bono, says that while
Schmit and others are justified in worrying about gambling
expansion, those fears are misplaced in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a land exchange for the land that sits beneath the Salton
Sea. It gives them no right that they don't currently have,'' said
Bono, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   John Tahsuda, general counsel for the National Indian Gaming
Association, said the tribe's acquisition is unlikely to set a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The equities were so far out of whack on the tribe's side that
a lot of people will see it as a necessary right to a wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 640 acres that would be used for the tribe's casino sit at
Interstate 10 near Indio, about 130 miles east of Los Angeles. The
town is also home to the Cabazon Band of Mission Indian's thriving
Fantasy Springs casino -- a potential source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the booming tourist destination of Palm Springs, where
the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has one casino open and
another one planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Indio site is considered more favorable for a casino than
the existing, isolated Torres-Martinez reservation, where only a
fraction of the more than 600 tribal members live. Modular homes
and scrub brush dot the barren landscape, some homes have no
electricity or running water, and remote dirt roads make getting to
work difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The land deal has put Torres-Martinez at odds with the Cabazon,
who worked to defeat a similar bill in 1996 and agreed not to
oppose the current measure only after it was amended to guarantee a
two-mile buffer zone around the Torres-Martinez's casino land.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the small, wealthy Cabazon tribe admit they are
worried about competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we don't want is for them to be able to be in this
position, which allows them to jump over all the cities and the
other reservations in order to get into a better location,'' Greg
Cervantes, Cabazon's director of public affairs, said before the
amendment was approved. ''That has not been allowed for other
tribes in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres-Martinez leaders have decried Cabazon's opposition.
Tribal Chairwoman Mary Belardo said the Cabazon have been led
astray by non-Indians who fill key positions in the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The bill recently earned the backing of California's senior
senator, Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Other tribes also have come to
Torres-Martinez's support.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about justice for the Torres-Martinez people who lost
almost half of their reservation to other interests and then to
farmers, and decades going by and that not being addressed,'' said
Mary Ann Martin Andreas, chairwoman of the Morongo Band of Mission
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis has signed gambling compacts with 59
of the state's 107 federally recognized tribes, although not all of
those tribes have casinos. There are 41 tribal casinos in the state
and many more planned.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 4, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Ashby had one bad inning and it cost the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth and Terry Shumpert hit consecutive home runs
off Ashby in the fifth inning and the Colorado Rockies beat Atlanta
4-2 Friday night as the Braves blew a chance to move up in the race
for home-field advantage in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a couple of mistakes. A changeup that I slowed down on
to Hollandsworth and a sinker that I tried to throw down and away
and got it up in the zone to Shumbert,'' Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept us close and felt good about giving us a chance to
win,'' he said. ''We're playing good, but some days you just don't
catch the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton added his 41st home run for the Rockies in the
ninth. The Braves, losing their third in a row, haven't won since
clinching the NL East title Tuesday night with a 7-1 victory in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are tied with St. Louis for the second-best record in
the NL. San Francisco is two games ahead of both teams in the race
for home-field advantage in the league playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important (home field), but I don't think it's something
everybody is down about if we don't get it,'' said Ashby. ''The
main thing is we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox echoed Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to open at home if we can, but it's not the biggest
thing in the world. We'll open Tuesday, that's for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said he doesn't get any pleasure in playing the spoiler
role.
</P>
<P>
   ''No satisfaction whatever. We would like to be in their
shoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What Colorado did get with the win is their 81st victory,
ensuring a .500 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better than a losing season. It says to me that we're
going in the right direction. It's a huge positive,'' said Helton,
who went 1-for-4 and continues to lead the league in hitting (.373)
and RBIs (143).
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (12-10) gave up five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings, leaving after consecutive two-out doubles in the seventh
by pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla and Rafael Furcal got the Braves
within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon is 5-1 in his last seven starts and has won five in a
row on the road. He matched his career high for wins, set last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, (12-13) who had won his last four starts, had only one
bad inning -- the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander gave up a leadoff single to Todd Walker and
Hollandsworth hit with his 19th homer, a two-run shot into the
right-field stands. Shumpert followed with his ninth homer, a drive
over the left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby gave up five hits and three runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored their first run in the opening inning when
Furcal led off with a single, took second when Chipper Jones was
hit by a pitch and scored on a single by Andres Galarraga, giving
him 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Galarraga became the third Atlanta player to reach 100
RBIs. Chipper Jones has knocked in 109 runs and Andruw Jones 101.
... In the second, Rockies catcher Brent Mayne's throw attempting
to get Reggie Sanders at third on an attempted double steal hit the
bat of Andruw Jones. Both runners were safe. Jones walked, loading
the bases, but Chipper Jones flied to center to end the two-out
threat. ... If the Giants and Braves finish with the same record,
Atlanta would have the home-field advantage based on its 6-3 season
edge on San Francisco. If Atlanta and St. Louis are tied, the Cards
get home field because of their 4-3 season series lead. If all
three teams are tied, the Braves and Cardinals would gain home
field in the first round. The Braves would play the Giants and St.
Louis would meet the New York Mets.

<HEADLINE> Campus Melees Blamed On boredom  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- They are rebels without a cause,
university students who party 'til they riot.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't protesting politics or a football defeat. For the
most part, they say the parties-turned-melees are symptoms of
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall term started at the University of Colorado,
raucous off-campus parties have twice deteriorated into violence,
with crowds starting fires and pelting police officers with bottles
and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   A similar disturbance occurred Aug. 26 at James Madison
University in Virginia that resulted in 17 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Some students believe the riots are a symptom of boredom in
towns that offer little to do. Other blame a handful of
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes down to it, the students don't have anything to
do at night besides going to house parties,'' said Colorado junior
Josh Kahn, 20, a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Clapper, 18, of Greenwood, Ind., was embarrassed by the
riots, especially because members of her freshman class have borne
much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see why people would want to party hard but that's no
excuse for a riot,'' she said. ''It's embarrassing for me and for
the people who don't burn couches.''
</P>
<P>
   She has found plenty of fun activities on campus, but admitted
it is difficult to provide entertainment for everyone, particularly
the 5,150-strong freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   Educators blame a generation of students who have no little of
purpose and lack political consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ''What drove them 30 years ago was really a protest movement,
much more accompanied by drugs than you see now,'' said Sheldon
Steinbach, general counsel for the Washington-based American
Council on Education. ''What may be driving this group of men and
women may be this segment of that population have it too easy,
economically.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schools go to great lengths to try to provide a degree of
cultural enhancement. To say one is bored, sounds like what you and
I might have said to our parents when we were 14.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Colorado, at least six riots have broken
out since May 1997, when up to 700 people stormed the streets of
''The Hill,'' an older neighborhood with Victorian-style homes
sandwiched among stately fraternity and sorority houses. About
three dozen people were arrested, including 23 students.
</P>
<P>
   In that disturbance, students were upset about a crackdown on
alcohol use.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, about 1,000 people burned doors, furniture and
carpets in the same neighborhood. At least three people were
arrested. A few days later, a second riot involved about 200
people. Five people were arrested, including four students.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, police in riot gear used pepper spray and tear gas
to disperse a rioting crowd of about 2,000 on Aug. 26 at James
Madison.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison spokesman Fred Hilton said the off-campus party is
held nearly every year, but inexplicably turned violent this time.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said campus riots seem to happening more frequently.
Students have rioted to protest noise ordinances, lost football
games or university personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be more of an inclination by some to be more
confrontational, to threaten the health and safety of others. I'm
not sure what is happening in our society to make college students
go in that direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Colorado and James Madison have been searching for
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said James Madison has been re-examining its judicial
system and code of conduct and hoped to offer more alcohol-free
weekend activities.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder, officials have worked on building student-police
relationships, holding students accountable for off-campus behavior
and promoting more weekend activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Campaign Disrupts Sudan Bid  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States has jolted the annual
campaign to fill five of the 15 U.N. Security Council seats,
pursuing a late and intensive effort to remove Sudan as the chosen
African candidate and promote a rival instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, which is under U.N. sanctions, has denounced the U.S.
intervention. Other nations have questioned it. But the action has
forced an unexpected vote for the African seat on Oct. 10, when the
General Assembly selects five new countries to join its top
decision-making council for two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the seats will go to an African. The United States
is now trying to help line up support behind Mauritius -- even
though Sudan had won the support of most Africans months ago and
been considered the endorsed candidate, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has gone on the counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''A superpower promoting a small country to contest another
country against the will of the region is unprecedented,'' Sudan's
U.N. ambassador, Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa, said in an interview
Friday. ''The permanent members should not get involved in such
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Erwa said the U.S. campaign, which has been unusually public,
was tied to election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mauritius had indicated it wanted the African seat back in
January, and Uganda has backed it. Other support is uncertain, but
western diplomats said Mauritius has clearly been emboldened to
pursue the underdog bid by the American intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made it clear that Sudan, which it
considers a sponsor of terrorism, doesn't deserve such
international recognition that a council seat confers.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo issued ahead of an Arab foreign ministers meeting last
week, the United States asked for Arab support in urging Sudan to
postpone its candidacy. Sudan's presence on the council would make
it harder to discuss lifting sanctions when the matter comes before
the council in November, the Americans argued.
</P>
<P>
   The council imposed limited diplomatic sanctions on Sudan in
1996 to compel it to hand over the gunmen who tried to assassinate
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Sudan says various inquiries
didn't find the suspects in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries have backed Sudan's bid to lift the sanctions
-- something the United States opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated
Press, the United States said: ''It would be highly prejudicial and
damaging for the credibility of the U.N. if Sudan joined the UNSC
(Security Council) when the body could be deliberating whether
Sudan has taken the anti-terrorism steps the UNSC required.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is made up of 15 members: permanent members
Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States and 10
nonpermanent members. Every year, five of the temporary seats open
up for two-year terms beginning Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, the candidates are selected by the various U.N.
regional groups months before the actual General Assembly vote.
This year, for example, the Latin American group has settled on
Colombia while the Asian group has chosen Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, Italy and Norway are contesting the two seats allotted
to Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. interference in the selection process of African
nations has raised some eyebrows here -- even beyond the African and
Arab nations which typically resent U.S. influence in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   One Security Council diplomat, who asked not to be identified by
name or nationality, said several countries would prefer that Sudan
not be on the council but that it was up to the Africans to pick
their candidate. ''You may not like it, but there are plenty of
things we don't like that we have to live with,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan recently circulated a memo to all U.N. missions recalling
that it had been endorsed as the candidate by African nations and
that now ''another African country is being enticed by the U.S. to
challenge the African consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Does the U.S. speak on behalf of Africa?'' reads the memo.
''Does the U.S. decide for Africa? Does the U.S. want to say that
Africans don't honor their commitments, or don't respect decisions
taken by their own institutions at the highest levels?''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said the United States was free to let it be
known that it doesn't want Sudan on the council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not telling the Africans who to pick,'' the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''We're saying this
country is not suitable.''

<HEADLINE> No Predications Made For Debates  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A haggard Richard M. Nixon, his appearance
more telling than his words as he debated a vigorous John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, trying to defend his failing grasp on the White
House against the television skills of Ronald Reagan, the performer
who became a president.
</P>
<P>
   The same Reagan rambling on camera four years later, then
reversing the question of his age -- 73 -- by quipping it away.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald R. Ford blundering an obvious foreign policy point, then
insisting that his wrong answer was right.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush glancing at his watch as though he just wanted the
campaign debate to be over with, which, it turned out, is exactly
what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, confident of re-election, commending Bob Dole
for past service to the nation at the start of their 1996 debate.
No need to take the offensive when he had the winning political
hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush face each
other for 90 televised minutes in Boston on Tuesday, it will be the
18th time the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees have
met, beginning with the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush debate again in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 11,
and in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The vice presidential nominees, Dick
Cheney and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, meet on Oct. 5, in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Over all the years of debating -- there were none for three
campaigns after 1960 because one party or the other had a nominee
determined to avoid them -- the telling issues seldom have been the
ones the campaigners planned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, matters of image and style, things that were not spoken
or were said in error, have been the points that made points for
one candidate or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The debates have delivered no major oratory, and no
breakthroughs on campaign issues. In the age of poll-testing and
focus groups, a debate before a television audience of 60 million
to 70 million is not a forum in which a candidate will risk new
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, a preview has helped score a debate point, as when
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee,
snapped at Sen. Dan Quayle in 1988: ''You're no Jack Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle had said, accurately, that he had served as many years in
Congress as Kennedy when he ran for president. Quayle had been
advised against repeating it in the debate, but he walked into
Bentsen's line.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the debates have reinforced impressions of candidates,
sometimes to their detriment. That happened to Ford in 1976 when he
declared that ''there is no Soviet domination of eastern Europe''
and wouldn't be while he was president, an error so obvious that
the questioning reporter asked whether he'd really meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said the United States did not concede Soviet dominance --
as obvious as it was.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he corrected himself, the damage was done, and the
image of a president prone to stumbles had been underscored.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 election, the closest popular count in American
history, could have turned on the debates, especially the first
one. Nixon was vice president, better known than Kennedy, confident
that as the man who had debated Nikita S. Khrushchev in Moscow, he
could handle the Massachusetts senator.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues there was no obvious advantage either way, in any
of the four Nixon-Kennedy debates, still the most in any single
campaign. But Nixon was campaign weary, and ill, when he and
Kennedy first met in Chicago, on Sept. 26, 1960. He was wan and
sweating, while Kennedy looked fit and trim. Nixon got a call from
his mother, concerned about his health, after the debate. The
illness was minor, the political setback major.
</P>
<P>
   The image problem afflicted Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988,
over his bland, dispassionate restatement of his opposition to
capital punishment in reply to an ambush question of whether he'd
still oppose execution if his wife were raped and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   It fit the picture Republicans were trying to draw of Dukakis as
a liberal technocrat, cold and emotionless. Only the liberal part
was so, but the debate episode seemed to go with the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis said later it wouldn't have been so damaging had he been
running a better campaign against George Bush. Then again, he added
wryly, ''If I knew anything about presidential politics I'd be
talking to you in a different capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Reagan's age became a morning-after question, not for
what he said in his debate with Democrat Walter F. Mondale but
because he said it haltingly and defensively, in sentences that
wandered.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed it on overtraining and overbriefing. And he got rid of
it in a second debate by saying he would not make age an issue
despite Mondale's youth and inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan wasn't supposed to falter in debate -- not the man with a
career on camera before he became president. That points to another
factor that has figured in debate ratings: Expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the candidate who is supposed to be the lesser
debater can win by managing not to lose much.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are working at positioning now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man is a great debater,'' Bush says of Gore at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president says the conventional wisdom of the
expectations game is not accurate. ''He really is a very good
debater,'' Gore said, ''and he's won all of the debates that he's
ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, the former president, has been in more national
campaign debates than anybody else -- five presidential, one vice
presidential.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a PBS interview that he didn't like them, thought
them contrived, too much show business.
</P>
<P>
   And about that glance at his watch in the 1992 debate:
</P>
<P>
   ''Now was I glad when the damn thing was over? Yeah. And maybe
that's why I was looking at it.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney Starts Debate Preparations  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) -- Dick Cheney tapped former aides from his
days in Congress and at the Pentagon to coach, advise and critique
him during intensive weekend preparations for his vice presidential
debate Thursday with Democratic rival Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the Republican nominee to his home in Wyoming for
practice sessions was Dave Gribben, a longtime friend. Gribben
worked for Cheney when he was secretary of defense, was his chief
of staff when Cheney was in Congress and now is head of government
relations at Halliburton, the Dallas-based oil services company
that Cheney ran from 1995 until retiring in August.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Jim Steen, Cheney's former legislative director
when he was a House member during the 1980s and 1990s, and Gus
Puryear, an attorney and former congressional staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is playing Lieberman in practice
sessions for the Danville, Ky., debate was joining the candidate
Saturday, said Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will spend three days in Wyoming and return to
campaigning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides declined to discuss Cheney's debate strategy or what
subjects he may challenge Lieberman on. But they said they expect
the Connecticut senator to go after Cheney's conservative voting
record during his service in the House in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney voted against funding for social service and
environmental programs. He has said he did so because he felt the
deficit-ridden government couldn't afford some programs and because
he was supporting the positions taken by President Reagan. He has
also said he voted against some bills because Democrats were trying
to railroad them through a vote without allowing any discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in an online interview with ABC News and The New York
Times, said voters are likely to place great importance on the
coming campaign debates --three between the presidential candidates
and his Thursday with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the advice I get is, be yourself,'' he said. ''You've
got to come across as straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney got right to work as he ended a week of campaigning in
battleground states, huddling with the three counselors during a
3&AMP;frac12;-hour flight from Florida, where he had been campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers have been studying videotapes of Lieberman
appearing on talk shows and giving speeches on the Senate floor.
They've also immersed themselves in Lieberman's legislative record
and his position on the issues to prepare a debate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's staff has already made one videotape of a practice
session and plan to make others this weekend to help fine-tune
Cheney's performance.

<HEADLINE> Co. To Buy Back Biotech Corn Crop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to make sure that a
variety of gene-altered corn linked to a nationwide recall of taco
shells doesn't get into the food supply again.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis CropScience, the company that produces the corn seed,
agreed Friday to buy all of this year's crop, worth an estimated
$68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say there is no known health risk from the
corn, known as StarLink, but it has not been approved for human
consumption because scientists are unsure whether it might cause
allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled corn will eventually be sold for cattle feed or for
production of ethanol, a gasoline additive. The Agriculture
Department will purchase the grain from farmers and then oversee
its shipping to buyers to ensure that it doesn't get mixed up with
food-grade corn, USDA officials said. Aventis will reimburse the
government for all its expenses, including shipping and storage
costs, and in turn will get the proceeds from the corn's sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is a prudent and responsible step to prevent the
current crop of StarLink corn from being used in processed foods,''
USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods recalled millions of packages of taco shells sold in
stores under the Taco Bell name after tests showed that some were
made with the Aventis variety. Taco Bell Corp. said it was
replacing all the shells in its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   EPA approved the crop for commercial use in 1998 with the
condition that it only be used for animal feed. The StarLink corn
contains a bacterium gene that makes it toxic to insects.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of eight varieties of genetically engineered corn that
have been approved by the government and the only one that is not
approved for use in food.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt that it is vitally important for both our domestic and
import customers to have Aventis take this step of corporate good
faith to intervene in the marketplace to make sure this 2000 crop
is taken out of the stream,'' said Bruce Knight, vice president of
public policy for the corn growers association.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 acres of the corn were planted, 0.4 percent of the
total U.S. corn acreage.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori: Peru Will Be Stable  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under fire at home, Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori is getting support from the Clinton administration and the
Organization of American States for his goal of a transition to new
leadership next year under a strengthened democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   It was just two months ago that Fujimori was sworn in to a third
term, but a corruption scandal and other developments have left him
in a weakened position, forcing him to call elections four years
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've done the right thing,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Fujimori on Friday, according to State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said she also urged Fujimori to promote reforms that
will end abuses that have marked past election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori made his rounds here on his hastily arranged visit,
the Peruvian Congress voted to dismantle the country's National
Intelligence Service, which for a decade served as the power base
of discredited and now-exiled spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos. The
vote was 101-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a military coup plot have swirled around Lima in
recent days. In addition, Fujimori has faced demands for his
resignation from political opponents and for the extradition of
Montesinos, who was forced into exile in Panama last Sunday. He is
accused of trying to bribe an opposition congressman to join
Fujimori's alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said Friday he was confident he will be able to ride
out the storm. ''Stability and democracy will be guaranteed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's visit here also included a meeting Thursday evening
with OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria, who is overseeing a
dialogue among Peruvian political leaders aimed at forging a
consensus on ground rules for next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Gaviria said the process is working
well, noting that a series of agreements has been reached,
including a commitment to announce an election date by Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the OAS-led process is indispensable for democratic
stability in Peru, saying, ''There is no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria acknowledged there have been threats by some in the
military to stage a coup but said he expects its support for the
process.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Threatens U.S. War Remains  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea is threatening to stop cooperating
with U.S. efforts to recover remains of American servicemen lost in
the Korean War unless the Pentagon provides more humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   In talks Sept. 15 in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, a
North Korean army officer told Robert Jones, the Pentagon official
in charge of POW-MIA issues, that a deal reached in June to provide
U.S. access to battlefields will not be renewed when it expires in
November unless the aid issue is settled first.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is paying North Korea $2 million this year for
its assistance in the remains recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On a more optimistic note for U.S.-North Korea relations, the
State Department announced Friday that President Clinton will meet
next month with Cho Myong Nok, the first vice chairman of North
Korea's National Defense Commission. He will be the highest-ranking
North Korean official to visit Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is considered second in command to the country's leader, Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The talks also have been centered on terms of an accord that
froze North Korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for energy
supplies and two civilian reactors, State Department officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's past involvement in terrorism is on the agenda as
well, but State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
issue will be dealt with next week. He said the tone of the talks
after three days ''remains positive.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forensics experts, working in an area about 60 miles north
of Pyongyang where hundreds of American servicemen were killed in
battles with Chinese troops in October 1950, have recovered 35 sets
of remains this year. Among them are nine sets of remains flown out
of Pyongyang on Sept. 15 aboard a U.S. Air Force transport plane.
Jones accompanied the remains to Hawaii for a repatriation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour meeting in Pyongyang, Sr. Col. Pak Rim Su
told Jones ''there is a threat to this current cooperative
environment and to future prospects'' for recovering U.S.
servicemen's remains, Jones wrote in a memo Monday to Walter
Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A return to normal operations could only occur after the
United States resolved the problem of 'anti-American sentiment'
among the North Korean populace,'' Jones said Pak told him. Pak
said the solution was for the Pentagon to provide the kind of
humanitarian assistance North Korea asked for last December.
</P>
<P>
   In the December talks, the North Koreans demanded that the
Pentagon pay for construction of a clothing factory large enough to
provide shoes and clothing for all children in North Korea. Without
such a goodwill gesture, they insisted, ordinary North Koreans
would resist cooperation on remains recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told Pak that the clothing factory idea was unrealistic
and that any requests for humanitarian assistance would have to be
presented to the State Department. In addition to the $2 million in
compensation for remains recovery efforts, the United States has
given North Korean hundreds of millions of dollars in food aid in
recent years, as well as fuel assistance as part of a nuclear
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pak told Jones that the Pentagon would have to respond on the
humanitarian issue by October. Otherwise, talks planned for
December to agree on arrangements for remains recovery operations
in 2001 will not be successful, Pak said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 8,100 U.S. servicemen listed as unaccounted
for from the 1950-53 Korean War, the Pentagon believes that remains
of as many as 1,500 may be recoverable from the area that U.S.
forensics experts have been working this year. Their final
scheduled mission of the year is due to end Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also held talks with Chinese officials in Beijing this
month on issues related to accounting for U.S. servicemen. A
Ministry of Foreign Affairs official disclosed to Jones that crash
sites believed to contain the wreckage of two American aircraft
from the World War II period had been discovered in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   No other information about the planes was provided.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian: Bananas Changed U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans went bananas a century ago and the
tropical fruit has been as American as apple pie ever since. So
American, in fact, that the venerable Smithsonian Institution has
published a 210-page book telling the story of the banana's role in
U.S. history -- everything from banana splits to banana republics.
</P>
<P>
   Banana lore goes back to the unconfirmed report that a shipment
reached the stolid folks in Salem, Mass., in 1690. They tried
boiling them with pork. It took nearly two centuries after that
culinary disaster for bananas to catch on with North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But when they did in the late 19th century, bananas quickly
became the nation's most popular fruit, a status they retain to
this day. In 1998, Americans ate an average of 28.58 pounds of
bananas, compared with 19.2 pounds of fresh apples.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Virginia Scott Jenkins, ''Bananas, An American
History,'' published by Smithsonian University Press, names 62
popular songs about bananas, including Rosemary Clooney's ''A Bunch
of Bananas,'' Carmen Miranda's ''I Made My Money with Bananas'' and
the 1923 hit, ''Yes! We Have No Bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   But probably the most famous banana tune was the jingle sung by
Carmen Miranda that told Americans to store the fruit at room
temperature, ''never in the refrigerator.'' The jingle was popular
in the post-World War II era when many Americans acquired their
first refrigerator. Jenkins records that on one day it played 376
times on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   People slipping on banana peels remain a staple of jokes and
cartoons. Limericks became popular in the 19th century and one
published in 1886 began this way:
</P>
<P>
   ''A certain young woman named Hannah
</P>
<P>
   ''Slipped down on a piece of banana;
</P>
<P>
   ''She shrieked, and oh, my'd!
</P>
<P>
   ''And more stars she spied
</P>
<P>
   ''Than belong to the star-spangled banner.''
</P>
<P>
   The first banana imports of any quantity came from Cuba, brought
to the United States by enterprising ship captains looking for
marketable cargo on return voyages. A New York merchant imported
300 bunches of Cuban Reds in 1843 and sold them for 25 cents a
banana, comparable to about $2 today.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1880s, Lorenzo Dow Baker, a Cape Cod fishing boat
captain, and Andrew Preston, a Boston produce agent, joined forces
to create the firm that became United Fruit Co. It became the
leader in importing bananas and popularizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins relates how United Fruit and its competitors developed
plantations throughout Central America and wielded so much power in
several small countries that they became known as banana republics.
</P>
<P>
   Bananas remain a touchy foreign policy issue. The United States
is imposing tariffs on European luxury goods in retaliation for
barriers imposed by the European Union on bananas from the Central
American plantations of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Banana importers succeeded in promoting their product as one of
the healthiest of foods. Articles advised Americans eat bananas raw
and cooked, on cereal and in sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The banana is also rich in mineral salts, containing as much
iron as whole wheat bread and outranking the potato in
energy-giving qualities,'' said an article in a 1981 issue of the
Ladies Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian book records that a soda fountain in Latrobe,
Pa., created the first banana split in 1904. Students at Garringer
High School in Charlotte, N.C., in 1967 set the record for the
world's largest banana split, a 250-foot creation that used 500
bananas, 45 gallons of ice cream and 12 gallons of toppings.
</P>
<P>
   Bananas even played a role in Cold War rhetoric. In Fulton, Ky.,
a railroad crossroads through which bananas were shipped, the
International Banana Festival was founded in the 1960s to celebrate
where the mutual interests of North and South America coincided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theme, Project-Unite Us, was conceived with the ultimate
goal to 'fight communism with bananas,''' the Fulton Daily Leader
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The program for the sixth annual festival in 1968 described its
youth program as ''a blow aimed at the beachhead which communism is
attempting to establish in these banana-producing countries.''

<HEADLINE> Potentially Toxic Artifacts Found  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- David Hostler learned the troubling news
when he journeyed more than 3,000 miles from his Hoopa Valley
reservation, California's largest, to dig through troves of tribal
artifacts on display and in storage at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Ivy League school's Peabody Museum of
Archaeology and Ethnology, which owns the largest collection of
American Indian remains outside the Smithsonian, officials
suggested he don a pair of gloves and a dust mask before sifting
through the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when I found out some of the artifacts had been
contaminated,'' said Hostler, a director of the Hoopa museum and a
ceremonial leader of the tribe, which has 4,000 members and an
89,000-acre reservation about 40 miles outside the northern
California coastal city of Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Hostler and fellow Indians across the United
States remain unsettled by the notion that human remains and sacred
objects being returned to them under the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, may be poisoned with
heavy metals and pesticides that were used as preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, representatives of California's 110 tribes began
arriving at San Francisco State University for a three-day workshop
aimed at raising awareness of the potential health risks that
scientists consider especially acute because many of the artifacts
-- steeped in spiritual significance -- have been or will be returned
to their traditional use.
</P>
<P>
   ''For people who are only hearing about this for the first time,
it's only human to be scared and angry,'' said Lee Davis, an
anthropology professor at SFSU and consultant for the Hoopa tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticides and other toxins, including mercury and arsenic, have
been routinely used on all kinds of artifacts to preserve them and
keep insects away, with the idea that the objects would only be
displayed under glass.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed when the repatriation act, passed in 1990,
required museums to return headdresses and other regalia to their
rightful tribal owners.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how widespread the contamination may be, since
most of the evidence is anecdotal and no official empirical studies
have been conducted to determine whether mercury, arsenic, DDT and
other toxins used as pesticides or preservatives persist in harmful
levels.
</P>
<P>
   SFSU on Friday released preliminary findings of a study showing
traces of mercury in a handful of items that have found their way
back to the Hoopa tribe. There were also low levels of pesticides
on some samples, including DDT and naphthalene, an active
ingredient in mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Palmer, a chemical analyst who led the study,
questioned whether the results were reliable, saying he was ''not
sure how they would hold up in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other researchers noted how they are impeded by financial
constraints and limited in the types of testing they can do since a
lot of the cultural material must remain intact, and removing
toxins could be destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no easy answers -- a lot of uncertainties,'' Palmer
told a large group of other scientists, Indian leaders and
observers during one of Friday's sessions, calling the study a
''best effort'' by students. ''At least we've done this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and other scientists agree more in-depth studies are
needed. On Sunday, organizers plan to start drawing up a cohesive
plan to address the issues raised at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ramifications are complex,'' said Jeff Fentress,
coordinator of SFSU's artifact testing lab. ''Where did all these
contaminants come from? What other contaminants are there? What
exposure have we all had all these years? And last, what do we do
about it?''
</P>
<P>
   For the tribes, the waiting could mean sacrificing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Repatriation is important for preserving our culture and
educating our youth, and carrying on our religion as it always
was,'' Hostler said. ''At this time, hopefully we'll find solutions
on how to get the poisons out.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Deaf Student Struck in Head  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who knew Gallaudet University freshman
Eric Franklin Plunkett say he had no enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the beating death of Plunkett, 19, who was deaf, had
cerebral palsy and was a leader of a gay campus group, is that much
harder to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest question here now is, 'Why?''' Chester Virnig,
Plunkett's mentor and a math teacher at the Minnesota State Academy
for the Deaf, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gallaudet was established by Congress in 1864 and is the
nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf and
hearing-impaired. It has about 2,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett, of Burnsville, Minn., was found in his dormitory room
Thursday night after a student asked an official to check on him,
police Cmdr. Jennifer Greene said. Plunkett had not been seen for
more than a day.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy has not been completed, but Greene said a preliminary
report showed Plunkett died of blows to the head. Police told The
Washington Post they have no suspects and no motive, although they
have found what they believe to be the weapon. They would not say
what it was or where it was found.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Medical Examiner Jonathan L. Arden would not say how long
Plunkett may have been dead before his body was found. Greene would
say only that Plunkett may have been dead for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett was secretary of the Lambda Society, a gay and lesbian
organization of about 20 students. The student-run group is a
university club for gay and straight students, said club President
Thomas Green.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett ''was very motivated and he had a real desire to see
the organization grow,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there was no evidence that Punkett's involvement in
the club was related to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Students described Plunkett as friendly, somewhat shy and handy
with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a very sweet guy. He had high expectations for his
future,'' said Jean Frink, a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   At the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault,
Plunkett managed the football and basketball teams. He had taken
home so many honors when he graduated from the 12th grade --
including being named salutatorian of his class -- that those who
knew him wondered if enough plaques had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm smiling, because it seems every time an award was
announced, he was up there -- up and down, up and down,'' Linda
Mitchell, the school's superintendent, told the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine, I just can't imagine him having an enemy in
the world,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Thriller Depicts N.Korean Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Wolves, monsters, baby-snatchers.
Throughout the Cold War, the South Korean government pedaled
propaganda about the denizens of its once-bitter foe, communist
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with reconciliation blooming on the Korean peninsula,
Southerners are hungry to know what their old and mysterious enemy
is really like.
</P>
<P>
   They're getting a warmer view at the cinema this month, where a
new thriller depicts North Korean soldiers as funny and vulnerable,
rather than stereotypically cruel and inhuman.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened Sept. 9, ''Joint Security Area'' has drawn more
than 2 million viewers in a country of 47 million people and is
poised to become South Korea's biggest movie hit.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the tale about a murder investigation that
threatens to topple the uneasy peace on the Korean peninsula refers
to the neutral border area in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ. U.S.
soldiers operate in the area, a negotiation site that has been the
scene of confrontation and violence between the two sides on a few
rare occasions.
</P>
<P>
   DMZ jitters might wind down a notch soon. At their first-ever
talks this week, the defense ministers of both Koreas said their
soldiers would cooperate in plans to reconnect a cross-border
railway.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the lively portrayal of an illicit friendship
between four South and North Korean border guards matches the
curiosity and yearnings of South Koreans after five decades of
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie showed that ordinary citizens of North and South
Korea could mix together without any problem if it weren't for the
politics and ideology that separates them,'' said Kim Yu-kyong, a
26-year-old employee of an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Tears have been shed in a few theaters showing ''Joint Security
Area,'' though far fewer than during a far more evocative, and
real-life, event that helped humanize North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   In August, South Koreans wept as they watched televised images
of a round of anguished reunions of separated family members from
both Koreas who had not been able to meet in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions were the outcome of an unprecedented summit two
months earlier between leaders of the Koreas at which they agreed
to work toward reunification, a goal expected to take years and
even decades.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement has fueled South Koreans' eagerness to learn
more about their neighbors. Books about the North are selling well,
television stations show more programs about the North, and North
Korea studies are attracting more university students.
</P>
<P>
   Production on ''Joint Security Area'' began at a time when the
South's attitude toward the North was softening under the aegis of
President Kim Dae-jung and his policy of engaging Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North is viewed as the enemy,'' director Park Chan-wook
said. ''I want to question whether that's really the right
perspective on things.''
</P>
<P>
   In their roles as soldiers of opposing armies, his actors share
cigarettes, arm wrestle, tell jokes and chat about girlfriends and
favorite snacks. Yet the shadow of the conflict that divided their
peninsula at the end of World War II is never distant, and violence
ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Park's movie departs from the dogmatic tradition of South Korean
movies in the 1960s and 1970s, when military-backed governments
urged their citizens to trumpet the virtues of their system over
that of the North.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's homegrown hit, the spy thriller ''Swiri'', injected
humanity into inter-Korean intrigue. The plot: a South Korean
intelligence agent falls in love with a North Korean terrorist but
ends up shooting her to death after discovering her true identity.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has been democratic for a decade, and filmmakers and
other artists don't have to worry as much about violating
anti-communist censorship laws that are no longer rigorously
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The penurious film industry in totalitarian North Korea clings
to its formulas.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last week, the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA,
listed movies such as ''Star of Korea'' and ''The Sun of the
Nation'' that glorify the achievements of Kim Il Sung, the late
revered leader and national founder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those films, widely known as revolutionary ones, give the high
honor and pride of the nation to the Korean people who are
exceptionally strong in the spirit of worshipping the leader,''
KCNA said.

<HEADLINE> Work Stoppage Pressures Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Opposition leaders were fighting to
keep up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic to step down,
urging more protests and work stoppages over the weekend to build
on earlier massive demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Students rallied Friday in southern Yugoslavia, shopkeepers
shuttered their doors in the east and television workers cut off
transmissions in the north. The actors' guild declared a strike,
and most theater and cinema owners said they would shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Several roads were blocked in northern and southern parts of
Serbia and more than 7,000 coal miners stopped work in Kolubara, 25
miles south of Belgrade. Two protests in Belgrade's main Republic
Square drew more than 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Police briefly blocked one of three main bridges over the Sava
River, trying to prevent people and a column of about 100 taxi
drivers from joining the evening protest.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders want the protests to pressure the Yugoslav
strongman to admit that challenger Vojislav Kostunica won Sunday's
election by a wide margin. Milosevic admits he finished second, but
his government says the vote was so close that an Oct. 8 runoff is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of Milosevic, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N.
administrator of Kosovo, accused the Yugoslav president of
manipulating votes cast in that southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man is a liar,'' Kouchner said of Milosevic and of his
supporters' claims that 140,000 votes were cast in Kosovo, compared
to the no more than 40,000 counted by U.N. monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The gatherings in Belgrade were hastily organized and announced
late Thursday night, hence drawing smaller crowds. News of
opposition activity travels with difficulty -- mostly by word of
mouth -- since the lone independent radio station was off the air in
central Belgrade, where most of the capital's residents live, and
the cellular phone network was jammed during the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Belgrade, thousands of high school students shunned
classes in Nis, Serbia's third-largest city, and spilled into the
streets -- some jumping out of first floor classroom windows in
their haste to attend the protest. Waving anti-Milosevic banners,
they chanted: ''Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan,'' while
taxi drivers blockaded adjoining streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nis Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told an evening rally attended by about
40,000 people that the protests will last ''up to seven days,'' and
that they will start in full force on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 people gathered in Kragujevac and 10,000 in
Kraljevo in central Serbia. In Novi Sad, the second-largest Serbian
city, six employees of the state television were fired for wanting
to organize a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Similar walkouts -- joined by shopkeepers and company employees --
were staged in a dozen other cities and towns across Serbia,
including the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Sabac.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Serbia's opposition lodged an official complaint
with the Federal Election Commission, providing their own tally
that showed Kostunica beat Milosevic 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent
in Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission fails to respond to their complaint, the
opposition will press the case to the country's constitutional
court.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeta Jankovic, an opposition leader, told the evening rally
in Belgrade that Greece and Norway have agreed to send delegations
to arbitrate over the election dispute. His claim could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign leaders, including President Clinton, have promised
to lift sanctions if Kostunica's victory is respected.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has praised the growing
anti-Milosevic movement, and noted, without giving specifics, that
American forces were ''prepared for contingencies.''

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Rangers 5  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Giambi hit his 42nd homer and the
Oakland Athletics seesawed past Seattle into the AL West lead with
a 7-5 victory Friday night over the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde's go-ahead, two-run single in the sixth inning
sent the A's to a half-game edge over the Mariners, who lost to
Anaheim 9-3. Cleveland is one game behind Seattle for the wild card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde singled off Francisco Cordero (1-2) to break a 3-all
tie. In the same inning, Matt Stairs scored when Giambi's grounder
was misplayed by third baseman Mike Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi hit a solo homer in the fourth. He has 12 home runs and
29 RBIs so far in September.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir (10-3) pitched two innings for the win. Jason
Isringhausen worked the ninth for his 32nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Texas closed to 6-5 in the eighth when Royce Clayton singled
home a run and Chad Curtis had his third RBI groundout of the game.
The A's got a run in the bottom half when third baseman Scott
Sheldon made an error on Stairs' grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are hoping to gain some playoff ground against the
AL's worst second-half team and avoid a trip to Tampa Bay for a
makeup game Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo Saenz hit an RBI single in the fifth to give the A's a
3-2 lead. But the Rangers tied it in the sixth on Curtis' RBI
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Kenny Rogers got a no-decision, leaving intact his
streak at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, formerly with the A's, has won his last 17 decisions at
the Coliseum, last losing on Aug. 7, 1994. It is the longest streak
for a pitcher in a single ballpark since Minnesota's Frank Viola
won 19 in a row at the Metrodome from May 27, 1987 to July 22,
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers went 4 1-3 innings, allowing three runs on five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' grounder in the first inning was bobbled by shortstop
Miguel Tejada and scored a run. Tejada had not made an error in a
career-high 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb scored on Sheldon's sacrifice fly in the fourth. Giambi
homered to start the bottom half and Tejada scored on Eric Chavez's
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz's RBI single off Rogers in the fifth inning scored
Velarde, who also singled. Velarde was 3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman will not be back with
the team next season, manager Johnny Oates said. Bosman, the
Rangers' pitching coach for the past six years, was not with the
team in Oakland for their three-game series against the Athletics.
... Luis Alicea walked to lead off the game, then left because of a
strained left calf. The injury had been bothering him prior to the
game. ... A's left fielder Ben Grieve was a late scratch from
Friday night's lineup with a sore neck. The A's shifted rookie
Terrence Long to left field and brought in Bo Porter to play
center.

<HEADLINE> Mets 11, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets took care of business early,
getting their offense and ace pitcher tuned up for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run first
inning as the New York Mets cruised to an 11-2 victory over the
Montreal Expos on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Payton drove in a career-high four runs, Robin Ventura had his
24th home run and three RBIs, and Mike Hampton allowed three hits
in five strong innings to give the NL wild card Mets their third
straight win and sixth in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike got a good workout in, and the guys swung the bats real
well,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ''We just want to get
through this where we have good health, both physically and
mentally. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sent nine to the plate in the first, giving Hampton
(15-10) a six-run cushion and sending the Expos to their seventh
loss in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was on cruise control, retiring his last eight batters
before leaving after the fifth inning. Hampton, the Mets' possible
Game 1 starter against San Francisco or St. Louis in the first
round of the NL playoffs next Wednesday, struck out four and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first couple of innings were pretty long,'' said Hampton,
who threw just 64 pitches on a cool night at Shea Stadium. ''It
took me a while to get loose and get warmed up, but I felt a lot
more comfortable in my last two innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Thurman (4-9) got into trouble early.
</P>
<P>
   Timo Perez led off with a bloop single out of Thurman's reach
and third baseman Mike Mordecai couldn't make a play. Thurman then
walked Darryl Hamilton, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza to force in
a run. Ventura made it 2-0 with a base hit that went off second
baseman Jose Vidro's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first hit of the game was one of those things, and it just
sort of snowballed from there,'' Thurman said. ''I didn't seem to
be able to get anybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton followed with the Mets' team record-tying eighth grand
slam of the season. Payton hit a 2-1 fastball into the back of the
Expos bullpen in left field to give the Mets a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last time I faced these guys, they threw me a lot of
breaking balls, so I was thinking I might get a fastball,'' Payton
said. ''I was just looking for something over the middle of the
plate, and fortunately it was something I could drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had 11 hits and used 16 of 19 available position
players, added four more runs in the second on RBI singles by
Alfonzo and Piazza, and a two-run homer by Ventura off Julio
Santana.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of runs scored in the first two innings,'' Expos manager
Felipe Alou said. ''It's real tough when that happens. And
(Thurman) didn't throw very well, I didn't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, winless in six starts, lasted just one-plus inning and
allowed eight runs, six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   ''No sense in trying to analyze it,'' Thurman said. ''The
season's over for me. There's no reason to try to figure it out
now. It was bad, and that's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos got a run in the seventh when Vidro hit a leadoff
double against John Franco, and went to third on Orlando Cabrera's
fly to center. Vidro scored when third baseman Jorge Velandia
bobbled Michael Barrett's grounder and threw high to Matt Franco,
pulling him off first base for an error to make it 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got their final run in the seventh when Joe McEwing
scored on Vidro's error while trying to complete a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos added a run in the eighth when Terry Jones hit a
leadoff triple, and Fernando Seguignol drove him in with a
groundout to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Valentine and GM Steve Phillips both said the team had not
made final decisions on the rotation or the 25-man roster for the
playoffs. Phillips, Valentine and Mets coaches met for about an
hour Friday, and will meet again within the next three days to make
final decisions. ... Only Derek Bell and Benny Agbayani, both
recovering from injuries, and Todd Pratt did not play for the Mets.
... The Mets also hit eight grand slams last season. ... The Expos
have given up an NL-record 12 grand slams this season.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Keith swirled to life Friday in the Caribbean
and drifted slowly to the northwest, with forecasters saying it could soon
become a hurricane that will threaten parts of Mexico. Torrential rains were
expected through the weekend as the storm grows stronger and moves toward the
Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane watches were issued for parts of the Yucatan
peninsula. Meanwhile, Hurricane Joyce weakened into a tropical storm Friday and
kept losing steam, with top sustained winds dropping to 50 mph as it churned
westward across the Atlantic. Residents in the Lesser Antilles were told to
track the storm.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leader of a gay campus group at the nation's only
liberal arts university for the deaf was found dead in his dormitory room after
being struck in the head repeatedly, police said Friday. Eric Franklin Plunkett,
19, of Burnsville, Minn., who was deaf and had cerebral palsy, was found in his
room at Gallaudet University on Thursday night after a student asked an official
to check on him, police Cmdr. Jennifer Greene said. Plunkett had not been seen
for more than a day, Greene said. Plunkett was secretary of the Lambda Society
of Gallaudet University, a gay and lesbian organization comprised of about 20
students. The medical examiner's office ruled Plunkett's death a homicide.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan to open up the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain to oil drilling drew praise from state
politicians and oil companies today, while opponents warned it would harm the
environment. The Republican presidential candidate, speaking at a factory in
Saginaw, Mich., said today he supports opening 1.5 million acres of the refuge
to drilling to decrease the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Vice
President Al Gore shot back that former oilman Bush just wanted to let oil
companies ''invade precious natural treasures like the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea is threatening to stop cooperating with U.S.
efforts to recover remains of American servicemen lost in the Korean War unless
the Pentagon provides more humanitarian aid. In talks Sept. 15 in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang, a North Korean army officer told Robert Jones, the
Pentagon official in charge of POW-MIA issues, that a deal reached in June to
provide U.S. access to battlefields will not be renewed when it expires in
November unless the aid issue is settled first. The United States is paying
North Korea $2 million this year for its assistance in the remains recovery.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rich Aurilia hit a tiebreaking homer and drove in three runs,
and the San Francisco Giants clinched at least a tie for the best record in the
major leagues by beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 Friday night. The win sent
the Giants (96-64) two games ahead of Atlanta and St. Louis in the race for
home-field advantage in the NL playoffs. The Giants' record also is two games
better than Chicago's in the AL with two games remaining. Livan Hernandez
(17-11), who lost to Brian Anderson and the Diamondbacks on Sunday when he gave
up a season-high eight runs, allowed two runs in eight innings for the win.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules For Clint Eastwood  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Eastwood was cast as the villain
but considered himself the hero. In the end, a federal jury saw
things his way.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood was cleared Friday of having to pay damages to a
disabled woman who sued him because his historic inn near Carmel
lacked wheelchair access. The jury deliberated less than five hours
in siding with Eastwood, who claimed he had been set up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there were too many lies told in court and I think the
jury could see through that,'' Eastwood said shortly before he
thanked the jurors, signed autographs for them and let court
marshals take pictures with him.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, 51-year-old Diane zum Brunnen, who has muscular
dystrophy, was not in court when the verdict was read. Her
attorneys said they were considering an appeal and said Eastwood's
celebrity status influenced the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen sued Eastwood under the Americans with Disabilities
Act in 1997, a year after she and her husband, Michael, say they
had dinner at Mission Ranch. The couple from Alameda complained
that the wheelchair-accessible bathroom was in another building,
more than 200 feet away, across a driveway; the only accessible
guest room was $225 a night, when other rooms were as low as $85;
and there was no ramp to the main office.
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-day trial, the jury found Eastwood liable for two
minor violations: not enough signs to the restroom and no ramp
access to the hotel office. But they said zum Brunnen deserved
nothing in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood had contended that zum Brunnen and her husband didn't
eat dinner at the ranch on Jan. 21, 1996, as they claimed, but
instead stopped by to snap a quick picture of the office they could
use in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken some distance from the office, with cars
in the foreground, on a sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   The zum Brunnens said in depositions they took the picture after
dinner -- when it would have been dark -- but said at trial it was
taken before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A surveyor testified that the picture was taken at 12:05 p.m.,
which apparently convinced the jurors that the zum Brunnens'
stories had holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of didn't think she was really there for dinner,''
said juror Lorenzo Gutierrez, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen's attorneys admitted there were inconsistencies but
chalked that up to the passage of time, rather than a failed
conspiracy to nail Eastwood. The zum Brunnens' phone number is
unlisted; they could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, a former mayor of Carmel, said he has tried to provide
disabled access in his renovations to the 150-year-old ranch, which
he bought in 1987, while preserving the inn's historic feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not against the ADA; I want to make that clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though zum Brunnen's side portrayed the case as a simple fight
for a disabled woman's civil rights, it was impossible to ignore
the 70-year-old Eastwood's role. Both sides accused the other of
seeking a ''fistful of dollars'' -- a reference to his 1964 Western.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood was asked outside court if this would have been the
verdict he would have scripted had the case been a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of fact,'' he said, smiling, ''it's not a bad
ending, is it?''

<HEADLINE> FINA Suspends Italian Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International water polo officials have
suspended Italy's coach Ratko Rudic a year from any FINA events for
his angry display after his team lost to Hungary in the Olympic
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   FINA officials met at the Sydney International Aquatic Center on
Saturday. In a statement, they said that Rudic was disciplined for
''having brought the sport of water polo in disrepute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudic, who won golds with Yugoslavia in 1984 and 1988 and with
Italy in 1992, chased the officials after the game and was arguing
so loudly a uniformed officer stepped between him and the scorer's
table at the Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a post-game conference, Rudic accused officials of conspiring
against his team. ''I have no proof,'' he said through an
interpreter. He said the conspiracy might have been held through
secret meetings. ''It's too sophisticated for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Italy appealed the game on a technical error and asked it be
replayed, but it was denied by FINA.
</P>
<P>
   Rudic is not expected to be at Italy's games the rest of the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Also, FINA suspended three Italian players for their conduct in
slamming the pooldeck and arguing with officials following Friday's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Calcaterra was suspended for four international games.
His brother, Alessandro, was suspended for two games and goalie
Francisco Attolico was suspended a game.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's Dubravko Simenc was suspended a game for arguing with
an official after his team fell to Spain, 9-8. Simenc pointed and
yelled at an official once the game ended.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Men To Play France For Gold  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Does France have a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Even the French players didn't think so after they beat
Australia to reach the gold medal game, but now all bets are off
after the American men had a huge scare in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now France is our toughest game,'' coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Lithuania provided a tougher test than anybody
would have ever imagined. No more than three points separated the
teams over the final 15&AMP;frac12; minutes and the game wasn't decided until
the final shot -- a 3-pointer by Sarunas Jasikevicius -- was
off-target at the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The final score of 85-83 represented the closest game for an
American men's team in the Olympics since 1988 -- the final year
that collegians represented the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were fighting for our lives,'' Ray Allen said. ''It would
not have been very fun to play for the bronze medal. But these
teams are good, and we know that on Sunday we could be in the same
situation if we don't come out and just play the game of
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Friday night's near-miracle, the surprise of the last
few days of the tournament has been France. After finishing fourth
in Group A to barely make it to the medal round, the French rolled
past Canada, the first place team in Group B, and then knocked off
the host team, Australia, with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The French players hugged each other and celebrated after
beating the Aussies like they had won the gold medal, knowing in
the back of their minds that they really have no chance to beat the
Americans. A few hours later, they may have been reconsidering
their earlier thoughts
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to get the silver medal, so I played my best,''
France center Frederic Weis said.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be another surprise in store?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's possible,'' Weis said, ''but we'll see. A
game is a game, so we'll try.''
</P>
<P>
   France scored 94 points against the Americans in the preliminary
round and lost by just 12 in a game that was highlighted by Vince
Carter soaring over the head of the 7-foot-2 Weis for an incredible
slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I the first guy he dunked against?'' Weis asked Friday,
laughing at his own humor.
</P>
<P>
   France will look to get most of its offense from guards Laurent
Sciarra and Antoine Rigaudeau, both of whom are a threat from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Rigaudeau is shooting 37 percent from 3-point range in the
Olympics and is averaging a team-high 13.0 points per game, while
Sciarra has shot 42.3 percent from 3-point range while averaging
10.1 points per game. Weis is their leading rebounder, and guard
Makan Dioumassi is their defensive stopper off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   France's third-leading scorer, Yann Bonato, ruptured his
Achilles tendon against Canada and has already returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we played well in our loss to the United States we have
lost all our inhibitions,'' France coach Jean Pierre de Vincenzi
said. ''We are happy. We have to be. This has not happened for us
since 1948.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, meanwhile, were feeling a huge sense of relief
Saturday after avoiding what would have been one of the biggest
upsets in the history of basketball, Olympics or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to create turnovers with their pressure defense and
unable to pull away from the no-quit Lithuanians, the U.S. team was
further flummoxed by Lithuania's use of a tight 2-3 zone defense.
The Americans repeatedly pounded the ball inside, where they were
quickly double-teamed, and were often unsuccessful trying to shoot
over the zone from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, it came down to a final shot that might have come
closer had Jason Kidd not been playing such tight defense on
Jasikevicius.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a sigh of relief when I saw that the ball didn't touch
anything and the time had expired off the clock,'' Ray Allen said.
''It was a situation we put ourselves in, but when we win the gold
medal we can definitely say that we earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, the Americans have to earn it one last time.
Tip-off for the gold medal game is 10 p.m. EDT Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania plays Australia in the bronze medal game at 8 p.m.
EDT.

<HEADLINE> Felix Savon Wins Boxing Gold  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Felix Savon didn't look like a winner,
but he was. So was Cuba, which will go home with its usual Olympic
boxing medal haul.
</P>
<P>
   Savon was bleeding badly from a deep cut under his left eye as
his fight with Russia's Sultanahmed Ibzagimov drew to an end
Saturday. By that time, though, he had landed his big right hand
enough to secure his third Olympic heavyweight boxing gold.
</P>
<P>
   Savon became only the third boxer to win three Olympic gold
medals, joining former Cuban heavyweight Teofilo Stevenson and
Hungary's Lazlo Papp as triple gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Savon's teammates also won gold medal fights, giving
the powerful Cuban team four gold medals -- the same total it won in
Atlanta -- and two bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Six more gold medal bouts will be fought Sunday, but no Cubans
are in them. No Americans fought Saturday, but two are in gold
medal bouts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Savon, who won gold medals in 1992 and 1996 and is a six-time
world amateur champion, came into the ring with a mark under his
left eye that appeared swollen from a previous fight.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop him from piling up points against the Russian,
who had trouble getting inside the reach of the 6-foot-6 Cuban
heavyweight. A punch in the fourth round opened a deep cut below
the eye, but Savon was allowed to continue and won 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   As Savon went back to his corner, blood was streaming down his
face from the cut.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, though, he was happily dancing in the ring,
waving a Cuban flag in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really happy. I dedicate this to the people of Cuba,''
Savon said.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Savon has dominated amateur heavyweight boxing
for the last decade, though there were whispers that he was fading
as he got off to a rocky start in his first fight before beating
his Nigerian opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett was next for Savon, who used his powerful right
hand to pile up enough points to stop the inexperienced American
late in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great warrior,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Savon was cut under the left eye in a semifinal fight he won
over a German, but was allowed to continue and fight in the gold
medal bout.
</P>
<P>
   Ibzagimov, who landed some telling blows in the final two
rounds, said he followed the wrong strategy for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out and boxed defensively, and it was a mistake,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cubans winning Saturday were Ortiz Rigondeaux, a
20-year-old newcomer at 119 pounds, and veterans Mario Kindelan at
132 pounds and Jorge Gutierrez at 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The other two gold medals were won by Brahim Asloum of France at
106 pounds, and Oleg Saitov of Russia at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Olympic gold for Saitov, who also won in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what I'm going to do now,'' Saitov said after
beating Sergei Dotsenko of the Ukraine, 24-16. ''I don't like
planning ahead. I will just let things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Saitov's win brightened the day for the Russian team, which came
into the finals with the most boxers still in the competition --
five -- but lost three of four fights.
</P>
<P>
   The first boxing gold went to Asloum, who earlier in the
tournament had beaten favored Brian Viloria of the United States at
106 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asloum was fighting perhaps the smallest boxer in 4-foot-11
Rafael Lozano of Spain, who was fighting in his third Olympics.
Lozano, who won a bronze medal in Atlanta, fought hard but just
couldn't keep the pressure on Asloum, who was wearing his hair in
his country's colors of white, blue and red.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted the gold, but I got the silver. I hope my girlfriend
will talk to me tonight,'' Lozano said.

<P>
   One more win will give the San Francisco Giants something they
haven't had in almost 40 years -- the best record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night improved
the NL-leading Giants to 96-64, two games ahead of Atlanta and St.
Louis (each 94-66), which both lost. The Chicago White Sox are also
94-66 for the best record in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has not had the best record in baseball since
1962.
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games, it was Cincinnati 8, St. Louis 1; Colorado 4,
Atlanta 2; New York 11, Montreal 2; Los Angeles 3, San Diego 0;
Florida 7, Philadelphia 1; Pittsburgh 8, Chicago 4; and Milwaukee
13, Houston 3.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia hit a tiebreaking homer and drove in three runs as
the Giants clinched at least a tie for the majors' best record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people have success here,'' said Aurilia, who
homered for the second time in four games at Phoenix, all Giants'
wins. ''It's a good hitter's park, got a good backdrop to hit, and
the ball carries.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco would be wise to clinch home-field advantage
throughout the NL playoffs: it finished with the majors' best home
record (55-26).
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (17-11) allowed two runs in eight innings. Robb
Nen pitched the ninth for his career-high 41st save, 28th straight,
giving up a run on Luis Gonzalez's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad Robb Nen closed it out,'' manager Dusty Baker
said. ''And Livan? That was a tremendous performance -- a gutsy
performance. He was in trouble a couple of times and got out. That
was some big hitting from Richie, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson (11-7), who went into the game tied with Greg
Maddux for the best walks-to-innings ratio in the NL, issued a
career-high five walks. He gave up seven hits and four runs in 6
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Reds 8, Cardinals 1
</P>
<P>
   Ron Villone struck out a career-high 16 in St. Louis, tying a
Reds franchise record for strikeouts by a left-hander set by
Noodles Hahn in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Villone (10-10) pitched a two-hitter and had three singles.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central champion Cardinals are tied with Atlanta for the
second-best record in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (16-9), pitching for the first time in 13
days, gave up five runs on three home runs in five innings and has
a 6.60 ERA in five September starts.
</P>
<P>
Rockies 4, Braves 2
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth and Terry Shumpert hit consecutive home runs
off Andy Ashby as Colorado slowed host Atlanta's chances for
home-field advantage in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton added his 41st home run for the Rockies in the
ninth. The NL East champion Braves lost their third straight.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (12-10) gave up five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings. Jose Jimenez earned his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (12-13) had won his previous four starts.
</P>
<P>
Mets 11, Expos 2
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run first
inning at New York.
</P>
<P>
   Payton drove in a career-high four runs, Robin Ventura had a
home run and three RBIs, and Mike Hampton (15-10) allowed three
hits in five innings to give the Mets their third straight win and
sixth in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sent nine to the plate in the first against Mike
Thurman (4-9), sending the Expos to their seventh straight loss.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 3, Padres 0
</P>
<P>
   At San Diego, Gary Sheffield tied the Dodgers' franchise record
with his career-high 43rd homer, and Chan Ho Park struck out 13 and
also homered in his first major league shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Park (18-10) pitched a two-hitter and extended his scoreless
streak to 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's solo shot in the eighth matched Duke Snider's mark
set with Brooklyn in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Park's homer leading off the eighth gave the Dodgers a
franchise-record 209 home runs, besting the previous mark set by
Brooklyn in 1953. Two batters later, Sheffield connected off Woody
Williams (10-8).
</P>
<P>
Marlins 7, Phillies 1
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith allowed four hits and struck out 11 in eight strong
innings as Florida won at home.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo and Cliff Floyd hit solo home runs for the
Marlins, who have won four in a row and six of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Smith (6-6) won for the fourth time in six starts, striking out
the side twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen (7-4) took the loss for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Pirates 8, Cubs 4
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Brown scored the go-ahead run in the seventh and added a
two-run single in the eighth at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 4-4 in the seventh, Brown pinch hit for
winning pitcher Marc Wilkins (4-2) and drew a leadoff walk from
Steve Rain (3-4). Mike Benjamin bunted Brown to second and Jason
Kendall followed with a grounder that was fielded by first baseman
Julio Zuleta.
</P>
<P>
   Zuleta flipped to Rain for the out, but Brown never stopped and
scored easily.
</P>
<P>
Brewers 13, Astros 3
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins homered twice and Jeromy Burnitz homered and
scored four runs at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers wrapped up third place in the NL Central. The Astros
hit the 90-loss mark for the first time since dropping 97 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Horacio Estrada (3-0) made his first appearance in the majors
since May 21. He allowed three runs on five hits and five walks in
5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (17-7) lost for the third time in five decisions.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Beats Russia 3-2 In Volleyball  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Cuban women maintained their
volleyball dominance with their greatest Olympic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying from a two-game deficit, Cuba stormed back to win a
record third consecutive gold medal with a thrilling 25-27, 32-34,
25-19, 25-18, 15-7 victory over Russia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are Cubans. We came here to do the best, and that meant
fighting until the end,'' captain Regla Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba now has won every major international competition since the
1992 Games, building an amazing 35-3 record in world championships
and Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in ability and execution between the two teams
was minuscule, and they battled back and forth in a match befitting
the sport's two superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba had a 24-21 lead in the opener before letting it slip away.
In the second game, Cuba led 24-23 but again failed to close. Both
teams fought for and lost four more game points until Russia pulled
ahead 33-32 on a kill by Elena Godina, who then closed it out by
stuffing Marlenis Costa at the net.
</P>
<P>
   Regla Torres, Cuba's greatest player, brought her team back by
getting her 6-foot-3 frame into the path of the Russian players as
often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very tense in the first two sets, because of the
pressure of winning a third gold medal,'' Torres said. ''Then we
relaxed and changed the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who became the youngest volleyball gold medalist when
she played on the 1992 team at age 17, was fearless in the middle,
attacking the 6-4 Godina and Russia's other main scoring threat,
6-3 Liobov Chachkova.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba jumped to a 20-9 lead in the fourth game and withstood a
late rally. In the deciding game, the Cubans took an 8-4 lead and
kept hitting, as the young Russian team folded.
</P>
<P>
   Torres got the final kill, a shot from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ''These last few games have been the most difficult of my
career,'' Torres said. ''This has been one of those achievements I
won't forget in all my life. I dedicate this win to the whole
country of Cuba. I hope it will be an inspiration to the women of
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was sweet for Cuban coach Luis Calderon. He had
replaced Eugenio George, the national team coach for 15 years,
after George left the program in a dispute with sports officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery Russian coach Nikolai Karpol, meanwhile, fumed to the very
end.
</P>
<P>
   Karpol, who led the Soviet Union to gold medals in 1980 and
1988, had become the most-booed man among the crowds at Sydney
Entertainment Center with his fist-shaking tirades against his
players. As the Cubans celebrated, he argued with officials over a
previous call.
</P>
<P>
   Karpol was under intense pressure to bring home a winner after
the team's fourth-place finish in Atlanta. Russia had won four
golds and three silvers since volleyball became a medal sport in
1964. Besides 1996, the only time the Russians had not finished
first or second was in 1984, when the nation boycotted the Los
Angeles Games.

<HEADLINE> Reynolds Sails To Second Gold Medal  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mark Reynolds stood barefoot on the
dock, an American flag in his left hand, and marveled at how he won
his second Olympic sailing gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   His victory on the Pacific Ocean on Saturday (Friday night EDT)
was just the latest example of why the 44-year-old San Diego
sailmaker has been called the star of the Star class.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is great to have come from behind,'' said Reynolds, a
four-time Olympian. ''There were probably a few people that counted
us out after six races.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't say that I counted myself out, but at that point I was
starting to be concerned more about getting into the medals than
just worrying about a gold.''
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in this regatta, Reynolds and his crew,
Magnus Liljedahl, 46, of Miami, rallied and were assured of at
least the bronze medal when the day began.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it looked like they would get after going over the
starting line early in the 11th and deciding fleet race, the
combination of aggressiveness and being trapped there by Gavin
Brady, a New Zealander who lives in America.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had to turn back and cross the starting line again.
Instead of being buried in the 16-boat fleet, he ended up gaining
from a wind shift on the right side of the course, while most
everyone else thought the first shift would come on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to really go for it at the start and unfortunately,
I get a little too wound up and we kind of went over everybody and
we were over the line,'' said Reynolds, who also is the current
Star world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had enough speed to loop back around and not have that
bad of a start on port tack, with clear air.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really fortunate because the right side was a little
favored,'' he said. ''We got a little bit of a shift, and as soon
as we got that, bang, we tacked back and we knew we were in the
pack, we knew we had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds rounded the buoy at the top of the windward first leg
in second place, which, as it turned out, was gold medal position.
He finished second behind Canada's Ross MacDonald, holding off
Britain skipper Ian Walker by one point for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Walker worked his way up to finish third in the final race.
Reynolds and Walker came into the race tied for second on points.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Star gold medalist Torben Grael of Brazil came in with
a five-point lead. He was disqualified for being over the line
early and not turning back to restart, but still got the bronze,
his fourth Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   In the America's Cup earlier this year, Grael served as
tactician aboard Italy's Luna Rossa, which was swept by New Zealand
in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' gold helps restore some glitter to the American
sailing team, which was embarrassed in its home waters in Savannah,
Ga., in 1996 by winning just two bronzes. Four years earlier at
Barcelona, the United States won medals in nine of 10 classes,
including the gold won by Reynolds and his crew, Hal Haenel.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds won the gold in '92 with one race left to sail. This
time, he needed all 11 races.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had unbelievable luck in '92,'' Reynolds said. ''This was a
lot more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who owns a sail loft near the San Diego Yacht Club,
won the silver medal in 1988. He is a second-generation Star sailor
and protege of Dennis Conner.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Jim, who won a Star world championship with Conner
and fell just short in three attempts to make it to the Olympics,
was among several family members watching from South Head.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds sailed into the top three with three strong finishes on
Friday, including a first.
</P>
<P>
   He was assured of a medal in an off-the-water development.
Bermuda's Peter Bromby sought and received redress for a breakdown
that kept him from starting one of Friday's races, but Bromby's
adjusted score wasn't enough to give him a shot at a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding race was sailed in moderate breeze and heavy swells
off the cliffs of the Sydney Heads.

<HEADLINE> 4 Palestinians Dead Following Clash  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli riot police stormed a major Jerusalem
shrine Friday and opened fire on stone-throwing Muslim worshippers,
killing four Palestinians and wounding 175 in the worst bloodshed
in four years at the walled compound at the center of the deadlock
in Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four police officers, including the Jerusalem chief, were
hit by stones. The violence quickly spread to Jerusalem
neighborhoods and the West Bank, further dimming prospects for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority accused the Israeli government of
having ignited a ''religious war'' and called for a general strike
and a day of mourning in the Palestinian areas Saturday. Israeli
officials said they were trying to cool the situation. Peace talks
have been stalled since July over the issue of sovereignty over the
shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Violence flared again Saturday, as hundreds of Palestinians
threw stones at Israeli soldiers outside the Jewish settlement of
Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops responded with rubber
bullets. There was no immediate word on injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tension has been running high since Thursday, when the hawkish
Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, toured the Jerusalem
shrine, revered by Muslims and Jews, to demonstrate that Israel is
in control.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's violence began after Muslim noon prayers when the
compound was filled with 20,000 worshippers. Several hundred
Palestinians began hurling stones at Israeli riot police huddling
behind Plexiglas shields at the compound's Moghrabi Gate. Officers
fired barrages of rubber-coated steel pellets and snipers shot live
rounds. Police, many wielding clubs, then charged, chasing
stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mayhem, Palestinian protesters hit by rubber bullets fell
to the ground and were carried away on stretchers. One young man
was unconscious, his forehead smeared by blood. Others slumped on
the cobblestone plaza, holding their stomachs and heads in pain.
Shouts of ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, mixed with the sounds
of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the clashes spread, riots erupted in other areas of
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem and the West Bank. In the
biblical town of Bethlehem, rocks littered the main road and thick
clouds of black smoke from burning tires rose into the skies. One
stone-thrower, his face covered by a black hood, was taken into a
chokehold by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, four Palestinians were dead and at least 175 were
wounded by rubber bullets and live rounds, most shot in the upper
body, hospital officials said. Forty-four Israeli policemen and 15
civilians were hurt by stones. Eight cars, including police vans
and ambulances, were set on fire or had windshields smashed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead, Bilal Afani, 26, was a Palestinian laborer from
the West Bank suburb of Abu Dis. Before leaving his home Friday, he
had talked about having a party later in the day for his daughter's
first birthday, said Bilal's brother, Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I am sad or happy, because my brother gave his
blood for Al Aqsa (the main Jerusalem mosque), and this is an honor
for the family,'' said Ahmed Afani after thousands attended his
brother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-acre walled shrine is known to Jews as the Temple Mount,
site of their former biblical Temple, Judaism's holiest site. To
Muslims, it is Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, home to two
major mosques that mark the spot where tradition says the Prophet
Muhammad ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Cabinet said after its weekly meeting Friday
that Israeli troops opened fire ''without warning and without
justification in a planned attack, and after the failure of
Sharon's visit.''
</P>
<P>
   As the clashes raged, Sharon defended his visit to the shrine.
''The state of Israel cannot afford that an Israeli citizen will
not be able to visit part of his country, not to speak about the
holiest place for the Jewish people all around the world,'' Sharon
told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's hawkish mayor, Ehud Olmert, a member of Sharon's
Likud party, accused Palestinian security forces of orchestrating
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   However, Israel's police minister and acting foreign minister,
Shlomo Ben-Ami, said he believed the riots were spontaneous. ''Our
assessment is that this is largely linked to this visit (by
Sharon),'' Ben-Ami said, adding that neither the Palestinian
Authority nor the Israeli government had an interest in an
escalation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's clashes were preceded by two deadly attacks on Israeli
troops. On Wednesday, an Israeli soldier was killed in a bomb
attack in the Gaza Strip. On Friday morning, a Palestinian
policeman opened fire on Israeli colleagues patrolling the West
Bank town of Qalqiliya, killing one of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israel barred its citizens from entering Palestinian-run areas
to prevent further friction, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ordered more police to be deployed in Jerusalem. The violence came
at the start of the Jewish New Year which ushers in a 10-day period
of contemplation and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami and Arafat spoke separately by phone with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright on Friday. Ben-Ami tried also tried to
reassure the Palestinians, saying Israel was not trying to
challenge the right of Muslims to worship at the Haram as-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came at a time of increased tensions between
Israelis and Palestinians, and at a time of deadlock in peace
treaty talks. The negotiations are hung up because of rival claims
to sovereignty over the mosque compound. Both sides have said they
would not grant the other sole control. U.S. mediators have floated
compromise ideas, but none has been accepted by both Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Controversial calls Plague Taekwondo  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The last impression the people running
taekwondo want its Olympic debut to leave is that it's just too
Korean for the rest of the world to ever really break into.
</P>
<P>
   But while the World Taekwondo Federation took pains to keep that
from happening, they weren't able to escape a little controversy.
And perhaps a bit of sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the nation that created taekwondo -- the ''way of
the hand and foot'' -- didn't completely dominate the medals, each
country except host Australia was limited to only four athletes in
the Sydney Games, where eight golds were contested.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the breadth of the competition was better than most
would have thought.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 nations, from Austria to Venezuela, entered. Taekwondo
even provided Vietnam with its first-ever Olympic medal -- a silver
for Tran Hieu Ngan in the women's 57-kilogram class.
</P>
<P>
   Even some traditional rivals were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watched two days of taekwondo, and I think it is in many
ways superior to karate,'' said Yushiro Yagi, head of Japan's
Olympic delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But despite large and very spirited crowds each day, the sport's
debut was marred by a few bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Like most sports involving judges, the point system posed a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bayou, an official with the Ivory Coast team, said he
was unhappy about the refereeing. He was so upset that he even wept
during a match involving Ivorian player N'Guessan Sebastien Konan.
</P>
<P>
   Konan lost to Mexico's Victor Manuel Estrada Garibay by a score
of 7-4 in a repechage match for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a little bit disappointed at the results, which were
unfair,'' Bayou said. ''I don't know why they did not count
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   In taekwondo, three judges sit around the square fighting area.
When they believe a competitor has scored a valid kick, they press
a red or blue button corresponding with the color of the athlete's
headgear. The athlete with the most points after three three-minute
rounds is the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the buttons are pressed virtually simultaneously, the
points won't resgister, however. And there is always room for
dispute over what constitutes a valid scoring kick.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the four-day competition, two unofficial
complaints were lodged over point disputes, both in bouts that went
in favor of Australians, prompting the World Taekwondo Federation
to issue a statement in its own defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WTF has placed a top priority on impartiality in order to
present this first-time medal sport in the best possible light,''
it said. The statement noted that judges found to make repeated
arbitrary calls can be suspended for up to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also were raised over whether judges were unnecesarily
hard on the Korean entrants, allegedly because the WTF believes it
would be better for the sport's future for Korea not to be too
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   But, with Korea doing quite well, those claims are hard to
support.
</P>
<P>
   With just one athlete still to compete, Korea had won two golds
and one silver, pretty much as it had expected coming into the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've no big complaint,'' said South Korean coach Kim Jong-ki.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said the one gold that got away -- when Sin Jun-sik lost to
America's Steve Lopez -- was lost in a close, but fair, bout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision could go either way,'' he said. ''Our player has
superior techniques, but could not use them because of his
opponent's height advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim admitted that the most important thing for Korea at these
games is keeping taekwondo's Olympic future alive, not taking home
all the golds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if there is any subtle effort by referees to
check and balance our supremacy in the sport,'' he said. ''But I
agree that spreading the golds among a variety of countries would
help promote taekwondo worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   French team coach Philippe Bouedo wrote off the complaints as
mostly just sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The refereeing so far has been very good and fair,'' he said.
''When you lose, you are upset. When you win, you are happy.''

<HEADLINE> Haiti Leader Faces Murder Charges  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- They came at dawn, forcing their
way into the shantytown homes, making some victims lie in open
sewers, beating up old people and children, shooting the ones who
tried to flee.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people died that day six years ago in the
brutal attack by soldiers and right-wing thugs designed to break
the spirit of supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who
had been deposed by a military coup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 58 people stood trial for the Raboteau Massacre in
what is being billed as a trial of Haiti's 1991-1994 military
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those accused have fled the country and were being tried
in absentia. Former coup leader Raoul Cedras lives in exile in
Panama. Former militia leader Emmanuel ''Toto'' Constant works as a
real estate agent in New York City's Queens borough.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trial is not only that of major human rights offenders.
It is the trial of the coup d'etat itself and of its atrocities,''
said Michelle Karshan, a spokesman for President Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution is going to show how the high command was
implicated in the Raboteau Massacre,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 police officers mounted tight security Friday at the
courthouse in Gonaives, the city where the killings took place on
April 22, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings started late but a 12-member jury was chosen
Friday afternoon. The trial is expected to last about six weeks.
Proceedings will resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accused still in Haiti are former Capt. Castera
Cenafils, 46, and 21 former soldiers and thugs from the right-wing
FRAPH -- the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti -- which
Constant led.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people died in the attack because soldiers
prevented the victims' families from retrieving bodies from the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Raboteau slayings were part of a series of attacks
undertaken to break support for Aristide, a charismatic slum priest
who became the Caribbean country's first democratically elected
leader in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and FRAPH killed at least 3,000 people and maimed
thousands more before President Clinton in 1994 sent 20,000 troops
to end the bloodshed and halt an exodus of boat people to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was restored and the army was abolished. Aristide was
succeeded by his hand-picked successor, Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Under both men, only a handful of soldiers and militiamen have
been tried for coup-related crimes and no more than two or three
have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than three years for Haiti's inefficient judicial
system to prepare the Raboteau case.

<HEADLINE> Texas ACLU Files Suit Over Drug Bust  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A lawsuit was filed against two law
enforcement agents and a district attorney for their role in an
arrest stemming from a much-criticized drug bust that prompted
allegations of racial discrimination in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three people were arrested in the bust in Tulia, in
northwest Texas. Forty were black, and the other three, two whites
and a Hispanic, are said to have ties to the black community.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 residents of the community of 5,000 rallied Friday at
the Capitol as Will Harrell, executive director of Texas American
Civil Liberties Union, announced the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on behalf of Yul Bryant, who was arrested in
July 1999 for allegedly selling cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   His case was dismissed when District Attorney Terry McEachern
found out that undercover agent Thomas Coleman was not certain he
had bought cocaine from Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in federal court, accuses McEachern, Coleman and
Sheriff Larry Stewart of falsely arresting, imprisoning and
prosecuting Bryant, who is black. Swisher County was also named in
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''These unlawful actions were part of a deliberate plan ... of
targeting members of the African-American community of Swisher
County, Texas and removing them from the area using the legal
system,'' the lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is seeking $2 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart would not comment on the suit. Coleman did not
immediately return telephone calls made by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   McEachern says he does not believe that he did anything wrong
and that he dismissed the case as soon as he found out Coleman was
not sure Bryant had sold him the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Of those arrested in the same bust as Bryant, 17 have pleaded
guilty and 11 have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   LaWanda Smith said she pleaded guilty to one count of delivering
a controlled substance because she was afraid of the sentence she
might receive if she went to trial. But she denies selling drugs to
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never met the guy,'' she said. ''Not ever.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Workers Lay Out Strike Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The union representing 47,000 Los Angeles
County employees vowed to start shutting down government offices
one by one beginning Monday after negotiations for a new contract
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, which would come amid a 2-week-old strike by bus
and rail operators that has shut down the nation's second-largest
public transit system, will begin with animal control facilities
and the county Registrar-Recorder's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are kind of starting slowly and we want to escalate,'' said
Annelle Grajeda, general manager of the Service Employees
International Union Local 660.
</P>
<P>
   The union's declaration Friday came as the transit strike was in
its 14th day, with talks having broken off earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, members of the union representing 43,000 Los
Angeles Unified School District teachers also voted to authorize a
strike if talks with the Board of Education are unsuccessful. The
union didn't set a date for a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   The SEIU said Monday's action would be the first of several
one-day ''rolling'' walkouts designed to get the union's point
across without crippling county services. Jails, libraries and the
district attorney's office would be targeted on Wednesday.
Hospitals would be hit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations for a new contract are still unresolved by Oct.
11, however, the union has said it would call a countywide strike.
The current contract expires at midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The union has rejected the county's offer of a 9 percent wage
hike over three years, saying it wants at least 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed that the union has chosen to leave the
bargaining table,'' said county Chief Administrative Officer David
Janssen.

<HEADLINE> Panama Struggles With Future  </HEADLINE>
By KATHIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama has struggled to overcome
drug, arms and money-laundering problems largely borne of its
location at the hemisphere's hub. Now, Panama's neighbors are
tossing it yet another dilemma to deal with -- their discarded
strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's position as a place of transit has always been its
greatest asset, but some recent arrivals are adding to the
country's already serious image problem, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent arrival, Peru's reviled former intelligence
chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, is seeking to join other undesirables
already in exile here. President Mireya Moscoso has yet to make a
decision on his asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we are not only seen as a country that launders money,
traffics drugs and weapons, but also one that serves as a
retirement paradise for political scum like Montesinos,'' said
Miguel Bernal, a former adviser to Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
   Some here see the asylum issue as a chance for Panama to help
solve its neighbor's problems. Panama has granted asylum in recent
years to at least three high-profile dictators or strongmen, and by
so doing defused some tense situations in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   There had been rumors a coup could occur in Peru were Montesinos
to be denied asylum here.
</P>
<P>
   Others see the Montesinos case as an opportunity to lift
Panama's image, battered by questions over whether the country
could clean up crime or run the canal the United States turned over
to Panama in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the right moment, when everyone's focused on Panama, to
defend the country against unjust accusations,'' said former
justice minister Renato Periera.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of crime and insecurity have rained down on Panama
in recent years. For example, U.S. conservatives opposed to the
canal handover said that leftist guerrillas in neighboring Colombia
have frequently crossed into Panama, and sometimes get their guns
here.
</P>
<P>
   And, when Montesinos jetted up from South America on Sunday, he
followed roughly the same route used by traffickers who ship
Colombian cocaine up through Panama to the United States. In a
sense, other people's problems have quickly become Panama's.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not taken into account the repercussions of
giving Montesinos asylum, said Teresa de Arias, vice president of
the country's legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a man like him here could endanger the country,'' de
Arias said. ''Given his past, he could be the target of all sorts
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians stress that they have done a good job running the
canal in the nine months since the United States left; that they
are serious about fighting drug trafficking, and don't want the
arms trade from Colombia's civil war to spill over into their
country.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the country needs, in these circumstances, is a
man like Montesinos who many consider a gangster.
</P>
<P>
   The country's banking sector -- a mainstay of the economy, born
out of the huge amount of shipping transactions and a lax
regulatory environment -- is laboring under the specter of being
placed on the ''black list'' of rogue money-laundering countries by
the international Financial Action Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos arrived here just as the country's congress is
debating stiffer laws against money laundering. ''It's just better
not to be on such a list,'' said Ricardo Alba, who is the
government's point man on the laws.
</P>
<P>
   And anti-asylum demonstrations have broken out here, protests
not seen since Panama gave asylum to the Shah of Iran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Panama has allowed in Haitian dictator Raul Cedras,
reviled former Ecuadorean President Abdala Bucaram, and former
Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano Elias, who attempted to seize
absolute power in his country in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Astrid Wolf, one of about 80 people who gathered in an
anti-asylum protest in Panama City on Tuesday, put it in simple
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to be somebody on the world stage, but with
people like this here, we won't get anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Horse Leads Equestrian Event  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET FREEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Olympic gold and silver medalists
from Atlanta in individual dressage changed places this time around
after a spirited competition.
</P>
<P>
   Anky van Grunsven of the Netherlands rode an energetic and
mistake-free Grand Prix freestyle for a record score to defeat 1996
Olympic champion Isabell Werth of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Van Grunsven, on Bonfire, earned 86.05 percent Saturday for a
combined score of 239.18 from the three days of competition. The
freestyle by Werth, aboard Gigolo, was not as fluid, and she earned
82.2 percent for a combined 234.19.
</P>
<P>
   Ulla Salzgeber of Germany won bronze on Rusty with a 80.67
percent freestyle and a combined score of 230.57.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isabell and I have been fighting each other for years,'' Van
Grunsven said. ''It has always been close. You get a horse like
Bonfire once in a lifetime. Today he was brilliant. No one could be
happier with a gold medal than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Werth said she was nervous and too cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to be too safe and made mistakes,'' she said. ''But I
feel I didn't lose the gold. I won the silver.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 15 riders from two previous Grand Prix tests rode a
musical freestyle Saturday, including two U.S. riders who were not
in medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Blinks of Wellington, Fla., earned 74.37 percent on Flim
Flam for a combined 214.65 to move up to eighth from 11th overall.
It was the sixth-highest score of the freestyle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a boy,'' Blinks said of Flim Flam. ''He was tired and he
really came through. I've been preparing him for the Olympics for
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Traurig of Carlsbad, Calif., scored 65.57 percent on
Etienne for a combined 208.21 to drop from 10th to 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a little bit out of gas today,'' said Traurig.
''Overall, I'm pretty happy with his efforts for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Werth led after the Grand Prix test during the team competition
Wednesday, but Van Grunsven pulled ahead in the Grand Prix Special
test on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Grunsven earned a standing ovation from the capacity crowd
of 20,000 for her freestyle with a ''Song Sung Blue'' theme.
Werth's music was ''Just a Gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the judge panel, Eric Lette of Sweden,
announced later that Bonfire's 86.05 percent was a record freestyle
score in a major competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen today dressage at its best,'' judge Volker Moritz
of Germany said.
</P>
<P>
   Salzgeber's performance also won a huge ovation. Her music broke
halfway through her test, and she completed it an hour later after
the other riders were done.
</P>
<P>
   Van Grunsven and Werth had announced that the Sydney Olympics
would be the last competition for their horses, both 17. They have
gone head to head for six years.

<HEADLINE> FBI Searches For 2 In Assault Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The FBI has joined the search for two suspects in
a scheme to sexually assault women after inviting them to a
lingerie party.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa M. Todd, 22, and James H. Gipson, 26, were seen in Las
Vegas on Wednesday, and investigators believe they may be on their
way to Phoenix, San Diego or Los Angeles, the agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has obtained federal warrants against the pair for
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Gipson are suspected in a scheme in which women were
approached in Denver-area malls by a young woman who claimed to be
an employee of the lingerie chain Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   The woman asked for the victims' phone numbers and addresses,
telling them she would contact them for a party where they could
try on and buy lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   When she picked the women up at their homes, she instead took
them to a remote location where they were sexually assaulted at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Police said more than 20 people were approached in the scheme
and three women in their late teens or early 20s were assaulted.

<HEADLINE> Three alleged mob associates arrested in art fraud scam  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Three mob associates were arrested Friday on
charges of trying to peddle ''cheesy'' fake artworks that they
claimed were created by Picasso, Chagall, Botero and Rubens,
federal prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants planned to sell the fakes
through an upscale Manhattan gallery for $32 million. Federal
agents, using wiretaps and an informant, killed the alleged scheme
and no paintings were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants are Dominick ''Little Dom''
Curra, 56, of Lawrence, N.Y.; Kevin McMahon, 35, of Howard Beach,
Queens; and Robert Walsh, 35, of Fort Lee, N.J. The defendants are
associates of reputed Gambino organized crime soldier Charles
Carneglia, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Curra and Walsh were arrested at their homes Friday morning.
McMahon was arrested in jail where he is already being held on
federal extortion charges, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Weissmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants were charged with wire fraud, which is
punishable by up to five years in prison. Curra and Walsh pleaded
not guilty when they were arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Cheryl Pollack released Curra in $750,000 bond. She
remanded Walsh and scheduled his bail hearing, and McMahon's
arraignment, for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said the phony art package included two pieces
purportedly by Picasso, one by Marc Chagall, one by Fernando
Botero, and one by Peter Paul Rubens. He said the fakes ''looked
really cheesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said the fake Rubens is in fact an authentic
12-inch-by-12-inch canvas from ''the school of Rubens,'' meaning it
was painted by a Rubens-era (1577-1640) artist in Rubens' style.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubens-style canvas, worth about $2,000, was stolen from a
private residence in Maryland about 30 years ago, the federal
complaint against the three men said.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants and the informant, who has pleaded guilty
in another case and is cooperating with prosecutors, planned to ask
$30 million for the ''Rubens'' and $500,000 for each of the other
four fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said he did not know where the defendants got the
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said Walsh told the informant in a March 31
telephone conversation that the Rubens was real, had been insured
by Lloyd's of London, and had been owned by a ''real gangster.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Many New York children in federal insurance program ineligible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Up to half of the roughly 538,000 New York
children enrolled in a federal health care plan are ineligible and
will be removed from the plan over the next several months, The New
York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some families began receiving notices several weeks ago that
their children would be removed from the Children's Health
Insurance Program as early as Sunday and that they must apply for
Medicaid, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance executives and advocates for the poor told The
Times that thousands of New York children were wrongly placed in
the program largely because participating insurance plans did not
steer families into Medicaid even when it was clear they belonged
there.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives said the state Health Department did not
instruct them to screen applicants for Medicaid eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Health knew exactly what we were doing,''
said Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which insures 96,000 state children
enrolled in the program. ''There is no secret about this. And there
is no question that it is going to create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, a spokesman for the state Health Department, said
the problems arose because time was needed to iron out the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously our top priority is to get children the health
insurance they need and deserve,'' Signor said. ''The federal
government is now forcing states to move children who are eligible
for Medicaid into that program.'' He estimated that about 22
percent of the children would have to be moved, but insurers and
others put the figure closer to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carl McCall warned the Health Department
several times over the last few years that it was enrolling too
many children who belonged in Medicaid, the newspaper said. The
department responded to a 1998 audit by assuring McCall's office
that it was requiring insurance carriers to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The program was intended to insure children from low-income
families whose incomes are too high for Medicaid but too low to
afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   New York, where the program is known as Child Health Plus, is

<HEADLINE> Carl Sigman, songsmith who made generations hum, dead at 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANHASSET, N.Y. (AP) - Carl Sigman, who wrote music or words for
dozens of songs, including the theme song to the 1950's ''Robin
Hood'' television series, died Tuesday at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sigman's best-known legacies is a phone number. In 1938
he wrote ''Pennsylvania 6-5000,'' in tribute to the Hotel
Pennsylvania, where the Dorsey Brothers, Benny Goodman and Artie
Shaw regularly performed. The Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the
song. The phone number, PE6-5000, still rings at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Sigman wrote the words to Duke Ellington's ''All Too Soon'' in
1940 and ''What Now My Love,'' for which he wrote English lyrics in
1966 for a French song written four years earlier. Herb Alpert and
the Tijuana Brass, Sonny and Cher and Mitch Ryder sang his version.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the words to ''Ebb Tide,'' a song originally
composed as an instrumental by the harpist Robert Maxwell; Vic
Damone, the Platters and the Righteous Brothers, among others,
recorded it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, his ''Enjoy Yourself'' was used in the 1997 Woody
Allen movie ''Everybody Says I Love You.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigman's son, Michael, noted that a Mercedes commercial shown
during the current Olympics used ''Enjoy Yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of New York University Law School, Sigman was
admitted to the bar, but never practiced. Instead, he was drawn to
music and became acquainted with Johnny Mercer, the lyricist,
vocalist and composer who became his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Sigman was drafted into the Army and served in Europe
in the crew of a glider. He was awarded a Bronze Star for heroism.
He also wrote what became the 82nd Airborne Division's official
song, ''The All American Soldier,'' receiving a $25 war bond for
the achievement.

<HEADLINE> Mother of two has short-lived career as a bank robber  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A would-be bank robber chose an odd getaway
vehicle - a slow-moving city bus.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Coletti, 41, allegedly collected $8,300 in cash from the
Banco Popular in Sheepshead Bay and made her escape on a bus on the
B-49 line. The bus was stopped by police about a block from the
bank, and Coletti, a mother of two college-age sons, was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The bungled robbery happened Friday at about 10:30 a.m., when
Coletti allegedly strode up to a teller's window, holding a blue
bag and pointing a black gun at the teller, police said.
</P>
<P>
   She demanded the money and, when the teller fumbled with the
drawer containing marked bills and exploding cash packets, she
ordered him to open a second drawer, police said. When the teller
then had trouble opening that drawer, she allegedly banged the gun
on the counter, attracting the attention of customers and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   After Coletti left the bank, an employee ran out and flagged
down a police van from the 61st Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The employee said, 'We've just been robbed, and the lady who
robbed us is on the city bus that just passed you,''' said Police
Officer Jeff Childs. The cops went after the bus.
</P>
<P>
   With a description of the robber, Childs boarded the bus about a
block away from the bank and checked out the passengers. The bus
was full, but Childs zeroed in on a woman sitting in the last row,
center seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't move, she didn't say a word,'' Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs approached her and ordered the woman to put her hands up.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered two pellet guns from the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Coletti allegedly told police she had taken the bus because she
didn't have money for a cab. The Brooklyn resident was taken into
custody by federal authorities and was remanded Friday night in
Brooklyn Federal Court.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Capture Key Area  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban rulers captured
a strategic northern area in Takhar province, pushing the besieged
opposition forces deeper into the country's northeast corner, an
opposition spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Namakaab on Friday sealed off the opposition's
supply route to the Farkhar district, the last area controlled by
the opposition in the province, Mohammed Abil, a senior opposition
spokesman, told The Associated Press from the besieged region.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are now barely 18 miles from Farkhar and appear to
be preparing for a final push to the area, Abil said. Farkhar lies
155 miles northeast of the capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic artillery fire was exchanged by the two sides early
Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate comment was available from the Taliban, who now
rule more than 95 percent of the country, including the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost Namakaab because some of our commanders switched their
loyalties and joined the Taliban ranks along with their men,'' Abil
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six opposition commanders and 200 fighters joined the Taliban,
the Taliban-controlled newspaper Shariat reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says that nearly 70,000 people have fled to
neighboring Badakshan province, held by the opposition, to escape
the fighting. The region is close to Afghanistan's frontier with
the Central Asian state of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who follow a harsh version of Islam, are Sunni
Muslims and mostly Pashtun, Afghanistan's majority ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, led by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
former Defense Minister Ahmed Shah Massood, is made up of ethnic
and religious minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In an unusual act of contrition,
right-wing militias in Colombia have apologized for dragging a
wounded guerrilla from a Red Cross vehicle last week and executing
her.
</P>
<P>
   The apology from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, an
umbrella group for the country's militias, was contained in a
letter faxed to the Red Cross in Bogota on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We accept our responsibility for this lamentable incident that
put at risk the good work of the International Red Cross in
Colombia,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross had no comment on the apology.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, the militia group conceded that on Sept. 22 three
of its fighters stopped a Red Cross vehicle outside Apartado, a
town near the Panamanian border.
</P>
<P>
   The men then grabbed the wounded guerrilla, whom the Red Cross
was taking to a hospital, and later killed her. She was a member of
the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the
Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Apologies are rare in Colombia's brutal, 36-year civil war,
which has left at least 35,000 people dead, most of them civilians.

<HEADLINE> Wrecked Roman Empire Ships Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLBIA, Sardinia (AP) -- The remains of 10 ships dating back to
the twilight of the Roman Empire have been found off northeastern
Sardinia near the port of Olbia.
</P>
<P>
   Marine archaeologist Rubens D'Oriano said Friday that the ships
were likely burned by the Vandals of northern Europe when they
plundered Olbia in the 5th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery ''is particularly important because it gives us
details on a specific historical event'' as well as ancient naval
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Oriano said another five ships from the 13th century were
found in the same area, D'Oriano said.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found during work on an underwater tunnel at
the port of Olbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman ships -- some up to 30 yards long -- are believed to be
merchant vessels. The hulls show signs of fire.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the wreckage has yielded human bones, oil lamps, coins,
a statue of the Egyptian god Osiris, a sapphire, an amphora and
fragments of a bronze statue.
</P>
<P>
   D'Oriano said divers are still exploring the wreckage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Honduran soldiers launched a search
Friday for a helicopter carrying the chief justice of the country's
Supreme Court and five others which disappeared in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell-206 helicopter took off from Islas de Bahia, 180 miles
north of the capital Tegucigalpa, earlier Friday and disappeared
from radar screens shortly after, aviation authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Keith is about 200 miles north of the coast, and
has drenched northern Honduras where the chopper disappeared with
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran air force officials said they would wait until Saturday
to launch an air search for the craft, but soldiers and police were
already searching on the ground for judge Oscar Avila Banegas and
the five others.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Banegas, a congressman, the pilot, two court employees
and Banegas' bodyguard were on board. Their names were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Rolando Leiva, director of Honduras' Civil Aviation agency,
said ''the craft went down due to the prevailing bad weather.''

<HEADLINE> No Injuries in Madrid Office Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A bomb blamed on a leftist group exploded
Saturday at an office of the ruling Popular Party in Madrid,
causing minor damage and no injuries, said police.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman in Madrid said a woman called police after
the explosion to say GRAPO, an elusive group with apparent
anarchist leanings, planted the bomb in the office in Madrid's
Hortaleza neighborhood. Nobody was in the building at the time of
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The homemade bomb, with 3.3 pounds of explosive material, was
left in the office doorway and a witness told police he saw two
young men running from the scene shortly before the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-dawn explosion was the fifth in three days blamed on
GRAPO.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two men and a woman planted a bomb in a trash bin in
the Barcelona office of El Mundo, one of Spain's leading
newspapers. The building was evacuated. When the device exploded,
it injured two police officers who had rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, three bombs exploded at temporary employment
agencies in three Spanish provincial capitals, causing considerable
damage but no injuries. GRAPO, which has targeted temporary job
offices in the past, claimed all three.
</P>
<P>
   GRAPO has killed some 60 people in sporadic bombings and
shootings since it emerged in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The group has never stated clearly its political aims although
it is believed to go after what it considers to be right-wing and
capitalist targets.
</P>
<P>
   Its name -- October First Anti-fascist Resistance Group -- comes
from October 1, 1975, the date of the group's first major attack in
which it killed four policemen in reprisal for the execution of two
suspected Basque separatists and three anarchists belonging to
FRAP, a predecessor group of GRAPO. The firing squad executions
were the last by the regime of the late dictator Gen. Francisco
Franco.

<HEADLINE> Official: US Hostage Visited Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- An American being held hostage by
Muslim rebels visited their camp twice before being abducted and
discussed procuring night vision goggles for them, the Philippine
national police chief said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., was taken captive by the
Abu Sayyaf rebels Aug. 28 after he visited their camp on southern
Jolo island in Sulu province. Schilling says rebel leaders abducted
him after they began suspecting he was a CIA agent, which he
denies.
</P>
<P>
   But national police chief Panfilo Lacson said Schilling also had
visited a rebel camp on the nearby province of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twice in the past two years Schilling visited the Abu Sayyaf
camp in Basilan (and met) with Abu Sayyaf leaders for the
procurement of night vision goggles,'' Lacson said in an interview
with ABS-CBN television.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because he went there without any difficulty, we are wondering
why he was kidnapped, because he went to Sulu and transacted
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel faction holding Schilling previously operated on
Basilan, but fled to Jolo to escape a military assault after they
kidnapped about 50 children and teachers from two schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, the military launched a massive attack on Jolo to
rescue 17 other hostages being held by the Abu Sayyaf, including
Schilling and three Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have raised questions about Schilling's
relationship with the rebels, although they say they continue to
believe he is being held against his will.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's wife, Ivi Osani, is the second cousin of the Abu
Sayyaf's spokesman and the widow of a rebel killed several years
ago by government troops.
</P>
<P>
   Osani, who went to the rebel camp with Schilling but was not
abducted, is being held by police.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, majored in Near East studies at the University of
California at Berkeley and converted to Islam in 1994. He is deeply
interested in the status of Muslim minorities in countries like the
Philippines, his family says.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf claims it is fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the impoverished southern Philippines. In the past six
months it has kidnapped scores of people. Most were released after
Libya and Malaysia paid more than $15 million in ransom,
negotiators say.
</P>
<P>
   Several Philippine news reports have accused Schilling of
discussing procurement of supplies such as camouflage uniforms,
combat boots and night vision goggles from the United States.
Schilling's mother, Carol, has denied he was an arms dealer.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, at least two rebels were killed and one soldier was
wounded after a gunbattle erupted between government troops and
about 100 rebels in a mountainous area in Patikul town, military
officials said.

   De La Hoya, 27, says he wants to retire from the ring in about

father's dream instead and became a fighter.

<HEADLINE> Gunfire Erupts in Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of rock-throwing Palestinian rioters
clashed with Israeli troops across the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
Jerusalem on Saturday, and gun battles raged in two areas in what
Palestinians said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
Jerusalem shrine.
</P>
<P>
   In a second day of bloody clashes, three Palestinians, including
a 14-year-old boy, were killed in the West Bank, while in Gaza a
protester was comatose with a bullet wound in the head, Palestinian
doctors said. About 325 Palestinians were injured, hospital
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle for Jerusalem has begun,'' said Bassem Naim, a
Palestinian activist.
</P>
<P>
   Huge plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose high above
Palestinian towns, and streets were littered with rocks and
overturned garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene in taxis. Helmeted Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pelles and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls. Gun battles
raged near the West Bank town of Nablus and close to the Jewish
settlement of Netzarim.
</P>
<P>
   South of Nablus, about a dozen masked Palestinians, crouching
behind walls and olive trees, exchanged fire with Israeli troops
for more than an hour. Two Palestinians, including a 14-year-old
boy, were killed in the clash, doctors said. In the West Bank town
of Ramallah, a 16-year-old protester was killed, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis must understand that Palestinians can also shoot
and kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an M-16 assault
rifle who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Near Netzarim, Palestinian police in uniform and plainclothes
exchanged fire with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the trigger for the violence was a visit
Thursday by Israel's hawkish opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, to
the disputed Jerusalem hilltop known to Jews as the Temple Mount
and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. Al Aqsa is
one of two major mosques in the walled compound.
</P>
<P>
   In clashes at the compound Friday, six Palestinians were killed
and close to 200 wounded. ''We're going to teach them not to touch
our holy place,'' said Khalil Natash, 21, a stone-thrower in the
West Bank town of Hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those killed. ''We will burn the ground underneath the Israelis to
stop them from touching our holy place.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appealed to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to restore calm. He said Israel has been showing
''maximum restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its citizens and restore order. The violence erupted as Israelis
marked the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath said Israeli security
forces committed ''premeditated murder'' at the Jerusalem shrine
Friday. The violence underscored Palestinian demands that Israel
must withdraw from east Jerusalem, the sector the Palestinians
claim as a future capital, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank, said he
expected confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the Israelis are behaving now in the Palestinian
territories and Israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis felt the Palestinians were responsible. ''Despite
the fact that there is a peace process, they (the Palestinians)
want to ruin everything,'' said Meirav Buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from the town of Netanya. ''There won't be peace. There will only
be war.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem,
Palestinians observed a general strike and day of mourning
Saturday. Shops were closed and children were sent home from
school. Israel barred its citizens from entering the
Palestinian-controlled areas to avoid further friction.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty claims to the shrine. Neither side wants the other to
have full control. All U.S. compromise proposals have been rejected
so far by the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting the shrine Thursday, Sharon, who staunchly opposes
concessions to the Palestinians, said he wanted to demonstrate that
Israel is in control there.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians accused the Israeli government of having
ignited a ''religious war'' because it did not stop Sharon from
visiting the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's hawkish mayor, Ehud Olmert, a member of Sharon's
Likud party, accused Palestinian security forces of orchestrating
the violence.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Milosevic Is Finished  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD MIDDLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
urged Russia on Saturday to accept that Slobodan Milosevic was
''finished'' as president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was reacting to news that Russian President Vladimir
Putin had offered to send Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to Belgrade
to talk to both sides in Yugoslavia's election standoff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russia hasn't taken sides in the dispute over who won
Yugoslavia's presidential vote on Sunday. Opposition candidate
Vojislav Kostunica says he beat President Slobodan Milosevic
outright, while Milosevic says a runoff is necessary to determine
the winner because Kostunica got less than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she planned to speak to Ivanov later in the day,
and would stress that Kostunica had won the election.

   ''I think the Russians need to make clear that they understand
that this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,''
Albright said at a news conference in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians need to understand that Milosevic lost in this
round. He is finished. It is time for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also said she had spoken to leading parties in the
Middle East peace process in an effort to ease tensions which
erupted in violence in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had telephoned both Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and Israel's prime minister Ehud Barak in a bid
to keep the peace process on course.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned about the violence. It is clearly
counterproductive in the peace process,'' Albright said. ''There is
danger of a cycle of violence developing. The talks are at a very
delicate stage and it is important that the violence stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright stopped briefly in Iceland, a NATO ally, on her way to
France and Germany, and met with Foreign Minister Halldor
Asgrimsson and Prime Minister David Oddsson.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between the two countries for the U.S. use of the
military base at Keflavik in southwest Iceland is due for renewal
in April. Iceland relies on NATO and the U.S. forces for its
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said any changes in U.S. commitments to Iceland were
unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Clashes Escalate  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of rock-throwing Palestinian rioters
clashed with Israeli troops across the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
Jerusalem on Saturday, and gun battles raged in two areas in what
Palestinians said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
Jerusalem shrine.
</P>
<P>
   In a second day of bloody clashes, three Palestinians, including
a 14-year-old boy, were killed in the West Bank, while in Gaza a
protester was comatose with a bullet wound in the head, Palestinian
doctors said. About 325 Palestinians were injured, hospital
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle for Jerusalem has begun,'' said Bassem Naim, a
Palestinian activist.
</P>
<P>
   Huge plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose high above
Palestinian towns, and streets were littered with rocks and
overturned garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene in taxis. Helmeted Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pelles and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls. Gun battles
raged near the West Bank town of Nablus and close to the Jewish
settlement of Netzarim.
</P>
<P>
   South of Nablus, about a dozen masked Palestinians, crouching
behind walls and olive trees, exchanged fire with Israeli troops
for more than an hour. Two Palestinians, including a 14-year-old
boy, were killed in the clash, doctors said. In the West Bank town
of Ramallah, a 16-year-old protester was killed, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis must understand that Palestinians can also shoot
and kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an M-16 assault
rifle who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Near Netzarim, Palestinian police in uniform and plainclothes
exchanged fire with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the trigger for the violence was a visit
Thursday by Israel's hawkish opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, to
the disputed Jerusalem hilltop known to Jews as the Temple Mount
and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. Al Aqsa is
one of two major mosques in the walled compound.
</P>
<P>
   In clashes at the compound Friday, six Palestinians were killed
and close to 200 wounded. ''We're going to teach them not to touch
our holy place,'' said Khalil Natash, 21, a stone-thrower in the
West Bank town of Hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those killed. ''We will burn the ground underneath the Israelis to
stop them from touching our holy place.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appealed to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to restore calm. He said Israel has been showing
''maximum restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its citizens and restore order. The violence erupted as Israelis
marked the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath said Israeli security
forces committed ''premeditated murder'' at the Jerusalem shrine
Friday. The violence underscored Palestinian demands that Israel
must withdraw from east Jerusalem, the sector the Palestinians
claim as a future capital, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank, said he
expected confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the Israelis are behaving now in the Palestinian
territories and Israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis felt the Palestinians were responsible. ''Despite
the fact that there is a peace process, they (the Palestinians)
want to ruin everything,'' said Meirav Buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from the town of Netanya. ''There won't be peace. There will only
be war.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem,
Palestinians observed a general strike and day of mourning
Saturday. Shops were closed and children were sent home from
school. Israel barred its citizens from entering the
Palestinian-controlled areas to avoid further friction.	   Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty claims to the shrine. Neither side wants the other to
have full control. All U.S. compromise proposals have been rejected
so far by the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting the shrine Thursday, Sharon, who staunchly opposes
concessions to the Palestinians, said he wanted to demonstrate that
Israel is in control there.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians accused the Israeli government of having
ignited a ''religious war'' because it did not stop Sharon from
visiting the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's hawkish mayor, Ehud Olmert, a member of Sharon's
Likud party, accused Palestinian security forces of orchestrating
the violence.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of Palestinian rock throwers and
several gunmen clashed with Israeli troops Saturday in what
Palestinians said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
Jerusalem shrine. Six Palestinians were killed and about 325
injured in the worst violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle for Jerusalem has begun,'' said Bassem Naim, a

</P>
<P>
   Palestinian gunmen and Israeli troops exchanged fire in two
locations, near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza and south
of the West Bank town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   At the Netzarim junction, a Palestinian fired shots at an
Israeli army outpost from behind a red truck. Soldiers returned
fire, and several Palestinians took cover on the ground, covering
their heads with their hands, their faces pressed on the asphalt.
One Palestinian man screamed in pain when he was shot in the knee.
Paramedics ran into the line of fire to drag him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Shifa Hospital in Gaza City reported three dead -- a 12-year-old
boy, a Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, three Palestinians were killed by Israeli
fire, including a 14-year-old boy shot in the abdomen during a gun
battle between a dozen masked gunmen and Israeli soldiers. The
gunmen crouched behind walls and olive trees as they took aim as
the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> NJ wines -- a well-kept secret  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAMONG, N.J. (AP) - The workers make their way down row after
row of leafy green vines, snipping off dangling clusters of smooth,
plump, deep blue grapes.
</P>
<P>
   It's harvest time in the vineyards, and this scene is being
repeated in some of the world's prime wine growing areas - the
Bordeaux region of France, along Germany's Rhine River, in
California's Napa Valley - and in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   From the rocky hills of Warren County to the sandy Cape May
County coastal plain, there are 16 wineries turning out everything
from merlots to chardonnays to cranberry, apple and blueberry
wines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Garden State's $10 million-a-year wine industry
might just be its best-kept agricultural secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an unknown quantity,'' said Bill Walker, marketing
specialist at the state Department of Agriculture. ''Ninety percent
of the state's citizens don't even know that there is a wine
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jerseyans are a thirsty bunch - the state ranks fifth in the
nation in per capita wine consumption. But only 1 percent of what's
consumed here is made in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 45 states that make wine, New Jersey is among the top 15
in output, producing about 1 million bottles of wine in 1999. But
Wine Spectator magazine, considered by some vinophiles to be the
Bible of wines, has never even reviewed a New Jersey wine.
</P>
<P>
   Not because they're not good, magazine spokesman Terrence Meck
is quick to point out, but because most of the wineries are too
small.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a national publication, we're required to review wines
that have a much larger, broader distribution,'' he said. ''New
Jersey is known for having a good wine industry, but it's too small
still.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. Ten to 15 new wineries are expected to
open in New Jersey in the next five to seven years, said Joseph
Fiola, a specialist in small fruit and viticulture for Rutgers
Cooperative Extension. And more people are planting vineyards to
sell grapes to wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Fiola, who helps the state's grape industry with research and
development, said he gets several inquiries a week from people
interested in getting started. Some are entrepreneurs looking for a
new venture; others are fruit farmers who want to diversify, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newcomers want to plant in the southern part of the
state, where the weather is perfect for the grapes that are in the
most demand, Fiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New Jersey's wineries are in the hilly northern part of
the state, which has cool weather and is good for growing such
grapes as Riesling and pinot noir. But the most popular grapes,
such as cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot and chardonnay,
require a long, warm growing season. Southern New Jersey, with
moderating winds from the Delaware River, Delaware Bay and Atlantic
Ocean, is much warmer than the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that'll make a big difference if we can get these
quality grapes growing in South Jersey,'' Fiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than view the newcomers as competition, the state's
winemakers say they welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some exciting areas to grow grapes and a lot of
advantages that people don't seem to be recognizing,'' said John
Altmaier, winemaker at Unionville Vineyards in Ringoes.
</P>
<P>
   Altmaier, who received the ''Winemaker of the Year'' award from
Vineyard and Winery Management magazine in 1998 and has worked in
vineyards in Germany and Australia, acknowledged that the state has
a ''reputation problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's a New Jersey thing, and those things are hard
to change,'' he said. ''But things are picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's wines don't suffer image troubles in Malaysia, Japan
or Cuba, though. Tomasello Winery in Hammonton exports its fruit
wines to those countries and is working on distributing in Iceland
and Europe, said marketing director Lydia Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fruit wines are made with 100 percent blueberries,
raspberries and cranberries and have been very popular with the
Asian community,'' she said. ''One reason is they're very healthy,
with very high antioxidants, and they have a unique flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasello, which produced 38,000 cases last year, is one of the
larger wineries in the state. Most are small, family-run operations
that don't have large marketing and distribution systems. They sell
most of their wine at their wineries and rely on word-of-mouth,
newsletters and wine festivals for publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Beatty, wine director at Canal's Discount Liquor Mart in
Marlton, said New Jersey wines ''can't compete with California or
French wines'' and are viewed as more of a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support the wineries because they are unique to New Jersey.
You'll never find blueberry wine anywhere else. I love them. I sell
them,'' he said, ''but how often do people drink blueberry wine?''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony B. Valenzano, who runs Valenzano Winery in Shamong with
his father and brother, said maybe people should stop comparing New
Jersey wineries to California's and should concentrate on what
grows well here.
</P>
<P>
   ''California has done a good job of convincing people that
cabernets, chardonnays and merlots are the only good grapes, but
there are other good grapes that make good wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who taste New Jersey wines for the first time generally
are impressed, said Altmaier.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a winemaker, I'm not going to try to convince you that
they're the greatest wines in the world. But there's not a flaw in
them. They're nicely made. Most people are surprised when they come
here. They never knew New Jersey had wines like this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton seeks to energize black voters  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton, trying to stitch
together a coalition that will carry her to the U.S. Senate, is
facing a stiffer test in making sure blacks go the polls since New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani left the race.
</P>
<P>
   Her success at getting out the black vote could determine the
outcome of what appears to be a very close race against her new
Republican rival, Rick Lazio, a congressman from Long Island who
has not generated the sort of animosity within the black community
the mayor did.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Giuliani in the race, there would have been an
avalanche'' of black votes for Clinton, said state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference is, we'll need a bigger effort to energize the
community, but it will be energized on the basis of the issues that
Hillary Clinton has been talking about and has been identified with
for a long time,'' McCall, a Democrat considering a run for
governor in 2002, predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some who are cautioning she must do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all knew why we didn't want Giuliani in the Senate. With
Giuliani out, you've got to give us a reason to put you in the
Senate,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent figure in New
York's black community, ''and I'm not sure that has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been heavily criticized for what critics say is a
lack of sympathy to the needs of New York City's large minority
population and being too supportive of a police force blacks have
viewed as overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, independent polls show that Lazio, by the
numbers, is no more a favorite with blacks than Giuliani. But that
appears more a function of Clinton's popularity than anything Lazio
has done. A Sept. 21 poll from Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion found Clinton supported by 91 percent of black
voters. A March poll from Marist, taken when Giuliani was still in
the race, had her support at 87 percent among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor left the race in mid-May after learning he had
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What the polls don't reflect is the political maxim that it is
easier to get people to vote against something than for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was little doubt the polarizing effect of Giuliani would
have put turnout of minorities off the charts,'' said Marist
pollster Lee Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   McCall noted that the Rev. Jesse Jackson made stops in Syracuse
and in New York City on Monday and Tuesday to help energize black
voters and that San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown had also come to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am spending a good deal of my time trying to do that,''
McCall added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing a lot of surrogate activity to get the drum beat
going,'' Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has also been visiting black churches - four in
Queens on Sept. 17 alone and two in Brooklyn the weekend before.
She planned to visit four of them Sunday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The visits to the churches seemed to pay off judging by the
comments of parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons ''were brought up the way we were brought up - to
treat everyone fairly,'' said Carol Wilkins, of Queens, who works
in a housing project. ''I hope she makes it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She'll really work hard for us,'' said Elsie Murray, of
Brooklyn, who works for an insurance company. ''She loves people,
she's sincere, she's not a phony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Henry Simmons of St. Albans Congregational Church in
Queens said Clinton's visit there showed ''there's an earnest
desire to hear from and to be with persons that are different and
whose votes and whose support she knows she really needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also stepped up visits to minority neighborhoods and
interviews with media outlets geared toward black and Hispanic
communities, de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to insure that there are a series of elements
that build up to the final turnout push,'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   She and President Clinton have courted black leaders from New
York with overnight stays at the White House. McCall and his wife,
former New York City Deputy Mayor Joyce Brown, stayed in the
Lincoln Bedroom. The Rev. Floyd Flake, a former congressman, and
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields have also slept
over.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides are counting on the natural draw of a presidential
election, plus phone banks and street volunteers to help offset any
falloff in black interest because of Giuliani's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   They are also counting on the popularity of the first lady, and
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''The motivational level is very high among people of color,
particularly among women of color,'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said there are plans to have President Clinton ''speak to
targeted groups in this state'' just before the election on his
wife's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see President Clinton in here with both
feet,'' Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute, predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that people in communities of color relate
to President Clinton and if he is in the state, actively supporting
Hillary, they will duly note that and it will duly add to their
enthusiasm for Hillary,'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   While de Blasio and others have pointed with pride to a
get-out-the-vote effort in 1998 in minority communities as being
instrumental in helping elect Democrats in New York, data shows
blacks still tend to register and vote at a lower rate than whites.
While about 17 percent of New York's voting age population is
black, exit polling found that just 9 percent of voters in 1998
were black.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that to energize black voters, Clinton must speak
out more forcefully on ''issues that resonate in our community,''
such as racial profiling, police brutality and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot be vague and nebulous and then expect a vote that
is specific,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City warehouse provides storage for pageant memorabilia  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - When it was their turn, the
swimsuit-clad contestants each stepped onto a giant wooden
turntable, standing still as it turned them around for the judges
to see.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1998 Miss America Pageant ended and the TV cameras went
off, the turntable couldn't remain on the stage at Convention Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It had to go, but no one dared throw it out. After all, when you
stage a live three-hour beauty pageant every year, you never know
what props can be recycled for a future TV production number.
</P>
<P>
   So the turntable was shipped across town, to be stored amid
former pageant stage sets, steel lighting trusses, souvenir
programs and dozens of other pieces of not-ready-for-prime-time
equipment, memorabilia and supplies belonging to the world's most
famous beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Miss America warehouse,'' says manager Bill Weeks,
its one and only employee. ''We have everything here, including the
kitchen sink. Two of them, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse, a nondescript two-story building made of blue
corrugated metal, is located on Kentucky Avenue, about four blocks
from Convention Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen by pageant contestants, TV viewers and news cameras, the
warehouse becomes a hubbub of activity in the week before the
contestants arrive here for the annual fall festivities and in the
days after the new winner is crowned.
</P>
<P>
   ''With different years, it's different things,'' said former
Hostess Committee chairwoman Mildred Brick, 85, who led a reporter
and photographer on a tour of the building recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''We save a lot of stuff because whoever's doing the scene
designing comes in here and sees what we have to start with. A lot
of things get used over and over again,'' Brick said.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty, unmarked and barely recognizable from their appearances
on stage, the old sets take up only a fraction of the space in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest is taken up by the plywood, mattresses,
mirrors, shoe racks and assorted furniture needed to build the
pageant's ''Anchor Station'' and a backstage area called ''Sleepy
Hollow,'' where exhausted tap dancers, pianists and baton twirlers
can catch a few winks during rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor station is a section of Convention Hall that is
converted into the headquarters of Miss America during the 12 days
between their arrival and the telecast itself.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants sleep in casino hotel rooms and practice on
stage, but every other activity is centered at the Anchor Station.
</P>
<P>
   There, they eat lunch, pose for photographs, sit for interviews
with the press and gather before events. This is where the kitchen
sinks come in: They are used for the food operation, which fixes
and serves 5,000 meals to contestants, volunteers and pageant
hostesses over the 12-day period.
</P>
<P>
   The plywood - which is stacked 15-feet high and 5-feet deep
against a wall in the warehouse - is used to build the anchor
station and an adjacent cluster of offices for pageant executives.
</P>
<P>
   The mattresses are kept in a climate-controlled room, to prevent
them from mildewing. The mirrors - 55 oak-framed, 12-by-18-inch
vanity mirrors - are covered in brown paper and stored just so, to
avoid breakage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We care for the girls from the minute they get here until the
minute they leave. It's like setting up a whole home for them,
while they're in Atlantic City,'' Brick said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is stored in the warehouse is strictly archives. In
one room, shelves are stacked with old copies of the Miss America
program book, a thick, glossy magazine-style publication listing
each year's contestants, schedule of events and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in brown paper, labeled by winner - ''Tawny Godin,
1976'' - because each year's winner appears on the front cover of
the following year's program. Each package contains 100 copies of
that year's program.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the dozen cardboard boxes packed with sheet
music, most of it written by composer Bernie Wayne, the man who
penned ''There She Is,'' the song used to serenade the winner as
she takes her runway walk.
</P>
<P>
   Like any storage area, the Miss America warehouse is a
hodgepodge of old and new: Walking through it, you see steel
lighting trusses, 20-foot wooden pillars, stapled wooden risers,
gold faux organ pipes, shoe racks and stacks of old correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ''For one or two days, we're here preparing and shipping stuff
and then we're back here again after the pageant, because the stuff
has to be out of Convention Hall,'' said Brick.

<HEADLINE> Thriller Depicts N.Korean Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Wolves, monsters, baby-snatchers.
Throughout the Cold War, the South Korean government peddled
propaganda about the denizens of its once-bitter foe, communist
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with reconciliation blooming on the Korean peninsula,
Southerners are hungry to know what their old and mysterious enemy
is really like.
</P>
<P>
   They're getting a warmer view at the cinema this month, where a
new thriller depicts North Korean soldiers as funny and vulnerable,
rather than stereotypically cruel and inhuman.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened Sept. 9, ''Joint Security Area'' has drawn more
than 2 million viewers in a country of 47 million people and is
poised to become South Korea's biggest movie hit.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the tale about a murder investigation that
threatens to topple the uneasy peace on the Korean peninsula refers
to the neutral border area in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ. U.S.
soldiers operate in the area, a negotiation site that has been the
scene of confrontation and violence between the two sides on a few
rare occasions.
</P>
<P>
   DMZ jitters might wind down a notch soon. At their first-ever
talks this week, the defense ministers of both Koreas said their
soldiers would cooperate in plans to reconnect a cross-border
railway.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the lively portrayal of an illicit friendship
between four South and North Korean border guards matches the
curiosity and yearnings of South Koreans after five decades of
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie showed that ordinary citizens of North and South
Korea could mix together without any problem if it weren't for the
politics and ideology that separates them,'' said Kim Yu-kyong, a
26-year-old employee of an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Tears have been shed in a few theaters showing ''Joint Security
Area,'' though far fewer than during a far more evocative, and
real-life, event that helped humanize North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   In August, South Koreans wept as they watched televised images
of a round of anguished reunions of separated family members from
both Koreas who had not been able to meet in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions were the outcome of an unprecedented summit two
months earlier between leaders of the Koreas at which they agreed
to work toward reunification, a goal expected to take years and
even decades.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement has fueled South Koreans' eagerness to learn
more about their neighbors. Books about the North are selling well,
television stations show more programs about the North, and North
Korea studies are attracting more university students.
</P>
<P>
   Production on ''Joint Security Area'' began at a time when the
South's attitude toward the North was softening under the aegis of
President Kim Dae-jung and his policy of engaging Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North is viewed as the enemy,'' director Park Chan-wook
said. ''I want to question whether that's really the right
perspective on things.''
</P>
<P>
   In their roles as soldiers of opposing armies, his actors share
cigarettes, arm wrestle, tell jokes and chat about girlfriends and
favorite snacks. Yet the shadow of the conflict that divided their
peninsula at the end of World War II is never distant, and violence
ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Park's movie departs from the dogmatic tradition of South Korean
movies in the 1960s and 1970s, when military-backed governments
urged their citizens to trumpet the virtues of their system over
that of the North.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's homegrown hit, the spy thriller ''Swiri'', injected
humanity into inter-Korean intrigue. The plot: a South Korean
intelligence agent falls in love with a North Korean terrorist but
ends up shooting her to death after discovering her true identity.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has been democratic for a decade, and filmmakers and
other artists don't have to worry as much about violating
anti-communist censorship laws that are no longer rigorously
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The penurious film industry in totalitarian North Korea clings
to its formulas.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last week, the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA,
listed movies such as ''Star of Korea'' and ''The Sun of the
Nation'' that glorify the achievements of Kim Il Sung, the late
revered leader and national founder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those films, widely known as revolutionary ones, give the high
honor and pride of the nation to the Korean people who are
exceptionally strong in the spirit of worshipping the leader,''
KCNA said.

<HEADLINE> State begins accepting applications for expanded drug program  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The enrollment period has arrived for a new
expansion of New York's prescription drug program for senior
citizens which advocates hope will ultimately double the number of
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Income eligibility levels will grow and copays and enrollment
fees will drop for qualified participants starting Jan. 1, 2001.
The state will start to accept applications as of Monday, Oct. 2,
under the bill approved by the state Legislature and Gov. George
Pataki earlier this year expanding the ''EPIC'' drug program.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 124,000 New Yorkers age 65 and older are in
EPIC, according to the state Health Department. Advocates say that
number should double by 2003 under the more liberal qualifying
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department estimates that so far, seniors have filled
more than 35 million prescriptions at lower EPIC costs and saved
more than $825 million.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the program is expected to cost the state about
$180 million a year by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department distributed about 10,000 newsletters to
agencies serving the elderly since this summer summarizing the
changes in the EPIC program. All the seniors already enrolled in
EPIC were also notified of the impending changes, as were the 9,300
seniors who were denied benefits or who canceled their
participation in the program in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department also began running newspaper
advertisements about EPIC's expansion last week and plans to make
brochures available to every pharmacy in the state starting this
week. There are also television ads about the EPIC expansion in the
works to start airing in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Information is also available over the EPIC toll-free
information line, 1-800-332-3742, and the Health Department's Web
site at www.health.state.ny.us.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this will be an effective approach to not only get
the word out but to increase enrollment in the program,'' said Rob
Kenny, a spokesman for the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The New York AARP is also funding radio ads across the state
about the EPIC changes as well as distributing information to
seniors through its local chapters.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP's legislative representative in Albany, Bill Ferris,
said his group hopes the promotional campaign will enroll the newly
eligible as well as the currently eligible seniors who have never
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not near the number of people who are eligible,'' he
said. ''So if the outreach is effective, we are hoping to see
substantial numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many New Yorkers have not enrolled in EPIC who
can. But Ferris noted that of the 2.4 million New Yorkers age 65 or
older, 12 percent or about 300,000 have incomes below the federal
poverty level. They would all qualify under the current rules.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are fed up with high prescription drug prices and should
take advantage of the state's program if they can, said New York
AARP manager of advocacy Fred Griesback.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we are talking to our members, they are absolutely
appalled by what they are paying for drugs,'' he said. ''It is
desperation that people feel. It's like pouring money down the
sink.''

<HEADLINE> Gov. Raps Clinton-Gore Energy Policy  </HEADLINE>
By RANDY COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood
criticized the Clinton-Gore administration Saturday for failing to
develop a national energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration needs to promote energy production from U.S.
sources but instead ''treats American energy producers as the
enemy,'' Underwood said in the Republican Party's weekly national
radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's remarks followed George W. Bush's criticism of the
Clinton administration for putting ''our economy and the way of
life it supports'' at risk by failing to develop a comprehensive
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush introduced a 10-year, $7.1 billion program to increase the
nation's fuel sources.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood criticized President Clinton's recent decision to tap
the nation's oil reserves because of high international prices.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was ''an ill-advised, election-year ploy to deplete
energy reserves set aside for times of real crisis,'' Underwood
said. ''We would not be in this position if the Clinton-Gore team
had done anything in the past eight years to work with energy
producers in the United States instead of working against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, who is involved in a tight re-election campaign
against U.S. Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., is a harsh critic of Vice
President Al Gore's push for an international global warming
treaty, which calls for emissions cutbacks that would severely
tighten regulatory control of coal-fired power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president's stated goals would devastate coal mining
in my state and several states in Appalachia and the mountains of
the West,'' Underwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coal fired-power plants generate a majority of the nation's
electric power, yet the Gore approach would replace them -- I guess
with windmills.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore Schools Close After Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore authorities on Saturday ordered all
kindergartens, child-care centers and nursery schools to close
temporarily after three children died, possibly from a viral
infection.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-month-old girl and her 2-year-old brother died Saturday,
and authorities suspect the cause was hand, foot and mouth disease,
a government statement said. A 2-year-boy also is believed to have
died from the illness earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement advised parents to ''keep their children
away from crowded places,'' and to consult a doctor if their
children showed such symptoms as fever, sore throat and sometimes
blistering rashes on the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   The closures will be in effect for at least seven to 10 days,
pending a review by officials, Singapore Environment Ministry
spokeswoman Michelle Tan said.
</P>
<P>
   They will affect more than 37,500 children in 557 child care
centers and some 103,000 children in more than 400 kindergartens,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tan said that 363 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease have
been reported in the wealthy Southeast Asian city-state of 3.2
million people since mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is not usually life-threatening but can sometimes
involve potentially fatal complications such as meningitis,
encephalitis and inflammation of the heart muscles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 children died in Taiwan during an outbreak of hand,
foot and mouth disease in 1998. Thirty died of the illness in the
Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo island in 1997.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Legislation to enable patients to sue their
health insurance carriers for malpractice and another bill
appropriating $150 million for transportation projects top the
state Senate's voting session agenda for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The right-to-sue bill would allow patients to take their HMOs to
court for negligence if they can show the denial or delay of care
adversely affected their health.
</P>
<P>
   ''HMOs must be held accountable for the quality health care that
New Jerseyans need and deserve, said Jerry Flanagan, health care
advocate for New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, which has
backed the bill. Opponents warn it will invite a flood of frivolous
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 million for transportation projects represents the
second decrease from a $500 million transportation bond issue
approved by the voters in 1999. Half the bond issue was dedicated
to counties and municipalities for bridge repair and replacement.
The other half goes to a variety of state transportation projects,
including roads, bridges and bikeways.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill to be considered Monday, $25 million would go to
counties and municipalities for bridge repairs and replacements and
$125 million would go to state transportation projects. In the
previous decrease earlier this year, counties and municipalities
got $125 million while $80 million went to state projects.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill on the Senate list would appropriate $3.25 million
to Cranford to help finance the first phase of a four-phase plan of
flood control projects. Cranford was hit by severe flooding from
the Rahway River during Hurricane Floyd last year, suffering $15
million in damage. It also experienced flooding in 1992, 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer ambulance squads and fire companies might get some
protection from overregulation under a bill that would require an
impact statement for any proposed regulation affecting them. The
intent is to keep from driving volunteer first aid squads and fire
companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction on compulsive gambling would be included as part of
the required curriculum in health and physical education under
another Senate bill scheduled for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill is aimed at ensuring that agreements made and
contracts signed in cyberspace hold the same legal weight as paper
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to considering 29 bills, the Senate will hear from
former New York Democratic Rep. Shirley A. Chisholm. Chisholm, the
first holder of the Wynona M. Lipman chair in women's political
leadership at the Eagleton Institute of Rutgers University, will
address the Senate session when it opens at 2 p.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly meets Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Restored fire towers offer great views and a glimpse of history  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ESCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTER, N.Y. (AP) - From the top of Hunter Mountain, there's a
panoramic view of the Black Head range to the north, the Indian
Head wilderness to the east, and the Spruceton Valley to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Such grand, 360-degree vistas are rare in the Catskill
Mountains, where trees block at least part of the view from most of
the rounded summits. But on Hunter, a fire tower rising above the
balsams lets hikers expand their horizons - if they're brave enough
to climb 80 steep steps to a wind-buffeted, precarious perch.
</P>
<P>
   The steel structure, gleaming in the sun with a fresh coat of
silver paint, is one of four towers recently restored to safe
climbing condition in the Catskills. Restoration work is almost
finished on a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Adirondacks, three renovated towers are open to the
public and work is under way to repair several others.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the towers is a labor of love for a diverse group of
people, most of them volunteers. They include hikers, history
buffs, conservationists, tourism boosters, local governments, and
nonprofit groups seeking to preserve the heritage of the mountain
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The network of fire spotters had a lot to do with protecting
the Forest Preserve,'' said Steven Engelhart, executive director of
Adirondack Architectural Heritage. ''It's an interesting chapter in
Adirondack history.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a romantic appeal to fire towers,'' Engelhart said.
''People are drawn to them, much as they are drawn to
lighthouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The state forest commissioner proposed the construction of fire
towers throughout the Catskills and Adirondacks in 1909. A wooden
tower on Hunter Mountain, later replaced by a steel structure, was
the first of 13 towers built that year.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era when sparks from coal-fired trains ignited the
dead timber left by clear-cutting loggers, causing catastrophic
forest fires. Using hand-cranked telephones, spotters were able to
relay an early warning before the fires raged out of control.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of aerial observation, the reforestation of
logged-over land, and better fire prevention and control, the
towers eventually became obsolete. State officials started phasing
them out in the 1980s. The last fire observer retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the towers were dismantled. Others, in rickety
condition, were closed to the public for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Five steel towers remain in the 300,000-acre Catskill Park. In
1997, a group of volunteers formed the Catskill Fire Tower
Restoration Project to raise money and recruit workers to repair
the towers and open them to hikers.
</P>
<P>
   The project is cosponsored by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation and the Catskill Center for Conservation
and Development. Local committees coordinate work parties and raise
money through community events such as quilt raffles and square
dances, as well as the sale of patches, T-shirts and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cabins where fire observers lived near the base of
towers are also being restored, with plans to open them as living
museums.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hadley tower, near the southeastern edge of the
Adirondack Park, and Blue Mountain, in the center of the
Adirondacks, summit stewards sometimes work on weekends to share
fire tower lore and help visitors identify the peaks and lakes in
the distance. There has also been a summit steward at the Mount
Arab tower in the northern Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets with historical and natural history information are
available at the trailheads to Hadley, Blue, Goodnow, and
Poke-O-Moonshine mountains in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these preservation efforts aspire to have an interpreter
in the tower during the summer at least,'' Engelhart said.
''Besides coordinating firefighting activities, the fire observers
were early conservation educators. They told hikers about plants,
wildlife, what they were seeing in the landscape. Interpreters can
serve this role again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hill fire tower is the only one in the Catskills with a
formal interpretive program, with volunteers staffing the tower and
restored observer's cabin every weekend through October, said Helen
Budrock of the Catskill Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually we hope to have interpreters at all the towers,''
Budrock said. The Catskill Center also is working on a Web page
about the towers, which will be accessible through the center's Web
site (www.catskillcenter.org).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Hunter Mountain tower, restored Catskill fire
towers are also open to the public on Balsam Lake Mountain in
Hardenburgh, Red Hill in Denning, and Overlook Mountain in
Woodstock. The Tremper Mountain tower in Phoenicia is expected to
be open by early November.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking to the towers isn't terribly strenuous, since most of
them have old Jeep trails that were once used by fire observers but
now are closed to motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the Hunter tower, you can take a scenic chairlift ride
from the Hunter Mountain ski center and then hike up two miles of
rocky trail and old road. There are also several other trails up
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A new guide book called ''Views From on High: Fire Tower Trails
of the Adirondacks and Catskills'' is being published by the
Adirondack Mountain Club this fall.

<HEADLINE> Facts about the impending expansion of the EPIC drug program  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Changes in store for the EPIC prescription drug
program for
seniors in New York:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -Higher benefits and lower payments go into effect on Jan. 1,
2001. The sign-up period for the expanded program begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   -People age 65 and older are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   -Under the new rules, individuals making $35,000 a year (up from
the current $18,500 a year) or married couples making $50,000 a
year (up from the current $24,400 a year) will become eligible.
</P>
<P>
   -Seniors in the expanded income brackets can join a new
deductible plan under which they can buy prescription drugs for
copays after spending about 3 percent of their incomes on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   -The copay schedule will change. Current copays are $3 for
prescription drugs costing up to $8; $5 for drugs costing $8.01 to
$13; $7 for drugs costing $13.01 to $23; $10 for drugs costing
$23.01 to $33, and $23 for drugs costing more than $33.

levels - up to $20,000 for individuals and up to $26,000 for
married couples. The fees range from $2 to $75 per quarter.
</P>
<P>
   -The current rule against caps or limits on benefits will
continue under the expanded program. So will the rule under which
seniors do not have to continue paying copays if they reach a
certain limit in a year, based on a seniors' income.
</P>
<P>
   -All prescription medicines are covered under the program, as
well as insulin and syringes. Over-the-counter medications are not.

<HEADLINE> India's PM Expands Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
added six members to his Cabinet including one of India's most
popular female politicians -- just before two other ministers
resigned to protest a hike in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Mamata Banerjee, the federal minister for railways, announced
her resignation in the eastern city of Calcutta along with her
Trinamul Congress party colleague Ajit Kumar Panja, the junior
foreign affairs minister, United News of India reported.
</P>
<P>
   Banerjee did not withdraw support from the government -- her
party is a partner in Vajpayee's ruling coalition -- and the
decision not does immediately threaten the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Banerjee was protesting the government's decision Friday to
increase prices of subsidized diesel, gasoline, kerosene and other
oil products to make up for lost revenue from the recent rise in
global oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   If the two resignations are accepted by ceremonial President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan, the Cabinet would have 73 members.
Narayanan would act on the prime minister's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Banerjee announced her decision, Narayanan
administered the oath of office in New Delhi to Sushma Swaraj, a
former federal minister, M. Venkaiah Naidu, a former spokesman of
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, and four other first-time
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Their responsibilities were not immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   Swaraj, 48, has for years been one of India's most well-known
female politicians, and has often been assigned tough tasks by her
party, the Bharatiya Janata party, in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, she was asked to become the chief minister, or top
elected official, of the Delhi state government weeks before
elections to help the fortunes of the unpopular government. Months
later, she was chosen to run against Sonia Gandhi, leader of the
main opposition Congress party, in a tough election battle that
Swaraj lost.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the gasoline prices were increased by six cents per
liter. That raises the cost of the fuel used for most cars,
scooters and three-wheel vehicles 65 cents per liter.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel and kerosene, which is used for cooking, were also hiked
six cents per liter, while low-pressure gas, used for cooking and
heating, was raised by 87 cents per liter.

<HEADLINE> 8 Palestinians Killed in Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of Palestinian rock throwers and
several gunmen clashed with Israeli troops Saturday in what
Palestinians said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
Jerusalem shrine. Nine Palestinians, including two teen-agers, were
killed and 325 demonstrators injured.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day of deadly clashes in what has become the
worst violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in four years. On
Friday, six Palestinians were killed and close to 200 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle for Jerusalem has begun,'' said Bassem Naim, a
Palestinian activist.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian gunmen and Israeli troops exchanged fire in two
areas, near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza and south of
the West Bank town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   At the Netzarim junction, a Palestinian fired shots at an
Israeli army outpost from behind a red truck. Soldiers returned
fire, and several Palestinians took cover on the ground, covering
their heads with their hands, their faces pressed on the asphalt.
One Palestinian man screamed in pain when he was shot in the knee.
Paramedics ran into the line of fire to drag him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Shifa Hospital in Gaza City reported three dead -- a 12-year-old
boy, a Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver. A fourth
Palestinian, from the town of Khan Yunis, was comatose with a
bullet wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, six Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire,
including five who died in a gun battle between a dozen masked
gunmen and Israeli troops near Nablus. The gunmen crouched behind
walls and olive trees as they aimed at the Israelis who took cover
behind jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis must understand that Palestinians can also shoot
and kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an M-16 assault
rifle who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials initially said one of those killed in Nablus
was a 14-year-old boy. However, the victim's parents gave his age
as 16.
</P>
<P>
   Violence erupted across the West Bank, Gaza and Arab
neighborhoods of Jerusalem. Huge plumes of black smoke from burning
tires rose high above Palestinian towns, and streets were littered
with rocks and overturned garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene in taxis. Helmeted Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the trigger for the violence was a visit
Thursday by Israel's hawkish opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, to
the disputed Jerusalem hilltop known to Jews as the Temple Mount
and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In clashes at the compound Friday, six Palestinians were killed
and close to 200 wounded. ''We're going to teach them not to touch
our holy place,'' said Khalil Natash, 21, a stone-thrower in the
West Bank town of Hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those killed. ''We will burn the ground underneath the Israelis to
stop them from touching our holy place.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appealed to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to restore calm. He said Israel has been showing
''maximum restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its citizens and restore order. The violence erupted as Israelis
marked the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's senior policy adviser, Danny Yatom, said he believed
there was still a possibility to resume peace negotiations once the
violence has died down. ''I really hope the peace process won't be
hurt, but I can't be sure,'' Yatom said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty claims to the Jerusalem shrine. Neither side wants the
other to have full control. All U.S. compromise proposals have been
rejected so far by the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath said Israeli security
forces committed ''premeditated murder'' at the Jerusalem shrine
Friday. The violence underscored Palestinian demands that Israel
must withdraw from east Jerusalem, the sector the Palestinians
claim as a future capital, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank, said he
expected confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the Israelis are behaving now in the Palestinian
territories and Israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis felt the Palestinians were responsible. ''Despite
the fact that there is a peace process, they (the Palestinians)
want to ruin everything,'' said Meirav Buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from the town of Netanya. ''There won't be peace. There will only
be war.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem,
Palestinians observed a general strike and day of mourning
Saturday. Shops were closed and children were sent home from
school. Israel barred its citizens from entering the
Palestinian-controlled areas to avoid further friction.

<HEADLINE> Franks, Corzine differ on federal government's role in public education </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In some ways, U.S. Senate candidates Jon
Corzine and Bob Franks agree on what and how children should be
taught.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Corzine and Republican Franks part company, however,
over the federal government's role in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Both Corzine, the millionaire Wall Street retiree, and Franks,
the Union County congressman, support ''character'' education to
promote values in children and after-school programs to provide
them with a safe haven, for example.
</P>
<P>
   After that, differences emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has also made college scholarships a key feature of a
campaign platform driven by television advertising, although he
recently tempered his promises somewhat with caveats to control
runaway costs. Some took it as a signal he may shift away from the
universal promises offered during the primary to a more measured
set of proposals for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public schools, both candidates have laid out a
variety of proposals on what polls suggests is a hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
   Franks believes the federal government ought to hand over more
control to local school districts and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Corzine proposes that the federal government
increase its involvement by targeting increased funding to solve
specific flaws in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine ''is not only committed to ensuring that the federal
government plays a bigger role, but will target the funds to the
public education system's biggest needs,'' said campaign
spokeswoman Ivette Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the federal government contributed 3.7 percent of
education costs in the 1998-99 school year, the last year for which
statistics are available, according to the New Jersey School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among Corzine's various calls for more federal investment is a
$50 billion program over 10 years to ensure that preschool programs
are accredited, meet health and safety standards, and supply
well-trained and compensated staff.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Corzine wants to see federal education aid increase to
enable local districts to hire and train more certified teachers,
reduce class sizes, enhance school safety and stem substance abuse,
Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat supports interest-free school construction bonds
with tax credits to help state and local governments modernize,
repair and build public schools, Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Corzine, Franks wants to decentralize the federal
government's hold on public education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Franks believes parents, teachers and administrators know
what's best for our children. They should be the ones empowered to
make decisions regarding our children's education, not a Washington
bureaucracy,'' said campaign spokesman Peter DeMarco.
</P>
<P>
   Franks supports federal block grants to give local officials the
flexibility to meet local needs. In return, the districts would
have to meet higher education accountability standards, DeMarco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' decentralized approach irks the Corzine campaign, which
says there aren't enough accountability strings attached to Franks'
favored form of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also takes Franks to task for voting in 1995 to
dismantle the federal Department of Education, but Franks' campaign
said the resolution was merely advisory and never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they cited was not binding language,'' said DeMarco. ''It
only called on appropriators to consider eliminating the Department
of Education.'' DeMarco noted the provision was a small part of a
300-page report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the report was not to reduce the financial
commitment to education, but to have more federal money find its
way to classrooms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he will press to triple federal funding for
educating the disabled and handicapped, and he has proposed a $1
billion loan program to help charter schools pay for new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Franks also voted for a bill that would allow states to
distribute federal funds to parents who need help paying private
school tuition. Corzine opposes vouchers for private school costs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton tries to energize black voters in absence of anti-Giuliani base </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton, trying to stitch
together a coalition that will carry her to the U.S. Senate, faces
a stiffer test in making sure blacks go the polls since New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani left the race.
</P>
<P>
   Her success at mobilizing the black vote could determine the
outcome of a close race against her new Republican rival, Rick
Lazio, a congressman from Long Island who has not generated the
sort of animosity among blacks that the mayor did.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Giuliani in the race, there would have been an
avalanche'' of black votes for Clinton, said state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference is, we'll need a bigger effort to energize the
community, but it will be energized on the basis of the issues that
Hillary Clinton has been talking about,'' said McCall, a Democrat
considering a run for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some black leaders insist she must do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all knew why we didn't want Giuliani in the Senate,'' said
the Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent New York City activist. ''With
Giuliani out, you've got to give us a reason to put you in the
Senate, and I'm not sure that has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's critics say the mayor lacks sympathy toward New York
City's large minority population and has been too supportive of a
police force that many blacks view as overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But polls show that Lazio is doing no better among blacks than
Giuliani. A Sept. 21 poll from Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion found Clinton supported by 91 percent of black
voters. A Marist poll in March, when Giuliani was in the race, had
her support at 87 percent among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor left the race in mid-May after learning he had
prostate cancer. What the polls don't reflect is whether his
withdrawal might reduce black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was little doubt the polarizing effect of Giuliani would
have put turnout of minorities off the charts,'' said Marist
pollster Lee Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   To energize black voters, the Clinton campaign has organized
visits by Rev. Jesse Jackson and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.
The first lady has been visiting black churches - and winning
praise from parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons ''were brought up the way we were brought up - to
treat everyone fairly,'' said Carol Wilkins of Queens, who works in
a housing project. ''I hope she makes it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She'll really work hard for us,'' said Elsie Murray of
Brooklyn, who works for an insurance company. ''She loves people,
she's sincere, she's not a phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stepped up interviews with media outlets geared
toward black and Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   She and President Clinton also have courted black leaders from
New York with overnight stays at the White House. McCall and his
wife, former New York City Deputy Mayor Joyce Brown, stayed in the
Lincoln Bedroom. The Rev. Floyd Flake, a former congressman, and
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields also slept over.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides are counting on the natural draw of a presidential
election, plus phone banks and street volunteers, to help offset
any falloff in black interest because of Giuliani's withdrawal.

   McCall said there are plans to have President Clinton speak to
''targeted groups'' in the state just before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that people in communities of color relate
to President Clinton and if he is in the state, actively supporting
Hillary, they will duly note that and it will duly add to their
enthusiasm for Hillary,'' said Clinton campaign manager Bill de
Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   De Blasio says a get-out-the-vote effort in minority communities
in 1998 was instrumental in helping elect Democrats in New York.
But data shows blacks tend to register and vote at a lower rate
than whites. While about 17 percent of New York's voting age
population is black, exit polling found that just 9 percent of
voters in 1998 were black.
</P>
<P>
   To energize black voters, Sharpton said, Clinton must speak out
more forcefully on ''issues that resonate in our community,'' such
as racial profiling, police brutality and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot be vague and nebulous and then expect a vote that
is specific,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US, EU To Delay Trade Tax Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and the European Union
reached agreement Saturday to delay imposition of a possible $4
billion in economic sanctions against the United States in a trade
dispute involving tax breaks for American exports.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced by the Clinton administration, which had
been negotiating against a midnight Saturday deadline for
overhauling U.S. tax laws to come into compliance with the adverse
ruling from the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedural agreement, Congress will have until Nov. 1
to pass the legislation. The EU agreed not to impose any penalties
until a separate WTO panel can rule on whether the new legislation
complies with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States and European Union today demonstrated a
commitment to avoid escalating trans-Atlantic trade tensions and
managing this WTO trade dispute responsibly,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, in a statement, said the EU ''prefers
to avoid escalation of the dispute at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves the biggest case the United States has lost
before the Geneva-based WTO, which ruled that America's system of
granting tax breaks to U.S. companies that send goods abroad did
not comply with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   Congress faced a Sunday deadline from the WTO for passing new
legislation. When it became clear that the deadline would not be
met, the administration began negotiations with the EU in an effort
to postpone any threatened sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat stressed that it was
critical that Congress pass legislation before it adjourns for the
fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot emphasize strongly enough how critical it is that
Congress complete action on the (Foreign Sales Corporation) repeal
and replacement legislation as expeditiously as possible,''
Eizenstat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Created to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters, the tax
program permits U.S. companies to reduce income taxes by 15 percent
through export subsidiaries set up in offshore tax havens such as
Barbados and the Virgin Islands. Microsoft, Boeing and General
Motors are only a few of the 6,000 companies, with 4.8 million
workers, that get the $4.1 billion annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's agreement with the 15-nation EU does not involve the
substance of the dispute; rather, it establishes the procedural
guidelines by which both sides will abide.
</P>
<P>
   It is important, however, because it will protect the United
States from EU trade sanctions while a WTO panel rules on the
replacement legislation sought from Congress. The deal the two
sides reached was modeled after procedures used by Canada and
Australia in a WTO dispute involving salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The EU contends that the changes in the export tax law under
consideration by Congress do not go far enough to meet the WTO's
objections that the tax breaks amount to an illegal trade subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite White House pressure -- and an overwhelming favorable
vote in the House on the legislation -- Senate Democrats blocked
attempts this week by Republican leaders to bring the bill up for
debate. The dispute centers on Republican efforts to limit
amendments and Democrats' insistence on their rights to offer them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, senators want to change the legislation, which
would set up a replacement system of trade tax breaks on foreign
sales for about 6,000 U.S. corporations. The new tax breaks would
come to $4.5 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., is pushing an amendment that would
deny the tax benefit to pharmaceutical companies that sell drugs in
the United States at vastly higher prices than overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators want to deny tobacco companies the benefits,
arguing that the government should not provide tax breaks while
waging a war against smoking. A similar effort failed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Still other lawmakers want to attach completely unrelated
measures. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., sought a vote on a
campaign finance reform amendment on the trade tax bill, while Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has threatened try to attach language
raising the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage on several pieces of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., expressed
frustration at the blocking tactics after he tried to bring the tax
measure to the floor Thursday. He expressed hope that the Senate
would be able to pass the proposal ''in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4986.

<HEADLINE> Search Protection Leads Court Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Difficult questions about Americans'
constitutional protection against unreasonable searches -- while in
their homes, cars and even in hospital beds -- lead the Supreme
Court's agenda as the justices begin their 2000-2001 term Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, say the most important day for the
nation's highest court will be election day. The next president
will choose the next members of a court that has been divided 5-4
on some of the nation's most explosive issues.
</P>
<P>
   The court this term also is confronting a major challenge to the
nation's premier environmental law, the Clean Air Act, and will
decide whether people can sue states to enforce the federal ban on
discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The term that ended in June was a blockbuster. The justices
upheld the Miranda warnings police must give before questioning
criminal suspects, let the Boy Scouts ban homosexual troop leaders
and struck down a state's ''partial-birth'' abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   They also banned group prayers at public high school football
games and prevented rape victims from suing their attackers in
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The court last week cleared its plate of the massive Microsoft
antitrust dispute by sending it to a federal appeals court,
delaying a final ruling perhaps for years.
</P>
<P>
   The 47 cases granted review for the new term -- with about two
dozen more to be added in coming months -- lack the political punch
of last year's cases but still will touch the lives of many
ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already looming as a big year for the Fourth Amendment,''
which protects Americans against unreasonable searches and arrests,
said Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   A case that could affect the nation's 185 million licensed
drivers asks whether police can arrest people for traffic
violations punishable only by a fine. A Texas woman, whose lawyers
call her a ''typical motorist,'' says police went too far when they
arrested, handcuffed and jailed her because she and her children
were not wearing seatbelts in the family pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases illustrate ''the pressure that the war on drugs has
exerted on the Fourth Amendment in particular and the Constitution
in general,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will decide whether police can set up traffic
checkpoints and stop motorists in hopes of catching people who sell
or use illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police generally need a warrant or a reason to suspect someone
of a crime before detaining them for several minutes, and a lower
court ruled that drug checkpoints by Indianapolis police likely
amounted to unreasonable seizures. But the Supreme Court previously
has upheld roadblocks aimed at catching drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Another war-on-drugs case asks whether public hospitals can test
pregnant patients for drug use and tell police who tested positive.
A South Carolina hospital tested patients' urine without a court
warrant, and if the result were positive, women were arrested for
endangering the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   A group of women sued but a federal appeals court upheld the
tests, saying hospitals had a ''substantial interest'' in seeking
to reduce cocaine use by pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   A case that was among a dozen granted review last week, when the
justices got a head start on their new term, asks whether police
need a search warrant to use a device to detect heat coming from
someone's home. An Oregon man was charged with growing marijuana
after police said a heat-detecting device showed an unusual amount
of heat coming from the roof over his garage.
</P>
<P>
   Still another marijuana-search case involves an Illinois man who
was prevented by police from going inside his home alone until the
officers could get a warrant to search for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act dispute could yield a hugely important ruling
on environmental protection that might also limit other federal
agencies' authority to write rules to implement laws passed by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups want the Environmental Protection Agency to
consider costs, in addition to health benefits, in setting federal
air-quality standards. The case began as a dispute over the EPA's
1997 standards for reducing smog and soot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The argument is not that we want to turn back the clock'' on
environmental protection, said Edward Warren, a lawyer for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. Instead, he said the issue is ''how are we
going to do the most with what we have in solving environmental
problems?''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust called the
air-quality standards ''the heart and lungs of the Clean Air Act''
and said a Supreme Court win for industry would mean ''more
pollution, more health damage for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices might use the disability-bias case to forge ahead
with what some legal scholars call a states' rights revolution -- a
series of rulings that have sharply tipped the federal-state
balance of governmental power toward the states. In January the
court ruled that state employees cannot go into federal court to
sue over age bias.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the justices have agreed to decide whether state employees
can sue in federal court to enforce the 1990 Americans with
Disabilities Act, a law that aims to protect the disabled against
job bias. The law is perhaps best known for requiring wheelchair
ramps in buildings across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision could sweep broadly enough to affect all
ADA lawsuits filed against state governments, not just those filed
by state employees.

<HEADLINE> German Unification Was Unstoppable  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- German unification seemed unthinkable when the
Berlin Wall unexpectedly opened on Nov. 9, 1989. Before Christmas
it began to look inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Just 19 days after jubilant crowds first poured through
Checkpoint Charlie, while his allies were urging caution in dealing
with the rapidly unfolding drama, Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered a
plan to tie East Germany and West Germany into one nation. By Dec.
9, European Union leaders reaffirmed Germany's right to
unification. Ten months later it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after German reunification, the Berlin Wall and the
country called East Germany have vanished, and Europe is just as
stable and peaceful as before.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, there were fears in many capitals that
reunification could disrupt the balance of power and provoke a
Soviet response, and there were long memories of two world wars.
What couldn't be known at the time was how weak Moscow was, and the
extent to which Chancellor Helmut Kohl had correctly judged the
hunger for union in both parts of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before 1989 I can remember in our discussions nobody spoke
about the possibility of Germany reunification,'' Wilfried Martens,
prime minister of Belgium from 1979 to 1992, recalled in an
interview with The Associated Press in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the issue became pressing business.
</P>
<P>
   Martens recalled that Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti expressed
some doubts, but that the most vociferous opponent of German
unification was British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And
Thatcher found French President Francois Mitterrand ''still more
concerned than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher thought she had an ally in Mitterrand, and they had two
private meetings during a European Union summit in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''He observed that in history the Germans were a people in
constant movement and flux. At this I produced from my handbag a
map showing the various configurations of Germany in the past,
which were not altogether reassuring about the future. We talked
through what precisely we might do,'' Thatcher wrote in ''The
Downing Street Years,'' her 1993 memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Mitterrand, in her view, decided to do nothing, and that dashed
her hopes of slowing Kohl's rapid moves.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Cabanel, a conservative member of the French Senate,
recalled his own misgivings at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two fears: the existential fear of Germany of the
French people and that the reunification would happen in disorder
and that it would lead to unrest in what was then the USSR,
provoking military troubles,'' said Cabanel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was more leaning in favor of a harmoniously negotiated
reunification, and of avoiding as much as possible the presence of
the crowd,'' Cabanel said. ''There was also the fear that Germany
would lose interest in European construction, to concentrate its
efforts on reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher, then fighting moves to draw Britain deeper into the
European political and economic ambit, feared the reverse -- that to
gain unification, Kohl would accept tying Germany into an
ever-closer European Union. The momentum toward a single Germany
accelerated in February 1990, when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
signaled his acceptance by saying, ''the unity of the German nation
must be decided by the Germans themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 18, the newly formed Alliance for Germany, a
pro-unification party, won 48 percent of the vote in East Germany's
first free election.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, Thatcher met prominent academics at Chequers,
her official country residence, to ponder whether German
unification was a good idea, and whether it could be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The men she invited didn't share her fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were extremely respectful towards present-day Germany,''
Oxford University historian Norman Stone wrote years later.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher shocked some of the academics with her antagonism
toward Germany and Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we were leaving I remarked to an English colleague that the
only word she refrained from using in connection with Germany was
'Huns,''' Fritz Stern of Columbia University in New York later
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Stern said, the die was cast.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we met at Chequers, the point had already been reached
where East Germany was bankrupt. The Wall had been breached. It was
evident that a majority in the GDR (German Democratic Republic)
favored unification,'' Stern said in an interview last year with
the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only ones who could have prevented it back then were the
Russians,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish journalist Per Landin, author of ''Last Tango in the
DDR,'' a 1991 book about the demise of East Germany, was critical
of reunification at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it went too fast,'' he said in an interview. ''It
wasn't really a reunification as much as an annexation to or an
enlargement of West Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   He has changed his mind. ''It's been better than I had expected,
even though it is an awesome mental change that will take several
generations'' to complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's Martens believes the doubters have been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East Germany and East Berlin, ''the changes are
incredible, the investments were amazing in the infrastructure, the
modernization. When we see Berlin now it's not just a renovation,
it's been a real revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course there are still social and psychological problems.
The integration is still going on. They have unified, but they
still have to be integrated,'' Martens said.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher concluded that she had been right to oppose rapid
unification, but wrong to think she could do anything to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most observers were unaware of the nationalist passion for
German unity that burned in the East,'' Thatcher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the event,'' Thatcher said, ''the desire for unity among
Germans on both sides of the Elbe proved irresistible.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Fight Shows GOP Changes  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This year's budget fight, with both parties
bidding up federal spending to record levels, underlines the stark
change in Republican rhetoric and action since the Newt
Gingrich-led GOP began controlling Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget year that began Sunday finds Republican leaders
emphasizing that they would use annual federal surpluses first to
reduce the national debt, then to cut taxes and -- yes -- increase
spending for schools and other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they prefer less spending than President Clinton wants.
Even so, with the White House and both chambers of Congress at
stake in next month's elections, flexible GOP negotiators have
accepted administration demands for billions of extra dollars. They
have also added plenty of additional spending on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to address some of the additional needs the White
House has requested,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said of budget talks. But, he added, ''I'm hoping that the feeding
frenzy will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the atmosphere five years ago. Republicans
had just captured majorities of the House and Senate for the first
time in four decades, led by Gingrich, R-Ga., their aggressive
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, with huge federal deficits envisioned perpetually
into the future, Republicans spoke of dramatically changing the
face of government by eliminating the annual shortfalls by 2002 and
cutting spending and taxes. Rather than negotiate, they were
unhesitant about using brinksmanship to force Clinton into
unconditional surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible the fundamental functions of the federal
government could close,'' one GOP leader, House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich of Ohio, said in July 1995. ''But that is an
opportunity, not a risk. It gets us to the point where people
decide where we're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   By the following January, there had been two federal shutdowns
totaling 27 days. Polls showed that an angry public blamed the GOP
by about 2-to-1 for the shutdowns; ever since, Republicans have
taken a softer tone on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Gingrich's placed is the gentler-seeming Dennis Hastert of
Illinois as speaker. And beyond that, not only the rhetoric has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of fiscal 1995, the last year for which a Democratic
Congress wrote a budget, discretionary spending was $546 billion,
including cuts Republicans made by year's end. Discretionary
spending is the one-third of the federal budget that Congress must
approve each year, covering everything the government does except
for automatic payments such as Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lopped $9 billion off that total the following year
to $535 billion. But beginning in 1997, the figure has headed
steadily upward, practically soaring recently amid annual, year-end
talks in which GOP fear of another shutdown has given Clinton most
of the leverage.
</P>
<P>
   According to Senate Budget Committee estimates, discretionary
spending reached $617 billion in 2000, a 7.3 percent increase from
the previous year. And this year's total is so far estimated at
$646 billion, a 4.7 percent increase -- with only two of the 13
annual spending bills for 2001 enacted. That figure is expect to
rise as the remaining bills take their final form.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a surplus now, we had a deficit then,'' said Michele
Davis, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
explaining the spending turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the extra spending is possible because of
today's huge surpluses, which have so far gone mostly to reducing
the $3.4 trillion publicly held national debt. In a radio address
last weekend, Lott said that still leaves money to boost ''our
national priorities such as education, defense and health
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, GOP leaders were emphasizing eliminating entire
Cabinet-level departments, not increasing spending.
</P>
<P>
   Further underscoring the party's turnaround, it was Republican
senators -- including Lott and Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska -- who
delayed completion of talks last week on a new land conservation
program by demanding extra money for coastal states.
</P>
<P>
   And when bargainers shook hands on the new program and the
administration hailed it as a triumph, it was Murkowski who issued
a written statement complaining that ''none of the accounts might
ever be'' spent at all.
</P>
<P>
   Budget negotiations are likely to last into mid-October, with
the government kept functioning with a series of temporary spending
bills.

<HEADLINE> More Greek Ferry Victims Found  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- Criticism of the government grew as divers
on Saturday found two more bodies inside a ferry that crashed into
rocky islets and sank, raising the death toll to 76 in the nation's
worst ferry disaster in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marine officials said the number of dead could rise further.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doesn't anyone have the decency to resign?'' asked
conservative opposition leader Costas Caramanlis.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found inside the 345-foot Express Samina, which
sank in rough seas two miles off the island's coast on Sept. 26
after crashing into the islets marked with a light beacon.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were officially listed as missing -- four Greeks and
one Albanian man, the Merchant Marine ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Continued confusion over the number and identity of passengers
on the ferry has brought strong criticism of the government and
ship's operator, Minoan Flying Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the fleet also has come under scrutiny, and the
government has been criticized for what is seen as a feeble rescue
attempt in which so many died even though the ferry sunk two miles
from the shore. Most of the criticism has come from the opposition
and relatives of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry's captain, Vassilis Yannakis, his first officer and
two other crew members will testify Sunday before an investigating
magistrate on the nearby island of Syros, the region's
administrative capital.
</P>
<P>
   They have been charged with murder, neglect of duty and
violation of maritime procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Yannakis has told investigators he was taking a nap and his
first officer was off the bridge flirting with a passenger,
according to testimony carried in the daily Ta Nea on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Six-member diving teams were carrying out the search. Measures
were also being taken to prevent leakage of the 162 tons of fuel
oil and diesel from the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Merchant Marine ministry said 67 of the dead had been
identified. They include a Norwegian citizen and two Canadians of
Greek descent.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission asked the Greek government to provide
details of the accident to determine whether EU safety regulations
were violated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have asked Greek authorities to provide answers within one
month,'' EU Commission spokesman Gilles Gantelet said in Brussels
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Merchant Marine Minister Christos Papoutsis, facing calls
from critics to resign, said all passenger ferry companies would
have to submit their safety records to the ministry by Sunday or
have vessels impounded.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people travel on passenger and ferry boats
around Greece every year. There are about 18 ships over 29 years of
age in Greece's coastal fleet of about 130 ferries, many on routes
to islands such as Paros.

<HEADLINE> Cops Seek To Block Falun Gong Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Police checked vehicles entering China's capital
to thwart a threatened protest by followers of the outlawed Falun
Gong spiritual movement on Sunday, the 51st anniversary of
communist rule, a rights group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Spot checks on major roads around Beijing began Friday and
continued Saturday after two weeks of police sweeps that saw 600
Falun Gong members detained in nearby provinces, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows signs of government nervousness and
dispatches in Hong Kong media that 10,000 sect followers were
heading for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from ''All China's Falun Gong Students'' recently
posted on the group's U.S. Web site warned of protests if police
stepped up detentions ahead of the National Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   China's cabinet, the State Council, issued a directive, carried
in state-run newspapers Saturday, ordering government offices to
tighten security over the weeklong holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The order focused on general safety and demanded particular
attention be paid to explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong members have kept their protests against the
communist government's ban on the group peaceful, other disaffected
groups have not.
</P>
<P>
   Turkic Muslims in China's Central Asian territory of Xinjiang
have waged a sporadic bombing campaign against Chinese rule and
three years ago bombed a bus in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   National Day is China's most public holiday for celebrating the
Communist Party's takeover on Oct. 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other members of the communist
and government elite gathered on the holiday's eve for a reception
in the Great Hall of the People, next to Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji, in the traditional National Day address,
made only a vague, passing reference to worries of unrest by
unemployed workers, poor farmers and Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to ''difficulties of one kind or another in our way
ahead'' to a prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   People's Daily was more blunt. In an editorial to be published
Sunday, the party's flagship newspaper urged Chinese to rally
around the leadership to safeguard hard-won economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stability is the guarantor of reform and development,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed and plainclothes police in the large numbers usual for
a holiday kept careful watch on Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese by the thousands flooded into the broad square to admire
colorfully lit fountains, floral displays and a 30-foot-tall
sculpture of Beijing's 2008 Olympic bid logo.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders banned Falun Gong 14 months ago as a threat to
communist rule and as a public menace that cheated followers and
caused 1,500 deaths. Followers, however, maintain the group's
slow-motion exercises, Taoist and Buddhist cosmology and the
teachings of founder Li Hongzhi promote health and morality.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hong Kong-based rights group's report could not be
immediately confirmed, the actions it describes fit previous police
sweeps ahead of sensitive anniversaries. Police have previously set
up checkpoints and ordered provincial governments to round up Falun
Gong members to keep them out of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, New York-based Human Rights in China, said police
in Beijing have over the past few weeks evicted rural migrants,
street children, beggars and others from the city as part of an
annual clean-up campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, French Foreign Ministry official Jean
Felix-Paginon said that China plans to revise, but not abolish its
greatly abused system allowing police to send criminal suspects to
forced labor camps without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Felix-Paginon led a European Union delegation that met with
Chinese officials in Beijing on Friday as part of a twice-yearly
EU-China human rights dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Reform of labor-camp detentions aside, China offered scant other
evidence of progress on human rights in a one-day grilling, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Florida man charged with killing 3-year-old Connecticut boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A man who was granted temporary custody
of a 3-year-old Connecticut boy with cerebral palsy is accused of
killing the boy at his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   James Curtis, 25, was charged with first-degree felony murder
Friday in the death of Alex Charles Boucher, who was on a visit to
the Curtis home.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 25, Curtis was watching the child and became angry when
the boy soiled himself, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Curtis scolded the boy, grabbing his cheeks hard
enough to leave bruises, and later wrapped Alex tightly in a blue
cotton blanket and put him to bed unattended.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket was wrapped ''in a manner to willfully torture the
victim,'' according to the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Jackie Pehote of the police department in New Port Richey,
Fla., said Curtis admitted to wrapping the blanket so tightly
around the child's body that it pinned his arms to his sides.
Curtis also said he placed the blanket just under Alex's bottom lip
to keep him from crying, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis returned to the bedroom about 30 minutes later to free
the child because his wife, Jennifer, was due home from the store,
Pehote said, but Alex was unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had turned over on his stomach and choked himself,'' Pehote
said. Vomit was coming from the boy's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Alex, who had cerebral palsy and other medical problems, was
placed on life support at All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, Fla. and died Wednesday. An autopsy found the cause of
death to be homicidal asphyxia.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Department of Children and Families, which had
assigned temporary custody of Alex to James and Jennifer Curtis for
the September visit, had permanent custody of the child and had
been trying to find him an adoptive home for most of his short
life.
</P>
<P>
   The custodial rights of Alex's parents had been terminated when
Alex was only a few months old because they were unable to care for
him, DCF spokesman Gary Kleeblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   DCF initially placed Alex with relatives in Maine, thinking that
they eventually would adopt him, but no one was able to adequately
care for him because of his medical problems, Kleeblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Maine and Connecticut authorities attempted to
find Alex an adoptive home in those states, those efforts failed.
Then the Curtises turned up.
</P>
<P>
   The young couple were former Maine residents who had known
Alex's relatives and occasionally had baby-sat the child. Since
moving to Florida, the couple had gone to a private child-placement
agency in the hope of adopting. That's when they came to DCF's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We contacted that agency in Florida and found that the family
had already started the process,'' Kleeblatt said. ''The agency
said they had done a criminal record and child-protection check on
the couple, and we received a letter from the agency saying this
would be an appropriate placement.''
</P>
<P>
   DCF did not conduct its own background checks, Kleeblatt said,
but didn't simply turn Alex over to the Curtises, either. First the
couple traveled to Maine in early September and spent time with the
child during two weeks of supervised visitation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Child protection workers from Connecticut and Maine thought
those visits went well, Kleeblatt said, and arrangements were made
for Alex to spend extended time in Florida with the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Alex, described by neighbors as a pudgy little boy with blond
hair and a pug nose, had been living in the couple's apartment for
only a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all very saddened by this,'' DCF Deputy Thomas Gilman
said. ''Our preliminary investigation indicates that the (DCF)
worker spent a considerable amount of time with the youngster.''
</P>
<P>
   State Child Advocate Jeanne Milstein, who was notified Friday
about the death, said her office will be investigating. Milstein
said she is going to recommend that the state Child Fatality Review
Panel, of which she is chairwoman, also review the boy's death.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Fossil Auction,260  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - One of a trio of teen-age fossil hunters
who found a previously unknown gliding reptile 40 years ago is
suing another in the group in a dispute over the $167,500 the
fossil fetched at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brandrowski, 55, of Cliffside Park, filed a lawsuit last
week in Superior Court in Hackensack against Alfred Siefker, 56, of
North Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   Brandrowski claims that he discovered the 200 million-year-old
fossil, is the rightful owner and that the money it fetched at
auction belongs to him.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of Icarosaurus siefkeri in the former Granton
Quarry in 1960 led scientists to revise the evolutionary timeline.
The reptile - with a 10-inch wingspan and 7-inch-long body - proved
that vertebrates were flying millions of years earlier than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   It had been studied for more than 30 years at the American
Museum of Natural History before Siefker put it up for sale. The
California businessman who bought it returned it there Tuesday, and
it will go on display next week.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims Siefker ''wrongfully took possession'' of the
fossil in 1989 and had no right to put it up for auction Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Siefker's attorney, Robert Avery, said not only did the deadline
for Brandrowski to claim ownership of the fossil pass 30 years ago,
but his client has documentation that proves Brandrowski gave up
his rights to it and was compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Siefker has said he traded Brandrowski a telescope, $30 and some
fossils for the relic.

<HEADLINE> Japan Remembers Nuclear Accident  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- Anti-nuclear activists, some dressed in
funeral black, called for an end to nuclear energy in a noisy
demonstration Saturday, a year after Japan's worst nuclear accident
killed two people and exposed hundreds to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 demonstrators shouted through bullhorns outside
the Science and Technology Agency, demanding the government pull
the plug on Japan's nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power generates about a third of electricity in this
resource-poor country.
</P>
<P>
   The protest commemorated the Sept. 30, 1999, accident at the JCO
Co. fuel-reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, near Tokyo, in which two
workers tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium
in buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The mix set off an uncontrolled nuclear reaction at the plant,
exposing the two to fatal doses of radiation. A third worker was
hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ordered 161 people evacuated from their homes, and
another 310,000 were advised to stay indoors for 18 hours as a
precaution. In all, 439 people were exposed to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokaimura calamity confirmed the worst fears of the
industry's many critics, uncovering systematic disregard for safety
regulations and inadequate employee training.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government doesn't seem to have learned anything at all
from the accident,'' said Shin Kobuchi, a 22-year-old university
student. ''It has made no effort to listen to what the experts are
saying about the dangers of nuclear energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokaimura, a rural community 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, is
home to a nuclear reactor and a dozen related facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The town and plant operators commemorated the first anniversary
of the accident with a morning of disaster-prevention drills.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal officials rushed to a command post after receiving a
report of a dangerous radiation leak. Sirens wailed. Buses shuttled
evacuees to safe areas, where they were examined by medical
personnel with Geiger counters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's tragedy continued to weigh heavily on a nation
suspicious of nuclear energy and increasingly aware of its
destructive potential.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities are scaling down plans to build new plants. The
government is struggling to balance its long-term goal of expanding
nuclear energy with calls for tightening safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a state governor in western Japan forced a utility
company to tear up blueprints for a nuclear facility, citing safety
concerns raised by Tokaimura.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Japanese newspaper on Saturday criticized the
government's subsequent efforts to strengthen its supervision as
halfhearted, asserting the industry still lacks a vigilant
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safety should not be left to chance,'' the daily Asahi wrote
in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   JCO was stripped of its license to operate the processing plant
in March, and the last of the remaining uranium was being removed
from the facility this week.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has agreed to pay out $117 million in
compensation to settle 6,875 cases stemming from the accident.

<HEADLINE> Billionaire financier Carl Icahn pulls Sands out of bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Billionaire financier Carl Icahn has
pulled the Sands Casino and Hotel out of bankruptcy officially by
wiring $65 million to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn assumed control of the financially struggling casino
Friday, ending its 33 months under bankruptcy protection. He owns
65 percent of the casino and has installed its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The state Casino Control Commission approved Icahn's takeover
plan earlier this month to invest $65 million in cash and issue
$110 million in new bonds to prop up the casino, which has remained
operating while reorganizing in bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been unsettling because there was no firm floor you're
walking on. This is a real opportunity for the Sands to have a
financial position where it can move forward,'' Sands Chief
Executive Officer Alfred Luciani told The Press of Atlantic City
for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The casino had been under Chapter 11 since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's plans are already being carried out at the casino,
including looser slot machines, construction of a 282-room hotel
tower, a new bus terminal, casino expansion and renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Sands is expected to pay another $5.4 million to vendors who
haven't been paid for services and goods rendered before the
bankruptcy filing. The amount is 80 percent payback on the $6.7
million they're owed.
</P>
<P>
   The casino is now a stand-alone company called GB Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The small 532-room off-Boardwalk casino, which occupies the
middle of a block, has always struggled in the shadow of Bally's
Park Place Casino Resort and other bigger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It reported losses of more than $35 million annually for the
three years prior to the bankruptcy filing.

<HEADLINE> Last Inmates Leave Belfast Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The last four inmates have left
the Maze prison, which is due to be shut down as part of Northern
Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an end of an era and I hope we never return to the same
circumstances that we have had these last 30 years,'' Prison
Officers' Association spokesman Finlay Spratt said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think a lot of people will be sad to see the close of
the Maze. It's been a blight on our life for many years and it is
good to see the end of it,'' Spratt said in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   The last three Protestant ''loyalist'' prisoners were
transferred to Maghaberry Prison west of Belfast, and the lone
republican prisoner was moved to Magilligan jail in County
Londonderry on Friday. Seven other prisoners were moved on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday agreement provided for early releases for
prisoners affiliated with groups which declared cease-fires,
including the Irish Republican Army on the Irish Catholic side, and
the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force on the
British Protestant side.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1976, the Maze had eight H-shaped blocks designed for a
total of 800 prisoners. The prison is southwest of Belfast, near
the Protestant village of Maze.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the day the Maze opened, IRA convicts refused to
wear their new prison uniforms and smeared excrement on their cell
walls, while on the outside the IRA assassinated prison officers.
The campaign reached its climax in 1981, when 10 prisoners starved
themselves to death.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, 38 IRA prisoners escaped, the biggest in
British penal history.

<HEADLINE> Republican Lazio facing battle in conservative upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Rick Lazio, facing Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the nation's highest profile U.S. Senate race,
has found himself in a late-in-the-campaign dogfight for
traditionally more conservative upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio kicked off a three-day bus tour through the upstate area
on Thursday, beginning with a speech to a Rotary Club luncheon in
Buffalo. A day earlier, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute
had come out with a poll showing the first lady leading the
congressman from Long Island, 50 percent to 43 percent, among
likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton hitting the magic 50 percent mark for the first
time this year in a major statewide independent poll dominated the
news coverage, there was an ominous message in the poll for Lazio -
the mood of the upstate electorate. The poll found Lazio supported
by 46 percent of upstate voters while Clinton was backed by 44
percent, a statistical tie given the poll's margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''The upstate stuff shouldn't be that close'' if Lazio is to
win, said Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Buried inside the poll was the evidence of Lazio's upstate
problem.
</P>
<P>
   -Thirty-eight percent of upstate voters said they had a
favorable opinion of Clinton to 35 percent for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   -When asked if the candidates share their views on the issues,
58 percent of upstate voters said Clinton did, the same number that
said Lazio did.
</P>
<P>
   -Asked if the candidates had ''the stature to be a distinguished
United States senator,'' 65 percent of upstate voters said Clinton
did. Lazio hit 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -Asked if the candidates were too liberal, too conservative or
just about right, 53 percent of upstate voters said Lazio was just
about right while 47 percent of them said Clinton was just about
right, a very small edge for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   -Lazio did have the edge, 74 percent to 45 percent, when it came
to which candidate upstate voters felt had ''the right kind of
experience'' to be a senator from New York. He has made much of the
fact that she only moved to New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   -On the issues, upstate voters gave the edge to Clinton on
health care, education and abortion. Lazio had the edge on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   -By a 67 percent to 29 percent margin, upstate voters said a
candidate's position on issues was more important than their
experience or personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   That last could be a major problem for Lazio given that his
advertising campaign has been geared to telling voters that they
can't trust Clinton. The poll found that upstate voters, like those
elsewhere in the state, care more about where she and he stand on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The upstate region, less of a sure thing for Republican
candidates running statewide than it used to be, has become
critical in this year's Senate race. In general elections, the
region normally provides about 45 percent of the statewide vote.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday in Buffalo why he wasn't doing better in upstate
New York, Lazio said he thought he was doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pay attention to polls,'' he told reporters. ''If you
travel with us and you see the crowds and the enthusiasm ... I
think we're doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the same thing at a later stop in Rochester, Lazio
said, ''I don't believe for a moment that we are up by only two
points in upstate. If you've been traveling around with me, as I
have been going around upstate, people are exceedingly
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton is generally greeted by larger crowds across
upstate New York, certainly a reflection in part of her celebrity,
but they also often seem more enthusiastic than those who come out
to see Lazio. She has been spending a good portion of her time in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, the Lazio campaign plans to have him spend more
time in the upstate region in the last month of the campaign and to
spend more money on television advertising there.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Clinton well ahead of Lazio in heavily
Democratic New York City, which traditionally provides about 30
percent of the statewide vote, with him having the edge in the
suburban counties, which usually account for about a quarter of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the pattern for months, explaining why there is
the heavy interest in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, then-Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato captured 55
percent of the upstate vote to Democrat Charles Schumer's 45
percent. Schumer won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Humbert has covered New York state politics for The
Associated Press for more than 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Handouts vs. Works in Brazil Race  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   JABORANDI, Brazil (AP) -- Mayor Jose Dias da Silva thought his
record would speak for itself. Surely investments in schools and
hospitals would sway voters more than beer or food baskets at
election time, he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was many residents seemed to prefer the handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Many here complain da Silva -- known by his nickname Regente --
has spent too much on public works and not enough on the favors and
gifts that are a hallowed campaign tradition and give the election
a carnival feel.
</P>
<P>
   That's where his rival, Lidio Dias, excels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regente did stuff for the city, he didn't do anything for the
poor,'' says 19-year-old Lesio Villas Boas da Franca, who wore a
Dias T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately the people around here are a bit backwards,''
explains high school principal Neusa Campos de Oliveira. ''They
like a guy who gives them a slap on the back. Lidio was the kind of
guy who showed up at a bar and picked up the tab for everybody. A
lot of people owe him.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ahead of Sunday's municipal election in this town
of 10,000 people highlights the obstacles to rooting out the
patronage and cronyism ingrained in Brazilian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Dias, an old-school politician and da Silva's uncle, was mayor
until 1996. When his term ended, he used his popularity and
influence to help elect his cool, businesslike nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva, who attended veterinary school and served in the army,
brought something new to Jaborandi, a poor town of mostly
subsistence farmers 375 miles northeast of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   He went after federal funds that Dias had been unaware of or
ignored and benefitted greatly from a 1998 law that distributed
government funding directly to cities instead of through state
governors, who often allocated the money at their whimsey.
</P>
<P>
   Under da Silva, the town's annual budget jumped from $47,000 to
$1.9 million. He invested heavily in health, education and a sewage
system that keeps the local river clean -- something practically
unheard of in Brazil's poor Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governing is the easiest thing in the world, you just have to
want to,'' said the tall, stubble-chinned da Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Dias seems genuinely stunned by the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My administration was there to help the people who suffer on
the farm,'' he said. ''I did what I could with my small budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But the all-in-the-family harmony broke down in 1997, when a
Constitutional amendment allowed mayors to run for reelection.
Dias, who had expected to inherit the mayor's office again,
suddenly faced opposition from his nephew. The two no longer speak.
</P>
<P>
   Dias says his nephew's administration wasn't entirely selfless.
He points to da Silva's enormous house and sports utility vehicle
and suggests that he also benefited from the recent cash inflow.
</P>
<P>
   Dias is known for distributing food baskets, a traditional
election time handout here. But he claims da Silva has upped the
ante, buying votes with UNICEF funds intended to replace the
unhealthy mud shacks that are home for many residents. Instead of
new houses, Dias says, the mayor offers renovations, and only to
those who agree to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva denies he's doing anything wrong with the UNICEF money
but admits political realities have forced him to engage in some of
the more traditional voting getting methods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do good work and I do good politics too,'' counters da
Silva, known popularly as Regente. ''Buying votes exists. If a poor
person is sick what are you going to do: let them die?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, da Silva appears to be trailing among voters. His support
is strongest among the 2,000 who live near the newly restored town
square, where he has created government jobs and improved social
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the 8,000 voters on the small farms surrounding the town
seem to like Dias better. He mixes easily with the farmers and
field hands, drinking cachaca -- a homemade sugar cane liquor -- and
smoking corn husk cigarettes. Farmer Jose Joaquim Saraiva, 56,
admits the mayor has done a lot for Jaborandi but says he still
plans to vote for Dias.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lidio helped me a lot when he was in office,'' he says. ''If I
could pay with a liter of cachaca or a kilo of beans I would, but I
can't. The only way I can pay him is with my vote.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Haskell Gets Movie Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Surviving well past her 15 minutes of fame,
''Survivor'' star Colleen Haskell has signed on to do her first
feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Studios announced that Haskell, 24, will appear in a
comedy called ''Animal'' due out next June. Filming is scheduled to
begin Oct. 17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which stars ''Saturday Night Live'' veteran Rob
Schneider, is about a man who receives organ transplants from
several different animals and finds himself taking on the donors'
traits. Haskell will play Rianna, his love interest.
</P>
<P>
   While others have landed TV appearances, Haskell is the first of
the 16 ''Survivor'' castaways to snatch a movie deal. She was a
student at the Miami Advertising School in Miami Beach, Fla.,
before appearing on the show.

<HEADLINE> Ray Romano Talks About Gambling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ray Romano sees only one upside to his old
gambling habit: he didn't have much money to blow at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, who plays sportswriter Ray Barone on the CBS sitcom
''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' says his hobby of betting on sporting
events during his days as a struggling standup comedian turned into
a compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a casino, you gotta give them money up front. But when you
make a phone call to a bookmaker, you can say, 'Put a thousand
dollars on this' even if you don't have the money on you,'' Romano
said in the Oct. 9 issue of Us Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good part was that I didn't have a lot to lose, so it's
better that I had the habit then than now,'' said Romano.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, 42, says he gave up gambling 11 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Barge Spills Fuel Off Trinidad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- A barge leaked an undetermined
amount of marine diesel fuel off Trinidad's shore in the Gulf of
Paria, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry of Energy officials were surveying the area off
northwestern Trinidad on Saturday, the Trinidadian Coast Guard
said. By Saturday it had reached from an area outside Port-of-Spain
about five miles up to Chaguaramas, on the Caribbean island's
northeastern tip, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel spill happened Thursday at the National Petroleum
Marketing Co. in an area called Sea Lots, Coast Guard Lt. Ekmata
Mooleedhar was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper Saturday.
The Coast Guard has declined to identify the barge suspected of
leaking the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to release more details about the spill in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   The area harbors hundreds of yachts, and the fuel coated the
hulls of nearly 160 boats, said Amanda Shaw, manager of the
Trinidad and Tobago Sailing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches along the northwest of Trinidad may have to be closed
for several days for clean-up operations, Mooleedhar was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Wait in Tribute to Trudeau  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The body of Pierre Trudeau, Canada's former prime
minister, was returned to the capital Saturday to lie in state as
the country mourned.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau died Thursday at age 80. He had been suffering from
prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Gov. Gen. Adrienne Clarkson,
justices, generals, senior bureaucrats and politicians paid their
respects in the morning before the doors of the Parliament
building's marble Hall of Honor were opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Sons Justin and Sacha flanked their mother Margaret as they
followed the coffin, along with Chretien and his wife, Aline. The
prime minister looked drawn as he stood before the remains of his
old friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, all manner of ordinary folk filed past the coffin:
old and young, men in business suits and teens in baggy jeans,
white-haired matrons and soccer moms with tykes in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Gillespie, 30, of Ottawa, said he had to be part of the
solemn occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked his flamboyance. Canada has many heroes but not too
many legends,'' said Gillespie. ''His zest for life makes me want
to copy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau will lie in state on the Hill until Monday, when a
special, black-draped funeral train will carry him home to Montreal
to lie in state again in Mary Queen of the World Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   A state funeral with a solemn Roman Catholic ritual will be held
Tuesday in the ornate grandeur of Notre Dame Basilica.

<HEADLINE> De Niro Gets Achievement Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Robert De Niro is known for his
ability to adapt to a variety of roles. Talking about his talents
isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, De Niro was presented with the Donostia Prize
lifetime achievement award, a highlight of the San Sebastian Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his reluctance to talk off screen as he is for
volatility on screen, De Niro's answers at a packed press
conference were typically scant on detail and his smiles to an
eager audience were few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro, who has appeared in more than 50 movies, won an Oscar
for Best Supporting Actor in ''The Godfather, Part II'' in 1975.
Eight years later, he won the Best Actor Award playing an aging
boxer in ''Raging Bull.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Sebastian festival, Spain's leading film festival, was
to wrap up Saturday with the announcement of its prize winners.

<HEADLINE> Gas Supplies Cut to Russian Regions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russians huddled in parkas indoors and ate cold
meals in a Siberian city and a southern province Saturday after
natural gas utility turned off the tap because of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Siberian city of Omsk told Russia's
state-connected ORT television that they looked forward to riding
public transport because it was the warmest place in town. One old
woman wrapped in scarves heated tea on an old overturned iron
because her gas stove doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers said demand for electric heaters, stoves and
teapots had spiked since the gas was shut off. Independent NTV
television said talks between city officials and natural gas
monopoly Gazprom on resuming gas and fuel oil supplies had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Gas supplies have also been cut sharply to the entire southern
region of North Ossetia. Kazbek Karginov, first deputy premier of
the province, urged Gazprom to reschedule the debts before winter
sets in, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an electrical utility cut off power to a
strategic missile base for unpaid bills, panicking top government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoffs highlight Russia's chronic web of nonpayment, in
which large companies and government agencies don't pay cash for
energy, raw materials and taxes -- a habit that economists say drags
down the economy.

<HEADLINE> Five arrested in illegal lottery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Three New Jersey residents and two New
Yorkers were arrested in what authorities have described as an
illegal lottery with ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers arrested after the six-week investigation were
taken into custody in an apartment there that officials described
as a ''layoff bank,'' a place where large bets were taken to be
paid off if a bettor won.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested at their New Jersey homes were Thomas Abridello, 54, of
Belleville; Alfonse ''Tic'' Cataldo, 58, of Florham Park; and Mary
Henderson, 60, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Abridello and Henderson pleaded innocent on Friday. Cataldo had
his arraignment postponed a week.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Cataldo, described as the head of the
operation, is an associate of the Lucchese crime family. At a
Newark hearing, Assistant Essex County Prosecutor Judy Gagliano
said he has three gambling-related convictions, including one as
recent as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in New York were Queens residents Flimer Porro, 25, and
Mercedes Odano, 54. Authorities said the New York part of the
operation was under the control of Cuban organized crime figures
that had allied with the Lucchese family.

Gore Clings to Electoral College Lead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaign is tight and volatile across the
political map, with Al Gore clinging to his lead in the hunt for electoral
votes, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. Sixteen states plus the
District of Columbia are leaning the vice president's way or solidly in his
column, putting him at 226 electoral votes, 44 short of the 270 needed to win.
Another 21 states with 175 electoral votes would go to George W. Bush. That
leaves 13 tossup states with 137 electoral votes. Polls show that Gore and Bush
hold only narrow leads in several of their states, meaning the slightest
momentum shift could reshape the race.

violence was a dispute over a bitterly contested Jerusalem shrine sacred to

<HEADLINE> Report: No Charges in Pa. Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Police officers will not be charged for
shooting a carjacking suspect, but an investigation will continue
into his televised beating, newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired nearly 50 rounds at Thomas Jones, 30, who was
chased on foot and in cars after he was spotted driving a stolen
car on July 12. Jones eventually jumped into an empty police
cruiser and drove off before being stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
   A television news helicopter videotaped police officers kicking
and punching Jones during the arrest, images that were broadcast
around the nation. He was hospitalized for more than three weeks
with five gunshot wounds to his arm and stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The city district attorney will not prosecute any officers on
criminal charges in Jones' shooting, Saturday's editions of The
Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News reported. Both
cited unnamed sources within the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Officers could still face criminal charges for the beating of
Jones. Those who shot him could also face disciplinary sanctions
from the department for violating its firearms policy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is being held on $1 million bail, awaiting a preliminary
hearing Nov. 2 on more than 70 criminal charges, including eight
purse snatchings and two carjackings.
</P>
<P>
   A district attorney spokeswoman refused to comment on the police
statements, saying the investigation into the entire Jones matter
was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting, chase and arrest is being investigated by
Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne M. Abraham, the city Police
Department, the FBI and the federal Justice Department's Civil
Rights Division.

<HEADLINE> Runner Ottey Says She May Not Retire  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Don't say farewell to Merlene Ottey
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   In what she had described beforehand as her final race, Ottey
anchored the Jamaican team to a silver medal Saturday night in the
400-meter relay at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old has competed in six Olympics during her 20-year
career and won eight medals. But, within minutes of completing the
relay, she was already hedging on retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said a year ago that after the Olympics I would retire,''
she said. ''But I'm not sure actually. I had such a rough year.
It's been a fight trying to get on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had just two months to prepare for the Olympics. I thought I
did a fantastic job. I missed out on a medal in the 100. But I'm
happy I came. It could have been worse. I will consider continuing
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, who finished fourth in the 100 last weekend, is the most
decorated woman in track and field athlete, with 35 medals in major
championships. But she never won an Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey said just competing in Sydney was a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   She tested positive for traces of the steroid nandrolone in July
1999, forcing her to pull out of the world championships in
Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation suspended her, but
she was cleared by her national federation. The IAAF sent the case
to its arbitration panel, which lifted the ban on July 3 on grounds
that her urine sample was improperly tested.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey was asked whether she felt any sympathy for C.J. Hunter,
the shot putter and husband of U.S. sprinter Marion Jones.
International track officials said Hunter tested positive four
times this summer for nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never really taken up for anybody regarding doping,''
Ottey said. ''I can only speak for myself. But if he's innocent, I
can only imagine what he's going through, because I know what I
went through. As far as if he did it or not, I have no idea. If
he's innocent, it's a very, very bad feeling to be wrongly
accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold in the relay went to the Bahamas in 41.95 seconds,
followed by Jamaica in 42.13 and the United States in 42.20.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey said she was thrilled that Caribbean nations finished 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a lot of change in my career,'' she said. ''Twenty
years ago, when I started, we didn't have a lot of Caribbean
athletes on the podium. What's changed is the women are doing
better than the men.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are now believing in us. They believe we can also
perform well and they're giving us a chance. In the past, we've
never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should start paying attention to the Caribbean. They
should put more money into the region to support track and field.
Hopefully, we can do well in other sports, too, not just track in
field.''

<HEADLINE> Lisa Leslie Happy With Hoops Gold  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Not even a scalping of Lisa Leslie
could stop the U.S. women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   When Australia's Lauren Jackson yanked off Leslie's braided hair
extension in a tussle under the boards, it was the final indignity
the Americans would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie picked up her plait, tossed it to a startled
photographer, then caught up with Jackson at the other end of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have that,'' Leslie told her. ''I'll take the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Leslie and the rest of the Americans did, finishing off
the Australians 76-54 Saturday to win their second straight Olympic
title.
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of game the Americans have been waiting to
play since they arrived Down Under, an end-to-end rumble in which
they unleashed two weeks of pent-up annoyance at the Aussies and
let loose a deep, talented lineup that seemed bottled up too long.
</P>
<P>
   ''It definitely was our best performance,'' Leslie said. ''We
had to go out and make it an ugly game for Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they came here, the Americans kept hearing how they
couldn't run with the Australians, couldn't shoot with them, and
sure couldn't beat them on their home court. The newspapers arrived
each day with more and more taunts by the Australians, more and
more digs by local wags about how their beloved Opals would give
the Americans, thrown together slapdash from WNBA teams, their
comeuppance in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ''Australia challenged us not just on the court but in our
hearts and minds,'' Leslie said. ''I don't think any of my
teammates slept last night. We were tired before the game
started.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the hype was a real or imagined feud between the
6-foot-5 centers, the 28-year-old Leslie and the 19-year-old
Jackson, stemming from a chest-bumping confrontation in an
exhibition game before the Olympics. Leslie said it never happened,
Jackson said it most certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to the gold medal game, and the trash talking
gave way to some serious bumping and elbowing, players bouncing off
each other and the court as if a hockey game had broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The packed crowd of 15,000 in the SuperDome added to the
feverish mood, with green-and-yellow painted Australians competing
with flag-waving Americans for supremacy. The American men's
basketball team sat at courtside, lending its support, with Alonzo
Mourning holding up a sign that read, ''USA Came Down Under, Got
Gold!''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie and Jackson did a fair share of the shoving, jostling
each under the boards, going at each other from end to end. Leslie
would drive, and Jackson would match her. Jackson would pop from
the outside, and Leslie would try to do the same. Jackson got in a
few blocks, including a couple on Leslie, and Leslie came back with
a few assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, with their solid bench and stronger, more
experienced players, stayed ahead the whole game, building a 43-30
lead at halftime and never letting the lead fall to less than seven
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's frustration mounted as the Americans pulled away,
and when Yolanda Griffith tapped in an offensive rebound to make it
70-51 with 5 minutes to go, the tension reached a peak.
</P>
<P>
   In a scuffle for a ball under the boards, Jackson tore off
Leslie's long braid, leaving the embarrassed American to play the
rest of the game with just a tiny bun on top of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ''She pulled it off intentionally,'' Leslie claimed. ''I was
surprised she did that to me. Trust me, she had to pull it really
hard, because it was pinned in tight. She knew what she was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson scoffed at that, saying ''my fingers got caught as I
went for the ball. It certainly wasn't intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberate or not, Leslie's perception of what happened was
indicative of how the teams felt about each other and how much was
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you feed us a diet of the stuff we were hearing, day
after day, it's a lot of motivation,'' Leslie said. ''I said this
day would come, and we'd answer them on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans answered with balance all over the court -- Leslie
and Natalie Williams scoring 15, Sheryl Swoopes 14, Griffith 13,
Nikki McCray 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who may be headed to the WNBA in a few years, came up
with 20 points and 13 rebounds, but had little help from the rest
of the Opals.
</P>
<P>
   Though annoyed by the hair-pulling incident, Leslie said her
respect for Jackson as a player was undiminished. Yet, Leslie
couldn't resist one parting verbal punch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a gold medal, and I'm going home,'' Leslie said. ''If
she wants to come to the WNBA, she can meet me on my turf.''

<HEADLINE> US Hoops Coach Answers Doubters  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The final seconds were winding down and
Nell Fortner was able to stop coaching and start hugging.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal was assured for the U.S. women's Olympic
basketball team and the coach few had heard of three years ago had
answered all the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish you could jump inside my body and feel that personal
satisfaction. It's just great,'' Fortner said after the 76-54
victory over Australia ended her three-year run as the coach of the
women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Fortner, 41, was given the job in 1997 despite having just one
year as a head coach on any level. She left Purdue, a team to she
led to a 17-11 record and the second round of the NCAA tournament
after one season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the coach of the U.S. women's team was Tara VanDerveer,
a coach with a national reputation. Fortner was a well-known
assistant at Stephen F. Austin and then Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The players on a talent-laden U.S. were willing to give her a
chance. She showed she could handle international competition by
coaching 10 teams in the three years to a combined record of 84-14
in events like the Pan Am Games, the World Championships and the
Jones Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing was that Nell has grown with the game,''
U.S. guard and soon-to-be Temple head coach Dawn Staley said. ''She
had one year of head coaching experience, none with pro athletes.
Over the years she had an understanding of how we approach the game
and how she wants the game played and we kind of met in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wanted things her way and she did, but we compromised in
some areas and she listened. It was an awesome relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner, who was an aide to VanDerveer with the 1996 gold medal
team, never looked at the lack of head coaching experience as a
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always believed in these players and I think the key was
they believed in me, too. That's a pretty good combination to start
with,'' she said. ''You work hard and have players who are making
sacrifices and are committed to what you're doing and that makes
all the difference. I feel very satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Those final seconds Saturday night, when Fortner could stop
roaming in front of the bench and start exchanging congratulations
with her players, were the most special of the three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was wonderful, a huge sense of relief, a huge sense of
pride,'' she said, her voice starting to break up just a bit. ''I
was so happy for the players. They're always coming up behind me
and saying 'Nell, don't worry about it, don't worry about it.' But
coaches worry. That's our job.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question if you win with these players you're
supposed to win and if you lose it's the coach's fault. That's a
tremendous amount of pressure, especially playing on a contender's
home court. I can't tell you how much I believe in these players
and how good they are. It's been a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner seemed most emotional talking about five-time Olympian
Teresa Edwards and Staley, her point guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a player-coach relationship is believing in each other
and a coach has a different relationship with their point guards,''
she said. ''With those two, they're the ones you've got to run it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   And she did.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think coaches, when they prepare for something as big as
this, they second-guess themselves, you know, the type of team,
what offense to run, things like that,'' Staley said. ''But 'T' and
I had a talk with her just to reassure her that what she put in
will work. You just have to let the machine run its course and she
listened and let us do that.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Michael Johnson and Marion Jones
wrapped up their Olympics the same way they started them: in
spectacular sprints to gold-medal finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The two American track icons shared the wealth on the medal
stands Saturday, both joined by their teammates in the 1,600-meter
relay. And there was more gold for the United States: The U.S.
women's basketball team successfully defended its Olympic gold, and
the men's 400-meter relay team finished first.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. track team, it started and finished with Jones, who
thrived in the Sydney spotlight. She leaves Australia with three
golds and two bronzes -- falling short of her goal of five golds but
still becoming the first woman to capture five medals in a single
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She also became the first woman since Florence Griffith Joyner
in 1988 to win three track golds in one games. And she did most of
it while shrugging off allegations that her husband, shot putter
C.J. Hunter, had used steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the 100- and 200-meter sprints, took a bronze in the
long jump and a bronze in the 400-meter relay, then closed out
Saturday with a gold in the 1,600 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ran a spectacular third leg, moving from second place into
a comfortable 15-meter lead before handing off to anchor Latasha
Colander-Richardson. Though not usually a 400-meter runner -- and
with no desire to be one -- Jones shared with individual 400
champion Cathy Freeman the distinction of having the fastest leg of
any runner in the relay final.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a couple of days, when I look back, I'll probably feel
these were successful games,'' Jones said. ''I wanted to win them
all, without a doubt, and I still think it's possible. But I
didn't, so I'm not going to dwell on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in his farewell Olympic appearance, anchored the men's
1,600 relay team to capture his fifth gold medal over three Summer
Games. Across an amazing career, Johnson has won nothing but gold --
five Olympic and nine world championship medals.
</P>
<P>
   He earlier won the 400 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Led by 100-meter champion Maurice Greene on the anchor leg, the
Americans won the men's 400-meter relay -- but the four-man team
drew more attention with their-post race antics, an assortment of
WWF-style poses and muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1,500 meters, Suzy Favor Hamilton's bid to become the
first American medalist in the event ended when she collapsed about
75 meters from the finish line and finished last. Suffering from
dehydration, she was taken off the track in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyan, the first legally blind athlete to compete in the
Olympics, took the lead early in the race because she was
frustrated with the pace but wound up eighth -- ''which the first
time around is not bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, I'm going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   With one day left in the Sydney Games, the Americans were poised
to collect the most medals, leading the pack with 90 (38 gold, 22
silver, 30 bronze). Running second was Russia with 77 (28-24-25),
followed by China's 59 (28-16-15).

</P>
<P>
   The U.S. hoopsters faced host Australia before a rabid crowd
eager to see the gold medal come home -- and sent the locals home
disappointed. The Americans, winners of the Atlanta Games, took
their second straight gold with a 76-54 thrashing of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played hard, we played great,'' U.S. center Lisa Leslie
said. ''We knew we could do it, but it's still an amazing feeling
to do it on someone else's homecourt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans won with rebounding and defense, holding Australia
to 31 percent shooting while winning the battle of the boards
48-27. Leslie and Natalie Williams led the Americans with 15 points
each, while Yolanda Griffith added 13 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women led by 13 at halftime, and quickly answered
Australia's one second-half run to put the game away. The U.S. team
has now won the last two Olympics and the 1998 world championships.

<HEADLINE> No Medal for Diver Mark Ruiz  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mark Ruiz put on a smile for family and
friends as he pulled himself from the water one last time. The
scoreboard flashed 9s and 9.5s -- his best dive of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But that final flourish couldn't mask the disappointment of
leaving Sydney without a medal hanging from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, I'm a little depressed,'' said Ruiz, whose first
Olympics ended with a sixth-place finish Saturday in the 10-meter
platform. ''I'm not the kind of guy who's going to come in here and
say no matter what I do, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old came down under carrying the weight of his
native Puerto Rico, his adopted home in America and the mother who
gave up everything so he could have a better life.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a medal. He wanted it soooo bad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he settled for a pair of seventh-place finishes in
3-meter springboard and synchronized platform before placing well
behind a 1-2 Chinese rout in the last diving event of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shouldn't be upset,'' Ruiz said. ''I did pretty well. But I
am upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Tian Liang outlasted teammate Hu Jia in a battle of perfect 10s
to win the platform, completing another stunning performance by the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   They became the first country to win five diving gold medals,
adding five silvers just to drive home their complete dominance
over the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   China's acrobatic army captured three of the four individual
events, just as it had done at the last two Olympics. The medal
count reached record numbers because the program was expanded from
four to eight events this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were awesome,'' American coach Jay Lerew said. ''When
they're on their game, they're unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruiz thought he could compete with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-time U.S. champion, he drew the obvious comparisons to Greg
Louganis after becoming the first diver since the great one to
qualify for both individual men's events at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz lost his edge when matched against the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young and inexperienced,'' Lerew said. ''He needs more
experience. He can do the dives as well as the rest of them. He
just needs a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Puerto Rico, Ruiz spent a lot of time at a river
near his home, jumping from rocks and trees. His mother took him
for swimming lessons, but he wouldn't stay in the pool. All he
wanted to do was jump in.
</P>
<P>
   A career was born.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Torres gave up her home and business to bring her youngest
son to the Unites States when he was only 13. They wound up in
Orlando, Fla., sharing a one-bedroom apartment that was close to a
pool where he could train.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was born to be a diver,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz wanted to do well to repay his mother for all the
sacrifices she made. He also felt the tug from both his adopted and
native lands, fully aware that both were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I let myself down and I let my country down,'' he said. ''I
wanted to bring home this medal for the United States and Puerto
Rico. I let them both down.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone. The Americans captured only one medal -- Laura
Wilkinson's surprising gold in the women's platform -- and left
Sydney with their lightest haul since 1912, excluding the boycotted
Moscow Games.
</P>
<P>
   David Pichler of Butler, Pa., who finished ninth in the
10-meter, said a lack of financial support has left the Americans
playing catch-up in a sport they once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing they can do is take care of us a little bit,'' the
32-year-old said. ''I have to work 30 hours a week just to dive.''
</P>
<P>
   The government-supported Chinese showed their depth with the 1-2
finish in platform. Hu, only 17, was a late replacement for an
injured teammate and wound up with silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very satisfied,'' said coach Zhang Ting, wearing a Mao
badge on his T-shirt. ''To get so many golds in an Olympics is
quite hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese dominated from start to finish -- Tian winning with
724.53 points, Hu next at 713.55. Defending champion Dmitry Sautin
of Russia earned bronze with 679.26, his fourth medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I see my Chinese colleagues, I see a certain
consistency to their performance,'' said Sautin, a three-time
Olympian. ''I find it more and more difficult to compete with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For comparisons' sake, Ruiz had 625.92 points after pulling off
his best dive at the end. Pichler totaled 616.17 to finish three
places lower than he did on platform in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diving is so deep around the world now,'' Lerew said. ''Every
year, it gets deeper and deeper.''

<HEADLINE> Gold-Medal Defeats Turn Ugly for US  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A remarkably good Olympics for the U.S.
freestyle wrestlers turned ugly with two gold-medal losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sammie Henson, who said he wasn't interested in a silver medal,
got exactly that by losing 5-4 at 119 pounds Saturday to the
wrestler he beat for the 1998 world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he sobbed uncontrollably on the mat and during the
medal ceremony, he was jeered by a crowd that felt he was an
ungracious loser.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Slay's complaint after losing 4-0 at 167&AMP;frac12; pounds: He
wasn't allowed to wrestle at all.
</P>
<P>
   Slay also was jeered -- much more loudly than Henson -- when he
wouldn't shake the hand of referee Borje Schoug of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The losses clearly upset not only the wrestlers but their
coaches, who had seen the U.S. team win 12 consecutive matches in
Sydney. Four more Americans could win medals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys work six, seven, 10 years to get here and they take
a lot of pride in winning gold medals,'' U.S. co-coach John Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a two-time Olympic champion, even wondered if there was
an anti-American bias at work, intentional or not.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States was on good roll, it was obvious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, of St. Charles, Mo., fell behind Namig Abdullayev of
Azerbaijan 3-0 with 45 seconds gone and never recovered. Henson
rallied to tie it, but Abdullayev scored the winning point with a
reversal at 4:27 of the 6-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullayev found a particularly useful way to fight off Henson,
repeatedly pulling on the straps of Henson's singlet. The trick is
not permitted by the rules, but referee Abbass Namazian of Iran did
not stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be a point for grabbing the clothes -- he was
blocking his moves -- but they didn't call it,'' Smith said. ''We
needed that (penalty) point, and we didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Alexander Leipold got his first three points on
penalties against Slay, with the other coming after Slay began
taking desperate chances to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe politics is a part of this sport, and it's
unfortunate what happened,'' Slay said. ''It's unfortunate when you
give your all to win and it's taken out of your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The match changed as Slay and Leipold locked into the clinch
that starts the second period when there is no score. As they began
to lock up, Slay apparently did not position his shoulder the way
the referee wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I let him get locked and then I locked, and then he (Leipold)
starts whining and crying like a baby that he can't get his hands
locked,'' Slay said. ''He was acting to the officials, hoping they
would give him points, and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   After several seconds, the referee abruptly stopped, cautioned
Slay and called him for an illegal hold, giving Leipold a 2-0 lead.
Leipold was later given another point when Slay was cautioned
again, apparently for grabbing Leipold's hands as the German
applied a gut wrench.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's frustrating is I felt he couldn't beat me,'' Slay said.
''But I never got the chance to wrestle him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the early rounds of the Olympics, when results can be
protested and frequently are, there can be no protests of
medal-round matches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunday is my last day on the job, and I can honestly say I'm
happy and it's because of situations like this,'' said Bruce
Burnett, who is leaving the U.S. freestyle team to coach at Navy.
''I saw a lot of points being put up and not a lot being scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Leipold was elated to get a gold medal virtually nobody expected
him to win. He has been unable to beat Russia's four-time world
champion, Bouvaissa Saitiev, but he was eliminated by Slay in pool
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can come back and win two gold medals,'' Leipold said,
referring to Slay, who turns 25 in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Slay didn't especially like that comment, saying, ''Who knows
where I'll be in four years, or eight? I came here to win this gold
medal, tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Deactivate PK Daluiso  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Giants kicker Brad Daluiso won't
play Sunday because of a bad back, and New York signed Jaret Holmes
for the game against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt it was too risky to see if Brad was going to be OK
for tomorrow's game,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said Saturday. ''His
back still concerns me, and I couldn't take that chance. We are
going to leave Brad at home so he can take the next two or three
days to try to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Daluiso, who missed the final 10 games of last season because of
a knee injury, experienced tightness in his back on Wednesday. He
sat out of drills on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was waived by the Chicago Bears before the start of the
season. He was on the Bears' and Giants' practice squads last
season before being signed to the Bears' active roster Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Holmes, the Giants waived linebacker Kevin
Lewis. He made the team as a free agent but he had not been active
for any game.

<HEADLINE> Russia Gets Gold in Rhythmic Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Russians won by a ribbon. And a
club.
</P>
<P>
   Russia edged Belarus for the gold medal Saturday in the rhythmic
gymnastics group competition, winning in a tiebreaker. Both teams
finished with 39.500 points, but Russia won because its highest and
lowest scores -- thrown out in the initial scoring -- were better.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus, which finished sixth at the Atlanta Olympics, got the
silver.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, the silver medalist at last year's world championships,
had to settle for the Olympic bronze after dropping a club in the
first event. The Greeks actually topped both Russia and Belarus in
the second event, hoop and ribbon, but it wasn't enough to overcome
their early mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really wanted gold,'' said Anna Pollatou of Greece.
''However, we will aim for gold in Athens in 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States didn't qualify for either group or the
individual event. The individual all-around final is Sunday, and
world champion Alina Kabaeva of Russia is favored.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are three-time world champions, but they could
manage only the bronze medal four years ago when the group
competition made its Olympic debut. They were determined to do
better this time.
</P>
<P>
   They strutted onto the floor for their first event with an
attitude, the clubs, and the outfits to match. They wore
dominatrix-like costumes, with their leotard tops trimmed in silver
to look like bustiers and oval cut-outs all the way up their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Performing to the funky beat of ''The Matrix,'' they tossed
their clubs high in the air while contorting their bodies in shapes
not seen since Gumby. With sultry dance steps they moved in perfect
unison and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians scored a 19.800 for the clubs, the same as Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   In the second event, a combination of the hoops and ribbons, the
Belarussians flitted across the floor like little girls on a
playground. As four team members pulled three ribbons taut in a
crisscross, the fifth threw a hoop high in the air, letting it drop
gently down onto the ribbons and bounce back up again.
</P>
<P>
   They threw hoops to each other across the floor, deftly catching
the whirling orbs as they balanced on tiptoe. With ribbons swirling
above their heads, they twisted and turned with ease, but it wasn't
enough to top the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia was instrumental in initiating the group
performances,'' said Valentina Ivanizkaya, a Russian assistant
coach. ''It was their dream to win.''

<HEADLINE> US Quiets Fans With Win Over Aussies  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- There's been bad blood between these
teams since Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians had been laying for the Americans ever since
losing to them twice at the 1996 Summer Games and settling for the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   This time they vowed it would be different. Their terms, their
turf, their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Their gold? No way.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a perfect Olympic tournament that was far more
challenging than the romp through Atlanta in 1996, the United
States beat Australia 76-54 Saturday to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did it with their usual combination of quickness,
depth and strong inside play, knocking Australia off its game early
and taking the crowd out of it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to stifle the crowd at the beginning,'' Natalie
Williams said. ''We knew that if we got a good lead, they would
quiet down.''
</P>
<P>
   A 15-point lead in the first half did the trick and ruined what
the Australians had hoped would be their finest moment in
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Fans roared from the moment their beloved Opals first appeared.
They waved flags and held signs. Several Australian athletes shed
their shirts and painted their chests. It was like the Cameron
Crazies from Duke had gone Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the U.S. players were surprised. Fans had cheered for
their opponents throughout the tournament and even booed the
Americans at times. When the United States beat South Korea in the
semifinals on Friday, you would have thought the game was in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all cheering for Korea and we knew there weren't
that many Koreans here,'' Sheryl Swoopes said. ''But we expected
that. That's what makes it fun and exciting. That's what you work
for.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the only cheers were coming from the small band of
U.S. fans led by the players' families and Dream Teamers Alonzo
Mourning and Vince Carter, who had draped himself with an American
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played hard, we played great,'' Lisa Leslie said. ''We knew
we could do it, but it's still an amazing feeling to do it on
someone else's homecourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia got a strong game from 19-year-old Lauren Jackson, who
had 20 points and 13 rebounds. But by herself she was no match for
the U.S. post trio of Leslie, Williams and Yolanda Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie was too quick, Williams and Griffith too strong. Williams
and Leslie each scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds.
Griffith added 13 points and 12 rebounds. Swoopes scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt if I got low and on the block, I could turn and
score,'' said Williams, an explosive jumper with a wide body.
''They were trying to double team, but a few times I got
one-on-ones and I felt there was nothing they could do to stop me
inside. I wanted it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was loosely officiated and players often banged into
each with nothing called. Swoopes and Australia's Kristi Harrower
jawed briefly as they walked off the floor at halftime and the
crowd booed when Griffith and Michele Timms got tangled up near the
U.S. basket and tumbled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   With about 5 minutes left, Leslie lost her braided hair
extension and accused Jackson of pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all right. She can have the hair,'' Leslie said. ''I
have the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''My fingers got caught as I went for the ball,'' she said. ''It
certainly wasn't intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   The hair caper aside, this one belonged to the United States
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, who had left the South Korea game with a sore knee,
scored the team's first three baskets and fed Nikki McCray for the
fourth. Everyone should be so sore.
</P>
<P>
   The United States led 26-18 after Griffith and Williams
converted back-to-back three-point plays. Leslie finished a 9-0 run
with five straight points to make it 35-23, and Griffith's jumper
put the Americans up 43-28. That was the plan: jump on the
Australians early and don't let them up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to,'' said Teresa Edwards, who collected her fourth
gold medal in her fifth and final Olympics. ''We were on their
floor. We were on a foreign court. We had to go at them and hope
the game went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia got the lead down to seven early in the second half
and trailed 53-45 with 13:44 left, still plenty of time to make a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. Williams had five points and an assist a 7-0 run that
took the lead to 60-45 and it was never below 13 after that. The
United States was pulling away at the end, and then the celebration
began.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith rushed into the stands to hug her 11-year-old daughter,
Candace. Dawn Staley grabbed the flag from Carter and draped it
over her shoulders as she paraded around the court, then handed it
off and turned cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie also found a flag to wear and other players waved smaller
flags on sticks, DeLisha Milton strutting and gyrating as she held
hers. They had come straight out of the WNBA season and gone 8-0
over a tough two weeks. A little dancing was in order.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was definitely our best performance,'' Leslie said. ''We
had to go out and make it an ugly game for Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. But oh so beautiful for the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pressure on Boxers Juarez, Williams  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- For Rocky Juarez and Ricardo Williams
Jr., a lot more than just an Olympic gold medal is at stake when
they enter the ring for Sunday's boxing finals.
</P>
<P>
   Professional riches await, but only if the medal is gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing people remember is the gold. No one remembers
if you win silver or bronze,'' U.S. coach Tom Mustin said.
</P>
<P>
   The $15,000 that U.S. Olympic officials pay for a gold is nice,
but for boxing gold medalists there's a real pot of gold in their
future. Oscar De La Hoya found that out when he cashed in as the
only American boxing gold medalist in 1992. Four years later, David
Reid guaranteed himself millions when he knocked out a Cuban to win
his gold.
</P>
<P>
   In back-to-back gold medal fights Sunday, Juarez takes on Bekzat
Sattarkhanov of Kazakstan at 125 pounds and Williams fights
Mahamadkadyz Abdullaev of Uzbekistan at 139 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of promoters and would-be managers will be in the
stands watching to see if Juarez and Williams have what it takes to
sell tickets as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they (promoters) have been talking to them
already or not,'' Mustin said. ''I hope not, because it can be a
distraction. But we can't watch these guys 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxers are prohibited from signing with promoters while still
fighting for the U.S. team. But all bets are off the minute a gold
medal goes around the neck of an American boxer.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya parlayed his gold into a pro career that has seen him
earn more than $100 million. Reid got a $1 million signing bonus
after winning his gold in Atlanta, and has made millions more in
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Five other Americans won bronze medals in Atlanta, and faced a
tougher time making money. One of them, Floyd Mayweather Jr., is
now a champion and making good purses but even he had to start with
small money fights because he didn't have a gold.
</P>
<P>
   Williams may have the tougher road. He's fighting the 1999 world
champion in Abdullaev, who beat Williams 11-4 when the two met in
the second round of the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the fight I've been waiting for my whole life,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez hasn't lost in 68 fights over a period of two years, and
has fought relentlessly throughout the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This game is just whoever wants it more,'' Juarez said. ''I
can't imagine anyone wanting it more than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield, who knows a bit about fighting as a pro,
believes Juarez has a big future in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fights like a pro now,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin said it can be more difficult for U.S. boxers to keep
focused on the Olympics when many are already looking into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. boxers will end up with only four medals in Sydney, and it
will be up to Williams and Juarez if the team will increase its
lone gold medal counts from the previous Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''For other countries, their sole purpose is to win a medal for
their country,'' Mustin said. ''A lot of times our guys may look
past the medal because they may have offers already.''

<HEADLINE> Arabs Express Anger Over Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab leaders criticized Israel on Saturday
for deadly clashes in Palestinian areas, while Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon and Egyptian university students vented their anger and
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Four Palestinian groups in Syria that oppose peacemaking with
Israel also renewed their calls for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to scrap efforts to negotiate peace with Israel in favor of
armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people, who have been breast-fed with love of martyrdom
and grew up among bullets and deadly bombs, are always ready to
fight their enemy,'' the Islamic militant group Hamas said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was in Egypt, where he briefed President Hosni Mubarak,
Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid and the European
Union's Mideast envoy, Miguel Moratinos on the three days of
violence that has left 18 Palestinians dead and injured more than
500 people.
</P>
<P>
   A general strike and day of mourning was observed in Lebanon's
13 refugee camps, home to many of the 400,000 Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon. Shops and schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes began Thursday moments after Ariel Sharon, leader of the
Likud party, visited Haram as-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary -- a
site also holy to Jews as Temple Mount -- to show Israel's control
over the area. The mosque compound is the third-holiest site in
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Mubarak spoke by
telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and ''expressed
his anger'' over the violence. ''What is needed is self
restraint,'' Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel-Meguid said the 22 ambassadors to the Cairo-based league
would meet in emergency session Sunday to discuss the clashes in
east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said Arafat
requested the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly condemn the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, whose
provocative actions led to this bloodshed,'' Abdel-Meguid told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel-Meguid said Moratinos, the EU envoy, told him he will
discuss the situation with European and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu-Ragheb warned the region could
be experiencing ''a new cycle of violence that might be difficult
to control.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement carried by Jordan's Petra news agency, Abu-Ragheb
condemned Israeli soldiers for firing on stone-throwers after
Friday prayers at the mosque compound.
</P>
<P>
   ''These actions harm the feelings of Arabs and Muslims,'' he
said. ''We condemn the atrocious crime that was committed by
Israeli soldiers against innocent worshippers in Haram as-Sharif.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's most prominent opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood
Movement, urged the government to ''cease all dealings with the
(Israeli) enemy and dismiss its ambassador in Jordan as a step
toward canceling the (1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace) treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, Prime Minister Salim Hoss praised the rioters in
''occupied Palestine'' and called on the world to ''work for an
immediate halt to the Israeli aggression against Arab Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Ein El-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp,
1,000 youths carrying Palestinian flags marched, shouting: ''We
live for Palestine! We die for Palestine!'' Palestinian guerrillas
trampled the Israeli flag.
</P>
<P>
   In Alexandria, Egypt, police said 5,000 students, many carrying
banners reading ''Jerusalem is Islamic,'' demonstrated on campuses
in the Mediterranean port city.

<HEADLINE> Hungary-Russia Water Polo a Rematch  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hungary and Russia hope their
gold-medal match Sunday is remembered for grace and talent, not the
fear and horror seen in an Australian pool 44 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic men's water polo final matches the two nations that
gave the sport its most infamous moment at the Melbourne Games --
the gashed face of Hungary's Ervin Zador, pool water mixing with
his blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was another time,'' Hungary's Tamas Kasas said Saturday
after his team defeated Yugoslavia 8-7 to advance to its first
final since 1972. ''There's not really any other explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That match came soon after the Soviet Union crushed Hungary's
revolt. Zador, now living in California, says the game was a chance
for his teammates to fight for their people.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians, Zador said, would frustrate the Russians with
harsh words and physical play. The goal was as much athletic -- to
win a gold medal for Hungary -- as political, Zador said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got out of control,'' Zador said by phone last month.
</P>
<P>
   The match was stopped with Hungary ahead 4-0 as fans left the
stands to surround railings near the pool. Police escorted the
Russian team to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the world was shocked by the pictures of Zador's wounds.
Water polo, a sport known for its brutality, gained an even more
chilling reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard for anyone who saw it to forget,'' Zador said.
</P>
<P>
   The game's legend is strong in Australia, whose people seem as
fascinated with the contest as repelled, Australian women's coach
Istvan Gorgenyi said. ''They want to discuss it, all the time,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   This latest match, though, will likely be a joyful one with few
hard feelings by the losers, Russian coach Alexander Kabanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is for both nations' return to water polo's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year is 2000,'' said Hungarian coach Denes Kemeny. ''The
difficulty we face is the strength of the Russian team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary holds an Olympic-record six water polo golds. But its
program has faltered in international competition the past two
decades. Its last gold was in 1976, and its last medal was a bronze
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary rebounded from an earlier tournament loss to Yugoslavia
in its 8-7 semifinal victory. ''I think we beat the best team in
the Olympics,'' Hungary's Kasas said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was also a water polo superpower as the Soviet Union. It
won gold in 1972 and 1980, then earned consecutive bronze medals in
1988 as the Soviet Union and in 1992 as the Unified Team.
</P>
<P>
   The crumbling Soviet republic splintered its water polo talent,
a pool Kabanov is finally refilling.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians ended Spain's gold-medal defense with a thrilling
9-8 sudden-death victory Saturday. The teams played nearly 18
minutes of scoreless water polo until Dmitri Gorchkov scored on an
outside shot with 9:55 gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gorchkov says his only motivation is Olympic success. ''We'll be
playing the same tomorrow,'' he said. ''It's not possible to play
better.''

<HEADLINE> Winners &AMP; losers as E-ZPass, toll hike debut on N.J. Turnpike  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Saturday was a day of winners and losers
on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Daniel was a winner. Out with his family on a gorgeous fall
morning for a trip to New York, he was able to sail through the
toll booths unobstructed, saving at least 20 minutes on his drive
because he had an E-ZPass tag attached to his windshield on the
first day the Turnpike began using the electronic toll collection
system.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius Wade was one of the day's losers. An independent
long-haul trucker, he found himself hit with a steep toll hike that
will further eat into the meager earnings he says he's able to
scrape out. Saturday was also the first day of the Turnpike's
so-called ''variable pricing'' toll schedule, in which increases of
20 percent for cars and 13 percent for trucks took effect.
</P>
<P>
   But cars with E-ZPass that avoid entering the Turnpike during
the peak hours of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4:30 to 6 p.m. won't have to pay
an increase. During peak hours and weekends, the increase for these
vehicles will be 8 percent. Trucks with E-ZPass will pay an 8
percent increase regardless of when they use the toll road. It was
the first phase of a multistage increase that will eventually raise
tolls by 37 percent for cash customers, and 18 percent for E-ZPass
users by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there was confusion on the road as motorists
zigged and zagged, trying to end up in the correct lane, trying to
figure out how much they'd have to pay based on what time it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take some getting used to on the part of the
public,'' said Lynn Fleeger, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority. ''For 50 years, there was only one way to pay
tolls, and that was with cash. Now there's different options.''
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPass went online about 4 a.m. By 11 a.m., it had already
processed 36,000 transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going very well,'' Fleeger said. ''From a system
standpoint, it's performing extremely well. There's still some
confusion out there on the part of motorists, but we're pleased
with the way the transactions are going.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Daniel. The Wilmington, Del., man was out with his family
on a trip to New York, loving the speed with which he sailed
through the entrance tolls at Exit 1 near the Delaware Memorial
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it,'' he said during a quick stopover at the Grover
Cleveland rest area just north of Exit 11 in Woodbridge. ''I'm
thrilled they started using it. You can go all the way from
Delaware to New York state now without having to dig for change or
take out your wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes things so fast,'' said Judy Aldeghi of Haddon
Heights. ''It probably saves you 5 or 10 minutes on each trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But those without E-ZPass were less chipper Saturday. Lines of
30 or more vehicles queued up in front of some cash-only toll
booths, while drivers seethed as they watched E-ZPass-equipped cars
zip right by them.
</P>
<P>
   ''At Exit 12 in Carteret, it's terrible,'' said Darlene DeBerry,
who lives in Carteret. ''It backs up halfway down the Turnpike
sometimes. I'm going to tell my son and my boyfriend to get
(E-ZPass). It might save you 20 minutes of waiting in traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   And the toll hike wasn't winning any plaudits, either. Wade, the
independent trucker from Bridgeport, Conn., was so angry he could
hardly speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jersey is getting as bad as New York,'' he fumed. ''They
should chop it off and let it drift off in the water. This is
another nightmare, especially with what us truckers have to go
through.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tolls are too high to start with,'' he said. ''We're forced to
use this road every day because we've been forced off the smaller
roads. It makes it harder to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade said he paid about $200 a week before the toll increase
took effect, on top of $400 a week in fuel costs, plus maintenance
expenses for his two $155,000 trucks. Wade, who was hauling a load
of steel from Philadelphia to Massachusetts, vowed to try to avoid
the Turnpike as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't pass the increases on to your customers,'' he said.
''They don't want to hear it. They don't care that it costs me 13
percent more to drive this road now. They'll just say, 'Take a
different road; that's on you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another trucker who would not give his name said the higher
tolls would force him to break the law by carrying heavier loads
than permitted, and lying about it on his documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to make me become a bigger criminal, to load extra
weight and run illegal,'' he said. ''It costs X amount to run this
truck. If tolls go up, there's only one other place you can make up
for it. I think lots of other trucks are going to do the same
thing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turnpike will dedicate 120 lanes as permanent E-ZPass lanes,
and they'll stay in the same spots at toll plazas, Fleeger said. An
additional 41 can be added or removed as demand dictates. E-ZPass
lanes are marked by purple overhead signs with flashing yellow
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeger said there are no plans for now to add pavement markings
to help motorists line up for cash or E-ZPass lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see how our positioning works out first,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Men Clown During Anthem  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- ''Oh, say can you see'' is about to
become ''Did you see what they did?''
</P>
<P>
   So what should we make of the hugging, mugging, preening,
flexing, posing, clowning display by Maurice Greene and his posse --
Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams and Brian Lewis -- during the
national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ''look-at-me thing,'' the kind of thing too many
athletes do nowadays because they get paid and worshipped all out
of proportion for doing one thing exceptionally.
</P>
<P>
   Over the top?
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly.
</P>
<P>
   In poor taste?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Disrespectful?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   You would know that if you had seen the look on their faces the
moment it dawned on the four members of the gold medal-winning U.S.
men's 400-meter relay team how poorly their ''celebration'' was
going to be received in the States.
</P>
<P>
   That moment occurred during a news conference a half-hour after
the four collected their hardware, not long after a reporter read
back comments by Nanceen Perry, a member of the U.S. women's
400-meter relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Perry watched her compatriots' celebration on a TV screen a few
minutes after she'd stood on the same podium herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole way they were going about it, making all sorts of
comical faces -- you could do a little bit of that, but they were
doing it throughout the national anthem,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you expect anybody to respect our flag if you don't. I
think foreigners think we're rude, anyway, so it just confirms the
whole image they have of us.''
</P>
<P>
   When first read back to Drummond, those remarks didn't quite
drain the bravado out of his face, or even his posture. Initially,
Drummond wasn't stunned enough to quit the annoying habit of
discussing himself in the third person.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Drummond never won an Olympic gold before,'' Drummond
said, ''so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Drummond was slouching when he said this, but then Greene,
sitting to his right, came across with an apology that sounded
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry,'' Greene said, his voice even, ''if we offended
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who knows Greene knows how hard it must have been to get
those few words out.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is irritating on good days, so much of a peacock that his
vanity plates back home read ''MO GOLD.'' He woofs and talks so
much trash that even his pal and training partner, Ato Boldon of
Trinidad, often shakes his head at the crazy things that come out
of Greene's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But Boldon also knows, better than the rest of us, this is how
some men pump themselves up to run 100 meters in less than 10
seconds in front of 110,000 screaming people -- when years of hard
work can be undone by one false step.
</P>
<P>
   And once Drummond realized Greene was on the level, he sat
straight up and tried to explain how it felt to get it all right --
and win.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have a lot of emotion bottled up,'' Drummond said. ''Your
focus is on one thing for so long. When we finally have that
opportunity to exhale, we're just expressing ourselves the way we
know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams sat to Greene's right and Lewis to the right of him.
Apparently, Greene's apology covered them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing that, because this is a fight these guys will never
win. People back home will see them for a few moments on TV and
think what Michael Johnson and a whole lot of their elders here
did.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has an ugly feud already going with Greene and he didn't
actually see the celebration, probably because he was preparing for
his own trip to the medals podium.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for accounts to get back to him. Or for
Johnson to pass judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that what you all saw, that I didn't see, is a
product, another product of that immaturity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a contributing factor, no doubt. But this wasn't
Roseanne Barr singing the national anthem before a baseball game in
San Diego, spitting and grabbing her crotch like a ballplayer. And
it wasn't a political statement, a black-gloved, black power salute
by John Carlos and Tommie Smith on the podium in Mexico City in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   This was four guys letting off nervous energy. Four guys who
should have been able to find a less provocative way to do it. They
couldn't. Still, bad taste isn't a capital offense.
</P>
<P>
   All that needs to be said was said by Antonio Pettigrew, another
member of the 1,600 relay team with Johnson. Asked what advice he
had for Lewis, the youngest member of the 400 crew, Pettigrew
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would say to Bernard is, 'Sometimes, don't get caught
up in the moment. You represent the U.S.A. It's a bigger spectrum
than here. It's all around the world.''

<HEADLINE> Priest Attacks Ill. Abortion Clinic  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) -- A Catholic priest smashed his car into an
abortion clinic Saturday morning, then chopped at the building with
an ax until the owner fired two shotgun blasts to stop him, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic was not open and nobody was injured in the attack,
which came just two days after federal approval of the abortion
pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   The man drove through a door at the Abortion Access Northern
Illinois Women's Center around 8:15 a.m. He was swinging an ax when
the clinic's owner fired a 12-gauge shotgun twice. He did not hit
the man.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Earl, 32, was arrested and charged with burglary
and felony criminal damage to property, said Deputy Police Chief
Dominic Iasparro. Earl was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Iasparro would not comment on statements Earl made to police
about a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion providers usually are on alert for violence following
abortion-related events in the news, such as this week's approval
of RU-486 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Vicki
Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't received any specific threats, but anytime abortion
is in the headlines we issue an alert to our clinics to take
precautions because there is the potential for increased
violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockford clinic is not one of the NAF's 360 member
facilities, but ''it's just kind of common sense that clinics would
be on alert,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl did not reach the clinic offices with the ax, so damage was
confined to the exterior overhead door he crashed through and
woodwork in a hallway, Iasparro said.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic houses the office of Dr. Richard Ragsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said there have been vocal protests outside the clinic
during the past four or five months, but he said he had not noticed
Earl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised that something happened on the heels of the
RU-486 announcement,'' he said. ''But this is a little more violent
than we were expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said the clinic will open as scheduled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale filed a landmark 1983 lawsuit challenging Illinois
abortion restrictions, contending that they required doctors
performing abortions to conduct their practices in buildings that
in effect are hospitals. Under a settlement that was upheld by the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1990, women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant may
undergo abortions in clinics, while those beyond that term require
full-service surgical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rockford is located about 85 miles northwest of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Va. Parking Decks Probed After Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Officials have ordered safety
inspections of the city's older parking structures after a car
plunged off the top deck of a hotel parking garage this week,
killing four vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   The city had said owners were responsible for checking their
parking decks.
</P>
<P>
   ''But after careful consideration, this is the way we think it
ought to be done,'' Planning Director Robert Scott said. ''We feel
a response from the city is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   The four women killed Sunday worked as nurses at New York's St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. Their car crashed through a
3-foot retaining wall at the Sandcastle Resort Hotel, flipped and
landed on its roof 41 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   The top floor of the Sandcastle's parking garage did not have
wheel guards, a requirement when the parking garage was built 15
years ago, according to the Illinois-based Building Officials and
Code Administrators International, or BOCA.
</P>
<P>
   BOCA drafts construction codes that carry the force of law in
Virginia and many other states. Cities and counties are charged
with enforcing the standards.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sandcastle refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Maddox, chairman of the Resort Leadership Council, which
represents a large faction of Oceanfront district businesses, said
hotel owners and managers would support ''anything and everything
it would take to create a safe environment.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Researchers Back From Arctic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's continental shelf may be bigger than
previously believed, researchers said Saturday upon return from the
country's first major state-sponsored expedition to the Arctic Sea
since the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   The ship Academic Fyodorov returned Saturday to the northern
port of Murmansk after a six-week journey, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kryukov, director of the state-run company that led the
expedition, said the results of research in the area of the
Mendeleyev rise ''could be a serious argument for expanding
Russia's continental shelf'' by more than 480,000 square miles,
pending U.N. approval, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Kryukov said the ship studied areas that previous researchers
had not been able to reach, and that it was Russia's first such
large-scale expedition in nine years. The report did not explain
what the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is already the world's largest country in land mass.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was sponsored by the Defense Ministry, the Natural
Resources Ministry and the state Meteorological Agency.

<HEADLINE> African Triangle May Get Troops  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- West African peacekeeping troops may
soon be deployed along the borders of Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Guinea to prevent war in the increasingly tense triangle, Sierra
Leone's vice president said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Joseph Denby said presidents of the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States were ''working on'' stationing
peacekeepers in the region to halt sporadic cross-border raids and
prevent an escalation of hostilities. No final decision had been
taken yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Denby made the remarks to journalists in Monrovia following
private talks with Liberian President Charles Taylor in Gbarnga,
some 125 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the three nations have chilled in recent weeks
and military activity along the borders have increased following a
crackdown by Guinea on hundreds of thousands of refugees who have
taken shelter in that country from wars in Liberia and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Denby did not reveal details of his discussions with Taylor but
said he delivered a special letter from Sierra Leone President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is satisfied with events in the subregion,'' Denby
said, adding that Taylor was ''happy to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinea accuses the refugees of being behind dissident attacks on
several Guinean villages while Liberia counters that one of its own
rebel groups uses rear bases in Guinea to stage attacks on northern
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Community of West African States has sent
peacekeepers to the past in both Liberia and Sierra Leone, where
some 13,000 U.N. troops are stationed to salvage a lapsed peace
agreement involving Sierra Leone's government and a notoriously
brutal rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Doctor Sought in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARTMOUTH, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Police have issued an arrest
warrant for a Dutch doctor who is accused of illegally storing
children's organs in a Canadian warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant was issued Friday after workers discovered eight
organs thought to belong to two 5-year-old children in a crate
abandoned at the facility two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, pathologist Dick van Velzen, was in the Netherlands
on Saturday. He is also the target of an inquiry into the
stockpiling of children's organs at a British university.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada said they were concerned about the way the
organs were stored, said Judy Pal, spokeswoman for the Halifax
police. They do not suspect foul play in the children's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way they were left there and the way he left them in the
hands of warehouse workers, we have some serious concerns,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is charged with indecent interference with a dead
body, which carries a five-year prison sentence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Velzen released a statement from The Hague saying he had
stored only human tissues in the Canadian warehouse, Pal said, and
would call Halifax police to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Van Velzen ran the pathology department at a Halifax children's
hospital for two years, until he was fired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry in Britain was launched in November 1999 after Alder
Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool learned that hundreds of
children's organs were being stored in a University of Liverpool
laboratory.

<HEADLINE> Floods Spur Italy State of Emergency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy (AP) -- Authorities declared a state of
emergency in Italy's southern region of Calabria on Saturday after
rain triggered scattered flooding and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated 400 people from homes in the town of
Bovalino, one of several villages in the region fully or partially
isolated by the rains and mud.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The inundation blocked highways and interrupted rail traffic
across the region, at one spot because of a collapsed pillar on a
railway trestle. Aviation officials briefly closed the airport in
the Calabria capital of Reggio Calabria.
</P>
<P>
   Rain caused trouble across much of northern and central Italy as
well Saturday, with a record 14 inches of rain in 24 hours reported
in the Piedmont region. High water flooded St. Mark's Piazza in
Venice.

<HEADLINE> At Least 130 Hurt in Miss Bus Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLIVE BRANCH, Miss. (AP) -- Two buses and a van carrying
Clark-Atlanta University students to an out-of-state football game
collided Saturday, sending at least 130 people to area hospitals,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed, and the injuries were not considered
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck occurred about 9 a.m. about 12 miles south of Memphis,
Tenn., Olive Branch Police Sgt. Bill Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said traffic had been slowed on the highway because
officers were cleaning up debris from an 18-wheeler crash that
occurred before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lead bus had to stop due to traffic. The second bus veered
to left to avoid an accident, but the third bus struck the van,
which in turn ran into the first bus,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles were carrying cheerleaders, university band
members, and fans traveling to Memphis for Clark-Atlanta's game
against Lane College on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police said those who were not hurt were placed on the second
bus to continue the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the accident was cleaned up about noon and the road
was re-opened.

<HEADLINE> Croat President Retires 7 Generals  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The president of Croatia retired seven
generals who were critical of the government's plan to prosecute
alleged war criminals. The country's former ruling party responded
Saturday by calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the 1991 war for independence from Yugoslavia joined
in the storm of criticism over President Stipe Mesic's move, which
followed an open letter by 12 active-duty and retired generals
criticizing cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Croatian Democratic Union, led by former
President Franjo Tudjman until his death in December last year,
denounced the government as ''communist and anti-Croat.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the government ''will be overthrown with the only
civilized weapon -- by the will of the people expressed in the
elections, this time early parliamentary elections, which have to
be called as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesic, who fired the seven active-duty generals Friday, brushed
off the Tudjman party, saying it ''obviously forgot that the power
can only be seized by democratic means.''
</P>
<P>
   All 12 were strong Tudjman's supporters and are regarded by some
here as war heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ivica Racan also dismissed the party statement,
saying that it ''is directed not only against this government, but
against all people of Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Croatian citizens gave their votes on Jan. 3 to this
government for the next four years,'' he said, reaffirming
determination to carry out reforms and establish the state of law.
</P>
<P>
   War veterans called on Mesic to reconsider the decision and said
they would support the generals ''now, as we did in the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The new government has tried to cooperate with the U.N. war
crimes tribunal and prosecute those accused of atrocities against
Serbs and Muslims during the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   However, senior officers and war veterans accuse the government
of shaming the nation's 1991 struggle for independence against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the government's moves erupted this month when
police arrested several Croats suspected of committing war crimes
against Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Ruling Frees Sex Offenders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Prison officials have released 170 rapists and
child molesters from parole, and 112 other sex offenders also could
be freed following a Colorado Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court threw out a 1993 mandatory parole law
because it conflicted with a 1979 measure that limited how long sex
offenders could be placed on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, 600 sex offenders sentenced from 1993 to 1998
to prison and parole will be released without having to serve
parole, Department of Corrections administrator Donna Thurlow said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 18 ruling came in the case of Vance Martin, who was
sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty in 1994
to sexual assault on a child. After two probation violations, he
was re-sentenced in 1997 to four years in prison and five years of
mandatory parole based on the 1993 law.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers said they would study the issue when the
Legislature convenes in January.

<HEADLINE> White House Urges Calm On Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration appealed for calm
Saturday in violence-wracked Jerusalem, saying that the highly
charged issue of the city's future must be solved ''at the
negotiating table and not in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen Palestinians were reported killed and 523 wounded as
Israeli police battled several gunmen and thousands of
rockthrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned about the violence,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Iceland, one stop in her European trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly counterproductive in the peace process. There is
danger of a cycle of violence developing. The talks are at a very
delicate stage and it is important that the violence stops.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had telephoned both Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in an
effort to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for the violence was a dispute over a bitterly
contested Jerusalem shrine sacred to Muslims and Jews. Six
Palestinians were killed and almost 200 were injured in clashes at
the compound on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, P.J. Crowley of the White House's National
Security Council said, ''We recognize that emotions are running
high but these remain issues that must be resolved at the
negotiating table and not in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. officials had been ''in touch with both sides at
the highest levels, urging them to do all that they can to work
together to restore calm.''

<HEADLINE> Truth is Elusive in Airline Death  </HEADLINE>
PAULINE ARRILLAGA and SHARON L. CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere behind the pale stone facade of the FBI building in
Salt Lake City, the transcript from a cockpit voice recorder and a
thick sheaf of interview notes hold clues to why a 19-year-old was
killed by fellow airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Jonathan Burton's mother decides to sue, she may never
know exactly what happened to her son aboard Southwest Airlines
Flight 1763 from Las Vegas. He went berserk and was pummeled,
wrestled into the aisle and held down so tight he couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the more Janet Burton has learned, the more she has
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Little about Burton's last hour alive is sure. What follows is
the best reconstruction possible to date, pieced together by The
Associated Press from interviews with passengers, police, the FBI,
airline officials, Burton's mother and sections of the autopsy
report she gave to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Airport police also supplied written statements from two
officers who met the flight at Salt Lake City International just
after 11 p.m. on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ, each influenced by vantage point, tainted by
media reports or confused by panic.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Burton was headed to Salt Lake to spend two weeks with
his aunt and uncle. It was a trip he and his older brothers had
made almost every summer since they were kids. During the week,
they'd work at their uncle's painting business. Water skiing and
hiking ruled the weekends. In more recent years, the brothers often
went separately, and this year, Burton was traveling alone.
</P>
<P>
   He was getting ready to start community college after taking a
year off. He had worked in housekeeping for a nursing home and last
year was voted employee of the month, but wiping floors got old. He
still wasn't sure what he wanted to do, but school would be a good
start.
</P>
<P>
   The evening he was leaving, the TV news carried something about
a plane crash. Mrs. Burton remembers saying it seemed like anytime
someone's about to get on a plane, they hear about something going
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah,'' her son said, ''isn't that something?''
</P>
<P>
   They headed for the airport and grabbed some tacos on the way.
Mrs. Burton waited with her son at the gate until he boarded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''See you in two weeks,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a new book about how to win at blackjack, Burton walked
onboard.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Adam Bradshaw jogged to the gate. His late flight from Burbank,
Calif., had almost cost him his Las Vegas connection to Salt Lake.
He was headed for a new job and didn't want to miss the flight.
Plus, he didn't have a seat assignment on Southwest, which does
things first-come, first-serve.
</P>
<P>
   Management consultant Dave Jennings, on his way home from
business in Los Angeles, found a seat two rows in front of Burton
and tucked his laptop between his feet. Dean Harvey, on vacation
from Canada, settled in near the front.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw found a spot toward the back. John Whitaker, on his way
home, was in an aisle seat nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:20 p.m., the Boeing 737 lifted off over the sparkling
lights of Las Vegas. It was behind schedule, but the captain said
he could make it up. He told the 121 passengers they'd be in Salt
Lake on time.
</P>
<P>
   The jet reached its cruising altitude, and the three flight
attendants began serving drinks. That's when Bradshaw first noticed
Burton, a young man in jeans and a T-shirt, wearing a baseball cap
backward. He had brown hair, a goatee -- and a frantic look.
</P>
<P>
   As a flight attendant was about to serve Bradshaw, Burton
strolled up, took a drink off the tray and returned to his seat
without a word. ''Away he went,'' Bradshaw said, ''kind of
self-serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendant told Burton he should have waited for
someone to take his order, but he didn't seem to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he was on his feet again, this time headed
to the rear. He rummaged through cabinets until he found the
peanuts, grabbed a couple packs and returned again to his seat.
Jennings recalls thinking the guy must work for Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifty-one-50,'' the man behind Bradshaw muttered. A television
news director, Bradshaw recognized the police catch phrase for
somebody mentally unstable. Bradshaw turned to his fellow passenger
and said, ''I wonder what we're in for.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes passed. Suddenly Burton got up and began pacing
the aisle. He walked all the way to the front, all the way to the
back, and then again toward the nose of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker thought he was looking for an open lavatory, but he
also saw the glassy, agitated look on Burton's face. He must really
have to go, Whitaker thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he walked past me, he was mumbling and he seemed
anxious,'' Whitaker said. ''He seemed stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Burton raised his voice and kicked the folding door to the
cockpit, hard. An emergency escape panel popped out and Burton
shoved his head and shoulders through the opening, muttering
something like, ''Fly this plane.'' People started to get scared.
</P>
<P>
   Six-feet-tall and about 190 pounds, Burton was muscular and
ruggedly good-looking, bearing a slight resemblance in some family
photographs to actor Brad Pitt. He had played baseball as a boy and
wrestled at Cheyenne High School. It showed.
</P>
<P>
   It ''looked like he was intent on going in there,'' said Harvey,
the Canadian. ''But it looked like the pilots were intent on
pushing him out.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is he going to do, Harvey wondered. Is he going to
pull out a weapon? Is he going to hijack the plane? What the hell
is going on?
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant urged Burton to calm down. Its unclear
whether he then returned to a seat alone or if passengers forced
him that way. In the end, a group of men surrounded him in an exit
row.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody yelled he was going for the handle. Men and women
scrambled over seats to get away. Children started screaming. A
flight attendant asked volunteers to stand in front of the broken
cockpit door.
</P>
<P>
   A few men hung on to Burton as he squirmed, then he seemed to
get a hold of himself and sat down. The curious peeked up over seat
backs to get a better look.
</P>
<P>
   ''Settle down, settle down, chill out,'' people told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stupid jerk,'' someone added.
</P>
<P>
   Burton still had a sort of spacey look on his face, and each
time one of his self-appointed guards glanced away, Burton wriggled
a little more.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane began its descent into Salt Lake, Burton exploded
again, jumping up, spitting on people and landing punches like he
knew how. Kids were shrieking, old women hid their eyes. Several
men fought with Burton. One wound up with a split lip. They grabbed
his arms and legs, stretched him out and mashed him on the floor.
Four guys stood or sat on his limbs.
</P>
<P>
   At some point the pilot came on the intercom, telling passengers
they were close to landing. He said he hoped all of them -- but one
-- would have a good weekend. Its unclear whether this came before
or after Burton's second outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings couldn't see very well but remembers seeing Burton on
the floor, sort of under a seat. He says some passengers were
yelling things like, ''Hurt him! Beat him up!''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were scared. It felt like he was taking over the plane,''
Jennings explained.
</P>
<P>
   Only he has publicly reported hearing shouts egging on a fight.
And only Harvey has given what may be the most disturbing part of
the story. He says that in the end, it wasn't Burton doing the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey remembers the young man being subdued as some passengers
continued to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't understanding why this was continuing,'' Harvey
said. ''He was basically 100 percent defenseless at this time. ...
I remember thinking no one can take a pounding like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey says he went down the aisle as a big man in black boots --
weighing as much as 260 pounds -- repeatedly kicked Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt this group, particularly this one man, was out of
control,'' Harvey said. ''He was stomping on Jonathan's chest, one
foot at a time, I don't know what the rest of the group was doing
other than holding him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey begged for it to stop, but finally returned to his seat
and told his companion, ''I think they're killing him back there.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   One of the first police officers to board the plane reported
finding Burton unconscious and bleeding from the mouth with a
''huge knot'' and ''discoloration'' on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The time is imprecise, somewhere between 11 and 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At first, FBI agent Bill Matthews thought he had gone into
cardiac arrest. Burton's behavior seemed consistent with drug use,
and his heart could have stopped if he was doped up enough to act
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It would be weeks before his mother learned her son had
suffocated as the other travelers restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   That night, police handcuffed the motionless body as people
warned Burton would fight if he came around. Paramedics tended to
bloody passengers and to Burton, but he was declared dead just
after midnight at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Airport police took passenger names, and some filled out written
forms for Southwest. Others left without talking to authorities.
Members of the flight crew went to a local hotel and had to be
brought back to the airport later that night for questioning by the
FBI. The airline has declined to make their names public.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rutherford, of Southwest, said the company cooperated
fully with authorities and believes crew members handled the
situation as well as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flight crew did absolutely what they thought was necessary
in response to Mr. Burton's behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results, some which were released to various news
outlets by Burton's family, showed signs of drug use, but
authorities don't think it was enough to cause the man's apparent
break with reality.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy also reportedly recorded that Burton had contusions
and abrasions on his torso, face and neck, and died after being
suffocated. The death has been ruled a homicide, but U.S. Attorney
Paul M. Warner has decided not to file charges. Warner issued a
statement saying the passengers acted in self-defense. He declined
to be interviewed by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burton says she can't understand any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That wasn't Jonathan. It's just nothing like Jonathan. He
would never go looking for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's just hoping someone else will come forward to help
her figure things out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can appreciate the fact of passengers being scared. If I'd
been a passenger, I would have been scared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Jonathan needed to be safely restrained. He should have
been in a Salt Lake City jail if he caused a problem on that plane.
They had no right to be judge, jury and executioner.''

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- It's become a sort of American Olympic
ritual: a trip to the gold medal stand followed by an appearance on
a cereal box.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg Co. announced Sunday (Saturday EDT) that it will put the
faces of four prominent U.S. gold medal winners on boxes of
breakfast cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinters Maurice Greene and Marion Jones and backstroke swimmer
Lenny Krayzelburg will join Tony the Tiger on boxes of Frosted
Flakes, while swimmer Jenny Thompson will be featured on boxes of
Crispix.
</P>
<P>
   All four had signed contracts with Kellogg before the Olympics --
preempting any plans General Mills might have had to lure them over
to the arch-rival Wheaties camp.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is an official supplier of the U.S. Olympic team through
the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.

   FIRST GOLD: The words had never been uttered before at an
Olympics. Maybe that's why the players weren't sure how to react.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gold medalists: Cameroon.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Olympic Stadium cheered, but the players on the
soccer team hesitated and looked at each other. Finally, they
realized that this was the moment they were supposed to step
forward onto the round, gold-colored podiums and accept their
medals from International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon won the Olympic soccer tournament Saturday, beating
Spain on penalty kicks after a 2-2 tie. Cameroon's Olympic history
had previously consisted of just two medals, both in boxing: a
silver in Mexico City in 1968 and a bronze in Los Angeles in 1984.
</P>

<P>
   AT LONG LAST: Bahamians waving flags and cheering in drenching
rain celebrated the country's first gold medal in 36 years and its
first in track and field with the women's 400 relay victory
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The race ended around 4:30 a.m. Bahamas time, but that did not
stop people from cheering ''We won!'' in the streets. Even police
officers in squad cars honked their horns and waved flags, waking
some people in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't care,'' Georgette Hall, a 23-year-old mother, said of
the early awakening. ''Every Bahamian should be proud of the girls.
They are our girls. We love all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamian team of Davis-Thompson, Sevetheda Fynes, Chandra
Sturrup and Debbie Ferguson finished with a time of 41.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas won its first -- and until Saturday, only -- gold
medal in sailing in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. When Davis-Thompson
took the 200 meter silver this week, islanders were proud but
showed little fanfare. The capture of the elusive gold brought fans
out into the rainy streets of Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard the national anthem playing on TV I cried like a
baby,'' said Marsha Johnson, a 33-year old banker. ''It was great
moment. I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. I am getting goosebumps
just talking about it.''
</P>

   CALL TO THE FLAGS: Olympics organizers on Saturday urged
Sydney residents not to steal thousands of flags hanging in the
city ahead of the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 of the colorful banners have been hung along
Sydney streets during the Olympics and are due to stay until after
the Oct. 18-29 Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair athlete Louise Sauvage said it would be a
disappointment if the banners had been stolen before the
Paralympics began. ''I remember arriving in Atlanta four years ago
after the Olympics ended and things had been pulled down and ripped
down,'' she said.
</P>

   DERAILED: A train derailment caused minor disruption late
Saturday on services to Olympic Park, with commuters having to wait
an extra 20 minutes for a ride to and from the main competition
sites.
</P>
<P>
   A train went off the tracks at the Flemington railyard in
western Sydney at 7 p.m (4 a.m. EDT), according to the Olympic
Roads and Transport Authority.
</P>
<P>
   There were no passengers on board and the train was quickly
removed from the tracks.

<HEADLINE> No.9 Mich 13, No.17 Wisconsin 10  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY LAGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Drew Henson, making his first start,
threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to David Terrell with 6:42 left to
give No. 9 Michigan a 13-10 victory over No. 17 Wisconsin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines (4-1 overall, 2-0 Big Ten) became the first
Division I-A football program to reach 800 wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (3-2, 0-2) likely eliminated themselves from winning
a third straight Big Ten title. Since 1896, a Big Ten championship
has been won by a team with two losses just four times.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, who fumbled twice in the first quarter, was 15-of-27 for
257 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the game-winning drive, Henson converted on two third downs
with a 21 and 20-yard passes to Terrell. On the game-winning pass,
Henson eluded a rush, rolled right and threw across the field on
his back foot, over two defenders and one of his receivers, to a
leaping Terrell in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Henson made his first college start after missing the first
three games of the season because of a broken foot, and coming off
the bench last week to lead the Wolverines to victory at Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Walker caught seven passes for 130 yards, Terrell had
five receptions for 96 yards, and Anthony Thomas gained 82 yards on
29 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's Michael Bennett ran for 123 yards on 30 carries.
Brooks Bollinger was 8-of-17 for 98 yards with one touchdown and
two first-quarter interceptions. Bollinger scrambled for 57 yards
on 12 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan needed the go-ahead touchdown after Wisconsin took a
10-6 lead with 12:10 left. On a play-action pass, Bollinger tossed
a 5-yard pass to Chad Kuhns to finish a 13-play, 71-yard drive,
which took 5:47.
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks had trouble taking care of the football,
especially in the first quarter. In the first 12:21, Henson fumbled
twice and Bollinger threw two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Todd Howard prevented Wisconsin from scoring a
touchdown on its first drive by cutting in front of Nick Davis in
the end zone on the first interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers turned Henson's first fumble into a score. Kevin
Stemke kicked a 49-yard field goal to give Wisconsin a 3-0 lead
with 4:26 left in the fist quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Del Verne tied it with a 33-yard field goal with four
seconds left in the half. Henson directed a nine-play, 57-yard
drive over 1:09, highlighted by a 33-yard pass to Terrell, to get
in position to score.
</P>
<P>
   Del Verne put Michigan ahead 6-3 on another 33-yard field goal
midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Henson played in an entire game for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 35-31 win at Illinois, he directed the final
possession of the first half and the entire second. He missed the
first three games of the season recovering from a stress fracture
in his right foot.

<HEADLINE> No. 16 TCU 24, Navy 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- LaDainian Tomlinson ran for 121 yards and
a touchdown as No. 16 TCU beat Navy 24-0 on Saturday to extend its
winning streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Printers was 14-of-17 for 188 yards and two touchdowns for
the Horned Frogs (4-0). Navy fell to 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, who had 33 carries, broke TCU's career rushing
record, pushing his total to 3,645 yards.
</P>
<P>
   TCU put together touchdown drives of 81, 85 and 67 yards, keyed
by Printers' passing. The 81-yard march in the second quarter ended
with Matt Schobel's 9-yard catch. Schobel also had a 13-yarder in
the drive, and Printers hit Cedric James for 27 yards
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, who had only 13 yards in the first touchdown drive,
scored the second TD on a 4-yard run. He ran for 24 yards, while
Printers completed four passes for 45 yards, in the 85-yard march.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback George Layne, who had a 20-yard burst in the first
scoring drive, added a 27-yard run on the final play of the third
quarter. That drive finished with a 23-yard pass from Printers to
Layne that made it 24-0 with 14:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Layne finished with 78 yards on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   Navy's longest drive took the Midshipmen to the TCU 13. But a
penalty moved them back 5 yards, and they ended up missing a field
goal in the closing seconds of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Midshipmen were held to 120 yards total offense, and crossed
midfield only twice. TCU has not allowed a touchdown in its last
eight quarters, while Navy has been blanked for six periods.

<HEADLINE> Deaths Rising in South Asia Floods  </HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAIRADANGA, India (AP) -- Torrential rains and deadly floods in
India and Bangladesh have cast a cruel twist on the region's
biggest Hindu festival that ordinarily would be marked with
frenzied celebrations and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   During the Durga Puja festival, devotees honor Durga, the
mythological goddess thought to bring blessings and save people
from hardships. The festival is to be held this coming week.
</P>
<P>
   But the killer floods that in the last two weeks have devastated
much of West Bengal state and part of neighboring Bangladesh --
forcing millions from their homes -- could prove too big a challenge
even for Durga.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can I expect my father to buy a gift for me when we have
lost our home?'' asked Shibani Biswas, an eighth-grader who stood
in a muddy expanse after flood waters receded in Pairadanga, a
farming village 40 miles north of Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people have died, or are missing and presumed
dead, after unseasonable monsoon rains forced rivers to overflow
across eastern India and western Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The victims succumbed to drowning, snake bites and murder by
pirates looting abandoned villages. Survivors are battling cholera,
diarrhea and typhoid that have broken out in crowded relief camps
in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18 million people in both countries are believed to be
marooned. Millions more have seen their meager homes washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Churning flood waters submerged new areas Saturday in
Bangladesh, where flood waters inundated farmland and submerged
roads in 185 villages the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta, the state capital of West Bengal, weather
specialists held out hope, saying the Hooghly River was returning
to normal levels after inundating many parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of villagers throughout the region have been fleeing
their submerged homes for higher ground on rafts made of banana
trees tied together with ropes, ferrying all household goods and
small farm animals they could take with them.
</P>
<P>
   Others wade through waist-high flood water, carrying children
and the elderly on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the initial chaos we are now getting enough food. But I
wonder where I shall get the money to rebuild my two damaged
houses?'' asked Nitendra Shaha, one of 200 people crammed into a
temporary shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials in West Bengal estimate it will take $65
million to repair damaged homes; another $714 million to replace
the value of lost crops.
</P>
<P>
   Food and water are being taken to flood-ravaged districts in the
six hardest-hit districts of West Bengal. But flood victims are
prey to robbers who raid relief camps and steal supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina surveyed the flooded
areas in a helicopter Saturday and visited relief centers in the
worst hit Chuadanga, Meherpur and Jhenidah districts, the United
News of Bangladesh news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Clemson 52, Duke 22  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- No. 7 Clemson made the most of its highest
ranking in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Dantzler ran for three touchdowns and threw for another
score as the undefeated Tigers beat winless Duke 52-22 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson (5-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won its first
five games for the first time since 1987 and is 17-3 against the
Blue Devils (0-5, 0-2) in the last 20 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Duke kept it close for awhile, but Clemson scored four TDs in a
span of 7:18 in the second quarter to build a 35-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The last three scoring drives of the second quarter each came in
46 seconds or less as the nation's No. 1 offense displayed its
quick-strike ability under the elusive Dantzler, the ACC rushing
leader who ran for 134 yards and passed for 174 more.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the third straight game Dantzler, who didn't play in
the fourth quarter, has gone over 300 yards of total offense -- a
Clemson record.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemson's offense continued to cruise, Duke's was a
disaster under D. Bryant, who was making his first start at QB in
place of injured Spencer Romine.
</P>
<P>
   A 57-yard interception return by Brian Mance set up Travis
Zachery's second 1-yard scoring run early in the second and got
Clemson rolling. In addition, the inexperienced Bryant was sacked
six times in the opening 30 minutes as Duke was held to 42 total
yards on 35 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Up 21-0 and already having scored on a 12-yard run, Dantzler
made yet another spectacular run that has helped him move into the
Heisman Trophy race.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzler faked a pitch and sprinted into the secondary, where he
was nearly spun to the ground by defensive back Darryl Scott at the
20. Somehow, Dantzler was able to escape, maintain his balance and
race into the end zone in front of a stunned Duke defense.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, Dantzler hit a wide open Morgan
Woodward on an 8-yard scoring pass to put the Tigers up by 35.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzler drove the Tigers 93 yards midway through the third
quarter on 13 plays, scoring on a 1-yard dive. Dantzler's rushing
yardage on the long march gave him 520 yards on the ground in the
last three games -- yet another Clemson record by the junior.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have now outscored opponents 238-48, while Duke has
dropped 52 of its last 64 games since its last bowl season of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Cops Puzzled Over Drug Submarine  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FACATATIVA, Colombia (AP) -- Lt. Javier Uribe, a policeman with a
buzz cut and a good dose of curiosity, peered through a hole on the
rusted metal door of the warehouse. In the dim light he spotted
what looked like huge metal containers.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Uribe had been on the trail of thieves who were
digging down to underground pipelines and stealing gasoline. He
figured the fuel was being stored in the warehouse, and mounted a
stakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, on Sept. 6, no one had yet shown up, so the
police broke into the place.
</P>
<P>
   They were dumbfounded by what they found.
</P>
<P>
   The huge metal cylinders were not storage tanks at all -- they
were sections of a submarine. Once completed, it could have ferried
some 150 tons of cocaine to the United States and elsewhere with
almost no risk of being detected.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian and American law enforcement officials swarmed in on
helicopters to investigate and also to marvel at the sheer audacity
of the scheme: to build a submarine 8,000 feet high in the Andes
Mountains and then, presumably, truck it at least 210 miles to the
ocean, section by section.
</P>
<P>
   And do it all in secret.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A lanky ''gringo'' who called himself Steve Smit rented the
warehouse, in a cow pasture in the Bogota suburb of Facatativa in
April 1999. Smit told Manuel Neira, the owner, that he wanted to
use it for a welding shop. Soon after, four or five Colombians
started working there.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel's brother Pablo lives next door to the warehouse in a
dilapidated house. He owns two buses that he rents to schools, and
when he needed to repair them, he would trudge over to the
warehouse to borrow tools.
</P>
<P>
   At first the workers obliged, but they never let him peek inside
the warehouse. After several visits, they finally scratched a
message on the door: ''No se presta herramienta'' -- We don't lend
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve was a little anti-social,'' the bespectacled Neira
recalled in an interview. ''I mean, he was polite and spoke Spanish
well, but he let you know he didn't want to strike up a
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he make any attempt to explain the sound of hammering
and the hiss of welding torches that emanated from the red-brick
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure they kept a Rottweiler on the premises.
Passers-by sometimes heard the workers call his name, Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday, 13-year-old John Alvarez and his buddies would
walk past the warehouse on their way to school and wonder about the
hammering and the shadowy men coming and going. A car repair shop?
If so, where were the broken-down cars? All the boys saw were
expensive new SUVs and sedans being driven by the warehouse
workers.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, the last school day before vacation, John was
walking home in his scuffed Buster Brown shoes, blue V-neck sweater
and gray slacks. He lingered by the warehouse. It was now or never.
</P>
<P>
   He dared himself to creep up to the door.
</P>
<P>
   As he got close, the Rottweiler came bounding out of nowhere and
chased John away.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pablo Neira and employees of a nearby Texaco
station, the work sometimes went on around the clock. Other times,
the warehouse was silent for days.
</P>
<P>
   The workers brought in their own food and booze in bulk, had
their own cook and installed four security cameras on the roof.
Investigators say Russians, including perhaps the sub's designer,
were among those working at the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Among papers police found was a list of handwritten words in
Russian and their Spanish equivalents: cigarettes, capsules,
Russian, oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian angle was not entirely a surprise to the
investigators. Russian mobsters are increasing their operations in
Colombia, especially in drug- and gunrunning. Several years ago,
Colombian drug lords even tried to obtain a Russian military
submarine from corrupt Russian officials, using a go-between in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The workers in the warehouse recorded their expenses
meticulously on notebook paper, from liquor, wine and cookies to
$1.30 for 50 screws, complete with the hardware store receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Pinup calendar girls and greasy tools were found scattered on
work benches, along with welding equipment from Russia and the
United States, and a system of pipes and valves from Britain. A
tool catalogue from a Chicago-area company lay on a table.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over everything was the bullet-nosed sub, 100 feet long
-- nearly the length of three New York City buses. It looked like a
reddish metallic whale sliced into three segments. Metal benches,
perhaps for bunk beds, ran the length of one section.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine had rudders, but no propeller had yet been
installed. Investigators think it was within months of being
completed. Authorities believe a computerized navigation system was
being assembled elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Fidel Azula is Colombia's longest-serving submarine
skipper. Pictures of Colombia's German- and Italian-built
submarines decorate his office in the Defense Ministry in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Azula loves submarines, and doesn't disguise his admiration for
the men who were building the perfect smuggling device and managing
to keep the whole project secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even our military doesn't have the capacity to build a
submarine,'' said the 20-year submarine veteran.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would have taken a crew of five to run the sub,
Azula said. He believes it would have been capable of traveling
deep enough to elude U.S. Coast Guard cutters and other security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Submarines are almost impossible to detect unless you have
intelligence that they will be in a particular place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers could have released their load of drugs from a
hatch without ever surfacing. The load would have popped up on the
surface for pickup by a boat.
</P>
<P>
   The sub's design is innovative, Azula said. Instead of ballast
tanks in the front and rear, this one had a double-walled hull.
</P>
<P>
   Water would have flooded the outer hull through a series of
holes, causing the submarine to dive. Pressurized air could have
drained the hull to make it rise.
</P>
<P>
   Azula is still trying to figure out exactly how the system
worked, and would love to have a chat with the designer, who
obviously knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to make a resistant hull, and to make the
flanges on the parts of the sub form a perfect seal,'' Azula said.
''It requires very special skill and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States Congress, unhappy about delays in delivering
U.S. anti-drug aid to Colombia, is noting the submarine project
with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian-speaking mafia, in conjunction with the drug
traffickers, got the steel, the tools and manuals down to Colombia
and built a pressurized, double-hulled submarine,'' Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., said at a Sept. 21 hearing on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our State Department ought to be able to deliver our
counter-drug aid at least that well,'' Gilman added. ''If not, I
think we're in major troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The sub builders bought much of their equipment from hardware
stores in downtown Bogota, according to copies of the seized
receipts obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the shops don't recall who bought the items, but
hero-worship them all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine, that they did this. It is ingenious,'' exclaimed
Esperanza Lara, who runs the Campana shop that sold welding
materials to the sub builders.
</P>
<P>
   Azula is sure that with so much drug money in play, someone,
somewhere, will try again.
</P>
<P>
   But is this the first? Could there be another submarine, not yet
discovered, running silent and deep with loads of Colombian
cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know, but I hope there isn't. I hope this was the
first one,'' said Leo Arreguin, chief of U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's operation in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary, the amount of drugs that could have reached the
United States if this project had been successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his office in the fortress-like U.S. Embassy in the
capital, Arreguin said he believes several Colombian drug cartels
pooled their money to finance the submarine's construction, and
were advised by Steve Smit -- if that is his real name -- and Russian
submarine experts.
</P>
<P>
   DEA agents are now poring over telephone and immigration records
in their search for Smit and the other sub builders. Agents in the
United States have already questioned a person in Atlanta. The lead
turned out to be an apparent dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained an American reporter visiting the warehouse and
carefully checked his ID. ''Steve looked a lot like you,'' Pablo
Neira later told the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA suspects Smit is American but won't release details on
the probe. ''We do not comment on ongoing investigations,'' said a
spokesman at DEA headquarters in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Embassy is also investigating, but did not respond
to repeated interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine is still in the warehouse, and there have been no
arrests. ''The dog is the only witness we have,'' said Uribe, the
police lieutenant who discovered the sub.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Neira, meanwhile, feels a shadow has been cast over his
family, even though police have ruled them out as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He is thinking about cashing in on the warehouse's notoriety by
opening a restaurant there after investigators have hauled away the
sub.
</P>
<P>
   What will he serve?
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably seafood,'' he said. ''Or submarine sandwiches.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> 12 Palestinians Killed in Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli troops battling several gunmen and
thousands of rock-throwing Palestinians opened fire Saturday,
killing 12 Palestinians in the bloodiest clashes in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip since 1996. More than 500 Palestinians were injured,
the Palestinian health minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the
cross fire. Cowering behind his father, he screamed in panic as
shots hit a wall just inches above their heads. Seconds later, the
boy was fatally shot in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for the violence was a visit by Israel's hard-line
opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, last week to a bitterly contested
Jerusalem shrine sacred to Muslims and Jews. Sharon said he toured
the compound to show Israel was in control there.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, six Palestinians were killed and close to 200 wounded
in clashes in the walled compound.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle over Jerusalem has begun,'' said Bassem Naim, a
Palestinian activist, as thousands of protesters chanting the
Muslim battle cry ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great, marched toward
an Israeli army position.
</P>
<P>
   Further dimming prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace
treaty, the two sides traded angry accusations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat by phone late Saturday. ''The prime minister warned
Arafat that he (Barak) will not let violence a tool in the
negotiations,'' Barak's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army chief, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said the Palestinian
Authority did nothing to stop the violence, and that Palestinian
police officers in some cases even participated in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath called the deadly
confrontations at the Jerusalem shrine a ''premeditated massacre''
by Israeli security forces, aimed at proving that Israel is
sovereign there.
</P>
<P>
   From the town of Jenin in the northern edge of the West Bank to
Jerusalem's Mount of Olives and the dusty refugee camp of Khan
Yunis at the end of the Gaza Strip, similar scenes were replayed
over and over Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian youths hurled rocks, some twirling slingshots for a
longer aim. Others stuffed gasoline-soaked rags into bottles and
threw them at Israeli soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and live rounds from behind walls and jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   Streets were littered with rocks, garbage bins were overturned
and plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose into the sky. In
Hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the scene
in taxis.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority, providing a list of names and ages,
said 12 Palestinians were killed and four were brain dead as a
result of army fire. The Palestinian health minister, Riad Zanoun,
said 523 Palestinians were injured. The Israeli army said 11
soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In two spots -- an army outpost outside the Jewish settlement of
Netzarim in Gaza and south of the West Bank town of Nablus --
several Palestinians, some masked, exchanged fire with Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis must understand that Palestinians can also shoot
and kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an M-16 assault
rifle who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   In Netzarim, 12-year-old Mohammed Aldura and his father, Jamal,
were caught in the cross fire. The boy screamed in panic as bullets
hit a wall just inches above their heads. At one point, the father
raised his head above the metal barrel that served as their cover
and shook his finger, as if to admonish those firing at him.
Moments later, Mohammed slumped to the ground, fatally hit, and the
father, gravely wounded, lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mohammed, two other Palestinians died in the clash,
including an ambulance driver who tried to rescue him and a
Palestinian policeman. Israeli troops fired anti-tank missiles
during the firefight, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest confrontation erupted in Nablus, where six
Palestinians, including two policemen and a 16-year-old boy, were
killed in a protracted firefight. Gunmen, their faces covered by
checkered headscarves and black ski masks, shot from olive grove at
Israeli soldiers crouching behind jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old victim was Khaled Bazyan, who had dropped out of
high school three days ago and taken a job at a car wash near the
site of the clashes. ''When the Israeli army withdrew from Nablus,
we felt safe,'' said Bazyan's father, Adli. ''But today, we felt
that the occupation is still here, on our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more Palestinians were killed in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the trigger for the violence was Sharon's visit
Thursday to the disputed Jerusalem hilltop known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon dismissed the charges. ''It wasn't my visit that incited
the fire. It was the Palestinian Authority incitement that has been
going on for some time,'' Sharon told Israel TV's Channel Two.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty claims to the shrine, which was once home to the
biblical Jewish Temple, Judaism's holiest site, and now houses two
major mosques that mark the spot where tradition says the Prophet
Muhammad ascended to heaven. The walled compound is the third
holiest site of Islam. Neither side wants the other to have full
control. All U.S. compromise proposals have been rejected so far by
the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Iceland on Saturday
during a trip to Europe, said she had spoken to both parties to try
to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned about the violence. It is clearly
counterproductive in the peace process,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence on Friday and Saturday was the deadliest since
September 1996, when 59 Palestinians, 16 Israelis and three
Egyptians were killed in three days of gun battles between
Palestinian police and Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The latest clashes came as Israelis marked the first day of
their two-day New Year's holiday, a time of festive family meals
and outings.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis felt the Palestinians were responsible. ''Despite
the fact that there is a peace process, they (the Palestinians)
want to ruin everything,'' said Meirav Buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from the town of Netanya. ''There won't be peace. There will only
be war.''

Bush Addresses Christian Coalition by Tape
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush offered a three-minute videotaped address
to the Christian Coalition today to soothe any hard feelings created by his
decision not to attend their convention in person and he reaffirmed his support
for their values. ''Should I be elected, I will lead our nation toward a culture
that values life, the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young
and the life of the unborn,'' Bush said. He did not explain why he initially
hadn't intended to speak. Bush outlined his backing for a tax cut and reforms in
Social Security, education and restoring moral values to children.

FBI Expands Probe of Debate Tape
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has expanded its investigation to determine if
superiors of an employee of a Bush media consultant were involved in sending a
Bush debate tape to his Democratic opponent, a federal law enforcement official
said today. The bureau has opened a full criminal investigation of debate
preparation materials for George W. Bush that were mailed to a confidante of Al
Gore, the official said. ''I'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy
would have mailed the tape,'' Bush said today from his ranch in Crawford, Texas,
where he was preparing for the first debate with aides. ''I look forward to
finding out who it is.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration appealed for calm today in
violence-wracked Jerusalem, saying that the highly charged issue of the city's
future must be solved ''at the negotiating table and not in the streets.'' A
dozen Palestinians were reported killed and 523 wounded as Israeli police
battled several gunmen and thousands of rockthrowers. ''We are very concerned
about the violence,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Iceland, one
stop in her European trip. She said that she had telephoned both Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in an effort to
ease tensions.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia offered today to try and mediate the
showdown between Slobodan Milosevic and opposition forces, but Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the Russians should accept his Sept. 24 election
defeat and send a message that Milosevic is ''finished.'' There was no official
reaction to the Russian offer. But at a speech today, Milosevic said: ''We alone
will decide our fate.'' Thousands of opposition supporters gathered in Belgrade
this evening to hear their leaders announce a general strike for Monday and a
limited road blockade tomorrow as a ''dress rehearsal.''

   ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) -- A Catholic priest smashed his car into an abortion
clinic this morning, then chopped at the building with an ax until the owner
fired two shotgun blasts to stop him, police said. The clinic was not open and
nobody was injured in the attack, which came just two days after federal
approval of the abortion pill RU-486. The Rev. John Earl, 32, was arrested and
charged with burglary and felony criminal damage to property, police said.
Abortion providers say they are usually are on alert for violence following

(3-2, 0-2) likely eliminated themselves from winning a third straight Big Ten
title. Since 1896, a Big Ten championship has been won by a team with two losses
just four times.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Fear Ivory Coast Tension  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Stability made Ivory Coast what it
was for 40 years -- a beachhead for Westerners in troubled West
Africa, complete with skyscrapered skyline, well-made croissants
and the only ice skating between Egypt and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and prosperity drew millions, from African migrant workers
to Lebanese restaurateurs, American missionaries to French
financiers. Expatriates joked they settled in bustling Abidjan
because ''it's so convenient to Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's welcome is turning ever more to today's threat
for the outsiders who now make up as much as one-third of Ivory
Coast's population.
</P>
<P>
   The military junta that took power amid the country's first-ever
coup, on Christmas Eve, increasingly is appealing to anti-foreigner
sentiment in its bid to stay in power through an election promised
for Oct. 22 to return Ivory Coast to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting, looting and now near-daily scares of more to
come, life for Ivory Coast's expatriates has become a worry of if,
when -- and how -- to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have extra provisions packed and can leave quickly, but one
thing we don't know -- where's the rendezvous point?'' Marysha
Yonis, a British-American, said as she picked up some of her three
children at an English-language school in Ivory Coast's commercial
center of Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the embassy will take care of us, but will it be an
airport evacuation -- because last time they closed the airport -- or
by water?'' Yonis wondered, while saying the time to run had not
yet come -- and might not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ivory Coast's foreign population are laborers from
neighboring African countries -- and many of them have already sent
their families home.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for true for the non-African population, which
numbered up to 330,000, most Lebanese, before the recent troubles.
Enrollment at the English-language school dropped 10 percent over
summer break.
</P>
<P>
   The drop is greater at the city's French-language expatriate
school, said merchant John Salame, a French national who sent his
wife and three children to France over summer vacation
</P>
<P>
   ''Every week, we hear something, so we tell them, 'Stay away,''
said Salame, whose warehouse was one of several looted in the
December coup. ''When it gets worse, all of us will be leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Salame and many others here are veterans of West Africa's other
unrest -- arriving in Ivory Coast after violent upheaval in Togo,
Sierra Leone, Liberia or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast was supposed to be a haven from all that.
</P>
<P>
   Under founder Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Ivory Coast grew to be the
most prosperous country in tropical Africa after independence in
1960. His conservatism, patronage by the former French colonial
rulers and development of cocoa, coffee and palm oil crops made
Ivory Coast flourish. Even in the late 1990s, after
Houphouet-Boigny's death in 1993, the annual growth rate hit 5 to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in cocoa prices helped change all that -- the one-time ice
skating rink is now a dank slab in the now-mildewing, once-snazzy
Hotel Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, gunfire in the streets punctuated the end of
an era in Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Guei assumed power within days of the coup, promising that
military rule would be finite and bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the general traded his uniform for statesmanlike
gray and blue suits -- and today is showing increasing unwillingness
to surrender power.
</P>
<P>
   Abidjan awoke Sept. 18 to yet more machine-fire fire -- an
assassination attempt against Guei, backed by allies of main
opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara, the junta claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests followed, as did opposition claims of torture and
killings -- accusations the government has denied.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for a potentially explosive announcement on whether
Ouattara will be allowed to run against Guei in the scheduled Oct.
22 presidential vote keeps tensions running strong.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's junta claims Ouattara is secretly a foreigner and thus
ineligible. Guei, who rejected African leaders' attempt at
mediation last week as unwanted outside interference, increasingly
depicts Ivory Coast's troubles as us vs. the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreigners out!'' Ivorians screamed in one angry pro-junta
demonstration last week, while Guei looked on smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is almost suffering in comparison with Nigeria,
which shows how far it's fallen,'' Gregory Kronsten, a London-based
financial analyst with WestLB, said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is bad enough that the African Development Bank,
Ivory Coast's leading foreign presence with 1,100 jobs, has drawn
up emergency plans for moving to another country, staffers say.
Bank officials refused on-the-record comment.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the non-African expatriate community here could make
any evacuation unparalleled in the recent history of African
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Many expatriates have stockpiled food and water, drawn up phone
trees to spread news in case of trouble, and dropped by their
embassies to leave hand-drawn maps of the routes to their homes --
essential in a city where few streets have names.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've packed my bag of coup food,'' said American mother
Stephanie Schulte, who put the same precaution to use in unrest in
Togo. ''I'm hoping I don't have to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   France, with 20,000 to 30,000 nationals here, has a military
ship stationed somewhere offshore able to evacuate 3,000 people.
The U.S. Embassy and other Western embassies have contingency plans
as a matter of routine.
</P>
<P>
   Missionaries make up the biggest single bloc of Ivory Coast's
2,000-2,500 Americans. The missionaries plan to meet Tuesday to try
to draw up plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are seeking to do what they can to prepare for what
could be a bad situation,'' said Paul Shaddick, assistant director
of Ivory Coast's International Linguistic Society, whose work
includes translating religious works.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of foreigners in the country,'' Shaddick said.
''Ivory Coast has always had a place for them. Until now.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Policy Agency Witholds Payment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office is
withholding more than $13 million in payments to a major
advertising firm while it determines whether the company overbilled
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Office of National Drug policy said Saturday
examination of invoices submitted by the advertising firm of Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather are standard, routine operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   About $13.5 million of $187 million billed by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
have been withheld pending negotiations, the officials said. The
money was spent on an ad campaign urging young people to stay away
from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   An outside consultant employed to assess the charges found the
billed costs, particularly for labor, were ''dramatically higher
than even the high end of what is standard industry practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, drug policy officials said withholding the payments
is nothing more than routine procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is standard operating practice for us to scrutinize
everything,'' said Pancho Kinney, the drug office's director for
strategic operations. ''There is absolutely nothing here that
concerns us. What we are doing is pursuing prudent measures to
protect the public interest. The great majority of questioned costs
has been found allowable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, the agency's spokesman, questioned what he said is
renewed political interest in the issue by congressional
Republicans, who he said have scheduled a hearing for next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are wondering if there is a political motive in that this
is taking place 30 days before the presidential election,'' Weiner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Paster, an Ogilvy spokesman, told The New York Times,
which reported the story Saturday, that it is commonplace for bills
to be negotiated. The company expects to be paid for its work with
no significant reduction in billing, Paster said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office began an inquiry into the Ogilvy
contract in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy is the primary contractor in an anti-drug advertising and
education effort called the National Youth Anti-Drug Media
Campaign. The campaign, which began in 1998, is expected to cost
nearly $1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign caused a stir this year when it was revealed that
popular television shows were submitting scripts to the White House
drug office. In return, TV networks received millions of dollars
worth of financial credits for including positive anti-drug
messages in their shows.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party loses support of leaders in Rochester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Mega-millionaire B. Thomas Golisano won
enough votes in two quixotic bids for governor to give the
fledgling New York Independence Party an automatic spot on the
ballot through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Now fellow party founders and leaders from the Rochester area
are quitting. They complain the leadership has been usurped by a
faction led by left-wing activist Lenora Fulani and no longer
represents ''radical middle'' voters who feel alienated by the two
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Neild, a party founder, said he is resigning along with
state party secretary Laureen Oliver and Monroe County chairman
David Stockmeister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look at it like a marriage that went bad,'' Oliver said in
Saturday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. ''It's time for a
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano declined to comment on the defections.
</P>
<P>
   The party was created ahead of the 1994 gubernatorial election
in which Golisano came in third but drew more than the 50,000 votes
needed to win a place on the ballot for four years. He repeated his
third-place finish in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the suburban Rochester businessman said the odds were
against him making a third run. But while the party has been riven
by leadership battles for much of this year, Golisano also said at
the time that he felt it remained strong and would likely survive.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani, however, told the newspaper that the party's success
doesn't hinge on Golisano continuing to run for governor. She
pointed to the party's 172,000 members as its source of strength.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership team elected earlier this month at an annual
convention is moving the Independence Party away from the middle,
she said. ''We're not a centrist party, we're a populist party,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> State opens probe into choking death of Bridgewater 2-year-old  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) - The state health department is
investigating how police and emergency service workers responded to
a call for help from the mother of a 2-year-old who was choking on
a toy.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Nicole Iarrapino, died Aug. 31, a day after her mother
frantically called 911. The Somerset County Prosecutor's Office is
investigating allegations that an emergency medical technician who
was nearby was told not to respond to the child's house.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are investigating this incident because there was a death
and there are questions about this death, and we are concerned
about the quality of care,'' said Marilyn Riley, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Health and Senior Services. ''I mean, a child
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne Forrest is investigating an
anonymous letter sent to the Iarrapino family claiming an emergency
medical technician in the area was told not to respond to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The letter claimed the EMT, Robert Hanlon, had lifesaving
equipment in his car and would have arrived much earlier than
rescue squad personnel. The letter claims Hanlon, a police
department employee with 18 years as an emergency medical
technician, was in the area but was called off by headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We interviewed Hanlon and he said he never began to respond,''
Forrest said.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Hanlon said his ''intention was to respond,'' and he
felt that he was ''called off'' by headquarters.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank To Face Congress  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weathering violent protests in the
streets of Prague, leaders of the two major international lending
institutions must face Congress, where key Republicans are ready to
cut deeply into their programs unless they change how they do
business.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a $435 million Clinton administration request in
behalf of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for a
high-profile initiative to provide debt relief for the world's
poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the money could fall victim to a last-minute
congressional rush to adjourn, President Clinton planned a strategy
session Monday with members of Congress and religious leaders who
have called debt relief a moral imperative.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the GOP lawmakers and the demonstrators in the Czech
Republic share a common belief -- that the World Bank and the IMF
have done more harm than good in trying to alleviate poverty around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am supportive of debt forgiveness for desperately poor
countries that have no hope of repaying their loans, but the
benefits have to go to the people who live in those countries and
not to the corrupt elite who run them,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
said last week. He and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., are pushing a
16-point reform agenda for both institutions.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, conservative Republicans, led by House
Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas, and Rep. Jim Saxton of New
Jersey, are making similar demands in what is shaping up as one of
the big session-ending budget battles.
</P>
<P>
   GOP critics are armed with a highly critical report done by an
advisory commission chaired by Allan Meltzer, an economics
professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer's group charged that the IMF and the World Bank badly
botched the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis, which plunged 40 percent
of the world economy into recession, and have failed to alleviate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the Meltzer commission's
recommendations, which form the basis for many of the Gramm-Helms
demands, are too Draconian.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to get the necessary votes, the administration
plans to cite results of recent meetings in the Czech Republic,
where the IMF and World Bank committed themselves to many items on
a reform agenda championed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States succeeded in winning overhaul of the IMF's
lending programs to discourage overuse of IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also has committed to moving ahead with tougher auditing
requirements and less secrecy surrounding the economic advice it
gives countries.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, once known primarily for its loans for
controversial dam projects, has pledged to diversify its lending
and to concentrate on projects with the greatest promise of
reducing poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IMF is moving in the right direction. I think they are
accepting a lot of the recommendations we have made,'' Meltzer said
in an interview. ''We see a lot of progress at the IMF and very
little progress at the World Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Goldstein, a former IMF official and now an economist at
the Institute for International Economics, gave credit to new IMF
Managing Director Horst Koehler, a former German finance ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
   ''Koehler is saying the right things. He wants a leaner IMF that
is more focused,'' Goldstein said. ''But he is going to face a lot
of conflicting pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even poverty and watchdog groups long critical of the IMF and
World Bank believe the reform efforts at both institutions are
having some impact.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to successfully lobby Koehler to drop IMF demands
that Mozambique remove protective tariffs around its sugar industry
at a time of low world prices.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler ''agreed with our logic. He told me he isn't always
going to agree with us, but he let us make our case,'' said Seth
Amgott, a representative of Oxfam, the international poverty
agency.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jorge Toca hit a three-run double in the eighth
inning to lead the New York Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Montreal
Expos on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Toca, a late-season callup, hit a drive off Javier Vazquez into
the gap in left-center field to lead the Mets to their fourth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lost its season-high eighth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Jay Payton was the only Mets starter to play all
nine innings. Manager Bobby Valentine emptied his bench, using 17
of 19 available position players, as the NL wild card winner
prepares for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez (11-9) cruised through the first seven innings, allowing
just one run on five hits. But Bubba Trammell walked to lead off
the Mets eighth and pinch-hitter Lenny Harris singled.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing sacrificed, and Todd Pratt was intentionally walked
to load the bases to set up Toca's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (8-6) pitched a scoreless eighth to pick up the
victory. Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his 41st save in 46
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro gave the Expos a 1-0 lead in the second inning with a
home run into the picnic area in left-center field off Glendon
Rusch. Vidro's 24th homer was his 200th hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal took a 2-0 lead on Michael Barrett's RBI single in the
fifth. Mike Mordecai hit a leadoff double down the left-field line
and Barrett followed with a single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got a run back in the fifth when Payton doubled and
pinch-hitter Matt Franco singled to right. Vladimir Guerrero
bare-handed the ball and threw home, but Payton beat the throw to
make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, looking to earn a spot in the postseason starting
rotation, allowed two runs, four hits, struck out two and walked
one in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez allowed four runs, seven hits, and walked four in 7 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Al Leiter, the Mets' possible Game 1 starter Wednesday
against either San Francisco or St. Louis, will skip his scheduled
start Sunday. Rick Reed will start instead. ... Valentine and GM
Steve Phillips remained non-committal on announcing the Game 1
starter, as well as the team's rotation and 25-man roster. ... Mets
OF Timoniel Perez hit a leadoff single in the first, but left after
experiencing tightness in his right hamstring while running to
third on Derek Bell's groundout. Perez is day-to-day. ... The only
Mets position players who didn't play were OF Benny Agbayani, who
is nursing a sore hamstring, and C Vance Wilson. ... OF Brian Cole
was selected the Mets' organizational player of the year, and RHP
Pat Strange the pitcher of the year.

<HEADLINE> Contractor fined after workers' fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey contractor faces $112,000
in federal fines six months after a roof collapse caused two
workers to fall 30 feet to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both James Kenney, 30, of Wayne, and Ronald Markiewicz, 19, of
Mount Arlington, suffered fractured bones in the fall, which
happened as they were helping build a warehouse in Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found
that the contractor, Lunar Steel, failed to secure the framework at
the site and did not provide employees with safety equipment such
as harnesses or a safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ''The willful nature of the violations is unmistakable,'' David
Ippolito, an area director for OSHA, said in a prepared statement
last week. ''This employer exhibited a significant disregard for
the health and safety of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the company would appeal, a spokeswoman for the
contractor said Lunar executives hoped to reach a settlement with
regulators next month.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's Parsippany office conducted the investigation.

Bush Addresses Christian Coalition by Tape

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush offered a three-minute videotaped address
to the Christian Coalition today to soothe any hard feelings created by his
decision not to attend their convention in person and he reaffirmed his support
for their values. ''Should I be elected, I will lead our nation toward a culture
that values life, the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young
and the life of the unborn,'' Bush said. He did not explain why he initially
hadn't intended to speak. Bush outlined his backing for a tax cut and reforms in
Social Security, education and restoring moral values to children.

preparation materials for George W. Bush that were mailed to a confidante of Al
Gore, the official said. ''I'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy
would have mailed the tape,'' Bush said today from his ranch in Crawford, Texas,

to Inova Alexandria Hospital in fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. The
nature of his problem was not immediately disclosed, but Thurmond has been
hospitalized several times in recent years for various problems, including
fatigue, and had prostate surgery in 1999.

At Least 130 Hurt in Miss. Bus Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OLIVE BRANCH, Miss. (AP) -- Two buses and a van carrying Clark-Atlanta
University students to an out-of-state football game collided today, sending at
least 130 people to area hospitals, police said. No one was killed, and the
injuries were not considered life-threatening. The wreck occurred about 9 a.m.
about 12 miles south of Memphis, Tenn., police said. Traffic had been slowed on
the highway because officers were cleaning up debris from an 18-wheeler crash
that occurred before dawn.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Drew Henson, making his first start, threw a 17-yard
touchdown pass to David Terrell with 6:42 left to give No. 9 Michigan a 13-10
victory over No. 17 Wisconsin today. The Wolverines (4-1 overall, 2-0 Big Ten)
became the first Division I-A football program to reach 800 wins. The Badgers
(3-2, 0-2) likely eliminated themselves from winning a third straight Big Ten
title. Since 1896, a Big Ten championship has been won by a team with two losses
just four times.

<HEADLINE> 1 arrested, others sought in ATM scam  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Police in northern New Jersey are looking
for several men they say are tricking automated teller machine
customers into giving up their personal identification numbers,
then stealing cash from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect was arrested Friday, and several others are still
being sought in connection with thefts in Parsippany, Pequannock,
Wayne and West Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects typically place a sticky substance such as tape or
glue into the card slot of an ATM machine, then tape a cardboard
sign next to the machine advising, 'If for technical reasons your
card is retained in the ATM, re-enter PIN and hit cancel.''
</P>
<P>
   The sticky substance prevents the patron from removing the card
from the machine, and the suspects stand close enough to the
machine to watch the patron re-enter the PIN number and record it.
</P>
<P>
   When the patron leaves the machine with their card still inside,
the suspects approach the machine, enter the customer's PIN, and
withdraw cash from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany Lt. James Storms said more than $500 was stolen from
First Union bank accounts in three instances in his community. When
incidents from the other three towns are included, the suspects are
believed to have stolen several thousand dollars from various
banks' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up surveillance at local banks and receiving an
anonymous tip about the identity of one of the suspects, Parsippany
police arrested Janet Castano, 36, of Victory Gardens, and charged
her with false impersonation; forgery; theft by deception;
possession of burglary tools; conspiracy to commit theft; and theft
of moveable property. She was released on $10,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany police have also issued an arrest warrant charging
Victor Cardonna, 27, of Victory Gardens, with the same charges. He
remained at large on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police also say several other unidentified suspects are being
sought.

<HEADLINE> Census count may cause problems for New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Census Bureau's efforts to make
the 2000 count more accurate may cause problems for New Jersey,
including a possible delay in next year's primary election and
redistricting complications.
</P>
<P>
   The census bureau is taking raw numbers and statistically
adjusting them so it doesn't undercount like it did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that may mean detailed census figures won't be delivered to
the state until March, leaving just a month for a state commission
to redraw legislative districts. That task must be completed by
April 12, the filing deadline for Republicans and Democrats to
declare themselves candidates for the June 5 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way we can do that,'' Senate Minority Leader
Richard Codey told The Star-Ledger of Newark in Saturday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   States redraw legislative and congressional districts to reflect
shifting population every 10 years after a census. That process may
be rushed in New Jersey because the state holds legislative
elections in 2001. The governor's job and all 120 legislative seats
are up for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn, legislative leaders say, may prompt lawmakers to
push back next year's primary by a few weeks or possibly a few
months - or even hold two primaries for governor and the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting very frightening signals about when they can get
(the numbers),'' said Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Gov.
Christie Whitman. ''It could really foul up our process if we don't
get accurate numbers quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A commission of five Democrats and five Republicans redraws
districts once census numbers are in. The process can be
contentious because redistricting can determine a party's majority
for a decade of elections. The commission has 30 days to drew up
new districts.
</P>
<P>
   A deadlock could prompt state Supreme Court Chief Justice
Deborah Poritz to appoint an 11th, independent member to spend
another 30 days to complete a redistricting map.
</P>
<P>
   In that scenario, redistricting would not be complete until May,
which is too late for candidates to file. In 1991, the commission
finished its work at the end of March after receiving census
numbers in January.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they are pressuring the Census Bureau to
release New Jersey's numbers in March. State population totals are
released in Dec. 31, but the bureau does not have to release
detailed data until April 1.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota 44, No. 24 Illinois 10  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AKERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tellis Redmon ran for 183 yards on 31 carries
and caught three passes for 116 yards as Minnesota beat No. 24
Illinois 44-10 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Redmon rushed for 151 yards in the first half. Travis Cole added
82 yards on 13 carries and completed 8 of 13 passes for 170 yards
over three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota stifled the Illini offense, which was limited to a
35-yard field goal by Steve Fitts in the second quarter and a
21-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Dustin Ward to Eric
McGoey with 35 seconds remaining. Minnesota scored the game's first
28 points and led 28-3 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome easily was the best performance of the season for
the Gophers (3-2, 1-1 Big Ten), who were coming off a 38-24 loss at
Purdue, and the worst by the Fighting Illini (3-2, 0-2), who lost
35-31 to Michigan last week.
</P>
<P>
   On a second-quarter possession, the Gophers continually ran
Redmon inside and dared the Illini to stop him. Redmon carried the
ball on all six downs of a drive that began at the 50 and ended
with his 3-yard touchdown. Redmon also had a 25-yard touchdown run
later in the second quarter. He set up a 19-yard field goal by Dan
Nystrom in the third quarter by running 62 yards along the right
sideline after catching a short pass from Cole.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, the quarterback controversy at Minnesota
shifted to running back. Redmon, who broke the 100-yard rushing
barrier midway through the second quarter, returned to the starting
job he had lost when redshirt Thomas Tapeh gained 183 yards against
Baylor because of Tapeh's foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, a junior-college transfer, took over the starting job from
redshirt freshman Asad Abdul-Khaliq after passing for 180 yards in
mop-up duty against Purdue last week. Abdul-Khaliq entered the game
in the fourth quarter, with the Gophers leading 34-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cole scored the Gophers' two first-quarter touchdowns, sweeping
left for 28 yards and following his center on a 1-yard burst. He
scrambled for a 21-yard gain on the second touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' Kurt Kittner, hurried most of the afternoon, completed
only 13 of 34 passes for 103 yards. Gophers defensive tackle Mike
Anderle deflected five of Kittner's passes.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Gophers cornerback Trevis Graham
intercepted a pass from Ward and returned it 71 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nystrom kicked three field goals for the Gophers.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was similar to Minnesota's 37-7 victory over the
Illini last season. The Gophers, led by Thomas Hamner's 184 yards
rushing, gained 367 yards rushing against the Illini one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Southern 56, VMI 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) -- Junior Adrian Peterson became the NCAA
Division I-AA career rushing touchdown and yardage leader when he
ran for 182 yards and four touchdowns in leading Georgia Southern
to a 56-3 rout of Virginia Military on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's 182 yards on 25 carries lifted his career total to
6,092 yards, breaking the mark of 5,931 yards set by Chris Parker
of Marshall from 1991-95.
</P>
<P>
   The four rushing touchdowns came on runs of 1, 29, 8 and 8
yards, lifting his career total to 63 in bettering the previous
mark of 60 set by New Hampshire's Jerry Azumah from 1995-98.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson had a fifth score in the game, grabbing a 20-yard
touchdown pass from J.R. Revere. With Southern building a 42-0
halftime lead, Peterson played a little less than three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Southern (4-1, 3-0 Southern Conference) amassed 577 yards of
offense, 463 on the ground, while VMI (0-5, 0-3) was held to 183
yards. The Keydets' only score came on the final play of the game
when Matt Maxey kicked a school-record 57-yard field goal that hit
the crossbar and bounced over.
</P>
<P>
   Revere added 84 yards on 10 carries and completed 5 of 6 passes
for 114 yards and two scores. Revere's other TD pass went 31 yards
to Chris Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Lavar Rainey scored on a 47-yard interception return in the
second quarter and the other Eagle score came on a 1-yard run by
Melvin Cox in the first minute of the final quarter.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Prepare For First Debate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush dug into intense
preparations Saturday for the first presidential debate, honing
styles and strategies for trumping the other guy in confrontations
five weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrat Gore, the road to Boston on Tuesday led through
Sarasota, Fla. Republican Bush's path led through his ranch in
Crawford, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For both men, the event is an opportunity to introduce
themselves to Americans only now tuning in what could be the
closest election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Issues ranging from abortion, oil prices, health care, Social
Security and education to voting records and reputations provide
fodder for attacks on such matters as Gore's penchant for
exaggeration and Bush's ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush practiced for the debate at his ranch in Crawford, assisted
by several aides and New Hampshire Sen. Gregg Judd, who is playing
the role of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Media consultant Stuart Stevens asked Bush why his tax cut
proposal was better than Gore's and Bush gave back his standard
answer -- that it would give tax cuts to all Americans, not just
targeted cuts. The mood was lighthearted, during a break when
reporters came through, with Gregg making some jokes at Gore's
expense such as: ''I invented the ranch concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said they practiced Friday night and Saturday by going
through ''pepper drills'' where aides pepper him with quick
questions. And Bush said working at the ranch ''helps clear my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to come here to this place to get my batteries
recharged,'' he said, adding that he would take a long walk with
his dog in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Florida, Gore began a series of consultations
with Americans about what they expect to come out of the debate
series. The first meetings were with Gloria Bingle, a steelworker
from Jeannette, Pa., and firefighter Matt Moseley, an Atlanta
firefighter from suburban Locust Grove, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking about what people look for and listen for
when watching the debates,'' Gore said, as the three sat on a sunny
patio at the vice president's residence in the Naval Observatory.
''I appreciate their help.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the campaigns have done their best to lower
expectations for their own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know that the vice president is a world-class
debater,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, adding: ''We think
that the pressure in this debate is really on Vice President Gore
to try to change the dynamic of the race. The dynamic of the race
is that voters want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of focus-group research, including detailed studies
by the Democratic Party and AFL-CIO, the Gore campaign heads into
Tuesday's debate convinced that it has the issues on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number one thing we feel confident about is, when the two
men stand side by side, Al Gore comes out ahead because swing
voters agree overwhelmingly with Al Gore on the issues,'' said
campaign communications director Mark Fabiani He cited such issues
as repaying the national debt, using the budget surplus to shore up
Social Security and providing for prescription drugs under
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ratcheted-up rhetoric in recent days offers hints on
where he is headed Tuesday. He hopes to portray Bush as inherently
opposed to Medicare and bent on its undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for Gore's environmentalism to play a role in the
debates. Fabiani said Gore will look for opportunities to
underscore Bush's and Cheney's ties to the oil companies -- or, as
Gore likes to call it, Big Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Gore has not spent much time worrying about how to
inoculate himself against attacks on his character or veracity
because his campaign does not believe that Bush will risk possible
voter backlash by raising such issues in debate -- not the first
one, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes Gore's character is an issue when it comes to
public policy. He has made the case at recent campaign stops that
voting for Gore would make trust in the White House a problem --
again -- on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Bush has said Gore's penchant for exaggerating
means he cannot be trusted to tell basic truths. The second trust
problem often outlined by Bush is that Gore's targeted tax cuts and
Social Security reform plans indicate the vice president doesn't
trust Americans to handle their own financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential candidates were also preparing for their
Oct. 5. debate in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was huddling in Jackson, Wyo., with advisers this weekend
who've studied Lieberman, viewed videotapes of his appearances on
talk shows and on the Senate floor and scrutinized his record on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who was at home in Connecticut for most of the
weekend celebrating the Jewish new year, was headed to Richmond,
Ky., late Sunday for three days of intensive ''debate camp.''

<HEADLINE> Two electricians burned at Newark airport  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two electrical workers were seriously burned
Saturday by an explosion and fire in a FedEx building at Newark
International Airport as a drill simulating an airplane crash went
on outside.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Paterek, 47, an electrical foreman with 15 years
experience, and Donna Fornoff, 42, an electrician's helper, were
working in a small electrical closet inside the cargo company's
airport building just before 11 a.m., said Steve Coleman, a
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Paterek was working on an electrical control panel when an
unidentified metal object fell into the panel and made contact with
live wires, touching off an explosion and fire that set both
workers ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to put the fire out on each other by rolling on the
ground, but there was very little room on the floor of this room,''
Coleman said. ''It was about the size of a small coat closet. They
eventually got outside the room and rolled on the ground and patted
the fire out on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterek, suffering from shock and first and second-degree burns
over 55 percent of his body, staggered out the door, to an area
where emergency crews from Essex and Union counties were staging a
mock disaster drill.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey, and Union Hospital saw Paterek, and rushed to his aid. The
drill was suspended while rescue workers assisted the victims.
</P>
<P>
   They were taken by ambulance to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in
Livingston, where Paterek was listed in critical condition in the
burn unit. Fornoff was treated for burns to her hands and arms, and
released. Their hometowns were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the drill, which simulated the crash of a 727
aircraft, continued without incident after the contractors were
taken to the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern 37, No.18 Mich St. 17  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Danien Anderson ran for two long
touchdowns and 219 yards Saturday, helping Northwestern beat No. 18
Michigan State 37-17 for the Wildcats' second straight victory over
a ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern (4-1, 2-0 Big Ten) also got three field goals from
Tim Long and used its spread offense to keep Michigan State (3-1,
0-1) off balance early. The Wildcats then shifted to a ground game
in the second half to use up time.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern, which beat then-No. 7 Wisconsin 47-44 in overtime
last week in Madison, took a 23-10 halftime lead, thanks to three
field goals from Long and its wide-open offense.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State was unable to convert several big plays into
scores, and the Spartans had two costly fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 10 after the first quarter, with
Northwestern's Teddy Johnson catching a 39-yard scoring strike from
Zak Kustok, and Michigan State's T.J. Duckett countering with an
11-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Long kicked two field goals in the second quarter, and Andersen
raced 32 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern ran for 201 yards in the half, to only 63 for
Michigan State as both teams used their pass attacks to register
big gains and pose scoring threats.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scored again in the third quarter, breaking loose up
the middle for a 41-yard run.

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Ja'Mar Toombs scored two
touchdowns in the final 6:58 and Texas A&AMP;M had three interceptions
and a blocked punt that led to 20 points as the Aggies beat Texas
Tech 33-15 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders (4-1, 0-1 Big 12) came into the game ranked No.
11 nationally in passing but the Aggies (3-1, 1-0) defense had
interceptions by Michael Jameson, Terrence Kiel and Sammy Davis and
a blocked punt by Jay Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M extended its winning streak at Kyle Field to 22 games since
a loss to the Red Raiders in 1996. Tech upset A&AMP;M 21-19 last season
when the Aggies went into Lubbock ranked No. 6 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 83,644 was the second largest ever at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the Aggies leading 19-15, Toombs scored on a 3-yard run
with 6:58 to play. After Davis intercepted a pass by Tech's Kliff
Kingsbury on the Raiders' next series, Toombs scored again on a
1-yarder with 5:42 to play to end Tech's comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, beaten by the Red Raiders in four of their last five
games, took a 16-7 halftime lead with the help big plays by Brooks
and Jameson.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Weber capped A&AMP;M's first drive of the game with a 14-yard
touchdown run and the Aggies also scored on a 32-yard field goal by
Terence Kitchens and a 2-yard run by Richard Whitaker with 4:19
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker's touchdown came on the first play after Brooks blocked
a punt by Chris Birkholz. Tech's Dorian Pitts blocked Kitchens'
extra-point attempt after Whitaker's score.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen's field goal came after A&AMP;M safety Jameson intercepted a
pass on a fake field goal try and returned it 76 yards to the Red
Raiders' 8.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Terrence Kiel got another big play for the Aggies
secondary with an interception at the A&AMP;M 13 that led to a 40-yard
field goal by Kitchens with 1:18 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech completed four straight third-down plays, the last
one going 15 yards for a touchdown from Kingsbury to Tim Baker on
the first play of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With Tech trailing 19-7, Kingsbury completed 6 of 8 passes in a
drive that ended with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Baker with 13:41
left to play. Kingsbury completed a 2-point conversion pass to Cole
Roberts.

   Colombia has cast doubt on Peru's explanation that the smuggling
was committed by rogue former military officers -- and many here
suspect Peru's military was behind the arms sales.
</P>
<P>
   That has in turn raised questions about the role of Montesinos,
a behind-the-scenes operator who controlled a vast network of
informers and had enormous influence inside the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the bribery scandal erupted, Fujimori decided Sept. 16 to
dismantle the feared National Intelligence Service, or SIN, and cut
short his own presidency. Montesinos fled to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But many think Fujimori's fallout with his top aide came not
over the bribery scandal, but because of the growing allegations
that Montesinos had a hand in the arms sales to the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the rebel group battling the
government in Peru's Andean neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are poweful doubts'' about the arms sales, retired army
Gen. Sinecio Jarama said. ''This is being managed by Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   At an Aug. 21 press conference, Fujimori credited Montesinos
with breaking up the ring, presenting his spy chief in a rare
public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Former army Lt. Jose Luis Aybar and his brother Luis Frank
Aybar, a military contractor, were arrested in the case. Fujimori
said the two led a ring that parachuted at least 10,000 assault
rifles, obtained in Jordan, into rebel-held Colombian territory
between March and July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic firestorm ensued. Jordan flatly contradicted the
account, and Colombian President Andres Pastrana said ''we have
doubts'' about Fujimori's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's government said the Russian-made Kalashnikov assault
rifles were legally sold to Peru in 1998. Jordan officials said
they dealt with Peruvian generals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peruvian media dug up links between the Aybar
brothers and the intelligence network headed by Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest, Jose Luis Aybar sent a videotape to the TV
station Canal N in which he said he had thought he was involved in
a military intelligence operation when he got involved in the
weapons deal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an opposition congressman, Fernando Olivera, said he
received a letter smuggled from prison by Luis Frank Aybar, who
claimed his brother was being tortured to prevent him from
implicating Montesinos in the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Aybar said his brother was held in a military base, ''a victim
of beatings and torture to make him accept his guilt and not to
mention Dr. Montesinos at all,'' according to the letter, which
Olivera distributed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the announcement that Montesinos broke the ring was
an attempt to divert blame for the arms shipments. Colombia says it
alerted Peru to the smuggling months before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has vehemently rejected any suggestions of government
misconduct, saying, ''The sale, I repeat, was not to the armed
forces of Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have been careful to remain neutral about the
arms deal. The scandal comes as the United States is seeking to
unite the hemisphere behind Plan Colombia, which is costing
Washington $1.3 billion to fight the Colombian drug trade, and
indirectly, guerrilla groups that finance their insurgencies
through drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Lauer, a top political columnist for newspaper La
Republica, said Montesinos' flight to Panama may also have been
motivated by the fast-unraveling arms scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps Montesinos didn't fly the coop so much to save himself
from the demands of the Peruvian judicial process, but to avoid
deepening accusations about arms trafficking to the FARC,'' Lauer
recently wrote.

<HEADLINE> No. 13 Texas 42, Oklahoma State 7  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP)-- Roy Williams caught a 96-yard touchdown pass
and Kenny Hayter rushed for 122 yards against the nation's toughest
run defense as No. 13 Texas beat Oklahoma State 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite passed for 291 yards and three touchdowns to
lead Texas (3-1, 1-0 Big 12).
</P>
<P>
   On the day the school retired former Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams' jersey, the Longhorns overcame a sluggish first half that
included a blocked punt to produce its best offensive game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie White led Oklahoma State (2-2, 0-1) with 104 yards
rushing, most of them coming on a 69-yard run in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' touchdown catch broke open a 10-7 game in the third
quarter. On third-and-14, Williams broke behind the secondary and
Applewhite, who had been sacked one play earlier, laid out a soft
pass for him to run under down the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose 36-yard catch in the second quarter set up
Texas' first touchdown, set a Longhorns freshman record with 175
yards on five receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State came into the game ranked No. 1 against the run,
allowing just 30.3 yards per game. With Hayter pounding the ball up
the middle, Texas finished with a season-high 205 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   After a fumble by Oklahoma State quarterback Tony Lindsay led to
Kris Stockton's 20-yard field goal, Applewhite found Artie Ellis
for 21-yard touchdown pass to put Texas ahead 26-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Applewhite connected with Montrell
Flowers from 2 yards out and Ivan Williams added a late touchdown
run for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a long time to get its offense going. The Longhorns
had trouble moving the ball early and managed just one
first-quarter first down. The Longhorns led 3-0 after Stockton's
44-yard field goal, but failed to score an offensive touchdown in
the first quarter for the seventh straight game.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas defense, however, was dominant early. Oklahoma State
started drives inside Texas territory four times and came away with
only one touchdown, a 9-yard run by White in the second quarter
after the Cowboys blocked a Texas punt.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys kicker Seth Condley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt
in the first quarter and had a 38-yarder blocked on the last play
of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 7-3, Oklahoma State had a chance to increase its lead
when the Cowboys stuffed a Texas fake punt on the Longhorns' 38.
But after two short runs by White and an incomplete pass, Oklahoma
State was forced to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also got an early break when a Cowboys interception return
to inside the Longhorns 10 was negated by a personal foul.

<HEADLINE> No. 25 Georgia 38, Arkansas 7  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Jamie Henderson scored on a 35-yard
interception return on Arkansas' first play as No. 25 Georgia beat
the Razorbacks 38-7 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (3-1, 1-1 SEC) did it with a defense that held
Arkansas (3-1, 1-1) to one first down during the first 28 minutes
and a running game that pounded the Razorbacks up front.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter made a well-timed pitch on
Bruce Thornton's 21-yard touchdown run that increased the lead to
24-0 at the half and completed some important passes, but he also
missed some open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first for Arkansas inside the state borders
since Houston Nutt took over as coach -- a string of 15 games. The
Razorbacks were without their top two tailbacks, Cedric Cobbs and
Fred Talley, who were hurt last week against Alabama. Alvin Ray, a
third teamer last week, gained 1 yard on five first-half carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs made 13 first downs in the first half and held the
ball almost 18&AMP;frac12; minutes. Arkansas managed five first downs and 105
yards in the first three quarters and trailed 38-0 at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia scored 10 points during a 17-second span in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bennett ended the Bulldogs' first possession with a
39-yard field goal. The Razorbacks went without a huddle on their
first play, splitting two receivers to the left and leaving Ray
alone behind the quarterback. Robby Hampton backed up a couple of
steps and look to the left sideline for Boo Williams. Henderson
intercepted cleanly in front of Williams and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia drove 54 yards for its second touchdown after Richard
Smith made a fair catch of a punt at the Arkansas 7 and the
Razorbacks couldn't get out of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks and Thornton ran for two first downs and Carter fooled
Arkansas with a first-down play fake and a pass to Randy McMichael
for a 7-yard gain. Sanks and Thornton carried once each for a first
down at the 10 before a penalty moved the ball back to the 15.
Damien Gary made a sliding catch at the 2. Sanks was hit in the
backfield, but he spun, kept his balance and crawled over a couple
of players to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Carter started the Bulldogs' third touchdown drive with a short
pass that Brett Millican turned into a 20-yard gain. On third-and-2
from the Arkansas 21, Carter started left on the option. He waited
until Derrick Johnson committed and then pitched to Thornton who
cut inside a defender on his way to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks couldn't make a first down on their first two
possessions of the second half and the Bulldogs only had to cover
44 yards for a 31-0 lead. The defense reacted to Carter rolling
left and Gary worked open in the middle. Corey Harris missed a
tackle, Gary got to the right sideline and Jevaris Johnson screened
the final defender.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Gets Bush Video  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush reaffirmed his support for the
Christian Coalition's values Saturday in a three-minute videotaped
address meant to soothe any hard feelings created by his absence
from their convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should I be elected, I will lead our nation toward a culture
that values life, the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of
the young and the life of the unborn,'' Bush said. He didn't
explain why he initially hadn't intended to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing abortion, which is high on the list of concerns at
the convention, Bush said good people disagree on the issue, but
everyone should seek ways to promote adoption and parental
notification.
</P>
<P>
   ''And when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth
abortion, I will sign it into law,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush outlined his support for cutting taxes, restoring
children's moral values and reforming Social Security and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like Ronald Reagan, I believe that the freedom we cherish
ultimately depends on the values our families teach,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dede Robertson, wife of Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson, echoed her husband's earlier warning that Bush shouldn't
take their support for granted. Speaking before Bush addressed the
crowd, she criticized both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have one candidate who changes his personality every now
and then and then we have another candidate who has distanced
himself from his supporters and pals around with John McCain,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition members attending the convention were more
sympathetic to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the choir here,'' said Tonnie Dunmoyer, a real estate
broker from Hemet, Calif. ''He doesn't have to come here because we
are for him. He should be out there stumping to talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Friedman, an engineer from Brandon, Fla., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked to see George Bush here in person, but I
know that he is out campaigning. I don't think he would have
changed anyone's mind in this room,'' he said. Bush was in
Crawford, Texas preparing for the first presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's unscheduled address surprised many in attendance, who
were unclear there would be a videotaped message on two giant
television screens. When the Texas governor was announced and the
lights dimmed, many in attendance rose to applaud expecting Bush to
walk on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The audience gave their loudest applause to Alan Keyes, a former
contender for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said moral outrage over the Clinton administration was key
to the Republicans winning the White House, conceding that in
prosperous times it was virtually impossible to defeat an incumbent
on just economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''If voters go into the voting booth thinking about material
things, we are going to suffer a material and bitter defeat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, who has spoken at past
conventions but was not invited this year, later held his own rally
in the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in past years have counted on the Christian
Coalition to help get out the vote across the country, but Bush has
focused more on moderates and swing voters. Some in the party have
been concerned that Buchanan could drain away religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning him by name, Buchanan didn't overlook
Bush's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we supporting folks who will not stand with us?'' Buchanan
asked about 100 supporters. ''If they won't come speak to you, they
won't speak about these ideas, they won't talk about these issues,
can you trust them to fight for you once they get in the White
House?''
</P>
<P>
   Directing his comments to Bush, he added: ''Why don't you try
sending a video tape to the ballot box?''

<HEADLINE> Fordham 17, Georgetown, 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Javarus Dudley's 97-yard kickoff return
snapped a third-quarter tie as Fordham beat Georgetown 17-10 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley also caught Mike Mucci's 18-yard touchdown pass, and
Arthur Gaskin rushed for 108 yards to help the Rams (2-3) end a
two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Gharun Hester scored the Hoyas' only touchdown on a 45-yard pass
from David Paulus. Georgetown (2-2), which will join Fordham in the
Patriot League next season, has lost six consecutive games to the
Rams since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham's defense constantly pressured Paulus, who was sacked
eight times and threw four interceptions. Georgetown was held to 13
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Paulus completed 13 of 30 passes for 148 yards, and Mucci was
18-for-31 for 149 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive score came on the kickoff after a 48-yard field
goal by Georgetown's Mark Samuel forced a 10-10 tie with 10:57 left
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley took Samuel's high kickoff at the Fordham 3, scampered up
the right sideline then cut back across the field en route to the
Rams' first kickoff return for a score since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown turned the ball over twice in the first quarter as
the Rams took a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nine plays after Kyle Shanton intercepted Paulus' pass, Brian
Colsant kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 7:21
remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A play after Brad Fradenburg's interception, Mucci threw a
19-yard TD pass to Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoyas, who were held to minus-6 yards rushing in the first
half, cut the lead to 10-7 on 45-yard pass down the middle from
Paulus to Hester 1:33 into the second quarter.

   AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Rocky Butler threw for five touchdowns,
including a pair to Charlie Adams, to lead Hofstra to a 51-36
victory over Massachusetts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who had four touchdown passes in Hofstra's first four
games this season, completed 22 of 32 passes for 324 yards without
an interception.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Hofstra (4-1) a 14-0 lead early in the first quarter
with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Adams and a 1-yard run after Doug
Shanahan's interception.
</P>
<P>
   Butler threw two more touchdown passes in the first half after
fumbled punts by Massachusetts (2-2) to give Hofstra a 28-17
halftime lead. Kevin Quinlan scored on 28 and 15-yard runs for
Massachusetts in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra pulled away in the second half when Butler threw a
15-yard touchdown pass to Jason Maxwell and a 40-yarder to Steve
Jackson and Shanahan returned an interception 46 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' Richard Lucero was 22-for-36 for 311 yards and
three touchdowns, but also had three interceptions. Adrian Zullo

<HEADLINE> Va Judge: Inmates Can Get DNA Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Inmates who claim they were wrongfully
convicted have a constitutional right to request DNA testing that
might prove their innocence, a federal judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. issued the ruling Friday
in the case of James Harvey, 59, who was convicted of rape in 1990.
Bryan did not order DNA testing for Harvey but said the 14th
Amendment allows state prisoners to file federal civil rights
lawsuits seeking DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Although a district judge's decision is not binding on other
courts, Harvey's lawsuit could become a national test case.
</P>
<P>
   ''DNA testing is becoming so accurate that any intelligent judge
is going to say, 'If there's any doubt, you should have a right to
test.' If they can prove your guilt, why can't you prove your
nonguilt?'' said John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford
Institute, a conservative civil liberties group that is not
involved in the Harvey case.
</P>
<P>
   If Bryan's decision reaches higher courts and is upheld, it
could unleash a flood of lawsuits, The Washington Post reported
Saturday. Most jurisdictions, including Virginia, do not guarantee
prisoners the right to post-conviction DNA testing. Instead,
prisoners must depend on prosecutors and governors to grant access
to the laboratory work they claim could clear them.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gould, an attorney for Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney
Robert F. Horan Jr., whose rejection of Harvey's request prompted
the lawsuit, said the arguments the judge addressed were technical
arguments. ''There will be further proceedings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Post-conviction DNA testing has freed more than 70 prisoners,
including eight from death rows, but a national debate is raging
over how widely to make the technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey was convicted of a 1989 rape in which a woman was raped
and beaten by two men. No DNA testing was done at the time, and the
witness was unable to identify her attackers; the key evidence came
from a man who said Harvey had confessed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfax officials turned down Harvey's initial request for DNA
testing, saying a negative result would not prove his innocence
because there were two assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Gould argued that Harvey's civil rights lawsuit to get DNA
testing was an attempt to get around the strict rules of criminal
appeals and Virginia's one-year deadline for filing a habeas corpus
appeal arguing he was wrongly imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal judge wrote that Harvey may still have a
constitutional right to testing. Denial of DNA testing is a new
civil rights claim and separate from the strictly regulated habeas
corpus process, Bryan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good sign,'' said Barry Scheck, co-founder of
the New York-based Innocence Project, which represents Harvey and
other prisoners who claim they were wrongly convicted. ''We can't
ever get into state court because of the statute of limitations.
We've lost in many places because it's too late.''

12 Palestinians Killed in Clashes

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli troops battling several gunmen and thousands of
rock-throwing Palestinians opened fire Saturday, killing 12 Palestinians in the
bloodiest clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1996. More than 500
Palestinians were injured, the Palestinian health minister said. Among those
killed was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the cross fire. Cowering behind
his father, he screamed in panic as shots hit a wall just inches above their
heads. Seconds later, the boy was fatally shot in the abdomen.

FBI Expands Probe of Bush Debate Tape
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has expanded its investigation to determine if
superiors of an employee of a Bush media consultant were involved in sending a
Bush debate tape to his Democratic opponent, a federal law enforcement official
said today. The bureau has opened a full criminal investigation of debate
preparation materials for George W. Bush that were mailed to a confidante of Al
Gore, the official said. ''I'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy
would have mailed the tape,'' Bush said today from his ranch in Crawford, Texas,
where he was preparing for the first debate with aides. ''I look forward to
finding out who it is.''

Candidates Prepare For First Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush dug into intense
preparations today for the first presidential debate, honing styles and
strategies for trumping the other guy in confrontations five weeks before the
election. For Democrat Gore, the road to Boston on Tuesday led through Sarasota,
Fla. Republican Bush's path led through his ranch in Crawford, Texas. For both
men, the event is an opportunity to introduce themselves to Americans only now
tuning in what could be the closest election since 1960. Issues ranging from
abortion, oil prices, health care, Social Security and education to voting
records and reputations provide fodder for attacks on such matters as Gore's
penchant for exaggeration and Bush's ability to lead.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jorge Toca hit a three-run double in the eighth inning to
lead the New York Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Montreal Expos today. Toca, a
late-season callup, hit a drive off Javier Vazquez into the gap in left-center
field to lead the Mets to their fourth straight victory. Montreal lost its
season-high eighth in a row.

<HEADLINE> Indians 6, Blue Jays 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nothing has been easy for the Cleveland Indians
this season. It didn't start that way, and it won't end that way,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley got his sixth win in September and Roberto Alomar
hit a disputed homer as Cleveland put the pressure on Seattle and
Oakland in the AL wild card race, holding on for a 6-5 victory
Saturday over the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez also homered as the Indians moved within a
half-game of the Mariners for the wild card, and pulled one game
behind the Athletics, who lead the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was at Anaheim on Saturday afternoon, and the A's played
host to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which coasted into the postseason the past five
years, will now play a 162nd game that could mean a sixth
consecutive trip to the playoffs. But to stay alive in the playoff
picture, they'll probably have to beat Toronto's David Wells on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, a longtime Indians' nemesis, is 17-3 -- including 4-0 in
the postseason -- with a 3.08 ERA in his career against Cleveland.
He's 2-0 with 0.53 ERA in 17 innings against the Indians this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in getting to Sunday, the Indians nearly blew a pair of
three-run leads for Finley (16-11) and used four relievers to get
out of the eighth alone when Toronto scored twice to close to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   With the tying run at second and two outs, Cameron Cairncross
got Darrin Fletcher to ground out to first.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman, the Indians' seventh pitcher, worked the ninth for
his 14th save.
</P>
<P>
   Even the final out wasn't easy. With a runner on second and two
outs, Wickman intentionally walked Carlos Delgado before retiring
Tony Batista on a grounder that shortstop Omar Vizquel backhanded
in the hole to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland led 4-3 in the seventh when Alomar sliced a 3-1 pitch
around the left-field foul pole for his 19th homer. Toronto manager
Jim Fregosi stormed out of the dugout to argue the ball was foul,
but after discussing it for several minutes, the umpiring crew
decided it was a homer.
</P>
<P>
   TV replays were inconclusive, and Fregosi was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez followed with his 37th homer -- and 10th in 22 games -- to
put the Indians up 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has been everything the Indians could have hoped for down
the stretch. He allowed two runs and five hits in six-plus innings
while pitching on three days' rest for the second time in three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians snapped a 1-1 tie with a three-run sixth off Esteban
Loaiza (10-13) with some help from Blue Jays catcher Alberto
Castillo, who made two throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar beat out an infield single and went to second when
Castillo's attempted pickoff throw skipped away from Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez singled Alomar to third where he scored on Jim Thome's
groundout. Travis Fryman singled and Loaiza was pulled after
walking David Segui to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar came in and walked Russell Branyan to force in a
run, giving the Indians a 3-1 lead. Sandy Alomar then grounded into
a force at the plate but he was safe and Segui scored when Delgado
couldn't handle a return throw from Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays closed to 4-3 in the seventh against reliever Paul
Shuey on Fletcher's pinch-hit RBI single and Shannon Stewart's
run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Finley hadn't won 16 games since 1993. ... Delgado's double
in the eighth was his 99th extra-base hit. He needs one more to
become the 12th player in history with 100 extra-base hits in a
season. ... Wickman had six splinters removed from his right hand
after he was hit by the barrel of Corey Koskie's shattered bat in
Thursday's loss to Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Assad Readies for Trip  </HEADLINE>
By TANALEE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- After two months spent shoring up his
position at home, Syrian President Bashar Assad is shifting his
attention to a critical regional concern he so far has only tiptoed
around -- making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is expected in Cairo on Sunday for his first foreign trip
since his inauguration on July 17, succeeding his late father Hafez
Assad. The 35-year-old president is expected to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, a key mediator in Arab-Israeli
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power, Bashar Assad has been tackling domestic
issues -- corruption and Syria's weak economy -- amid concerns over
the transition after the June 10 death of his father, who was a
dominant figure in the Middle East for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Staying out of headlines so far should be a cause of
satisfaction,'' Patrick Clawson, an analyst with the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, said from Washington. ''But if he
goes six months without action on the peace process, then there
will be concern.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hafez Assad's death, his brother Rifaat, known to have
presidential aspirations, began grumbling aloud that the younger
Assad was not Syria's rightful leader; the military was put on
alert in case Rifaat should try to return.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon also was cause for concern. Israeli troops ended their
occupation of southern Lebanon barely two weeks before the elder
Assad's death. Hezbollah guerrillas moved into their place, leading
to worries cross-border fighting would erupt if the young president
weakened Syria's controlling hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Rifaat stayed away and Hezbollah proved a stabilizing force
along the Lebanon-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's remarkable how peaceful and calm the transition has
been,'' said analyst Stephen Cohen, a New York-based analyst with
the Israeli Policy Forum. ''It is a great contribution to the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad and Mubarak will discuss the Middle East peace process,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters Saturday, along
with other Arab issues including Iraq and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in January, with
Syria demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967. Israel insists on
waiting to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by
returning Golan land.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course
in any negotiations with the Jewish state. ''We have the urge to
reach a state of peace, but we have no urge to compromise an inch
of our territory,'' he said in his inauguration speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, where Syria has 30,000 troops and wields great
political influence, is Assad's other main regional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of Israel's occupation in southern Lebanon -- long
the outward justification for Syrian troops' presence in the
country -- some Lebanese want to loosen the strings.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father before him, Assad maintains the loyalty of the
vast majority of leading Lebanese politicians, including most
winners of recent parliamentary elections. But since Hafez Assad's
death, some leading Lebanese Christians have called on Syria to
withdraw its troops. Last week, Lebanon's largest church -- the
Maronite Catholic Church -- echoed the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's most concrete steps thus far have been on the domestic
front, where Syrians have high expectations he can modernize an
economy and bureaucracy bound by years of socialist regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's government has announced a $1.08 billion vocational
program hoped to help ease unemployment, which reached its highest
point last year -- 9.5 percent according to official figures and 20
percent unofficially. Assad has stepped up a campaign against
government corruption, resulting in the resignations of several top
legislators and the imprisonment of two ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is one of the new generation of Arab leaders, who looks at
modernization, economic development and the West not as a colonial
imposition but as something these countries can use in order to
become equal parties in global development,'' said Cohen of the
Israeli Policy Forum.

<HEADLINE> Report: IOC Gifts Included Viagra  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gifts to International Olympic Committee
delegates by Salt Lake Olympic officials ranged from a violin to
Viagra, a newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Favors and gifts such as free medical care and paid vacations
were reported shortly after the Salt Lake scandal became public in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other gifts included the 1995 purchase of a violin, in violation
of IOC rules, and the brokering of Viagra prescriptions for two IOC
members visiting Salt Lake City in June 1998 to study ski slopes
and skating rinks, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the opening ceremony for the Summer Games in
Sydney, Salt Lake Olympic Committee president Mitt Romney warned
IOC members to brace for further embarrassments as more details
become public and the federal bribery case against former top bid
committee officials Tom Welch and Dave Johnson goes to trial next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some IOC members responded with the threat of a lawsuit. Members
were also upset in May when SLOC released a copy of the ''Geld''
memo, in which the Salt Lake bid committee hinted at inducements
such as jobs, bow ties and medical treatment that could be given to
specific members to win their support.
</P>
<P>
   But The Tribune reported that a handwritten 1998 memo detailed a
June visit to Salt Lake City by 20 members of the IOC Coordination
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memorandum, SLOC employee Van Alford drove two
visiting IOC members -- only one is identified -- to a Salt Lake City
urologist to obtain a Viagra prescription for one of them. Then
Alford gave the delegate $1,000 to buy the medication, used to
treat erectile dysfunction, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper did not have a copy of the memo, but said it was on
file at SLOC.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources, The Tribune also reported that the
other IOC member also obtained a prescription for 10 to 20 Viagra
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune did not identify either official since the
transaction was not illegal and involved a private medical matter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Alford nor the IOC would comment on the story. SLOC
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said the committee will not comment on
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra purchase occurred a year after Welch resigned from
SLOC in the wake of a domestic violence charge. Johnson, however,
remained a key member of Salt Lake City's Olympic machine.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson, indicted in July on 15 counts of fraud,
bribery and conspiracy, are two of five people federal prosecutors
have linked in an alleged scheme to funnel more than $1 million to
the IOC. Welch and Johnson maintain everything they did was
sanctioned by bid committee trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Another document reportedly on file at SLOC is a May 17, 1995,
reimbursement for a $524.47 violin that employee Jason Gull had
purchased and the document said was given to Gen. Zein Gadir, an
IOC member from Sudan. Gadir was expelled by the IOC four months
after the scandal broke for having accepted more than $20,000 in
cash and scholarships from Salt Lake bid officials.
</P>
<P>
   The gift violates an IOC policy prohibiting gifts of more than
$150.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Delay Trade Tax Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A last-minute agreement Saturday with the
European Union gives the United States until Nov. 1 to replace a $4
billion annual tax break for American companies that sell goods
abroad, from giants Microsoft and Boeing to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was negotiating against a Sunday
deadline for bringing U.S. tax laws into compliance with an adverse
ruling from the World Trade Organization. The dispute involves the
biggest case the United States has lost before the Geneva-based
arbiter of world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Congress now has until Nov. 1 to pass the legislation. The EU
agreed not to impose any economic penalties until a WTO panel
determines whether the new tax system complies with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   A top Senate Republican, Finance Committee Chairman William Roth
of Delaware, said he was hopeful Congress would approve the
legislation ''in very short order.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a U.S. tax program that grants $4.1 billion in
annual tax breaks to 6,000 American companies which set up export
subsidiaries in offshore tax havens such as the Virgin Islands and
Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO in February ruled that it was an illegal export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States and European Union today demonstrated a
commitment to avoid escalating trans-Atlantic trade tensions and
managing this WTO trade dispute responsibly,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Pascal Lamy, Europe's top trade
negotiator, said, ''Our priority is to resolve disputes, not
exacerbate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamy, however, repeated the EU position that the legislation,
which has passed the House, still would violate international trade
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Sales Corporation program was created in 1984 to
enable U.S. companies, including Microsoft, Boeing, General Motors
and United Technologies, to reduce U.S. corporate income taxes by
15 percent by creating export subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The program was intended to offset an EU tax rebate given to
European companies for products sold overseas. The replacement
legislation would create new tax breaks that would apply equally to
U.S. exports and to products the companies manufacture in their
overseas plants.
</P>
<P>
   The extension gives Congress more time to complete work on the
replacement legislation and helps to defuse trade tensions between
the United States and the EU, the world's two largest trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Groundwork for the compromise was laid last month when President
Clinton agreed to a request by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
delay penalties against some European products, possibly including
British cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute with the EU is over barriers the Europeans have
erected to sale of bananas from American-run plantations in the
Caribbean and South America and the import of American beef treated
with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has imposed $308 million in penalties on a
variety of European luxury goods -- Danish ham, German chocolate,
French mustard, Roquefort cheese -- in an effort to get Europe to
drop its barriers and comply with the WTO rulings in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   To increase pressure, Congress this year ordered the
administration to rotate the target list periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to bring the replacement tax legislation for debate were
blocked last week by Senate Democrats. The dispute centers on
Republican efforts to limit amendments and Democrats' insistence on
their right to offer them -- even those dealing with unrelated
topics such campaign finance reform or the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, expressed optimism that Congress would approve the
legislation by the new deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge by the EU would take at least six months. If the EU
were to win its case against replacement legislation, only then
could it push for clearance to file for penalties.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that any penalties on U.S. imports would not
appear until next summer at the earliest. The EU, however, is
expected to publish a preliminary target list by late November.
</P>
<P>
   That list is likely to include a far larger amount of U.S.
exports from which the EU will later choose items totaling the $4
billion in economic harm it claims to be suffering.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Final RNC Demonstrators Enter Pleas  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The last of the nearly 300 people charged
with misdemeanors stemming from demonstrations during the
Republican National Convention entered guilty pleas or demanded
trials Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In three Saturdays of special hearings, 185 of those arrested
for crimes such blocking traffic or disorderly conduct have chosen
trial, 106 accepted plea agreements -- a $300 fine and six months
probation, with no legal record of the offense -- and warrants were
issued for a few who failed to appear, said Cathie Abookire, a
spokeswoman for District Attorney Lynne M. Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Several defendants read statements while about 60 supporters,
many holding banners reading ''resist,'' silently raised their
fists in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Reed said he chose to go to trial because he made a moral
judgment to protest and ''for that reason I can't voluntarily pay
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a moment of truth, a day in court. That's what we were
after in the street,'' said George Ripley, 52, of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Trials were scheduled over the next three months for those
facing misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators' causes during the convention included the
death penalty, police brutality, the influence of corporations and
big-money contributors over U.S. elections, and the corporate
dominance of a global economy that demonstrators say threatens the
effectiveness of U.S. labor and environmental protections.

<HEADLINE> Boxer's Family Celebrates Medal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The kids got to stay up all night and the adults
passed around a bottle of rum as family and friends crowded around
the television in Felix Savon's home to watch him became just the
third boxer to win three Olympic gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ''My papa won! My papa won!'' 6-year-old Felix Mario shouted
after watching his dad beat Russia's Sultanahmed Ibzagimov in the
early hours of Saturday via a live television broadcast from
Sydney. ''I'm not going to be a baseball player anymore. I'm going
to be a boxer like him!''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Mario's twin sister Maria Felix was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ''She gets scared when she sees her papa in the ring,'' said the
children's mother, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy, very happy, I cannot find the words,'' said
Savon's wife, wiping away her tears. ''I cannot find the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeping, too, was Savon's sister Marianela, who could only think
of their father who died six years ago. ''This title is for my
papa!'' she shouted. ''I am sure that wherever he is, he has
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianela was jittery all through the fight, jumping up and
running out after each round. Occasionally, the sound of a bell
could be heard coming from the patio, where followers of an
Afro-Cuban religion called on the supernatural to lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Savon's 53-year-old cousin Armando didn't move from
in front of the television, holding a glass of rum in one hand and
using the other to show cousin Felix just how to hit the Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Savon's wife said the twins and their 4-year-old brother,
Draysel, have watched all of their father's fights, no matter what
the hour. ''It is very important that they know who their father
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After an early morning of shouts, tears, and rum, the Savon
family and friends joined in a countdown at the end of the battle.
''Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Savon joined fellow Cuban heavyweight Teofilo
Stevenson as a three-time Olympic boxing gold champion. The third
three-gold fighter was Hungary's Lazlo Papp.

<HEADLINE> Jacksonville 28, Austin Peay 24  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville's Jonathan Turner blocked
a punt, then recovered it for a touchdown and the Dolphins' defense
forced seven turnovers as Jacksonville ended a seven-game losing
streak with a 28-24 win over Austin Peay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (1-3) recovered six of Austin Peay's nine fumbles
in the game played in a steady, heavy rain. The Dolphins forced a
turnover on all five Austin Peay possessions in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   JU converted three of those miscues into touchdowns, including a
32-yard run by Jon Underhill. That bettered Underhill's 30-yard
jaunt in the first quarter, the team's first scrimmage run over 20
yards this year.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's punt block for a touchdown early in the third quarter
erased the Governors' 12-7 halftime lead. It marked the first time
in school history that the Dolphins had scored a touchdown off a
blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Peay (0-4) battled back in the fourth quarter behind a
pair of Brian Baker touchdown passes to Mike Farrell and Mike Ogg.
The Governors failed to convert on any of their four extra-point
tries, missing a kick and three 2-point conversion attempts.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - One man was killed and another injured after
they were thrown from their motorcycle while fleeing from police at
an exit ramp off the JFK Expressway early Saturday morning, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol officers saw the two men without helmets, driving
recklessly along the JFK Expressway a little after midnight, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the motorcycle ran a red light, the officers attempted to
stop them, police said. But they continued, heading to the Belt
Parkway and then attempting to turn off onto Rockaway Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   While turning onto the exit ramp, the motorcycle hit the curb,
sending the two men flying off the ramp, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old passenger was brought to Jamaica Hospital where

<HEADLINE> Reds 8, Cardinals 4  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pat Hentgen became the latest St. Louis starter
to get hit hard before the playoffs as Osvaldo Fernandez pitched
the Cincinnati Reds past the Cardinals 8-4 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central champion Cardinals and East champion Atlanta will
start their best-of-5 series Tuesday, although where they open
remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the best record gets the home-field advantage. St.
Louis and Atlanta, which played visiting Colorado at night, began
the day with the same record -- if they end up tied, the Cardinals
get the edge because they won the season series 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez (4-3) allowed four hits in seven scoreless innings. He
won a day after Cincinnati's Ron Villone struck out 16 in beating
Garrett Stephenson and the Cardinals 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored four times in the ninth. Mark McGwire had a
pinch-hit, RBI single and Carlos Hernandez hit a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen (15-12) was battered in his final postseason tuneup,
allowing five runs on eight hits in four innings. He has struggled
his last two starts, allowing 11 runs in nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason LaRue had a two-run homer in the fourth, singled and
scored three runs for the Reds. Brian Hunter had two singles, stole
two bases, scored twice and walked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey also drove in two runs with an RBI single in the
first and a run-scoring groundout in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's only other appearance at Busch Stadium was the
shortest of his career. He gave up three runs on six hits in 1 1-3
innings July 6, then went on the disabled list for two months with
an elbow injury the next day.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thanks to the acquisition of Ken Griffey Jr., the Reds
broke the major league road attendance record previously held by
the 1993 Braves. They've played in front of 37 sellout crowds and a
total of 2,968,541 fans, 24,000 more than the Braves with one
sellout to go on Sunday. The sellout of 47,099 was the 36th at
Busch Stadium this season. ... Chris Stynes doubled in the second
and is 15-for-37 (.405) with four homers and nine RBIs during a
10-game hitting streak. ... The Reds have won their last three on
the road after losing four in a row. ... Dmitri Young's pinch-hit
single in the Reds sixth marked his first RBI in nine games, ending
his longest dry spell of the season.

<HEADLINE> Utah's Smith Refuses Soft Money Ban  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Republican Derek Smith has refused
Democrat Jim Matheson's challenge to ban soft money advertising in
their race for Utah's 2nd District congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties battling for control of the House of
Representatives, the National Republican Congressional Committee
has spent nearly $1 million on ''issue ads'' backing Smith, while
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has spent $250,000
on similar ads for Matheson.
</P>
<P>
   Matheson called for the ban on Tuesday, but Smith refused,
arguing on Friday that there is nothing wrong with the party
spending money to highlight issues important to Salt Lake Valley
voters. Smith also accused Matheson of making the pitch to avoid
being aligned with his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate rather than stating: Vote for
this candidate.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio have
agreed to call for a ban on soft money in their New York Senate
race, but that agreement has been criticized since there is no way
to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping soft money out of the Utah race would work to Matheson's
advantage. He had raised more than $720,000 as of the last
reporting period on June 30. Smith had raised only $15,000 and
spent nearly all he had, plus $620,000 of his own money, to beat
Rep. Merrill Cook in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Two polls show Matheson with a lead, but neither campaign is
putting much weight in the numbers.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Name Fleming Ass't Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Vern Fleming, who played 11 seasons with the
Indiana Pacers, has joined the team as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to hire Vern for a long time,'' Pacers president
Donnie Walsh said Saturday. ''I went to (head coach Isiah Thomas)
and told him he would be good for our situation, and it was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was the Pacers' first-round draft pick in 1984, and
started at point guard during most of his tenure with the team. He
completed his NBA career with the New Jersey Nets in the 1995-96
season, and then played one season in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, 39, has lived in Indianapolis since retiring as a
player.

<HEADLINE> 2 Electricians Burned at NJ Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An electrical explosion and fire burned two
workers Saturday, one critically, in a building at Newark
International Airport, while a mock disaster drill was underway
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The two were working in an electrical closet at a FedEx building
when a short circuit started the fire that set both workers'
clothing ablaze, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to put the fire out on each other by rolling on the
ground, but there was very little room on the floor of this room.
It was about the size of a small coat closet,'' said Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually got outside and put out the flames, and got help
from teams from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey and Union Hospital who were participating in a mock plane
crash disaster drill.
</P>
<P>
   One worker was released after treatment for burns on her hands
and arms. The second was in critical condition, with first- and
second-degree burns over 55 percent of his body.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers Yugoslavia Mediation  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Preparing to face down the
opposition in the streets, President Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday
turned down an offer of Russian mediation, a U.S. official said.
The defiant Balkan leader declared Yugoslavs themselves ''will
decide our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spoke as the opposition unveiled plans for what they
hope will be nationwide work stoppages and blockades to force the
Yugoslav president to accept defeat by challenger Vojislav
Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition claims Kostunica won outright, but the government
insists he failed to take enough votes to avoid a runoff next
Sunday. The Federal Electoral Commission on Saturday formally
rejected all opposition challenges of alleged vote irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   That has raised fears of violence as the only way out of the
Yugoslav impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ease the situation, Russian President Vladimir
Putin offered on Saturday to send his foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, to Belgrade to try to defuse the showdown. However,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, however, said the Russians
should accept Milosevic's apparent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The only message Moscow should send, she said, was that the
Yugoslav president is ''finished.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reinforced that point later Saturday in a
half-hour telephone conversation with Putin. According to P.J.
Crowley, the spokesman for the National Security Council, ''both
leaders agreed that it is important for Milosevic to accept the
will of the Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Crowley, Putin told Clinton that his offer to send
Ivanov to meet both Milosevic and Kostunica had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official statement from the government whether
Milosevic had rejected the Russian offer. But at a speech Saturday
to the Yugoslav military academy, Milosevic said: ''We alone will
decide our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of opposition supporters gathered in Belgrade on
Saturday night to hear their leaders announce a general strike for
Monday and a limited road blockade Sunday as a ''dress rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No more big words, speeches and rallies,'' said Vuk Obradovic,
a former army general and now Milosevic opponent. ''Our message to
the police, to the army and to paramilitary units is that we are
not afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Obradovic suggested that if Milosevic sends his forces to
attack, crowds from elsewhere in the country would converge on the
capital. ''Not a single drop of blood must be shed,'' he added.
''We ask everybody to be peaceful and dignified.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, using figures from their poll watchers,
claim Kostunica won the election with 51.34 percent to 36.22
percent for Milosevic. But the Federal Electoral Commission, in a
tally criticized by the United States and other countries, says
Kostunica fell short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still controls the army and the police, traditional
pillars of his power. Seeking to shore up those bases, the Yugoslav
president addressed graduation ceremony Saturday at the Yugoslav
military academy and congratulated the newly commissioned officers
for serving ''at a time of great temptation for our people and
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance since last weekend's election,
Milosevic reminded the military of its duty to defend ''our freedom
and the independence of our country,'' which the government claims
is at risk because of alleged Western interference in the Yugoslav
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign forces will not dare attack us again, unless they try
to come here with an invitation from our domestic enemies,''
Milosevic said, referring to the opposition. ''Since foreign
military intervention or a war are out of the question, other means
of destruction of Yugoslavia are being mentioned -- psychological,
media and political pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Putin offered to send Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to
Belgrade to meet with both sides. Russia -- among Yugoslavia's
strongest allies -- has warned the West to avoid meddling in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Belgrade finds it possible, Russia would be prepared to
play a higher profile in the process of settlement and coordination
of positions,'' Putin said, according to the Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, however, insisted the Russians must tell Milosevic it
was time to give up power and that she would convey that message to
Ivanov by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Russians need to make clear that they understand
that this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,'' she
told reporters In Reykjavik, Iceland. ''The Russians need to
understand that Milosevic lost in this round. He is finished. It is
time for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have called for a peaceful civil disobedience
campaign, hoping to avoid provoking Milosevic into using the army
and police against them.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered protests and road blockades took place Saturday in
various parts of Serbia. Various professional associations have
also pledged to support the opposition. University and high school
students have announced they will join the general strike.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers, farmers and workers blocked several roads in different
parts of Serbia Saturday, some for only several hours as a warning
of a broader blockade on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Miners at the Kolubara coal mine, workers in Pancevo oil
refinery, railroad workers in the western Serbia have also decided
to go on strike until the authorities acknowledge the opposition
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition had filed several complaints of alleged
irregularities, chief among them that Milosevic supporters packed
ballot boxes in Kosovo with thousands of votes purportedly from
Kosovo Albanians. The United Nations, which administers the
province, said virtually all Kosovo Albanians boycotted the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Report: Crackdown Delays Promotions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A security crackdown, which has cost an
ambassador his security clearances and forced former diplomats to
use escorts inside the State Department building, has led to
reviews of security records of almost 400 employees who were up for
promotion, it was reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions for more than 200 senior officials are held up during
the review, and 200 midlevel officials' promotions were released
Friday after being delayed a week, The New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted Marc Grossman, director general of the foreign
service, as saying he would review the remaining files for security
violations before forwarding the promotions to the White House,
which will forward them on to the Senate. Grossman told the
newspaper that ''under 10'' officials had been barred from
promotions because of results of the review.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department statement given to The Associated Press on
Saturday said only that the incident and procedures were under
discussion. Officials declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said Grossman was instituting a system to assess a
point system, grading the seriousness of offenses and how long ago
they were committed. Too high a score would send a State Department
employee to remedial security courses.
</P>
<P>
   Security in the department has been under a microscope after
strong congressional criticism that followed lapses including the
theft from within the building of a laptop computer holding
top-secret files. Despite a reward offer, the computer has not been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, clearances of Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to
Israel and a major participant in the Middle East peace process,
were suspended because of suspect security procedures. Officials
said espionage was not involved, just unfollowed security rules.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said last week that
five employees in all had their clearances suspended for security
policy violations this year. Another 27 have had suspensions within
the last two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent move, a requirement that retired diplomats be
escorted inside the building, caused outrage among many of the
almost 11,000 retired foreign service officers, who traditionally
have had total access.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last
week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who ordered the
crackdown under congressional pressure, said:
</P>
<P>
   ''I am trying here to find a middle ground in terms of not
having with hunts or being lax. We cannot have a culture of laxity
as far as security issues are concerned.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Dies in Mideast Clash  </HEADLINE>
By NAJIB ABU JOBEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NETZARIM, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Caught in Israeli-Palestinian cross
fire, a father and son clung together behind a metal barrel, barely
visible in the smoke, as shots flew overhead. ''The child, the
child!'' the father yelled, helplessly waving his arm in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The boy screamed in panic as shots hit a wall just inches over
their heads. Seconds later, 12-year-old Mohammed Aldura was fatally
struck in the abdomen. He loosened his grip on his father and
slumped over.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously wounded, the father, Jamal, shook with convulsions,
rolled his eyes skyward and lost consciousness. He was hospitalized
in Gaza and was expected to recover, family members said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance driver was killed trying to rescue them, and a
Palestinian police officer also died in the clash.
</P>
<P>
   The three killed in Netzarim were among 12 Palestinians who died
Saturday, in the bloodiest clashes on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
since 1996. More than 500 Palestinians were injured, the
Palestinian health minister said. On Friday, six were killed and
more than 200 injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting followed a hardline Israeli opposition leader's
Thursday visit to a disputed Jerusalem shrine, sacred to both Jews
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victims included three Palestinians killed in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, and six who died in the West Bank town
of Nablus, including two policemen and a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Bazyan, 16, left home Saturday morning to join a
rock-throwing protest against Israeli soldiers. His mother, Alia,
feared the worst. She sent her younger son Mohammed to bring him
back, but Khaled wouldn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who dropped out of high school last week to take a job
at a car wash, was killed when Israeli soldiers crouching behind
jeeps traded fire with masked Palestinian gunmen in an olive grove
south of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   His mother kissed Khaled goodbye when his body was brought to
her home before burial, lying on a stretcher and wrapped in a
Palestinian flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night he was playing soccer in the room with his brother
and I warned him not to break the furniture. He wouldn't stop and
was happy,'' she said, dressed in black and breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled was only a toddler when his teen-age neighbors were dying
in the Intefadeh, the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against
Israeli military occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Although an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty remains elusive,
Khaled's parents never imagined their oldest son would become
another victim in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Israeli army withdrew from Nablus we felt safe,'' the
father, Adli said. ''But today we felt that the occupation is still
here in our land.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic TV Ratings Drop To New Low  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fewer and fewer people are tuning in to NBC's
Sydney Olympics coverage, with the 15th night of taped telecasts
drawing the lowest rating yet by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's program, which included Marion Jones competing in
the long jump and the U.S. basketball team's two-point semifinal
victory over Lithuania, pulled in a 10.6 rating and 20 share
measured from 7:30 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   That's 15 percent lower than the previous worst nightly rating
for these Olympics (Tuesday's 12.4), 35 percent lower than what
advertisers were told to expect (16.1), and 40-43 percent lower
than NBC Sports predicted its programs would get (17.5 to 18.5).
</P>
<P>
   No night at any of the last three Summer Games rated worse than
the 12.3 for the closing ceremonies at Seoul 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has increased the number of national commercials it runs by
an average of two per hour to satisfy advertisers expecting to
reach larger audiences during the 17 days in Sydney. Sponsors paid
up to $600,000 for a 30-second commercial in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   With two nights left to measure, the cumulative rating for the
Olympics slipped to a new low of 14.2 with a 25 share.
</P>
<P>
   That's worse than for any Summer Olympics since the Tokyo Games
in 1964, when NBC aired only 14 hours and averaged a 12.7 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point represents a little more than 1 million
television households. Share is the percentage of in-use TVs tuned
to a given program.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's show had a 10.8 rating from 8-11 p.m., peaking
with a 12.7 from 10:30-11.
</P>
<P>
   NBC decided to show all action on tape because Sydney is 15
hours ahead of the East Coast, and one factor probably hurting the
ratings is the delay between when events are completed and when
they are aired. Results are available on the Internet and on TV
sportscasts up to 24 hours before NBC shows the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics also have to compete with the NFL, college football
and baseball's pennant races.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks, though, have little incentive to try to
audiences away from the Olympics, because Nielsen Media Research
pushed back the official starting date of the new TV season two
weeks to Oct. 2.

<HEADLINE> Lazio raises $10.7 million in five weeks, spends almost $15 million </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio said Saturday that his
campaign had raised a whopping $10.7 million over the last five
weeks for his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but also
spent almost $15 million during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Lazio's fund-raising success and heavy spending came
after he finished marching in a parade in this historic village
near Utica.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides reported much more disappointing figures for the
first lady, saying she had raised $2.6 million during the period
and was left with $2.5 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race is expected to be the most expensive in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, at a later campaign stop at a Syracuse shopping mall,
said the heavy spending was because of television advertising
needed to ''cut through a message and have some parity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also been spending heavily on television in recent
weeks. Much of her TV advertising has been financed by Democratic
groups and paid for through unlimited soft-money donations. An
agreement by Lazio and Clinton reached last weekend has banned such
soft-money spending on TV ads for the remainder of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This filing shows that Rick Lazio's 11th-hour acceptance of
Hillary's soft money proposal was nothing more than a strategic
ploy,'' said Karen Finney, a campaign spokeswoman, adding that
Lazio only accepted the soft money ban because, ''he has a hard
money advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures reported Saturday are made up of donations limited
to $1,000 for an individual. Despite Finney's comment, it was Lazio
who seemed to push hardest for the soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said his success in raising money from late August through
the end of September ''demonstrates a lot of grassroots support; it
demonstrates enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   As of late August, Lazio reported having $10.2 million on hand
while Clinton said she had $7.1 million. Lazio aides said Saturday
that as of the end of September, the congressman had $6.1 million
still in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Clinton edging ahead of Lazio in the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The figures come from reports prepared for filing with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio stumped Saturday in some of the same locales hit earlier
in the campaign by Clinton, who has attracted generally larger
crowds at her stops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's great to be in this New York Clinton,'' Lazio
said as he prepared to march in the village of Clinton's annual
homecoming parade. ''And, to have all these Clintonians' support
Lazio is really a great boost for our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scattered along the mile-long parade route were a few
''We Love Hillary'' signs. They were far outnumbered by the
''Clinton for Lazio'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of political gamesmanship, more than a dozen
placard-waving Clinton supporters showed up at the end of the
parade route to cheer for the first lady as Lazio climbed back
aboard his ''Mainstream Express'' campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's main square, Lazio shook hands with many of the
several hundred people on hand. At most, the crowd was one or two
deep, a marked contrast to the first lady's lunch-stop visit
earlier this year when the crowd on the village green was often a
half-dozen deep.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, after a stop at a marina in Frankfort, Lazio
was greeted by a crowd of about 150 people in Little Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll take this enthusiasm and this crowd any day,'' the Long
Island Republican said as he campaigned in the small Herkimer
County village on the banks of the Mohawk River. ''I'm very happy
with the crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Falls, Lazio delivered a 14-minute version of his
stump speech, touching on everything from his support for an
amendment to ban flag burning to Republican attempts to repeal
federal inheritance taxes.

<P>
   As a freight train rumbled, Lazio paused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Must be the Clintons heading back to Arkansas,'' Lazio said to
the crowd's laughter. ''I knew it was going to happen after
Election Day, but I didn't think it would be this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   On hand for Lazio's Little Falls appearance was Katie Nichols,
who heads up the Herkimer County Democratic Party effort for
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot larger crowd when Hillary was here,'' Nichols
commented.
</P>
<P>
   During a lunch stop at a Symeon's, a Greek restaurant near
Utica, Lazio said he felt much more comfortable on the campaign
trail than he did when he first started out in mid-May. But he also
said that he sometimes wakes up during overnights on the road and
can't get back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''I immediately start thinking of things I have to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio later stopped at a shopping mall in the Buffalo suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the day off from the campaign trail. She finished
up a three-day, fund-raising trip to Oklahoma, Las Vegas and
California on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Discuss Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian President
Vadimir Putin discussed developments in Yugoslavia by telephone
Saturday amid reports that Moscow was ready to try to ease
escalating tension over the Balkan nation's disputed presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Putin told Clinton
during a 35-minute conversation that a proposal to send Russian
Foreign minister Igor Ivanov to Belgrade had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, en route to meetings in
Europe, said the Russians should accept President Slobodan
Milosevic's apparent defeat in the Sept. 24 elections. The only
message Moscow should send to Belgrade, she said, was that the
Yugoslav president is ''finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Both leaders agreed that it is important for Milosevic to
respect the will of the Serbian people,'' Crowley said. The call
was initiated by Clinton, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Cuba Presidents Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami met Saturday
with Cuban leader Fidel Castro during an official visit to the
island following the OPEC summit in nearby Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the talks were not disclosed. Cuba's state media
earlier indicated that the leaders would talk about a variety of
trade issues, and discuss establishment of a direct maritime link
between their countries. The two countries conduct around $100
million in trade a year, mostly in sugar and agriculture
</P>
<P>
   Oil, a leading economic and domestic issue for communist Cuba,
might also have been discussed. Cuba was dependent on its socialist
allies for most of its oil before the Soviet Union broke up a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Cuba has increased its production of oil and
gas for domestic consumption but remains dependent on fuel imports.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the talks, the two men greeted one another before
local and international media: Castro in his typical olive military
drabs; Khatami, in the flowing robe and black turban that signifies
his descent from Islam's 7th century prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Castro invited Khatami to visit Cuba when they first met at the
summit of Non-Aligned Countries in South Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was a central figure at the summit of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries that wrapped up Thursday in
Caracas. After the OPEC summit ended, Khatami and Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan discussed upgrading diplomatic
relations between their countries that have been frayed since their
1980-88 war.

Milosevic Rejects Russia Mediation Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Preparing to face down the opposition in the
streets, President Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday turned down an offer of
Russian mediation, a U.S. official said. The defiant Balkan leader declared
Yugoslavs themselves ''will decide our fate.'' Milosevic spoke as the opposition
unveiled plans for what they hope will be nationwide work stoppages and
blockades to force the Yugoslav president to accept defeat by challenger
Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. The opposition claims Kostunica won
outright, but the government insists he failed to take enough votes to avoid a
runoff next Sunday.

Palestinians were injured, the Palestinian health minister said. Among those

Bush, Gore Prepare For First Debate

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush dug into intense
preparations today for the first presidential debate, honing styles and
strategies for trumping the other guy in confrontations five weeks before the
election. For Democrat Gore, the road to Boston on Tuesday led through Sarasota,
Fla. Republican Bush's path led through his ranch in Crawford, Texas. For both
men, the event is an opportunity to introduce themselves to Americans only now
tuning in what could be the closest election since 1960. Issues ranging from
abortion, oil prices, health care, Social Security and education to voting
records and reputations provide fodder for attacks on such matters as Gore's
penchant for exaggeration and Bush's ability to lead.

fired two shotgun blasts to stop him, police said. The clinic was not open and
nobody was injured in the attack, which came just two days after federal
approval of the abortion pill RU-486. The Rev. John Earl, 32, was arrested and
charged with burglary and felony criminal damage to property, police said.

Va. Judge Says Inmates Can Get DNA Test
</SUBHEAD>

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Inmates who claim they were wrongfully convicted have
a constitutional right to request DNA testing that might prove their innocence,
a federal judge ruled. U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. issued the ruling
Friday in the case of James Harvey, 59, who was convicted of rape in 1990. Bryan
did not order DNA testing for Harvey but said the 14th Amendment allows state
prisoners to file federal civil rights lawsuits seeking DNA testing. Although a
district judge's decision is not binding on other courts, Harvey's lawsuit could
become a national test case.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The pilot of a single-seat U.S. Navy
fighter jet that crashed into the Persian Gulf shortly after
takeoff from the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft has been declared
dead, the U.S. Navy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the F/A-18C Hornet strike fighter lost
communication with the aircraft carrier soon after taking off
Friday for a routine test on carrier landings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found some debris from the crash that killed the pilot and
the search is now over,'' said Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck, spokesman for
the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Gradeck would not say whether the
pilot's remains had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were withholding the pilot's name until they could
notify his closest relative, Gradeck said. The crash remained under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft carrier's home port is Everett, Wash. It arrived on
station in the Gulf on Sept. 24. The single-seat fighter jet was
assigned to Carrier Air Wing 14.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Keith strengthened to a
hurricane Saturday and threatened to hit Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain pounded the eastern Yucatan, Belize and northern
Honduras on Saturday. Storm surges caused rivers to overflow and
flooded thousands of homes, civil protection officials in Mexico
said.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning remained in effect along the Yucatan
peninsula's eastern shore, from Cabo Catoche south to Monkey River
Town in Belize, according to the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. EDT, Keith was centered about about 105 miles
east-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico. Maximum sustained winds
increased to 100 mph, and forecasters expected the storm to drift
north-northwest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Joyce headed for the Windward Islands,
raising storm warnings for Trinidad, Tobago and Grenada. A tropical
storm watch was in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Isaac diminished Saturday, with sustained winds at
about 75 mph. The storm was in open water, about 1,120 miles west
of the westernmost Azores.

<HEADLINE> FBI Opens Probe of Bush Debate Tape  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has expanded its investigation to
determine if superiors of an employee of George W. Bush's media
consultant were involved in sending a Bush debate tape to his
Democratic opponent, a federal law enforcement official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed confidence that none of his supporters were
involved and the media consultant, Mark McKinnon, helped him
prepare on Saturday for debate at his ranch outside Crawford,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy would have
mailed the tape,'' Bush told reporters. ''I look forward to finding
out who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would fire anyone if a theft were discovered, he
said, ''If I found somebody stealing from our campaign? Yeah, I
sure would.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, interviewed by phone while driving back to Austin with
chief Bush strategist Karl Rove, said he didn't believe his
employee, Yvette Lozano, had anything to do with mailing the debate
tape to an Al Gore confidant. ''I'm just anxious to get this
resolved,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove and several Bush advisers said they have confidence in
McKinnon, and there are no signs of finger-pointing between
advisers. The campaign has also defended Lozano, the initial focus
of the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI questioned Rove on Saturday for about 30 minutes at Bush
campaign headquarters in Austin, said Dan Bartlett, a Bush
spokesman. He called the questions routine, involving Rove's access
to debate material and about the material itself. Rove is one of
the last senior Bush officials to be interviewed by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday that the bureau has opened a full criminal
investigation in the matter. Previously the bureau was conducting a
preliminary inquiry and officials had thought it could take some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a full criminal investigation means agents and
prosecutors are more confident of the evidence they have in hand,
and are more confident that some federal statute has been violated
and are closer to resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano, who works for McKinnon at Maverick Media, has denied
mailing the debate materials. She and McKinnon have said the
package she mailed Sept. 11 from Austin contained Gap pants she was
returning to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was comparing fingerprints of Lozano with those found on
the inside and outside of the debate package mailed from Austin to
Washington, the federal law enforcement official said. She has said
the FBI took a second set of fingerprints and seized her computer.
</P>
<P>
   One federal investigator cautioned that fingerprints found on
the package would not necessarily be conclusive because Lozano may
have touched the items in the normal course of business at the ad
office.
</P>
<P>
   The label on the Express Mail package received by Gore adviser
Tom Downey on Sept. 13 corresponds to the date Lozano was filmed by
a security camera mailing a package, the official said. Downey
turned the package over to the FBI after finding the Bush debate
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano was initially linked to the case through forensic work by
the FBI laboratory, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Justice Department officials tentatively have settled on
three possible federal crimes to investigate: theft from a
federally funded activity, mail fraud and false statements to FBI
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials were surprised by news of the expanded FBI
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's director of communications, said the FBI
has not contacted the campaign since last week when FBI director
Louis Freeh spoke with campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and assured
him the agency was taking the investigation seriously. She
questioned why details of the probe were leaked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that someone in Washington is not playing politics with
the investigation,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say they suspect the material was illegally obtained
by a junior staff member or -- more likely, they say -- by somebody
who gained access to McKinnon's firm through an editing company in
the same building. A security lapse may have given somebody the
opportunity to copy the material illegally, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bush aides say they don't think the FBI is pursuing
all avenues, particularly the editing firm that does business with
Democrats as well as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The developments were an unneeded distraction for the Bush
campaign as the first debate loomed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon told the Austin American-Statesman that questions to
him indicated the FBI was looking into the possibility that Bush
campaign officials had the package mailed as part of a scheme to
have the upcoming debates postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said any suggestion that the Bush campaign would send the
tape to Gore to throw doubt on the debates' credibility ''is
absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Saturday, ''I have full confidence in the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and attorneys from the public integrity section of the
Justice Department's criminal division are trying to decide whether
the case amounts to a violation of federal law. To be a federal
crime a theft from a federally supported activity must be valued at
more than $5,000.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Strom Thurmond Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond collapsed Saturday at a
restaurant in suburban Alexandria, Va., and has been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-year-old South Carolina Republican, the oldest person
ever to serve in the Senate, was first taken to Inova Alexandria
Hospital, and later transported to Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
Inova spokeswoman Rita Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond was in fair condition, Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of his problem was not immediately disclosed, but
Thurmond has been hospitalized several times in recent years for
various problems, including fatigue, and had prostate surgery in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   An Alexandria Fire Department spokeswoman, Sandy Flynn, said
Thurmond was taken by ambulance from a downtown restaurant to the
hospital at 1:40 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington television station reported that Thurmond was
stricken while dining with two friends. During the meal, the
senator had a glazed look, then lowered his head to the table and
said he needed to sleep, WRC-TV said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Swift, manager at the Southside 815 restaurant, said
Thurmond and the other men came in for lunch. ''He really looked
tired,'' Swift said. ''Basically as a precautionary measure, the
two gentlemen with him asked us to call an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambulance responded to a 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond aides did not immediately return telephone calls
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Thurmond was released from Walter Reed after a three-day
stay for what an aide said was a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that month, he was twice hospitalized for an upset
stomach and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, the longest-serving senator and oldest member of
Congress, was first elected to the Senate in 1954. When he was
re-elected to his eighth Senate term in November 1996, Thurmond
said it would be his last campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was always proud of his health, even into his upper 90s. But
starting in 1999, a succession of hospital visits called that into
question.

<HEADLINE> Life After 'Big Brother' Begins  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is there life after ''Big Brother?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the question facing contestants who spent weeks away from
civilization as houseguests of the CBS reality show.
</P>
<P>
   From marriage proposals to job searches, the contestants now
will find out what life on the outside has in store for them. If
the experiences of the castaways from the network's more successful
reality show ''Survivor'' are any guide, the houseguests will have
to deal with some newfound fame.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-day endurance test ended Friday with Eddie McGee, the
blunt New Yorker who lost his left leg to cancer, winning the top
prize of a half million dollars. The only plans McGee admitted to
was ''having a real great holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee outlasted nine other contestants who entered the specially
built house July 5 where their every move was followed by cameras
and microphones, with the frequently dull results airing as often
as six nights a week on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Californian Josh Souza won $100,000 as the second-place
finisher, and New York lawyer Curtis Kin won $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie, a former Seattle beauty contest winner and one of the
last to leave the house, said she was amazed to learn how viewers
had bonded with the group inside. Since returning to the real world
just days ago, she said, she has fielded a dozen marriage
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the contestants, she wouldn't reveal her last name.
</P>
<P>
   At a celebration attended by all 10 contestants after the show
ended, George, known for his outlandish costumes, came dressed as a
chicken, his hair dyed orange and hoping to parlay his stint on the
show into a job.
</P>
<P>
   Former houseguests Brittany and Karen said they have remained
close after being booted off the show and have both auditioned for
several acting roles. There was no word Saturday if they had landed
any parts.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who was once an exotic dancer, is writing a book on
feminism.
</P>
<P>
   The castaways from ''Survivor'' have signed book and film deals,
earned TV acting parts and walked down the red carpet at the 52nd
Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. Some have even filmed commercials
promoting CBS shows and co-hosted ''Live with Regis!''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Big Brother'' publicist Diane Ekeblad said the shows'
contestants are very different from those on ''Survivor,'' and
their desires -- and the success of those desires -- ''varies from
person to person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a little early to tell,'' she said. ''Now that the
show is over, we will be learning more.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the glory, reality-based show contestants must also
be able to handle the sometimes unflattering publicity as one
contestant already learned.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes School Construction  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, bemoaning what he said were
too many overcrowded and crumbling schools, pledged Saturday not to
budge from budget talks until Republicans set aside billions for
school construction and his education priorities.
</P>
<P>
   He also released a Department of Education study showing that at
least 60 percent of schools in the country need repairs and that
the work would cost an estimated $127 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton took aim at the
GOP-controlled Congress: ''Every day they stall is another day our
children are forced to go to school in trailers, overcrowded
classrooms and crumbling buildings. It's hard for students to lift
themselves up in schools that are falling down,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to leave the (negotiating) table until we
invest in modernizing our schools and continue our efforts to hire
100,000 quality teachers for smaller classes,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president supports legislation sponsored by Reps. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., and Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., to subsidize $24.8
billion in school construction bonds; the federal government would
provide tax credits for the interest normally paid on a bond.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, 60 percent of the money would go to states
based on school-age population, with the rest directed to the 125
school districts with the largest number of low-income students.
The estimated five-year cost is $1.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has 228 co-sponsors, a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also is seeking $1.3 billion in grants and interest-free
loans to help schools make emergency repairs at 5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that over five years that initiative would
help 25,000 schools repair roofs, heating and cooling systems, and
electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans oppose any new program that mandates how
schools spend federal money, and believe the plan would increase
the federal bureaucracy and control over local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee, faulted Clinton for a ''red-tape approach'' and
costs would rise by 15 percent under a requirement to pay
prevailing wage rates, as demanded by labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just wrong-headed to jack up the costs of school
construction when dollars are limited and the needs are so great,''
said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the need is urgent and widespread, and cited
several examples:
</P>
<P>
   --a Florida school where classes spill over to 12 trailers.
</P>
<P>
   --a New York school that holds 400 students over capacity.
</P>
<P>
   --a Virginia school with such poor electrical service that the
circuit breaker cuts off when a new computer is plugged into the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and Wyoming, according to the Education Department,
more than 80 percent of the schools are reported in need of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many states and local communities are working to fix their
schools, but too many school districts simply don't have the tax
base to handle the burden alone,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal year begins Sunday, although Congress voted to
keep government programs running through next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   School construction is a central issue in negotiations between
the White House and GOP leaders on the remaining budget bills for
fiscal 2001 that must be passed before Congress can adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress still hasn't sent me a budget for education and other
pressing priorities,'' Clinton said. ''Yet they have found the
time, first, to pass huge, fiscally irresponsible tax cuts, and
then after I vetoed them, to load up the spending bills with
hundreds of millions of dollars in special-interest projects.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, it's time to turn off the pork barrel spigot and deliver
for our children's future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shani Waugh Leads New Albany Golf  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ALBANY, Ohio (AP) -- Shani Waugh has never finished better
than fourth in 97 career LPGA events. Now she's 18 holes away from
her first title.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian shot a 6-under-par 66 Saturday, matching her
lowest competitive score ever, to lead defending champion Annika
Sorenstam by a shot heading into the final round of the New Albany
Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh, whose best finish this season is a tie for sixth at the
Rail Classic, stands at 12-under 204.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Waugh was in the final group on the last day
of a tournament, she turned in a 76 at the 1999 Jamie Farr Toledo
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam hit a 7-foot birdie putt on the closing hole to cap
her second consecutive 68. She is seeking her sixth victory of the
season in the last full-field tour event this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam came into the day ahead by a shot, but was passed on
the front side despite making the turn in 2 under.
</P>
<P>
   Brandie Burton went through the first nine in 6-under 30 to grab
the lead at 11 under, then gave it away with two bad holes.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, a captain's pick for next week's Solheim Cup, played the
last four holes on the front side in 4 under, including an eagle at
the par-5 sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   But she found the water on her wedge approach to the par-5 13th,
then missed a 15-footer for bogey. She then three-putted the next
hole to fall three shots behind Waugh, who broke free from a tie
for the top spot with Sorenstam by hitting a 9 iron to 4 feet for
birdie at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   After Sorenstam hit to 10 feet below the hole on the 16th, Waugh
stepped up and nearly spun a sand wedge in. Her 3-foot birdie putt
put her ahead by two strokes. Sorenstam cut that lead in half on
the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Burton birdied the 18th for a 68 that left her tied for third at
9 under with Beth Daniel and Scotland's Catriona Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Kuehne, Mi Hyun Kim, Heather Bowie, Donna Andrews and Lori
Kane all were another two strokes back.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Refuses Mediation Offer  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Preparing to face down the
opposition in the streets, President Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday
turned down an offer of Russian mediation, a U.S. official said.
The defiant Balkan leader declared Yugoslavs themselves ''will
decide our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spoke as the opposition unveiled plans for what they
hope will be nationwide work stoppages and blockades to force the
Yugoslav president to accept defeat by challenger Vojislav
Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition claims Kostunica won outright, but the government
insists he failed to take enough votes to avoid a runoff next
Sunday. The Federal Electoral Commission on Saturday formally
rejected all opposition challenges of alleged vote irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   That has raised fears of violence as the only way out of the
Yugoslav impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ease the situation, Russian President Vladimir
Putin offered on Saturday to send his foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, to Belgrade to try to defuse the showdown. However,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, however, said the Russians
should accept Milosevic's apparent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The only message Moscow should send, she said, was that the
Yugoslav president is ''finished.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reinforced that point later Saturday in a
half-hour telephone conversation with Putin. According to P.J.
Crowley, the spokesman for the National Security Council, ''both
leaders agreed that it is important for Milosevic to accept the
will of the Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Crowley, Putin told Clinton that his offer to send
Ivanov to meet both Milosevic and Kostunica had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official statement from the government whether
Milosevic had rejected the Russian offer. But at a speech Saturday
to the Yugoslav military academy, Milosevic said: ''We alone will
decide our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of opposition supporters gathered in Belgrade on
Saturday night to hear their leaders announce a general strike for
Monday and a limited road blockade Sunday as a ''dress rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No more big words, speeches and rallies,'' said Vuk Obradovic,
a former army general and now Milosevic opponent. ''Our message to
the police, to the army and to paramilitary units is that we are
not afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Obradovic suggested that if Milosevic sends his forces to
attack, crowds from elsewhere in the country would converge on the
capital. ''Not a single drop of blood must be shed,'' he added.
''We ask everybody to be peaceful and dignified.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, using figures from their poll watchers,
claim Kostunica won the election with 51.34 percent to 36.22
percent for Milosevic. But the Federal Electoral Commission, in a
tally criticized by the United States and other countries, says
Kostunica fell short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still controls the army and the police, traditional
pillars of his power. Seeking to shore up those bases, the Yugoslav
president addressed graduation ceremony Saturday at the Yugoslav
military academy and congratulated the newly commissioned officers
for serving ''at a time of great temptation for our people and
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance since last weekend's election,
Milosevic reminded the military of its duty to defend ''our freedom
and the independence of our country,'' which the government claims
is at risk because of alleged Western interference in the Yugoslav
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign forces will not dare attack us again, unless they try
to come here with an invitation from our domestic enemies,''
Milosevic said, referring to the opposition. ''Since foreign
military intervention or a war are out of the question, other means
of destruction of Yugoslavia are being mentioned -- psychological,
media and political pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Putin offered to send Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to
Belgrade to meet with both sides. Russia -- among Yugoslavia's
strongest allies -- has warned the West to avoid meddling in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Belgrade finds it possible, Russia would be prepared to
play a higher profile in the process of settlement and coordination
of positions,'' Putin said, according to the Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, however, insisted the Russians must tell Milosevic it
was time to give up power and that she would convey that message to
Ivanov by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Russians need to make clear that they understand
that this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,'' she
told reporters In Reykjavik, Iceland. ''The Russians need to
understand that Milosevic lost in this round. He is finished. It is
time for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have called for a peaceful civil disobedience
campaign, hoping to avoid provoking Milosevic into using the army
and police against them.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered protests and road blockades took place Saturday in
various parts of Serbia. Various professional associations have
also pledged to support the opposition. University and high school
students have announced they will join the general strike.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers, farmers and workers blocked several roads in different
parts of Serbia Saturday, some for only several hours as a warning
of a broader blockade on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Miners at the Kolubara coal mine, workers in Pancevo oil
refinery, railroad workers in the western Serbia have also decided
to go on strike until the authorities acknowledge the opposition
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition had filed several complaints of alleged
irregularities, chief among them that Milosevic supporters packed
ballot boxes in Kosovo with thousands of votes purportedly from
Kosovo Albanians. The United Nations, which administers the
province, said virtually all Kosovo Albanians boycotted the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Alabama 27, No. 23 S.Carolina 17  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Milo Lewis intercepted two
fourth-quarter passes and backup quarterback Andrew Zow revived a
sputtering offense as Alabama beat No. 23 South Carolina 27-17 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide (2-3, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) avoided
their first 1-4 start in 43 years and handed the Gamecocks (4-1,
2-1) their first loss of the season. Alabama has won all 10
meetings in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Zow, who lost the starting job after two games, entered on
Alabama's third series and never left. He sealed the victory with a
tackle-breaking 8-yard touchdown run with 4:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   That play was set up when Lewis stepped in front of Phil Petty's
pass and returned it 15 yards. A personal foul gave Alabama the
ball at South Carolina's 26.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Zow scrambled 11 yards to the 3. He scored
after a delay of game penalty pushed the Tide back.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, who didn't start because of a sprained ankle, twice
brought the Gamecocks back from 10-point deficits in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   He threw TD passes of 19 and 28 yards to Jermale Kelly. The
28-yarder, set up by Sheldon Brown's 36-yard interception return,
snapped a string of six straight incompletions, including Lewis'
first pick. It brought South Carolina to 20-17 with 10:20 left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama went three-and-out on its next series, but four plays
and a Gamecocks personal foul penalty later, Lewis came up with
another interception.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Ahmaad Galloway had put the Tide up 20-10 with a
62-yard run with 29 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He had gained just 15 yards on his first nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks, who had given up only 10 second-half points in
their first four games, allowed 17 to the Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Zow entered the game with a woeful 58.0 passing rating and
didn't play at all in last week's loss to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced Tyler Watts, who had completed his last five passes
after opening with an interception. Zow was 14-of-26 for 149 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Petty was the third quarterback used by Lou Holtz. He came in
with South Carolina facing first-and-10 at the Alabama 36. Petty
hit Jermale Kelly on a 15-yard pass and went to him again on a
19-yard TD strike.
</P>
<P>
   The drive was kept alive by Antione Smith's 19-yard run on a
fake punt.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, who didn't start because of a sprained ankle, took over
after Eric Kimrey and Dondrial Pinkins had alternated.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's 10-3 halftime lead was largely courtesy of missed
opportunities by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks opened the game with a 15-play drive, capped by
Reid Bethea's 48-yard field goal. South Carolina made it to the
Alabama 18 but was stalled after losing 13 yards on a high snap.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks failed to cash in on three trips inside the Tide
10, with Bethea missing attempts of 28 and 21 yards, and Marcus
Spencer picking off Kimrey's attempt.

<HEADLINE> Tiznow Wins $500K Super Derby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) -- Tiznow, an import from California,
broke the Louisiana Downs track and stakes record with an
impressive victory Saturday the $500,000 Super Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow, called his jockey Chris McCarron, ''the best 3-year-old
in the country right now,'' posted a time of 1:59.84 in the 1&AMP;frac14;-mile
race while turning back a challenge from Belmont Stakes winner
Commendable.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable, ridden by Pat Day, was second, beaten by six
lengths. Mass Market finished third.
</P>
<P>
   The old track and stakes record of 2:00.1 was shared by Gate
Dancer in 1984 and Mecke in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bad start, Tiznow went quickly to the lead followed by
Commendable. Tiznow started pulling away at the mile mark and
quickly widened his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I called on my horse, he just wasn't able to respond,''
Day said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, posting his third victory in seven starts, paid
$3.60, $2.20 and $2.10 as the heavy favorite. Commendable returned
$2.80 and $2.10, and Mass Market paid $2.10 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Clever Brick was fourth, followed by Chris's Bad Boy and White
Star.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiznow has such long strides,'' said McCarron, a three-time
winner ofd the race. ''He is extremely deceptive,''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron did not go to his whip and said his only anxious moment
was at the start when Tiznow, owned by Michael Cooper and Cecilia
Straub-Rubens, hopped coming out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He recovered quickly and was able to get his position,''
McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   It was another disappointing loss for Commendable, but trainer
D. Wayne Lukas didn't appear concerned. The colt has not won since
his triumph June 10 in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see him keep improving,'' said Lukas, who is
mulling entering him in one of the Breeder's Cup races later this
fall.

<HEADLINE> Larry Nelson Leads Vantage Seniors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) -- Larry Nelson closed in on his fourth
victory in five starts, shooting a 7-under-par 63 Saturday to take
a two-shot lead at the Vantage Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the Senior PGA Tour's leading money-winner with more
than $2 million, broke a tour record with his 28th straight round
of par or better.
</P>
<P>
   Three others shared the previous record of 27 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has a two-round total of 11-under 129. Gil Morgan, the
1998 Vantage champion, shot a 65 to get to 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who began the second round one shot off the lead,
birdied the third, fourth and sixth holes. Nelson held on to the
lead the rest of the round after a birdie on the difficult uphill
par-4 10th combined with a Morgan bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Summerhays, who bogeyed his last two holes, tied Nelson
briefly at 8 under. But Nelson strung together birdies on 14, 15
and 16 to take a two-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had a chance to tie the tournament record of 62, but
missed a 5-foot birdie putt at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dent and first-round co-leader Isao Aoki are tied at 8 under
heading into Sunday's final round. Dent shot his second straight 66
and earned $34,000 as he won the two-round Georgia-Pacific Senior
Series tournament for players 60 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Overturf, another first-round co-leader, shot a 68 and is a
7 under with Tom Wargo.
</P>
<P>
   Summerhays, who shot a 68, and Bruce Fleisher (67) are five
shots back. Hale Irwin (66) and Gary McCord (66) are among five
players at 5 under.

<HEADLINE> Texas ACLU Files Suit Over Drug Bust  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two law enforcement agents and a district
attorney are beings sued their roles in an arrest stemming from a
drug bust that has prompted allegations of racial discrimination in
northwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three people were arrested in the 1999 bust in Tulia, all
but three of them black.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit was filed by the Texas American Civil
Liberties Union on behalf of Yul Bryant, who was arrested in July
1999 for allegedly selling cocaine. His case was dismissed after
District Attorney Terry McEachern found out undercover agent Thomas
Coleman was not certain he had bought cocaine from Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses McEachern, Coleman and Sheriff Larry Stewart
of falsely arresting, imprisoning and prosecuting Bryant, who is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ''These unlawful actions were part of a deliberate plan, scheme
and policy of targeting members of the African-American community
of Swisher County, Texas and removing them from the area using the
legal system,'' the lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Stewart prepared a list of local
citizens and others he considered ''undesirables'' before enacting
a policy to strong-arm them out of Swisher County. Most of the
people listed are black, the lawsuit claims, and McEachern was part
of Stewart's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was put to work as an ''undercover agent'' to try and
help Stewart, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart would not comment on the lawsuit. Coleman did not
immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   McEachern, who prosecuted many of the drug cases, said that he
doesn't believe he did anything wrong and that he dismissed the
case as soon as he found out Coleman was not sure Bryant had sold
him the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 residents of the community of 5,000 rallied Friday at
the Capitol as Will Harrell, executive director of Texas American
Civil Liberties Union, announced the lawsuit. Bryant is seeking $2
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Of those arrested in the same drug bust as Bryant, 17 have
pleaded guilty and 11 have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   LaWanda Smith said she pleaded guilty to one count of delivering
a controlled substance because she was afraid of the sentence she
might receive if she went to trial. She denies selling drugs to
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never met the guy,'' she said. ''Not ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Barrow, a 48-year-old truck driver from Tulia, was at the
rally because his two brothers were arrested in the bust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm beginning to wonder now who's on the second list. Am I?''
Barrow asked. ''Do we need to be getting out of town?''

<HEADLINE> Students and community members rally to protest Nader's exclusion from the debates </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ZACHARIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Students and community activists tried to drum
up support for Ralph Nader by giving a clearer picture of the Green
Party's presidential candidate during a rally Saturday at
Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the midday event attended by about 450 people
included local college students, activists and actress Susan
Sarandon. They hailed Nader, who is lagging in the polls behind Al
Gore and George W. Bush, while saying he deserved to be included in
the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vote for Nader is a vote for possibility,'' said Johanna
Fernandez - a graduate student at Columbia University who spoke at
the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she wanted to counteract the concept that a vote
for Nader is actually a vote for Bush, which she called a ''scare
tactic employed by the gatekeepers of the Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
   She questioned whether Republican and Democrat policies are that
different. She said that over the past eight years of the Clinton
administration, prison populations have soared while federal funds
that provide abortions for low-income women were drastically cut -
making the service unavailable for many women.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was impressed by the energy of the crowd, saying the
atmosphere was ''reflective of the new mood of young people'' who
don't want to continue reproducing ''the rightward trajectory of
American politics over the past 30 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An organizer said although Nader will likely not be included in
the debates, some networks may cover his direct responses to the
questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Those present wanted to stress that ''there is a s0970-----

<HEADLINE> Cloned Cow on Auction Block  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Her chest is broad, her legs and back
straight, and she has ''an excellent mammary system,'' her owner
says. Mandy may be one of a kind, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   An exact copy of the champion Holstein cow will be auctioned
this week in what is believed to be the first time a farm animal
has been cloned for commercial sale.
</P>
<P>
   The first calf clone or clones -- several now are growing in the
wombs of surrogate cattle -- are expected to fetch $50,000 to
$100,000 at Friday's auction at the World Dairy Expo in Madison,
Wis., the dairy industry's biggest trade show.
</P>
<P>
   The cloning is a project of Infigen Inc., an international
leader in cloning technology. Infigen, based in DeForest, Wis.,
owns its own herd of cloned cattle, which are used to produce
genetically engineered proteins for pharmaceuticals. Until now, no
one has tried to clone the animals for commercial use by farmers
and breeders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason it hasn't been done before is that the technology
hasn't been there to do it,'' said Kenneth Olson, a specialist in
animal genetics with the American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle embryos have been cloned before, but no one has made an
exact duplicate of an adult cow and put it up for sale, said
Xiangzhong Yang, director of the Transgenic Animal Facility at the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The efficiency and cost is a major obstacle,'' he said.
Research in cloning animals for agricultural purposes has been slow
because funds have gone toward pharmaceutical and medical uses of
the animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Infigen's process involves activating an unfertilized egg by
removing the nucleus, fusing the egg with a cell from the same
animal's ear, and then using a chemical compound to trigger a
release of calcium that causes the egg to divide and grow; the
resulting embryo is implanted in a surrogate cow.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the embryos do not develop properly. So
far, the company claims a success rate of no more than 5 percent
but believes that is good enough to take it commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Given that success rate, dairy industry experts say the process
still costs too much to attract broad demand.
</P>
<P>
   Infigen expects to charge about $25,000 per clone. But company
officials believe breeders wanting to duplicate champion bulls and
cows will show enough interest so the business can get off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the company continues to perfect its cloning process, the
price will come down, said Jesus Martinez, Infigen's director of
marketing. Infigen announced an agreement in August to provide
cloned bulls to an Ohio company that sells cattle genetics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now this is still an expensive way of doing business,
but we've been able to replicate it enough that we'll be able to
take it commercial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy, age 8, is a senior citizen by cattle standards. But she
has won major awards in the United States and Canada since she was
a calf. Her owner, Ron Bader of Orangeville, Ill., paid $100,000
for her when she was 2.
</P>
<P>
   While she can produce about 3,300 gallons of milk a year, about
twice the national average for a cow, her main value is as a
breeder. She regularly is mated with prize bulls, and the
fertilized embryos are removed and placed in surrogate cows for
additional breeding. The calves sell for $15,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a very, very consistent performer,'' Bader said,
referring to Mandy's long list of awards. ''That's the kind of
genetics you want in your herd.''
</P>
<P>
   Bader said he was skeptical of cloning when he was approached by
Infigen about making a Mandy copy, but decided to go ahead after
visiting the company's herd. ''You get an exact duplicate. That was
what impressed me.''

<HEADLINE> Adirondacks look to weed out plant invaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) - Along the highway, a stand of purple
loosestrife might look appealing but it's a tough and unwanted
customer that threatens native species and nature's balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the 6-million acre Adirondack Park, state and private groups
are banding together to make sure invading plants don't get a
toehold in the mountain range and start to push out plants vital to
the local ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Invasive plants form a stand of one species that out-competes
other types of plants,'' said Nina Schoch, program coordinator for
the Adirondack Nature Conservancy, one of the groups battling the
invaders. ''It doesn't provide a diversity of habitat that a
variety of animals needs to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey in 1998 and 1999, the Nature Conservancy found few
unwanted plants in remote areas but discovered pockets of 10
species including garlic mustard, purple loosestrife, common reed
grass and Japanese knotweed near roadways.
</P>
<P>
   The spread is not rampant and those concerned with the
wilderness area want to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the plants will start along roadsides where they
have begun to take hold. The state Department of Transportation
will use straw instead of mulch on projects, reducing the chance of
''hitchhiker'' seeds that often come in the mulch.
</P>
<P>
   DOT workers also are looking at ways to manually destroy the
nonnative species, including burying them under a geotextile fabric
or pulling them up by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are getting assistance from other state agencies like
the Department of Environmental Conservation and from residents who
can adopt a roadside and remove the plants.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Strom Thurmond Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, at 97 the oldest person
to serve in the Senate, appeared ''to be doing very well'' at a
hospital Saturday after collapsing at a restaurant in suburban
Alexandria, Va., his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center have not determined
why he collapsed, but ''more than likely his condition can be
attributed to dehydration,'' spokeswoman Genevieve Erny said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, R-S.C., will remain hospitalized through Sunday for
observation, but ''he appears to be doing very well,'' Erny said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond has been hospitalized several times in recent years for
various problems, including fatigue, and had prostate surgery in
1999. Erny said the collapse was unrelated to previous illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandria Fire Department spokeswoman Sandy Flynn said Thurmond
was taken by ambulance from a downtown restaurant to Inova
Alexandria Hospital at 1:40 p.m. EDT. He was later transported to
Walter Reed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond was lunching with a staffer and an acquaintance when he
began to feel tired and fainted, Erny said. ''He did momentarily
lose consciousness for a second or two,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really looked tired,'' said Christopher Swift, manager of
the Southside 815 restaurant. ''Basically as a precautionary
measure, the two gentlemen with him asked us to call an
ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambulance responded to a 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Thurmond was released from Walter Reed after a three-day
stay for what an aide said was a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that month, he was twice hospitalized for an upset
stomach and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, the longest-serving senator and oldest member of
Congress, was first elected to the Senate in 1954. When he was
re-elected to his eighth Senate term in November 1996, Thurmond
said it would be his last campaign. His term expires in January
2003.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been proud of his health, even into his upper 90s.
But starting in 1999, a succession of hospital visits called that
into question.

<HEADLINE> Report: Many New York children in federal insurance program ineligible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Up to half of the roughly 538,000 New York
children enrolled in a federal health care plan are ineligible and
will be removed from the plan over the next several months, The New
York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some families began receiving notices several weeks ago that
their children would be removed from the Children's Health
Insurance Program as early as Sunday and that they must apply for
Medicaid, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance executives and advocates for the poor told The
Times that thousands of New York children were wrongly placed in
the program largely because participating insurance plans did not
steer families into Medicaid even when it was clear they belonged
there.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives said the state Health Department did not
instruct them to screen applicants for Medicaid eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Health knew exactly what we were doing,''
said Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which insures 96,000 state children
enrolled in the program. ''There is no secret about this. And there
is no question that it is going to create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, a spokesman for the state Health Department, said
the problems arose because time was needed to iron out the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously our top priority is to get children the health
insurance they need and deserve,'' Signor said. ''The federal
government is now forcing states to move children who are eligible
for Medicaid into that program.'' He estimated that about 22
percent of the children would have to be moved, but insurers and
others put the figure closer to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Signor disputed Stocker's numbers, saying the insurance company
has a vested interest in keeping children off Medicaid rolls
because the insurance company is not reimbursed for Medicaid
clients. He also pointed out the health department's $10 million
investment in facilitators at 34 locations that will help children
enroll in the proper insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carl McCall warned the Health Department
several times over the last few years that it was enrolling too
many children who belonged in Medicaid, the newspaper said. The
department responded to a 1998 audit by assuring McCall's office
that it was requiring insurance carriers to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The program was intended to insure children from low-income
families whose incomes are too high for Medicaid but too low to
afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   New York, where the program is known as Child Health Plus, is
one of 10 states that have established a significant program so
far. New York's enrolled children comprise roughly one quarter of
all children in the program nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The federal insurance program was approved by Congress in 1997
and is reimbursed by the federal government at a higher rate than
Medicaid. New York gets a 65 percent reimbursement, compared with
50 percent for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is examining whether New York state may
owe it money, The Times said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Film Honored in Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- A dark comedy set in rural Mexico,
''The Ruination of Men'' (La Perdicion de los Hombres), took the
top prize Saturday at the San Sebastian Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
