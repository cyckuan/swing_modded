ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL AMENDMENTS ADDED TO DEFENSE MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Military spending bills before Congress this week are being
loaded with unrelated environmental amendments that could block
formation of a new national park in Arizona and prevent enforcement
of the federal Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said senators were using the must-pass
bills to carry language that otherwise would not pass. And House
GOP moderates circulated a letter saying the provisions ``would be
a serious procedural, political and policy mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the riders, proposed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would
give the Air Force permanent control of the Barry M. Goldwater
Gunnery Range in southwestern Arizona. Environmentalists recently
proposed that the 2.7 million-acre range be included in a proposed
Sonoran Desert National Park when the military no longer needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ives, a McCain spokeswoman, said she couldn't comment
about the rider because of secrecy rules imposed by the Senate
Armed Services Committee about next year's defense authorization
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ives said she was unable to answer why McCain submitted the
amendment, or why it was not brought up in the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, which has handled similar legislation
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Another rider, proposed by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., was
beaten back temporarily by environmentalists. It would have placed
a moratorium on creation of ``critical habitat'' for plants and
animals on the federal Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   Critical habitat rules not only protect endangered species and
where they live, they protect lands where endangered species have
been driven out but could again repopulate. In Arizona, this could
affect protections for endangered owls in both the forests and
deserts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Domenici withdrew his rider from an $11.6 billion
emergency spending bill providing military aid to Kosovo and
humanitarian aid to Central America. However, he said the proposal
would be resurrected as a separate bill in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said his plan would prevent creation of critical
habitat until recovery plans are completed for endangered species.
Environmentalists contend that federal officials have delayed
recovery plans because Congress fails to provide the money to
complete them, meaning there will be more delays in establishing
critical habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other riders are being piled onto the Kosovo/disaster
aid bill:
</P>
<P>
   An effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., to block the listing
the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species. He says such a
listing would restrict dredging in the state's waterways,
threatening the timber industry and other industries that ship
their products on barges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was trying to overturn a court
ruling that mining companies can't expand their milling operations
on public lands. Environmentalists complain those operations
pollute water. The ruling affects the Crown Jewel gold mine in
Gorton's state and other Western hard-rock mines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, wants to prevent the National
Park Service from phasing out commercial fishing in the waters off
Glacier Bay National Park until courts decide the issue.
Environmentalists say that could take years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's amendment helped prompt memos and letters to Sen. John
Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee:
</P>
<P>
   John Leshy, solicitor to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a
former Arizona governor, said new agreements between Interior and
the Air Force already are in progress that would govern management,
cleanup and the length of renewal of military uses of the range.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of eight national and Arizona-based environmental groups
signed a joint letter to Warner opposing McCain's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we recognize that the vast majority of these lands will
likely continue to serve as important training grounds for our
armed forces,'' the environmentalists' letter said, ``we believe
that the Department of Defense, working with the Interior
Department, can fulfill its training mission, while better
providing for the protection of the natural and cultural
resource(s).''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists questioned why McCain is trying to permanently
amend the status of the Goldwater range. &QL;

PATAKI DEFENDS TOUGHER GRADUATION TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday strongly defended
the stiffer graduation requirements that state education officials
are seeking to impose on nearly all public high school students,
and suggested that lawmakers should not try to water them down.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's comments could lead to a fight with members of the
Legislature, where there is growing bipartisan opposition to the
new standards. Lawmakers contend that the new requirements are
being phased in too quickly and do not provide an accurate measure
of students' overall academic abilities. The legislators also fear
that the failure and dropout rates in their own districts could be
high.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, in response to questions from reporters,
Pataki defended the new requirements. ``I think one of the most
important things we have to do is have high standards,'' the
governor said, ``and I think it's about time that we're finally
looking to elevate and raise standards in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he was concerned about the sentiment among lawmakers
to soften the new standards. ``Let me make it clear,'' he told
reporters at an impromptu news conference outside the State
Capitol. ``We should not back down one iota from our efforts to
raise students' performance standards in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's response drew immediate fire from lawmakers, many of
whom are under mounting pressure from parents, teachers and school
administrators in their districts to scale back the new
requirements, lest seniors fail in large numbers. Some lawmakers
say they fear that as many as 20 percent of seniors may be unable
to pass the new standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor is wrong, but it's a debate worth
having,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic Assemblyman from
Westchester County who has proposed allowing school districts to
use alternative standards in place of the new exams being required
for graduation. ``Standardized testing should not be the sole
measure of whether a kid has met the academic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents, the body charged with setting educational
policy for the state, and the state education commissioner have
announced that beginning next year, students will have to pass a
more rigorous English Regents exam to earn a high school diploma.
In later years, students will have to pass similar standardized
tests in four other subjects: math; American history and
government, global studies and science.
</P>
<P>
   The state first offered the Regents exam in 1879 as a standard
for colleges to use in evaluating high school graduates. But until
now, students needed only to pass a less rigorous competency test
to graduate, and only a minority have passed the more difficult
Regents exams; in New York City, fewer than 25 percent pass the
Regents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Board of Regents, under the leadership of the state's
education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has argued that under the
old two-tiered testing system, some students have excelled
academically while others have graduated unprepared for college or
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and the Regents are not simply requiring students to pass
the Regents exams to graduate. They also say that they are making
the exams considerably harder.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers opposed to the new tests say that they generally
support the Regents' effort to raise academic performance. Their
main concern, they say, is that the tests do not fully measure the
academic ability of students, and that many school districts,
particularly poor ones, lack the resources to prepare low-achieving
students to take the new tests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon
Silver, who is the Republican governor's main rival in the
Legislature, used the debate over the graduation requirements to
make the case on Wednesday for one of his main legislative
priorities: providing more money to school districts to help them
prepare students better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we talking only about tests?'' asked Silver, a
Democrat from Manhattan, adding: ``Let's start debating the issues
of what standards we need them to meet and what resources we have
to provide to them. That's what's lost in the debate. Where are the
resources?''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who has attacked the governor in the past for proposing
deep cuts for some education programs, also said: ``I don't have a
problem with having tests. What I am saying is that the debate
should not be whether the standards are too high or too low.''

LPGA EVENT SEEMS HEADED FOR LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Legacy Golf Resort, a layout in south Phoenix that
won't open until mid-October, apparently is the new front-runner to
host the LPGA's Standard Register PING next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although tournament organizers said an agreement has not been
struck, ``The Arizona Republic'' confirmed through the Legacy's
architect and developer that only a few minor details are holding
up completion of the deal. The course would house the event in 2000
while its permanent site, Moon Valley Country Club, is recovering
from a renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developer has made it real attractive for them, but I
guess they have to wait for some kind of approval from the LPGA,''
said architect Gary Panks, who has met with the Standard Register
PING tournament committee on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that meant the tournament would get the course for
free, Panks said, ``That's the way I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry Graham, who is chairing the site selection committee
for the Standard Register PING, said that the Legacy is one of
``three options, maybe more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Legacy) is definitely a consideration, but we absolutely
have not made a final decision,'' Graham said. ``We expect a member
of the LPGA field staff to be here next week, and we can review
that course along with several others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legacy, which is located next to the Raven at South Mountain
just off Baseline Road, is a joint venture involving Arizona-based
Sunbelt Holdings and Carefree Partners, as well as Shell Vacations
of Chicago. Sunbelt Holdings President John Graham is the stepson
of Kerry Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that's a guarantee we'll get it,'' John Graham
said of the relationship. ``But at the same time, it might prove
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more importance, the Legacy comes the closest to matching the
Standard Register PING's three criteria:
</P>
<P>
   A quality course with adequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Location that is geographically acceptable to volunteers and
fans.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's charity, the Samaritan Foundation, will not be
jeopardized. The tournament raises between $350,000 and $800,000
annually for breast cancer research and education.
</P>
<P>
   The Legacy is a big surprise, as is another of the possible
sites, the Anthem Country Club course by Del Webb just north of
Phoenix. Both courses are still in the construction stage and came
into the search late.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible choice is the Karsten Course at Arizona
State, which was among the original three choices, including
Phoenix Country Club and the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix Country Club has turned down the LPGA event twice,
and the TPC never was in the running.
</P>
<P>
   John Graham said he hopes that the clincher will be that the
Legacy is offering a quality course with more than adequate
facilities for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much want it, and at this point, that's very
meaningful to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Panks said the Legacy should be in ``perfect shape by the time
the tournament rolls around'' in March. Plus, he pointed out, there
will be on-site housing in the way of time-share condominiums, a
good-size clubhouse and an ``excellent practice facility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is well-suited for the ladies at a little over
6,000 yards, and visually the fairways are depressed, so it's good
for the fans' viewing, too,'' Panks said. ` &QL;

GRUDZIELANEK TRIES TO IRON THINGS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek arrived at
Dodger Stadium on Wednesday and found his name on a spot on the
lineup card _ among the extra position players available against
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight game, and eighth time in the last 20
games, Grudzielanek wasn't in the starting lineup. Jose Vizcaino is
instead the shortstop of choice.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Grudzielanek would have panicked, but recently
manager Davey Johnson has taken time to talk to Grudzielanek near
the batting cage or in the dugout. Johnson said it's not a
permanent move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting way too much rest,'' Grudzielanek said. ``It's one
of those things that it's a feeling-out process with me and
(Johnson), and I'm trying to get an understanding of what he wants
and I'm trying to learn a few things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely hard. I can't say I like the situation, but
he's letting me know how things are and the way things are going to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wants Grudzielanek to be more selective at the plate and
hit more balls on the ground. The two spent much of Tuesday's
batting practice session talking. That altered greatly from the
first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was more irritable or (angry) at him when he didn't
talk to me,'' Grudzielanek said. ``The last few days he's been very
talkative and explaining to me what he wants me to do. I'd be a
nervous wreck if he didn't say anything to me. It's the lazy fly
balls and the pitches I shouldn't try to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is looking for a No. 2 hitter, and Grudzielanek's been
given an opportunity in spurts. He has walked just twice from the
second spot. Grudzielanek also isn't taking many pitches, which
doesn't afford Eric Young the chance to steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   But Grudzielanek, who's hitting .257, points to his All-Star
season of 1996 when he hit .306 with Montreal. Most of that was
done from the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like (Grudzielanek) was getting a few bad habits at the
plate,'' Johnson said. ``Vizcaino has done a good job. When
(Grudzielanek) starts doing what he is capable of doing, he'll be
my shortstop. That's nothing against Jose (Vizcaino).''
</P>
<P>
   White sits: Dodgers center fielder Devon White, sidelined with a
hamstring strain, all but ruled himself out of Friday's game in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I would have to say no (to being ready Friday), but
I might go visit the wizard tomorrow and then you never know,''
White said. ``It's just tightness.''
</P>
<P>
   White injured his right leg Sunday against the Florida Marlins
and was hoping to be ready for the three-game series with the
Cardinals. Today's day off will help him, but White said he's only
at 70 percent and wouldn't even be ready to pinch hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel good, I might not even go that day,'' said White,
who's jogging in the outfield and getting treatment. ``It's getting
tired much quicker than it should.''
</P>
<P>
   White's unavailability leaves the Dodgers with three healthy
outfielders _ Gary Sheffield, Todd Hollandsworth and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Right-hander Antonio Osuna said his
pitching elbow felt fine even though the Dodgers coaches thought
his velocity was down during his four-run, one-third inning of
pitching Tuesday. Osuna, who has a bone spur on his elbow, remains
optimistic he can pitch through the pain. The Dodgers said the
situation will eventually work itself out. . . . The Dodgers
entered the series finale with the Cubs with a 9-8 mark at home and
9-7 on the road. ``It revolves around pitching,'' Johnson said.

 SPORTS COLUMN: SPEECHES DON'T SCORE POINTSsco` (xx) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boulder came rolling down on Tim Hardaway and the
Miami Heat on Wednesday night, from the top of the mountain on
which Pat Riley preaches. All the coaching axioms about force,
work, desire and playing with pain merged into this huge rock that
landed on Riley's team the way so many of their shots crashed into
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two to 2. That's what the Knicks had to say about a Miami
playoff dream hinging on guts and will and one significantly shaky
knee. That was their riot of a run, from late in the second
quarter, into the third. Wednesday night's 97-73 Knicks victory at
Madison Square Garden made the score in this first-round series two
blowouts for the Knicks, one wrestling match for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   These things can change, but Riley better have a couple of jump
shooters in his pocket along with Friday night's motivational
speech. Or he had better have a miracle cure for Hardaway's wounded
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The hard way. That's how the Heat is trying to compete with a
team that is no longer a mirror image of itself, a team with
weapons. That's how the Heat is learning that their ticket to the
playoffs as the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference is worth
as much as a typical Miami possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the seedings _ I don't know about one versus
eight,'' Riley said. ``This isn't the typical-type season, as
you've had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He picked a fine time to realize this. People said the Knicks
were not a typical eighth-seeded team, but the real story here is
that the Heat isn't what you'd call your standard No. 1. Yet for
one extra home game, Riley drove his players, particularly
Hardaway, through 50 games in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he see his point guard, his one authentic perimeter
threat, dragging his knee through the second half of the season?
After so many playoff wars, didn't he know that the Knicks or any
other playoff team would match Miami's nightly effort come the
playoffs? Hardaway, a shell of his once explosive self, played in
every Heat game, except the last one in New York. He should've
taken a long rest, or at least a few games off, like Patrick Ewing.
Now Riley and the Heat are paying a price as stiff as Hardaway's
knee.
</P>
<P>
   The pint-sized shooting point guard took 8 shots on Wednesday
night, made 1. He is now 6 for 32 in the series. He walks away from
any questions about the right knee, but there is no first step, no
crossover dribble, none of the stop-on-a-dime elevation that has
tormented the Knicks so many times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Timmy can play his game,'' said Alonzo Mourning, a
statement predicated on blind loyalty or wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway took 19 shots in Game 1, made 4. Riley sat him down and
suggested there had to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on Tim about getting better shots after the first game,
about not always settling for the long jumper,'' said Bob McAdoo,
Riley's assistant, who hoisted a few jumpers in his own playing
days. ``We told him he had to trust the other guys, break the
defense down, create open looks for them.'' Hardaway collected 11
assists, the Heat won by 10.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck winning the series with the collection of castoffs,
much less the title. Good luck with the likes of the game but
broken down Dan Majerle, whose jersey was soaked with perspiration
from chasing Allan Houston five minutes into the game. Good luck
with Jamal Mashburn, who makes Marcus Camby look like Charles
Oakley. Good luck with Keith Askins and Clarence Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   McAdoo said Hardaway didn't trust his Miami teammates when he
joined this team in 1996. As a Golden State Warrior, he once looked
around and saw the young Chris Mullin and Mitch Richmond and even
Latrell Sprewell. On Wednesday night, he passed the ball to
Mashburn, who launched tentative jumpers that grazed the rim. He
gave the ball to P.J. Brown, who dropped it under the basket. He
set Mourning up for a drive and the raging center charged face
first into the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The butchered possessions mounted and the Knicks ran away and
there was nothing Hardaway could do, so he got into it with Chris
Childs in the fourth quarter and suggested they meet outside the
Garden. That was frustration talking. Hardaway was ejected for that
and later in the locker room said, ``Man, I'm not talking.''
</P>
<P>
   He was always Miami's best hope against the Knicks and now all
he can do is pass the ball to Riley's castoffs and hope it somehow
goes in. Riley should have seen this coming, should have given this
man some rest. &QL;

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State's desire to host an NCAA baseball
regional may not only hinge on its weekend series with Arizona, but
on a Pac-10 meeting 350 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California, which hosts Washington Friday through
Sunday, is one of three conference teams that submitted bids for
regional sites. With the NCAA expected to award just two of its 16
sites to Pac-10 teams, and Stanford a lock for one, USC and ASU
appear to be in a battle for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions we make are always the target of criticism,''
said Le Moyne College Athletic Director Dick Rockwell, chairman of
the NCAA Tournament selection committee. ``It's always easy to
throw stones when you're on the outside. To put all this in
perspective, the ultimate goal would be to balance the regionals
geographically, have full houses at every game and to provide the
student-athletes with positive experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell wouldn't specifically address the Sun Devils' chances
but stressed the committee has not made up its mind.
</P>
<P>
   He will join the eight other committee members on a conference
call Monday morning to determine the first-round sites. Stanford,
which has won 10 straight and sits first in the Pac-10, is expected
to be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (31-22, 15-6 Pac-10), who took two of three from the
Sun Devils (38-19, 11-10) this season and are guaranteed to finish
higher in the conference, appear to have the edge. But if ASU
finishes strong this weekend and the Trojans struggle, the Sun
Devils might get a nod based on their overall record and their
ability to attract more fans.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that submitted bids were required to guaranteed $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be looking at a lot of factors,'' Rockwell
said. ``With the field expanded from 48 to 64 teams, there will be
new challenges. Are we going to make mistakes? Absolutely. Are we
going to make mistakes on purpose? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's chances to host would improve significantly if the
committee decided to give the conference three sites. Rockwell said
no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters if the Sun Devils struggle against the
Wildcats (31-20), who are in a three-way tie with ASU and
Washington for fourth place and also are hoping for a postseason
bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it will take (to earn a spot),'' Arizona
Coach Jerry Stitt said. ``Our guys just know how important this
series is and we hope they play the best they've played all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have struggled recently, losing four of their past
six. The Sun Devils have rebounded from five straight losses with
victories in six of their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Pat Murphy came away with a good feeling about his
team after it took two of three from Washington in Seattle last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they showed tremendous resiliency in adverse
conditions,'' he said. ``They showed a lot of guts. To defeat the
defending Pac-10 champs two of three on the road helped us gain
some confidence.'' &QL;

ANDERSON WORKING OFF THE RUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Brian Anderson, determined to be an asset for the
Diamondbacks, basically is making his two weeks with Triple-A
Tucson his spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can come down here and be mad and bitter, and two weeks go
by and I've not accomplished a thing,'' he said. ``Or I go down and
work hard, do what is asked of you, and be prepared when you come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander is taking the latter approach.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who was sent to the farm team Saturday after compiling
an 0-1 record and 9.58 ERA in eight appearances out of the bullpen,
is starting for Tucson and building stamina. He threw 40 pitches in
his first start Monday, gave up four hits and one earned run, and
struck out three and walked none in 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little rust,'' he said. ``I just need to get back
out there and pitch regularly. That's how I have to pitch to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson threw a personal-best 208 innings as a starter last
year, when he won 12 games and had a 4.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of free agents  &UR; Randy Johnson, Todd
Stottlemyre and  &UR; Armando Reynoso, Anderson moved into the bullpen,
where his workload was greatly reduced, even in spring training. He
pitched 10 innings in one month with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing once a week, I was pretty useless,'' he said. ``I was
just taking an inning here and there in meaningless games. I was
not doing anybody any good in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson isn't sure what role he'll assume when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   He has been assured by Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter that he'll have
two more starts, the next one Saturday in Omaha, then he'll rejoin
the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he'll throw about 65 pitches Saturday and up to 85
in his third start with Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there is a good chance that I'll come back as a
reliever, doing the same thing,'' Anderson said. ``I'll at least
have some outings. I'll be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have to do to get well. I just wasn't getting it
done. I understand. I agree with them.'' &QL; 
Day by day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sidewinders outfielder  &UR; Jason Conti, who earned Organizational
Player of the Year honors last year as a loan player to Double-A
Tulsa, took his 20-game hitting streak in stride. It was broken
Tuesday in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about it until I got to 15,'' Conti said.
``A couple of reporters asked me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conti was selected Howe Sportsdata Player of the Week for May
3-9 for hitting .556 (10 for 18) with eight RBIs. The 24-year-old
is putting no timetable on reaching the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just work on what I have to do down here,'' he said.
``Whatever happens, happens. If somebody goes down, I'll be ready.
But I don't wish anybody to get hurt.'' &QL; 
Short hops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tucson pitcher  &UR; Nelson Figueroa was named the Organizational
Pitcher of the Month. He made four starts in April, winning three,
giving up 11 earned runs and striking out 20 in 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman  &UR; Jarrod Patterson of Double-A El Paso is the
Organizational Player of the Month for April, after hitting .380
with 10 double, 16 RBIs and a .648 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Jeff Andrews (0-3, 6.37 ERA in six starts) moved
from Class A High Desert to El Paso, replacing pitcher
 &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim, who is expected to make his first appearance with
Tucson on Friday. &QL;

   RUBIN-SUMMERS (Washington) _ Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, who was nominated on Wednesday to succeed Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, arrived in Washington six years ago with a
reputation for brilliance and an equal reputation for intolerance

<P>
   Some casual four-wheel-drive trips turn nasty. They'll lull you
into contentment, then suddenly produce fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Road 677 is one of those roads. It's tame as can be a
good part of the drive, then grows horns and sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   I first heard about it from Tom Woods, a former Arizona Game and
Fish commissioner who four-wheels extensively with his wife, Sally,
in their built-up Ford Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   Woods told of a beautiful drive through rolling hills and upper
desert grasslands. He also told of a stretch going into Sycamore
Creek that was difficult for the average off-highway driver.
</P>
<P>
   The road can be reached at two places north of Phoenix off
Interstate 17. The first place is Bloody Basin Road, where you go
east about eight miles to the first major turnoff to the left,
which is marked as 677. The road comes out at Dugas Road to the
north. Sycamore Creek is just a few miles from Dugas Road.
</P>
<P>
   Both roads are clearly marked at I-17 exits.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said to start the trip off Bloody Basin Road and go north.
Going south off Dugas Road, he said, would be a real problem. That
statement was absolutely correct.
</P>
<P>
   I talked about 677 with Ed Fouts of Phoenix, who turned 83 on
Mother's Day. Fouts probably has covered more backcountry in
Arizona than any other man. He lives to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered hunting deer off that road. His first trip over it
was almost 40 years ago. We agreed to go from the Bloody Basin
side, accepting that Woods was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts took his Jeep, which has lockers on both axles and great
ground clearance. My stock S-10 Chevy Blazer was in for tough but
not destructive times.
</P>
<P>
   This was a beautiful drive through the grasslands with a great
view of the imposing Bradshaw Mountains to the west. Quail were
plentiful. The road was descent for high-clearance vehicles. Rock
outcroppings demanded some maneuvering along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The slopes leading into washes had eroded badly, leaving big
rock outcroppings that were rougher than heck. Some were a lot
worse than others. There was an occasional rub on the rear of the
Blazer when it passed through a bad spot, but nothing bad.
</P>
<P>
   We lost our way for a few minutes, and I managed to use the skid
plates twice on the same stupid rock while exploring. Bad judgment
on my part.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 20-mile trip to Sycamore Creek, the road
became worse and worse. Fouts was fine. The Blazer struggled a
little. But no bad incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the descent to Sycamore Creek. This stretch REALLY was
eroded. It consisted of bedrock ledges and loose rock. Fouts'
companion, Bill Atherton of Phoenix, had to guide Fouts through
some spots. He spent a lot more time guiding the Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Friend Steve Moorhouse, who was driving, gulped a few times but
got the Blazer over the ledges without a scrape on the bedrock. It
did get some desert pinstriping from an oak on one tight turn among
the ledges.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts didn't believe the Blazer would make it. It did, but is
making some strange noises now.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up that slope from the other side, especially with the
loose rock, would be even more challenging. My Blazer probably
would refuse to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was enhanced by Sycamore Creek with its huge sycamores
and running water. Great for wading and picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   This is a challenging trip for the average driver if he can beat
the ledges. &QL;

E.P. ABRAHMA, 85, BIOCHEMIST WHO HELPED DEVELOP ANTIBIOTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Edward Penley Abraham, a British biochemist and Oxford
University professor who contributed greatly to the development of
today's medical arsenal of antibiotics, died on Sunday at his home
in Oxford. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   He left his mark on biology, chemistry and medicine. Worldwide
patents brought him wealth, some of which he used for trust funds
to support research and education, particularly at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham came to international prominence while associated with
the William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford in the late 1930s
and 40s. With Ernest Chain and Howard Florey, he investigated the
therapeutic potential of penicillin and played an important role in
purifying it and decoding its chemical structure.
</P>
<P>
   Although his interest in such matters was mostly academic, the
fruits of his work had important practical applications. The
penicillin research spawned a new generation of synthetic
penicillins.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues, he also discovered penicillinase, a
penicillin-destroying enzyme that disclosed much about resistance
to penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Abraham turned his attention to cephalosporins, a
category of broad-spectrum antibiotics derived from a fungus that
offered an alternative for people allergic to penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   Such medicines are in wide use today, treating respiratory
infections like bronchitis and pneumonia, infections of the urinary
tract and certain toxic blood disorders. They also heal wounds
infected after surgery and shield the patient on the operating
table from such infections in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham wrote ``Biochemistry of Some Peptide and Steroid
Antibiotics'' (1957) and ``Biosynthesis and Enzymic Hydrolysis of
Penicillins and Cephalosporins'' (1974), and contributed to the
textbook ``General Pathology'' and to scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Southampton and educated at Queen's College,
Oxford, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1941. He also studied a year at
the University of Stockholm as a Rockefeller Foundation Traveling
Fellow in the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham held a chair in chemical pathology at Oxford
University's Lincoln College from 1964 to 1980, when he became a
professor emeritus. He had been a fellow at the college since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He received many awards, including honors from Britain's Royal
Society and the Swedish Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences. He was
knighted in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's survivors include his wife of 60 years, Asbjorg Harung
Abraham, and their son, Michael.

BOARD UNABLE TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES OVER EVOLUTION-CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Struggling to avoid a deadlock, the 10 Kansas
Board of Education members on Wednesday left hanging the question
of whether to accept science standards designating evolution as the
foundation of biology.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, written by a state committee of science teachers
and university professors, would determine what Kansas
schoolchildren learn and are tested on. They list evolution as one
of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   A competing set of standards presented by conservative board
member Steve Abrams on Wednesday would remove the emphasis on
evolution and insert ``the idea that the design and complexity of
the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Those standards were written by ``various citizens,'' including
members of a local creation-science group.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours the board questioned the state committee and
Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members questioned why the committee based its work
on standards written by a national science group.
</P>
<P>
   Others asked Abrams, of Arkansas City, why he did not include
the names of the people who wrote his proposal; the only names on
the document were those of the science committee members.
</P>
<P>
   As the discussion ended, board Chairwoman Linda Holloway of
Shawnee said she was unwilling to put the matter to a vote when it
was clear that board opinions were split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision rests with this board, and this is where the
wrestling will have to come,'' Holloway said. ``The responsibility
ultimately rests with these 10 members.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the board's schedule, the board is to vote on the
standards in June. But Holloway said she was sure the board would
not be ready to vote that soon.
</P>
<P>
   The debate stems from a 1997 vote by the board for new standards
in all subject areas. The science standards committee, appointed in
part by board members, has met 12 times since last June,
co-chairman Loren Lutes of Elkhart told the board.
</P>
<P>
   Lutes, superintendent of the Elkhart School District, told the
board that the committee used guidelines from the National Academy
of Sciences to frame the Kansas standards. Lutes said those
guidelines ``represent, in our opinion, a consensus of what is
right for science education.''
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the state board for discussion, the proposed
Kansas standards had been through eight public hearings and were
reviewed by the Council for Basic Education, based in Washington.
The fourth draft reflected the group's criticisms and public
comments, Lutes said.
</P>
<P>
   Lutes said his committee had reviewed the Abrams version and
found a fundamental difference in how the two documents defined
science. Board member Scott Hill of Abilene, a conservative, said
the differences were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Brad Williamson said the difference lay in how
the two sets of standards treated scientific theory. The
committee's version says a theory such as evolution paints a big
picture of how the natural world works. Abrams' proposal casts
theory as conjecture, placing applied science above understanding
how things work, said Williamson, an Olathe East High School
science teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science tries to figure out what's out there,'' Williamson
said. ``That's the point I'd like to share with my kids, and that's
taken away from me in (Abrams') document.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, a veterinarian, said later in the discussion that he
pushed for alternate standards because the committee's work did not
reflect his view of good science. He said he did not find in the
document his understanding that all scientific theories must be
observable, measurable, testable and falsifiable. To him, evolution
is none of these things.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams denied the accusations of several speakers who on Tuesday
called his proposal an attempt to push religion into the schools.
He said the proposal's intent in mentioning intelligent design was
to acknowledge that more than one theory existed on life's origins.
</P>
<P>
   Some members suggested that Abrams and the science committee
work out a compromise. Lutes, the committee co-chairman, said he
was unwilling to integrate the Abrams proposal into the committee's
standards. If the board asks him to, he will resign, and so will
many committee members, Lutes said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meets Monday in Salina to discuss its next step,
Lutes said after the board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the board continues to let us do our work, we're
going to do it,'' Lutes said. ``When the board takes over our job,
we're going to give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The board members said repeatedly they wanted consensus on the
standards. In the last two years the board has deadlocked along
conservative-moderate lines over state tests, math standards and
some federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-5 split continued after November's elections, but the
board agreed in January to find common ground. In March, for
example, members unanimously approved new math standards almost a
year after they appeared before the previous board.
</P>
<P>
   As the discussion Wednesday ended, Holloway spoke. She said one
aspect of the Abrams proposal that touched her was a statement that
``the cause of science or education (cannot) be served well by
censoring, ridiculing or in any other way discouraging students
from proposing and defending alternate theories.''
</P>
<P>
   In the board's open forum Tuesday, some speakers accused
Holloway, a Christian conservative, of attempting to impose her
religious beliefs on public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith was personally attacked yesterday,'' Holloway said,
her voice breaking. ``I don't want that for any child in the state
of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see what ridicule can lead to in Littleton. I don't want
any child or staff member to be ridiculed because they have a faith
that might be different from a prevailing theory.''

UTILICORP SUBSIDIARY WANTS TO BUILD POWER PLANT

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ UtiliCorp United Inc. said Wednesday that a
subsidiary, Aquila Merchants Energy Partners, was seeking
regulatory approval to build a $250 million plant near Pleasant
Hill that could begin generating electricity by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the gas-fired plant's 600-megawatt output
would be consumed by the estimated 180,000 western Missouri
customers of Missouri Public Service, another UtiliCorp subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Max Sherman, Aquila MEP project manager, said the rest of the
output, about 40 percent, would be marketed by Aquila Energy Corp.,
one of the country's largest energy-trading firms. Aquila Energy is
the parent of Aquila MEP and a wholly owned subsidiary of
UtiliCorp.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila MEP recently won a four-year contract to supply power to
MoPub.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the corporate sisters' relationship spread economic
risk among the companies and offered a long-term benefit to utility
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Industry) deregulation is coming,'' he said. ``The problem
most utilities have in this country, and MoPub is no different, is
how can you invest in facilities when you don't know what's going
to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation will allow consumers to choose from competing
electric service providers, much like telephone service today.
</P>
<P>
   The plant will create about two dozen permanent jobs at the Cass
County site on 175th Street west of Pleasant Hill and just south of
a MoPub electric substation. The new plant is to be designed and
built by Kansas City-based Black &AMP; Veatch.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission, the
facility will be one of only two independent power plants in the
state. The other one is being built in St. Francois County in
southeast Missouri, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila MEP owns interests in 17 other independent power plants
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila Energy, now based in Omaha, Neb., later this year will
move its headquarters and more than 500 jobs to downtown Kansas
City at the Town Pavilion, 1111 Main St.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority, the
Missouri Development Finance Board and the Kansas City Council
agreed to more than $16 million in tax breaks and other incentives
to lure Aquila from Nebraska.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Star Wars'' fans stood in long, long lines and
came from far, far away to get the first tickets a week before
George Lucas' much-anticipated prequel opens in theaters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, fans had camped in
line since early April and tested each other's knowledge of ``Star
Wars'' trivia.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Burbank, police braced for crowds downtown where two
theater complexes opened ticket sales at noon Wednesday for ``Star
Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the box office opened for pre-sales at the Pacific
Theatres' Winnetka 20 in Chatsworth, which boasts 70-foot-wide
screens, 350 people, some from as far away as Palmdale and Long
Beach, were ready to buy.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's American mythology. It's part of American culture. This
is American history here,'' said Ryan Andolina, an 18-year-old
Marina del Rey resident who was first in line at the AMC 16 theater
in Burbank. ``I'm really not some geek, though.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese Theatre, Lincoln Gasking, a 22-year-old from
Melbourne, Australia, and Tim Doyle, 27, from Toronto, Canada, were
the first to purchase tickets for the first screening at the
Chinese, ending a wait that began more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pure gold,'' Doyle said, showing off his handfuls of
tickets to the assembled TV cameras and gawking passers-by. ``Every
minute was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, lines snaked around theaters, callers jammed
ticket-sales phone lines and computer-users tied up online ticket
outlets. An accurate count of advance ticket sales won't be known
until next week, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations Co., which tracks domestic box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have numbers until May 20 because theaters don't
report ticket sales until people actually use the ticket,'' he
said, ``but things are looking very good. There are lines around
the block all over country.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand didn't outstrip supply, however, at mutliplexes like the
Winnetka 20, where seats for the movie's opening day remained
available even after the hundreds of fans waiting in line when
ticket windows opened had been served.
</P>
<P>
   That's true at several area theaters despite the devotion of
fans, many of them twentysomethings like William Reyes and Gino
Sanchez, who were infants when the first ``Star Wars'' movie came
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sacrificed ourselves,'' said Reyes, 21, of North Hills, who
camped out to get a good place in line.
</P>
<P>
   With a limit of 12 per customer, most bought several tickets for
family members and friends -- or for themselves so they could see
the movie several times.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 20, a Granada Hills resident, was the first to walk
away from the ticket window. He had 10 blue tickets, one of which
he plans to save as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   A preordained blockbuster like ``The Phantom Menace'' lends
itself to galactic statistics. Winnetka, a special draw because of
its 70-foot-wide screens, put the first eight days of screenings on
sale Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' will be shown on three screens that can
collectively accommodate 1,822 people. The movie will be shown five
times per day in each. That comes out to nearly 73,000 tickets
available for the first eight days at Winnetka alone. The movie
will be shown on between 3,500 and 4,000 screens nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Winnetka assistant manager Mike Canzoneri guesses that only
opening day will be sold out by the time the first reel is ready to
roll.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. For most, it was worth waiting just to be able to say
they saw ``The Phantom Menace'' on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more to brag about,'' said Ivan Lawrence, 18, of
Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you gotta do,'' he said outside the Winnetka 20.
``It's `Star Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The most carefully choreographed mob scene might have been
outside the Chinese, where several dozen ``Star Wars'' fans raising
money for charity have been camped out since early April.
</P>
<P>
   At Mann's Village in Westwood, Daniel Alter, 17, of Tarzana was
first in line five weeks ago. Since then, he'd been waiting in line
most of the time, with his mother bringing him food and other
friends relieving him for eight hours or so at a time.
</P>
<P>
   After he bought the 12 tickets he was allowed, Alter was
prepared for more waiting to get a good seat next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get right back in line for the ticket holders'
line.''
</P>
<P>
   At less-renowned local theaters, there were fewer fans waiting
in line but their `Star Wars' worship ran just as deep.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated mom Stella Palayan, a 51-year-old Glendale resident,
was first in a line of about 70 people at the Glendale Mann
Theaters to get tickets for the opening. She took over the spot at
8:30 a.m. from her 26-year-old son, Kirk, who had been camped out
since 6 p.m. Tuesday. ``He said `Mom, I owe you,' '' Palayan said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police reported no problems among the impatient
ticket-seekers, though some area police agencies set up barricades
to corral the hundreds of people who wanted to be part of history.

SHOULD INFERTILITY BE COVERED AS A DISABILITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I chortled when I read the news item. The Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission ruled that an employer violated federal
disabilities laws by refusing to pay for infertility treatments
through its insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   /{Oh brother,/} I thought. /{What will our litigious society
think of next?/}
</P>
<P>
   My knee jerk continued: /{Puhleeze. Inability to bear a child
doesn't affect one's ability to perform the essential functions of
a job _ which is what the Americans With Disabilities Act is
designed to protect./}
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says employers must provide reasonable
accommodations to help disabled workers do their jobs. /{But that's
for things like blindness and deafness, not infertility,/} I
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Then I listened to a woman who desperately wants to have a baby
and _ so far _ has not become pregnant. She and her husband are
spending up to $20,000, considerable time and much emotional
anguish trying to conceive. There is no question in her mind that
she is a disabled worker who is ``not firing on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC decision drew on an earlier U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that called reproduction a ``major life activity.'' Bingo, the
woman said. Disability laws were written precisely to help those
who have impairments of major life activities.
</P>
<P>
   She views her inability to conceive as an impairment, just like
an inability to see or hear like ``normal'' people. ``Normal''
people, she said, bear children.
</P>
<P>
   She is not a sniveling basket case. Her co-workers see her as an
intelligent, productive worker. Meanwhile, she sought emotional
counseling through her employer's confidential counseling program.
</P>
<P>
   She came up empty. The program offered counseling for
alcoholism, drug abuse, depression and a host of other problems _
but no expert help for the pain of infertility. She found and pays
for counseling on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Look, she argued, if the ``best places to work'' provide
adoption benefits and maternity benefits, isn't it fair to help pay
for fertility treatments, which are just another way of having a
child? Isn't it discrimination for insurance companies or employers
to exclude coverage for infertility treatments?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions aren't answered easily. If, say, a woman elects
to remain childless during her most fertile 20s and 30s, is it fair
to expect her employers' health-care budget to subsidize $10,000 or
$20,000 _ or more _ worth of fertility treatments in her 40s? But
what if we're talking about an infertile couple in their 20s?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a recent study by the consulting firm William
M. Mercer found that making infertility treatments a covered
benefit was not an unreasonable cost burden on employers. In fact,
such coverage may be cost-effective in terms of retaining
productive employees.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states have some type of infertility insurance coverage
law, but there is no current federal mandate. More than 6 million
infertile Americans are hoping that changes.
</P>
<P>
   As many employers try to create ``family-friendly'' workplaces
in an effort to attract and keep workers, infertility sufferers say
it's discriminatory when the system is family-friendly only if the
family is easily made.

WASHINGTON TEACHER IN CHINA FINDS PROTECTIVE STUDENTS AMID
TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROSEMARY ADANG, SPECIAL TO THE P-I  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Rosemary Adang, a faculty member at Highline
Community College in Des Moines, Wash., for nine years, is teaching
English this academic year at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in
China. As part of a faculty exchange program, she also is studying
Chinese culture. In the wake of NATO's accidental bombing of
China's Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last Friday, Adang
described the tensions in Shanghai in e-mail messages to the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The time references are in Shanghai
time, which is 15 hours ahead of Seattle time. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ I taught two classes of first-year students
Wednesday. They, like students from all the major universities,
have been involved in the demonstrations (against NATO), and do
generally believe the bombing (of China's Embassy in Belgrade last
week) was intentional. It's a sad statement about our relations
with the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the English Department went into each class before
me to pave the way, but I don't know exactly what she said to them.
She had told me her intention was just to remind them to respect me
as an international guest.
</P>
<P>
   But the students did not direct any of their anger at me; in
fact, they were as protective as the faculty. One student even gave
me a hand-folded origami crane and told me it was a symbol of peace
and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Another student asked me during a break if I had been scared.
When I said that I had (been fearful) to some extent, he said not
to worry because people know that individual Americans are not at
fault. But then he said, ``But there are radicals out there, so be
careful and stay at home as much as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   My third-year classes on Friday may be a bit rougher as they are
much more politically active, but I think they'll also hold the
distinction between the American government, which most of them see
as evil, and individual Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a sad week here in Shanghai. In an unrelated incident,
one of my graduate students committed suicide last weekend, and
that's been a big focus of my attention and feelings as well as the
bombing. (On Wednesday) after teaching for four hours, I attended
the funeral. There is no evidence that it was related to these
other events....
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night I attended the (meeting of the university's vice
president), where for over an hour he spoke about the bombing in
the most inflammatory terms possible, referring to the brutal,
vicious action; telling us we did not know the truth because we get
our information from the Western press; saying that the explanation
given by the United States and NATO was clearly false; and
referring to the eventual triumph of good over evil.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that the university guaranteed our safety on campus
and in our apartments and that we should be cautious elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I think we're safe right now here in Shanghai, though the recent
events are very disturbing....
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy happened just as I was going into an
unusual stretch of five days without classes to teach.... Being
away from my normal environment and my students (made) gauging the
tension somewhat more difficult, but at least here we have access
to CNN and some Chinese news in English....
</P>
<P>
   Our Chinese friends tell us that the American apology has not
been carried in the Chinese press, though apparently Tuesday
morning the Chinese government finally issued a public statement of
the apology.
</P>
<P>
   We're just a few blocks from the American Consulate, where there
have been protests since the bombing, and there are many more
police on the streets than usual, but the people in the hotel and
in a nearby restaurant have been very kind to us.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese person told us that reasonable people here know that
(President) Clinton and NATO have not gone mad. Another said that
because of the upcoming 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
protests, the government is eager to turn any unrest outward.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as far as we know all the local universities
have bused students to the protests, and many of my own students
are suspicious enough of American foreign policy to be sincerely
angry and skeptical of the explanation of the bombing as an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, we've witnessed the presence of many police, a
convoy of about eight military trucks and one group of soldiers
that we saw running together toward the consulate. Police were
turning cars away from the intersection next to our hotel, which is
a route to the consulate.
</P>
<P>
   People on the streets, though, have not been noticeably hostile
to us. We've received some looks that I would call even more
searching than usual, but we've also received friendly looks and
nods that to me seem to be attempts to reassure us of their good
will.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm sure you know, Chinese people receive very little news of
the plight of the Kosovo people, hearing instead phrases like ``the
forced expulsion of the Albanians'' as the most negative reflection
of the situation. Many believe the stories on CNN are Western
propaganda and greatly exaggerated or possibly even fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   We're not very afraid for our personal safety, but it's
disturbing knowing that many Chinese people do hold America
responsible and believe that this could have been a purposeful
action....
</P>
<P>
   Again, we think we and Americans who happen to be in Shanghai
right now are probably safe as long as they stay away from the
protests and don't provoke reactions.

MESA COUPLE RETURN WITH ADOPTED CHINESE BABY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mesa couple whose adoption of a Chinese baby came amid
ferocious anti-American protests returned to United States soil
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're home,'' said a relieved Tammy Jacobs, shortly after the
plane touched down at Los Angeles International Airport. ``We're
just happy to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs and and her husband, Loren, carried with them the
precious cargo they flew to China to get: 14-month-old Abigal Bei,
who rested in a cloth carrier slung over Loren Jacobs' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to arrive about 10 p.m. at Sky Harbor
International Airport in Phoenix amid the welcome greetings of
hundreds of well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 10 to 15 couples holed up in the White Swan
Hotel in Guangzhou, adjacent to the U.S. embassy, for several days
while angry mobs protested NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia, which killed three journalists and injured
20 others.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations in Guangzhou began hours after the couple
arrived in the southern Chinese city, and ended shortly after
President Clinton's apology was aired on TV days after he issued
it. Officials warned the hotel guests to stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid the protests would escalate,'' Loren Jacobs
said. ``They told us to stay away from windows and doors. We didn't
even know whether to make eye contact with hotel employes.''
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest fear was that there would be delays in getting
their visas processed. But immigration officials processed the
documents at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And by the fourth day, the couple ventured out to a market.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail is the couple's second Chinese baby. Their first is
4-year-old Kimmery, who stayed in Mesa with her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jacobses, John Carney and his wife also adopted a
second daughter in China. The St. Louis radio personality said he
was frightened the first day of the protests because he had never
seen such an angry crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second day, he said, they realized they would not be
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing prompted China to break contacts with the
United States on military relations, human rights, arms control and
other security issues. The country also allowed controlled
demonstrations, reportedly the largest and most widespread since
the Tiananmen Square uprising 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Adams of China's Children adoption agency in
Scottsdale, who worked with the Jacobses, said hotel workers
reported that the Chinese government hopes the protests will blunt
demonstrations on the Tiananmen Square uprising's 10th anniversary
on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she said, the adoption bureaucracy seems unharmed. She
said she received a letter from Chinese adoption officials on
Wednesday granting permission for six more local families to travel
to China for adoptions later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern, Adams said, was how China would react to the
news accounts of the demonstrations and of adoptions. She said that
on an ``NBC Nightly News'' account on Tuesday, anchor Tom Brokaw
made at least two references to adopted children as being
``unwanted'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   China has reacted negatively to such characterizations in the
past, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese laws restricting many couples to one child are behind
the high number of children in orphanages, estimated at 100,000 to
500,000, according to Adams. More than 95 percent of those children
are girls because in the Chinese culture, males dominate. Most of
them have been abandoned by families who want boys.
</P>
<P>
   China's Children has placed about 200 children with Arizona
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear couple Debbie and Ronald Whitler are pleased that their
upcoming trip to China to adopt a baby is scheduled to take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel threatened or worried about our safety,'' Debbie
Whitler said. ``I just don't want to be seen as the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   They have had a photograph of their daughter, who they have
named Lily Yan, since April 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's adorable,'' Whitler said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Jacobses, they took pleasure in satisfying their
American food craving after arriving at the Los Angeles airport.
They ate at an airport McDonald's. &QL;

FAMILY'S LAWSUIT AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANY GOES TO JURY IN KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did Charles Steele understand the risks of cigarettes and make a
rational choice to smoke, or was he hopelessly addicted to an
unreasonably dangerous product?
</P>
<P>
   Jurors faced that question Wednesday as lawyers representing
Steele's family and the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. made their
closing arguments in federal court in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began its deliberations about 11:45 a.m. and quit for
the day about 5 p.m. They will resume this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's son and daughter contend in their lawsuit that Brown &AMP;
Williamson's Kool Filter Kings were defective, ``unreasonably''
dangerous and directly responsible for his lung cancer. Steele died
in 1995 at age 56 while living in Vandalia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Company lawyers, witnesses and officials have acknowledged that
smoking is risky, but they say Brown &AMP; Williamson has funded health
research on smoking and helped to disclose its hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Company experts also have argued that Steele never tried to quit
smoking and was exposed to a host of cancer-causing chemicals when
he worked at an aluminum foundry and at a brick-making plant.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's family isn't the only group watching the jury's
decision closely.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco analysts said Wednesday that the verdict could be a
bellwether for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   After years of consistently winning cases brought by sick
smokers, the industry has had a more mixed record recently.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris recently lost two cases on the West Coast, while
earlier this week the industry won three cases that had been
consolidated in a Memphis, Tenn., courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the West Coast cases aberrations or were they the start
of a trend?'' asked Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon
Smith Barney in New York. ``Only after a half dozen or more cases
go to juries will the pattern become obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors watch such cases closely, said Gary Black, with the
investment management firm of Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.
Stocks tend to move when tobacco companies lose lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors' psyches are very fragile here,'' Black said.
``Tobacco stocks have been on a downslide since January. People are
looking at this case to see if the industry is back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for Steele's son and daughter, lawyer J. Michael Cronan
said Steele was powerfully affected by nicotine, changing from an
affable family man to ``evil'' _ in the words of his sister _ when
deprived of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was greatly affected by smoking while others are not,''
Cronan said. ``In the context of his genetics and his environment,
he was addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes by their very nature are defective, Cronan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal use of the product will cause serious injury or
death,'' he said. ``In the 1 1/2- to two-pack-a-day range (over 10
years) one in six smokers will get lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven McCormick, a lawyer representing Brown &AMP; Williamson,
argued that his client should not be held responsible for Steele's
decisions. Steele's daughter, he pointed out, testified that her
father read warning labels on his packs of Kool Filter Kings, which
he called ``cancer sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that an unreasonable risk?'' McCormick asked. ``Well, in
our country, that's a decision that adults get to make.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick also threw a new wrinkle into the case he had been
arguing for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   How could the jury blame Brown &AMP; Williamson when some evidence
suggested that he smoked other companies' brands from time to time?
</P>
<P>
   McCormick observed that some of Steele's friends and family
members remember him smoking at least four other brands before he
was diagnosed with cancer in 1994. None of those brands was
manufactured by Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he smoked Kool cigarettes sometime in the
later part of his smoking life,'' McCormick said. ``But this is not
the Steeles against smoking. It's the Steeles against our company
and our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning for rebuttal, Cronan reminded the jury of other
evidence that showed Steele smoking Kools from the late 1960s until
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Cronan closed argument in the case by telling jurors that about
9,500 Americans have died prematurely from smoking-related
illnesses since the trial opened on May 3. A verdict for Charles
Steele's children would send a powerful message to the company, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're here to stop the killing, to make smoking history and
to make Brown &AMP; Williamson deal with its problems,'' Cronan said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked jurors to award Steele's children about $1 million in
actual damages. But though he recently won permission from U.S.
District Judge Ortrie Smith to seek $25 million in punitive
damages, he did not suggest that figure to jurors Wednesday.

PAINT RESTRICTIONS URGED TO KEEP AIR CLEAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX   AND MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hoping to brighten Southland skies, air quality
regulators on Friday will consider imposing tough restrictions for
the paint industry that could take some of the gloss off Los
Angeles and leave the city lusterless.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the plan by bureaucrats of the South Coast Air
Quality Management District will result in paints that are inferior
in almost every way, leaving consumers with fewer colors and higher
prices for a product that is harder to use and provides less
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney William M. Smiland, who with his brother Bob, owns
Smiland Paint Co. in Los Angeles, said the AQMD plan borders on
being draconian. ``We don't use words like `irrational' lightly but
I am going to use that word on Friday before the board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy, this is nuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even air quality regulators acknowledge that their plan will
cost the paint industry tens of millions of dollars to implement,
impact a wide range of products on the market and could eventually
prove to be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, to be voted on by the board Friday, are directed at
the solvents used in paint. They are designed to reduce the amount
of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, released into the air by an
estimated 21.8 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these kinds of compounds, measured in grams per liter,
react with other elements in the air to produce ozone, a component
of smog. They are found in such products as primers, sealers, rust
coatings, waterproofing, gloss and semi-gloss paint and quick-dry
enamels.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are recommending a two-step reduction in the VOC
level. The first, gradual step would occur in 2002 with the steeper
and final cut coming in 2006, the AQMD said.
</P>
<P>
   The steepest cut, which would reduce VOCs down to 50 grams per
liter, will come in the kinds of products familiar to anyone who
has painted kitchen cabinets or the trim on their house. And by
2006 consumers will be paying about $6 more per gallon for their
glossy and semi-gloss paint, said AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The board is scheduled to discuss the rules at its meeting at
9:30 a.m. Friday in AQMD headquarters, 21865 Copley Drive, Diamond
Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Some paints used in industrial applications such as smokestacks,
sewage treatment plants and industrial furnaces can have a higher
VOC content than paints used around the home. The limit for
quick-drying paint like that used on film sets will be 250 grams
per liter effective in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the new formulas for paint used by government agencies for
items like bridges, roadways and water pipes will not be
implemented until 2006. Those limits will be higher than
residential users, the AQMD said, and are being implemented later
to give public agencies such as water plants enough time to find
paint that will pass muster of health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Broadbent, the AQMD's deputy executive officer, estimated
that the plan will cost the industry about $58 million starting in
2002 as manufacturers develop new, cleaner paints.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations are based in part on a study by National
Technical Systems that was completed about a month ago, he said.
The work was overseen by a group that included representatives from
the painting industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final results have been coming out for the past few months
and shared by staff in public meetings, even though the final
report came out recently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided the paint industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Advocacy Program of
the Southern California Paint and Coatings Alliance, a lobby group
known by the acronym EL RAP that represents manufacturers,
distributors and retailers, claims the impact of the new rules will
be many times more severe than the district's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims that formulas for 7,000 paints, about 90
percent of those in use, will have to be reworked, an economic blow
of up to $1.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   William Smiland estimates that his company has about $15 million
worth of formulas that will be wiped out if the new rule is passed.
</P>
<P>
   The products companies like his could make probably won't have
much consumer appeal because they will not last as long as today's
paints, hold vibrant colors or be very easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make low VOC paints but you can't get anybody to buy
them. It's very much like the electric car story. It is literally
this radical, outlawing Ford, GM and Toyota and just leaving the
electric car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smiland also said that the regulations were drawn up before the
AQMD's study on the issue was complete.
</P>
<P>
   AQMD officials disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry representatives said that we were rushing to judgment
because the final report just came out. But we feel that while that
may be true, the information in that report has been out for some
time and has been shared for the industry for some time,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly acknowledged that quality might be an issue. ``To be
honest with you the results of that study were mixed. The zero
(low) VOC paints . . . often were not as good.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end the industry is being given some wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial standards are adopted in 2002, the district
will conduct feasibility studies on whether paints to meet the next
level of reduction can in fact be made.
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturers could still make some paints with a high VOC
content as long as the end result of all the paint they sold was
less VOCs, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   And Broadbent said that by 2006 some of the solvents being used
will not be as reactive as they are today because of other
pollution reduction methods being implemented. If that's the case,
a recommendation to modify the rules can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some in the paint industry think the rules being
proposed by the district are all right.
</P>
<P>
   Ed &UR;  &LR; Laird, president of Coatings Resource Corp. in Huntington
Beach, which makes about 500 types of paint, thinks the industry
can adapt to the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has negotiated very tough and I think the
AQMD has done a very thorough study. There are coatings that meet
the rules and we've had a fair shot. It's time to move on and make
paint. For the most part there is a price to pay for clean air and
it's passed onto the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Whittingham, the air quality staff member for Los Angeles
County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, said the new rules will
hurt the smallest manufacturers the most, but that the board will
consider giving them a year and a half after the compliance date to
meet the new limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the big companies put their stuff on the shelf, (the
small companies) can go out and get it and change their
formulations. That's a lot less expensive than the original
research and development,'' Whittingham said.

SPRINT RAISING CURTAIN LOCALLY ON ION TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nearly a year after Sprint Corp. staged a
Broadway production to unveil its Integrated On-Demand Network, the
company is raising the curtain locally on technology that will
change the way its customers buy, use and pay for telecommunication
services.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sprint will open the ION Experience Center, an
interactive demonstration room where employees, customers and the
general public can schedule an appointment to scrutinize Sprint's
digital-age network and judge its seemingly awesome capabilities
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in the ground floor of a building at 9300 Metcalf Ave.,
the exhibit's purpose is twofold: to prove to skeptics, competitors
and potential customers that ION is real; and, more important, that
it works.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of that message to Sprint's future cannot be
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ION is the new face of Sprint, the vehicle it will use to
deliver all of its services in coming years _ local or
long-distance telephone service, data transmission and Internet
connections, for residential customers or businesses alike.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimates that there are 40 million technology-savvy
households nationwide that could be potential buyers of the
service. And by the end of the year, when it begins delivering the
service to residential customers, it must convince them it is worth
between $100 and $175 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration center includes a working telephone switch
that provides futuristic phone services to a series of nearby stage
sets _ a kitchen, a home office, a small business and a large
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that no smoke and mirrors are involved, the floors of
the exhibit are transparent, so customers can see the wiring that
runs to each device. Even the refrigerator and stove work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer education is going to be a pretty long process,''
said Jeff Shafer, a Sprint spokesman. ``That's why we're getting
started now.''  &LR; brk:Race to market
</P>
<P>
   When Chairman William Esrey insists that Sprint has what it
takes to succeed without being bought by a larger company, he is
referring to ION.
</P>
<P>
   ION is Sprint's strategy to enter local phone markets around the
country, and grab a larger share of its customers' exploding
expenditures on communication services.
</P>
<P>
   It is a technology that Sprint says will eliminate the notion of
time and distance in telephone billing, enabling the company to
transform your plain vanilla phone service into an all-you-can-eat
smorgasbord of full-featured voice lines, lightning-fast Internet
access, videoconferencing, and video on demand.
</P>
<P>
   The question, observers say, is whether Sprint has what it takes
to successfully execute the ION game plan, and put its service into
homes and businesses around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In short, will customers buy it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that it's really neat,'' said Robert
Rosenberg, president of Insight Research Corp. ``But is it cheap?
Is is reliable? And how quickly is AT&AMP;T going to be there with a
comparable product?''
</P>
<P>
   When Esrey stepped into the theater footlights last July to
introduce ION, he told industry analysts and reporters that other
companies had bits and pieces of the technology, ``but only Sprint
has it all, and only Sprint has it now.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, however, observers are still puzzled over what
services ION will include, what it will cost, and when it will be
ready for more than the eight companies and 30 employees currently
beta-testing the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing still sounds like more of a billing system than
anything,'' said David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while AT&AMP;T has secured access to local consumers with
a megabuck spree of cable-television company acquisitions, Sprint's
strategy to make the final connections to consumers' homes remains
fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``ION sounds like a pretty compelling service, but they don't
seem to have a cohesive last-mile strategy,'' said Zia Daniell
Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sprint has the opposite problem of AT&AMP;T. Ma Bell
has spent more than $90 billion to buy cable connections that will
allow it to compete with Baby Bells in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now AT&AMP;T must spend billions more to upgrade its cable systems
to provide services that they were never designed to handle, such
as two-way telephone service and high-speed Internet, with the same
near-perfect reliability of a phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, on the other hand, has developed a service that embodies
the vision. Now it has to figure out how to get that service to
customers, and convince them that its worth as much as $175 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be easy. Around the country, cable and local
telephone companies are beating Sprint to market with one of the
most enticing ingredients in the ION package: high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months, both Time Warner and Southwestern Bell
will offer their own flavors of high-speed Internet service in
Kansas City, priced at $40 to $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``First to market is major advantage,'' said Brian Adamik, an
industry analyst with the Yankee Group. ``Customers are less likely
to change once they're locked into a relationship. Sprint hasn't
even articulated what its offer is yet.''  &LR; brk:Wooing customers
</P>
<P>
   To hear Sprint tell it, ION is nothing less than a complete
reinvention of the traditional phone system, a technical voyage of
such mind-boggling complexity that you need an engineering degree
simply to understand the alphabet soup of technology acronyms
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sprint will be deploying its ATM-based
service through an ISH connected to your home via ADSL, which
communicates with a DSLAM at the CO, which will be backhauled to
their POP via DS3...
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a telecom engineer's dream,'' said Fred Harris,
director of network planning and design at Sprint. ``I finally got
the opportunity to do this the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sprint engineers, ION represents the great leap forward to
what analysts call Converged Network Services, a world where local,
long distance, video and data travel over the same, fantastically
efficient network.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, Sprint's network promises to facilitate
telecommuting, distance-learning, desktop collaboration and
electronic commerce. It could also alleviate the pressure on
businesses to maintain dedicated technical staff to deal with
problems on their own networks.
</P>
<P>
   To the consumer, what it means is that a technician will come to
your home and wire up an electronic magic box to which your
computer, telephones, fax machine and other communication devices
will be linked.
</P>
<P>
   Once the service is installed, users in different rooms of that
house could simultaneously talk on the phone, access the Internet
at warp speeds, download a video, and video conference with work _
all over the same connection.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Sprint plans to put the power of its network
directly in each user's hands. Using computers, customers could add
new phone lines with the calling features of their choice, or
request huge amounts of bandwidth for a high-quality video
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ION also erases the notion of a phone bill based on time and
distance. Instead, users will pay a flat fee, which will include
virtually unlimited long distance, all calling features and huge
bandwidth use.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Sprint's prices sound steep, particularly
because the service doesn't include cable TV programming or the
equipment needed to video conference. But company officials think
that about 40 million technology-intensive households in the United
States will consider it a bargain when they see what's included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these households are already spending $100 to $175 a
month,'' Joan Jarrett, director of emerging markets for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still weighing different pricing options for the
service, whether it will require a service contract, and how much
to charge for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is grappling with the bigger issue that puzzles
most analysts: how to get the service into consumers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, most observers have assumed that Sprint would
reach residential customers with souped-up copper phone lines _
known as asymmetric digital subscriber lines _ leased from the
regional Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company does intend to do that in some markets. During the
past month, however, Sprint has spent more than $1 billion to
acquire the stock of three little-known wireless cable companies.
Collectively, those companies own wireless broadcast licenses with
the potential to reach 24.2 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risky move. Using wireless to carry data is a fairly new
use of the technology, and Sprint will have to spend millions to
upgrade that technology to handle data.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sprint's marketers are doing everything they
can to build hype, with a national advertising campaign, regular
news releases and moves like the ION experience center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk here is the schedule,'' Harris said. ``Come a
year from now, when the number of customers starts skyrocketing,
it's got to work.''

THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE _ IMPORTED _ AT RISK IN BEEF WARS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Like to shop in the gourmet aisle of your local
supermarket?
</P>
<P>
   Then start stocking up on Dijon mustard, Swiss chocolate and
mineral water from France. Their prices may be about to double _
because Europeans aren't buying our hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Better get that pate, those sun-dried tomatoes and Roquefort
cheese, too. And if you've been intending to buy a moped or another
type of European motorcycle, do it soon.
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of a long list of imports from 15 European
countries that Washington may slap with a 100 percent punitive
tariff because their governments refuse to accept hormone-treated
beef from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest skirmish in a trade war with the European Union
that the beef industry estimates has cost American farmers about
$500 million in lost revenue in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has said it will not meet a World Trade
Organization-imposed deadline set for today for it to comply with
the organization's ruling that it lift the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to see a trade war, but you've got to have a
level playing field,'' said Larry Oltjen, a fourth-generation
cattle rancher in Robinson, Kan., and president of the Kansas
Livestock Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle is crucial to the Kansas economy. It accounts for nearly
$17 billion, almost a quarter, of the state's total economic
output. The state exported $471 million in beef and veal all over
the world in 1997. Missouri exported more than $64 million in beef
products that same year.
</P>
<P>
   The tension with the European Union is over the use of
artificial growth hormones, present in more than 90 percent of U.S.
beef production. The beef industry says the hormones produce cattle
with less fat than animals not fed with the hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But the mad-cow disease scare in Great Britain increased
concerns in Europe about the safety of its food supply, and the
union banned all imports of hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   For years, both sides of the Atlantic have waged a war of words,
sanctions and scientific studies. But in three instances, the World
Trade Organization has ruled against the European Union and ordered
it to lift the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative, said the European Union had engaged in a ``cynical
political manipulation'' of legitimate concerns over food safety to
engage in protectionism. Washington countered with a threat to
raise prices on $900 million in European Union goods if the ban is
not lifted by today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence is that
there is no human health threat posed by the proper use of growth
hormones,'' Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve O'Beirne, a spokeswoman for the European Union, said the
union was conducting its own studies and had asked for a longer
delay instead of today's deadline. She said the union had offered
to award the United States compensation in return for the
continuation of the ban on hormone-treated beef, such as dropping
the tariffs on the non-hormone-treated American beef.

L.A. AGENCY DEFIES BAN ON BRUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While homeowners fume over brush clearance rules
and fees, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and some other
public agencies with property in high-risk areas have openly defied
Los Angeles Fire Department officials and insisted upon setting
their own priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Los Angeles, including the San Fernando Valley,
thousands of homeowners face a $13 inspection fee and stiff
penalties if they fail to clear foliage and cut grass down to a
stubble. But officials at state agencies are setting their own
brush-clearance priorities and say they can't guarantee all the
work will get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fire Department, as well as any agency, private or public,
has to make its priorities, and not everything gets done by
everybody all the time,'' Belinda Faustinos, deputy director of the
conservancy, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city brush-clearance program ignited a firestorm of
criticism last month when a sternly worded warning letter about the
$13 fee and other potential costs was sent out to owners of about
180,000 properties -- some in hillside areas, but others in
landscaped flatland neighborhoods where homeowners are incredulous
at the order and say there has never been a brush fire.
</P>
<P>
   While many homeowners are fuming over the inspection fee,
officials in state agencies say they are not bound by the city's
rules or required to pay for the Fire Department's inspections and
reinspections.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have been frustrated by state agencies' refusal
to comply with city standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a dialogue with the conservancy,'' said Fire Capt.
Paul Quagliata, head of the Brush Clearance Unit. ``We're getting
an extreme amount of resistance from them. We're getting very poor
cooperation. It's virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said they have no intention of doing what we want
them to do because they don't have the people or the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant City Attorney Pete Echeverria said the city's
hands are probably tied. ``It appears as if they would have
sovereignty and would not have to comply. But we have not done any
in-depth research into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick claimed conservancy officials should be
``ashamed of themselves'' for ignoring standards that she said put
public safety first, even if the city cannot force a state agency
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the legalities, and I understand the limitations
in our abilities, but that doesn't change the very real risk to Los
Angeles residents,'' said Chick, chairwoman of the council's Public
Safety Committee and a supporter of the brush-clearance crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how the conservancy should be looking to acquire
more property when it can't manage its existing property to reduce
the risk to nearby residents.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of public agencies' compliance became a thorny topic
during the council's deliberations last fall. Despite some members'
misgivings, the council voted to spend $82,500 to help the
conservancy remove foliage, saying public safety outweighed the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Chick, however, said she would oppose such a subsidy for the
conservancy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Faustinos said the conservancy is working on a half dozen of the
72 parcels on which the Fire Department wants brush-clearance work
done, including land in Laurel Canyon and the nearby Parma
property.
</P>
<P>
   She said conservancy officials hope to get all 72 parcels
cleared, but cannot guarantee that will be done and have identified
areas where fire hazard is highest.
</P>
<P>
   She said the conservancy is following state law requiring brush
clearance within 100 feet of structures, rather than clearing for
200 feet under city rules.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has $250,000 for brush clearance. If its own
crews can get the work done or borrow workers from the state
Department of Forestry, all of the 72 parcels could be cleared, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At commercial rates, it would cost $700,000 to clear all the
conservancy land, Fire Department say, but acknowledge the
conservancy might be able to get it done for less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been, I think, very aggressive about making sure we do
have enough funding to maintain our property,'' Faustinos said.
``However, we recognize we don't have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On the conservancy's priority list, she said, parcels that are
not irrigated, driest and closest to homes are at the top of the
list for clearance.
</P>
<P>
   But Quagliata said Fire Department officials selected all 72
sites precisely because clearance of them is important to public
safety. ``If you have vegetation that interfaces with people's
homes, then to me, all of those are a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Faustinos said the conservancy is only one of a number of state
park or resource agencies that face similar dilemmas trying to
balance budgets and protection of wildlife habitat with local brush
clearance rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we are concerned about making sure there is
adequate public safety, and that also has to consider protection of
natural resources, which is clearly where our mandate is,''
Faustinos said.
</P>
<P>
   Quagliata said the Fire Department will soon issue clearance
notices on several thousand properties owned by city, county, state
or federal government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city's Department of Water and Power and the city's
General Services Agency, both of which lagged in clearing their
properties last year, are paying the Fire Department to handle
brush clearance this year.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Agency has 200 properties while the DWP has
50 to 60 large properties that are overgrown, Quagliata said.
</P>
<P>
   Other local agencies affected by the brush clearance ordinance
include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Los
Angeles Unified School District. The city has not yet issued
notices to them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Miles, district division maintenance chief for the
Department of Transportation, said Caltrans clears brush within
eight feet of the shoulder of state roadways but could not legally
go farther. ``We are forbidden by streets and highways codes from
going outside of our right of way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year Caltrans has spent $1.6 million on brush control in
the division, including has $325,000 to clear brush from road
shoulders along 468 miles of roads in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties. He said 3,077 acres were mowed and 2,800 acres sprayed
for weeds, while 15,080 trees were trimmed.

COUPLE DEVOTED TO ONE ANOTHER DIE AN HOUR WITHIN EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gladys and Pete Saccomanno died the way any of us who
ever swore undying love to someone else would want to: at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pete died at Seattle's Virginia Mason Medical Center Friday
night of complications from lymphoma. Gladys died in an ambulance
on the way to the hospital, apparently of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour separated the Seattle couple's deaths. Pete's
heart stopped in the hospital almost the moment Gladys died, but
medical technology got it started again; he passed away shortly
after she did.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a fairy tale marriage with a Shakespearean end.
</P>
<P>
   Pete and Gladys Saccomanno were buried Wednesday morning at
Seattle's Evergreen-Washelli Cemetery. She was 78, he was 76. A
cold mist fell on their burial sprays and left dark splotches on
the jackets of their friends, some who knew them from 35 years of
horse racing at Longacres race track in Seattle and later Emerald
Downs in Auburn, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, when Gladys was in a nursing home with heart
trouble and Pete was undergoing chemotherapy, Gladys stopped
eating, and told friends she didn't want to go on living. But a
friend persuaded her to start eating, leave the nursing home, take
care of Pete, and wait for the birth of her great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Gladys agreed, but if Pete passes on, she said, then she
didn't want to live, either.
</P>
<P>
   Their lifelong love began at first sight. They met in a
Harley-Davidson store in Trinidad, Colo., in 1939, when Pete
whistled at Gladys in the store, earning a rebuke and a glare from
her brother. They were married in 1942, and Pete went off to war,
the last time they would be apart.
</P>
<P>
   Pete came back and worked as a longshoreman on the Seattle
docks. She taught him how to handicap horses, he taught her how to
smoke. They rode their motorcycles together, Pete speeding along on
a black Harley, Gladys next to him on her white Indian with black
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Pete called her ``Princess.'' She called him ``Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Their only fight _ in 57 years of marriage, the only thing
anyone can ever remember them ever arguing about _ was whether
Gladys should tour as a professional bowler.
</P>
<P>
   A scratch bowler in Seattle's co-ed leagues, Gladys bowled an
average 243, and often rolled 260. In the basement of their Seattle
home are 47 bowling trophies Gladys won.
</P>
<P>
   She always was lucky. Her friends called her psychic. She was
uncanny at picking winning horses, using numbers she got off the
1-900 horoscope lines, numbers she saw on newspaper comics pages,
even phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   They never missed a day at Long-acres Racetrack, and came home
winners enough times that they bought new cars for their only
child, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   When Gladys' eyesight failed 12 years ago, when macular
degeneration made the world dim and fuzzy and narrow, she and Pete
kept going to the races. Pete would study the racing forms,
transcribing them onto white pieces of paper using big, black
numbers for her to see.
</P>
<P>
   Few people could tell she was blind, because she was agile. She
moved through the racetrack in a smock, with a couple hundred
dollars of fives in her left pocket and a couple hundred dollars of
singles in her right.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled a lot at her table in Longacres' wine cellar, the
same one they sat at all the time, toward the back corner, near the
buffet table. She'd smile when her picks were going well, when Pete
told her what was going on. She'd curse when her picks didn't win,
place or show.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at their funeral, a trumpeter played the traditional
horse racing theme ``A Call to the Post.''
</P>
<P>
   What was recalled were the little things: She was always his
princess, he at her beck and call. They cooked and despite her
failing eyesight they worked together, Pete doing the measuring and
Gladys the mixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be blind but I can still feel,'' Gladys told friends
when they learned how their Christmas cookies were made.
</P>
<P>
   After the blindness set in, Pete would put makeup on Gladys
every morning, and she'd sit still, smiling at him. He sewed her
pants suits, made her purses.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hospital nurses cried when they heard what happened.
Maybe it was coincidence they died when they did, maybe not,
because no one has ever proved, empirically, that you can die of a
broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   But Gladys and Pete Saccomanno died within an hour of each
other, the last chapter in a real American love story.

BLUES' POWER PLAYS SHORT OF HIGH VOLTAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The power is still on in the St. Louis Blues' power
play, but the light is definitely flickering.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Blues scored a power-play goal Wednesday night. It was
their second in this series. The only problem? They've had 21
chances, including seven Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues couldn't score with almost 90 seconds of five players
against three Wednesday night. Their one power-play goal was a
fluke, a centering pass from Geoff Courtnall that bounced in off
Dallas Stars center Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two or three games I thought our power play has been
effective,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``We get a fluke
power-play goal by Courtnall. Sometimes things like that turn
around a power play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues have scored with a man advantage 10 percent of the
time in this series. It's not ``that'' bad, but it certainly isn't
anything like the 27 percent clip they were scoring at on the power
play in the first round against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was 9-of-33 with a man advantage in the first round.
SPEAKING OF DEPTH
</P>
<P>
   Depth has been a Stars' strength all season. Coach Ken Hitchcock
has been rolling four lines since training camp, a luxury opposing
teams usually do without.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for St. Louis in postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues have had 15 players score goals in the playoffs, best
among the eight remaining teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all year long we've had a number of guys able to
score,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. ``The nice thing is you don't
have to rely on one guy to do your scoring. If it's not (Pierre)
Turgeon scoring, hopefully, it's maybe Al (MacInnis) or Pavol
(Demitra), and now all of a sudden you have some secondary guys to
count on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice knowing you don't have to look to one guy to
contribute goals.'' BECOMING FANS
</P>
<P>
   Joel Quenneville watched Tuesday's game between Colorado and
Detroit, and he admitted to rooting for the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't care who wins. But the Red Wings were up 2-0 in
the series and looking well on their way to a sweep, a bad sign for
the Blues and the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are rooting for the other series to be a long series. It's
only human nature,'' Quenneville said. ``You don't want to see them
have a sweep and have an easy time of it, knowing that they are
going to be fresh and have time to get rested for the next series.
That's the last thing you want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no sweep. Colorado won 5-3. RUNNING ON EMPTY?
</P>
<P>
   Blues defensemen Al MacInnis and Chris Pronger sit at No. 1 and
No. 2 in minutes per game in the playoffs. Pronger leads all NHL
players with 35.82 minutes per playoff game while MacInnis averages
35.61.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis says he feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``And obviously, Prongs is a lot younger than I am,'' MacInnis
said. ``Joel (Quenneville) has given us a lot of time off. We feel
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Quenneville said Pronger and MacInnis were logging just as much
ice time during regular-season play. Pronger ranked first among NHL
players, averaging 30.61 minutes per game, while MacInnis' 29.12
average had him fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a new thing for them,'' Quenneville said. ``They have
grown accustomed to managing their ice, knowing they are going to
be out there a lot. They are very astute as far as their
positioning goes, which can conserve energy.'' nn

STARS GAGGING NOW, BUT WILL THEY CHOKE?
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ First came misfortune Wednesday night, which
eventually resulted in misery, which left the Dallas Stars with a
nagging question to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   Are they gagging in this series?
</P>
<P>
   Gagging, of course, is defined as the first sign of choking.
</P>
<P>
   Open wide, fellows. Let's check those throats.
</P>
<P>
   Staggered again at Kiel Center by a another overtime disaster,
the Stars no longer qualify as the best team in the NHL, no longer
have Detroit in their conference finals cross hairs, and, please,
don't even mention the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there is a much greater concern.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Stars better than even the St. Louis Blues?
</P>
<P>
   When the Blues' Pierre Turgeon, taking a beautiful feed from
Sergei Zubov, ripped home an overtime goal Wednesday night,
second-round survival for Dallas became an immediate issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since Zubov was wearing a visitor's jersey, an assist won't show
up in the official scoring. ``But it was the best pass (Turgeon)
got all night,'' said St. Louis' Geoff Courtnall, celebrating the
3-2 victory with a one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   This second-round series became tied at two wins apiece,
guaranteeing a trip back here after Game 5 at Reunion Arena on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But a more critical issue for coach Ken Hitchcock is the
heavily-favored Stars have not demonstrated any signs of
superiority in the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 was actually their best overall performance of the
series, starting with Eddie Belfour in goal and Mike Modano getting
unleashed again. Yet, the Stars still lost.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov had one of those major blunders that haunts postseason
participants, sliding a mindless pass across his blue line, right
on to the stick of Turgeon. Where was Pat Verbeek with a slash to
the back of the knee when you really need him?
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon took the gift, skated in unchecked on Belfour, and
buried the puck above Belfour's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have that _ he knows it, we all know it,'' said
Hitchcock, describing the Zubov brainlock.
</P>
<P>
   But while that one misplay ended the game, the Stars had spent
the regulation 60 minutes cursing the hockey gods.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly no Cup luck on this evening. Misfortune
nailed them repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Most deflating was when Verbeek poked home what could have been
the game-winner with five and a half minutes remaining in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   Except Jamie Langenbrunner was also cruising the crease area
with Verbeek, and as the replays would show, yes, he had a half a
skate in the blue. Not when the puck went in the net, but as the
puck entered the blue-colored crease
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner was just lifting his skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the rule,'' Hitchcock said. ``I guess that evens out
the Edmonton series.''
</P>
<P>
   That one was the killer, but there was also more.
</P>
<P>
   After a strong first period resulted in a 1-0 Stars lead, the
Blues scored twice in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The first came after Brad Lukowich broke his stick and was
trying to defend Pavol Demitra with just gloves and skates. That
allowed Demitra to slide a feed to Jochen Hecht, who had shaken
Craig Ludwig, and was alone in front of Belfour. Hecht connected
for the tie, and ignited what had been a docile crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the go-ahead goal for St. Louis involved even worse luck for
the Stars. Courtnall fired a seemingly harmless pass from the
corner that crossed in front of Belfour. But the puck connected
perfectly with Modano's stick, and deflected past Belfour into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fluky,'' said St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville. Fluky,
however, still counts.
</P>
<P>
   Playing well enough all evening for a shutout, Belfour instead
was shaking his head over two coulda, woulda, shoulda goals. And
that was before Zubov made his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock shook up his lines for Game 4, and even made the major
move of separating Brett Hull from Modano. He was hoping for a
``jump-start'' for Modano, who had been no factor in two straight
games. That part worked. Modano was a dominant force, scoring less
than a minute into the game, and assisting on Jere Lehtinen's goal
to open the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, he also ``assisted'' on the Courtnall goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of evening for the Stars. A gagging kind of
evening. And now they have to prove that a gag won't lead to a
massive choke. nn

CATHERINE BRANDEL, 56, MUSE AND CHEF OF CALIFORNIA CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MOLLY O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catherine Brandel, one of the quiet forces behind the culinary
tide called California cuisine, died on Tuesday night at her home
in Berkeley, Calif. She was 56.
</P>
<P>
   She had waged a long battle with a rare muscle cancer, said her
brother, Michael Terry of Richland, Wash., who is her only
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   She was an illustrator, chef, forager and mentor to other chefs
as well as a prize-winning hula dancer and exuberant acolyte of
Hawaiian culture. She was a leading expert in wild edible plants
and an indefatigable supporter of small family farms.
</P>
<P>
   She opened and championed farmers' markets throughout the San
Francisco Bay Area, lobbied on behalf of organic growers and helped
create a conduit running from several thousand small-scale farmers
to top restaurants nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   One of two children of a Navy officer, Ms. Brandel was born in
Philadelphia and grew up ``all over the place,'' her brother said,
``but the place that really got under her skin was Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up artistic, and after a brief marriage, studied art
and anthropology at Barnard College and graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Although she earned a teaching degree, she worked as a
scientific illustrator before making a life in food in Berkeley.
Neither her brother nor her longtime friend Nilofer King knew how
Ms. Brandel became obsessed with cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she just loved to eat and to cook,'' Ms. King said.
``And back in the late 1960s, all that joy and celebration was just
in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the flamboyant star chefs, Ms. Brandel staked out a quiet
role for herself. Initially, she gathered wild fruits, nuts and
greens for Chez Panisse, Alice Waters' now-famous restaurant in
Berkeley, and with Julia Child, she organized the Great Chefs of
France cooking program at the Robert Mondavi Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   She had ``this rare attitude toward food, serious and happy at
the same time,'' Mrs. Child said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a segment of ``20/20,'' Ms. Brandel, a mischievous but
soft-spoken storyteller, regaled the audience with tales of her
curious shopping adventures to supply the Great Chefs of France.
Her expert foraging in the Berkeley and Napa Valley hills seemed
tame compared with her quest for the rooster testicles required for
one of Pierre Troisgros' dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine was an original,'' Ms. Waters said. ``She could find
anything, cook anything, teach anything, and I'm not sure the
restaurant could ever have happened without her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Ms. Brandel was named co-chef of Chez Panisse and used
her position to create some of the dishes it has become famous for,
like tangles of wild greens served on brick-oven-fired olive oil
focaccia or local cheeses turned into ravioli with wild onions,
beets and hazel nuts. She also increased public awareness of the
plight of American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Ms. Brandel was a teacher. Throughout her career, she
was a mentor to young chefs. In 1994, she left Chez Panisse to help
create the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St.
Helena, Calif., the California outpost of the Culinary Institute of
America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her course, ``Ingredients, Flavor
Dynamics and Techniques of Evaluation,'' was one of the most
popular courses, said Gregory Drescher, Greystone's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than simply teaching cooking techniques,'' he said,
``Ms. Brandel taught taste.''

Overtime Blues hit Stars again 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ST. LOUIS _ The mirror cracked on the Stars last night, and the
image afterward wasn't pretty. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victimized by two bad breaks and one bad play, the Stars lost a
3-2 overtime game to the St. Louis Blues at the Kiel Center and saw
their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals series tied at
two games apiece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive overtime game in the series and the
second consecutive overtime loss for the Stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All three \RBlues\S goals were lucky goals,'' said Stars
center Mike Modano, who had a goal and an assist. ``It was bad
breaks on our side and good luck on their side, but you have to
work hard for your breaks and your luck. They force us to play a
mistake-free game, and, if we don't, we end up paying for it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars paid heaviest in overtime, when they were dominating
the extra period and lost because of a single mistake. With the
Stars trying to push the puck out of their defensive zone,
defenseman Sergei Zubov made a careless cross-ice pass that was
picked off by Pierre Turgeon in the neutral zone. Turgeon then
walked into the offensive zone and threaded a 40-foot shot past
goalie Ed Belfour and into the upper left corner of the net for the
game-winner 5:52 into overtime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon's goal was almost a perfect snapshot of the series as
the Blues have been continually working to force Stars' mistakes,
and continually working to make the Stars panic. Once again, the
Blues lived off a neutral-zone turnover. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
``If nobody made mistakes, you'd have a lot of scoreless hockey
games.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Blues, the Stars aren't allowing that to
happen. On the Blues' first goal, defenseman Brad Lukowich broke
his stick and forced defensive partner Craig Ludwig to try to
over-cover behind the net against both Jochen Hecht and Pavol
Demitra of the Blues. Hecht played a perfect shell game on Ludwig,
bouncing a pass to himself off the back of the net and taking a
hustling Ludwig completely out of the play. Hecht then passed to
Demitra and moved to the front of the net, where Demitra fed him
for a 10-footer from right in front of Belfour 5:02 into the second
period. It was the second goal of the series for the rookie from
Germany. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who was again solid with 27 saves, had even worse luck
later in the second period. While Blues winger Geoff Courtnall was
rushing into the offensive zone, he was forced into the left corner
and wheeled to throw what he thought was a pass into the slot.
While no Blues player was close to the puck, Modano tried to stop
the pass and accidentally tipped it past Belfour and into his own
net for a 2-1 Blues' lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really looking for it, and I just had my stick on the
ice,'' Modano said. ``When it rains, it pours. It just seems
everything is going against us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, however, hadn't seen the worst of their luck. After
Modano worked a play to tie the game on Jere Lehtinen's goal 40
seconds into the third period, the Stars appeared to have victory
in hand. With about 5 1/2 minutes remaining in the game, Pat
Verbeek slipped a wrister through the pads of Blues goalie Grant
Fuhr. However, Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner had skated hard to
the edge of the goal crease and had his skates inside the crease
before the puck entered the crease. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The play was overturned on replay; an NHL rule designed to
protect goalies prohibits any player from preceding the puck into
the crease on a scoring play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A rule's a rule,'' Matvichuk said. ``It went our way in the
Edmonton series \Rdenying an Oilers goal\S. It went against us
tonight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek said he didn't blame Langenbrunner, who was charging
hard to the net and had his skate in the crease for only a second
or two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't cry over spilt milk,'' Verbeek said. ``It's over, so
let it go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored 59 seconds into the game to give the Stars an
early lead and had a strong game on a new line that included gritty
winger Grant Marshall and was minus Modano's yearlong linemate,
Brett Hull. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've felt all series,'' Modano said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Modano said he would need to feel even better when the
series returns to Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We handled the play for the most part tonight, we made good
decisions with the puck, Eddie made some great saves and we had a
lot of things going,'' Modano said. ``We just have to dig down even
deeper now. The breaks are going against us, so you've got to
really work hard.'' &QL;

HERE'S WHAT HIT THE HEAT: A 32-2 RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was as unforeseeable as the harmony on the court
between Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston. With about four and a
half minutes left in the second quarter on Wednesday night,
something struck the Miami Heat. Its execution became shabby, its
shooting stroke went cold and its hopes of taking control of this
series vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The next 12 minutes 26 seconds of Game 3 of this
three-of-five-game series were a nightmare for the Heat. It was
outscored, 32-2. Knicks 97, Heat 73. Game over. Circle the wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pat Riley, that master motivator, admitted to being
shellshocked by the sudden death of his offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was alarming to me was how quick it happened,'' Riley
said after his team shot 34 percent from the floor. ``About seven
minutes into the second quarter it began to go and we just could
not get it back. They had this run that was just overwhelming. But,
as I know in this game, I know we have one more left in us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, in the gloomy aftermath of their whipping,
the Heat players drummed up cliches about bouncing back and never
saying die. They talked about having fought through adversity
before, and Alonzo Mourning even reminded members of the news media
that the Heat led last year's first-round series, two games to one,
before losing in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubt this team,'' said Dan Majerle, who missed all
five of his shots and played with a severely bruised right
shoulder. ``This team's always been real resilient. We've got no
choice on Friday but to come out and play hard. Everything's on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Majerle appeared battered as he mouthed those words, not
just physically, but mentally. He sounded defeated, a man trying to
convince himself to believe. And he was not alone. The entire Heat
locker room was a dismal collage of bowed heads, stunned
expressions and sullen comments. It was hard for the Heat players
to be the big, bad, bold men they are reputed to be when they knew
they had given up halfway through their most important game of the
year. For when it began going badly, when the Knicks began
expanding their lead, Riley's warriors threw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took a hit and quit on the game,'' Majerle said. ``We
didn't stay the course and keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown, who had all 9 of his points and 5 of his 8 rebounds
in the first quarter, could not deny the truth in Majerle's words.
``It looked like our confidence went,'' he said. ``When it didn't
look good, we lost our fire. Instead of stepping up and coming
together like we should have, we just relaxed and didn't fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Heat's problem during that crucial stretch was the
absence of Mourning. After picking up his fourth foul two minutes
into the third quarter, he sat for nearly seven minutes. Mourning,
who led the Heat with 18 points, was one of Miami's few sources of
scoring in the first half, finishing with 13 of its 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Mourning's removal does not completely explain the team's
fruitlessness. After all, he played for all but 1:10 of its nearly
five-minute scoreless stretch just before the half, and after he
returned for the final 3:23 of the third, the Heat scored 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   This collapse was bigger than Mourning's having a subpar game.
It was Tim Hardaway looking like a shadow of himself on a sore
knee. It was Jamal Mashburn playing soft and not getting to the
free-throw line. It was the Heat being outrebounded by 37-19 and
grabbing just two offensive rebounds over the final three quarters.
It was a Heat bench that produced practically nothing before
garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks certainly deserve credit for their defense, but it
was not as if they were smothering the Heat. Majerle and his
teammates missed numerous open shots when the Knicks were slow on
their rotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots were there,'' Mourning said. ``We were so wide open
that we passed up the drive. Those same shots that we missed this
evening, we made them in Game 2. But when you miss them on a
regular basis, you have to start driving, taking it to the hole.
That's what we didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like hardheads, they continued to hoist 3-pointers,
despite missing their first 17 and finishing 4 for 23 (17.4
percent). Balls clanged off the front of the rim, bounced high and
wide off the back, and one attempt by Keith Askins missed the rim
altogether.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
There has been nothing during the first six weeks of the season to
suggest the Astros are not the team to beat in the National League
Central. Likewise, nothing occurred over the past three days to
indicate the Pittsburgh Pirates have what it takes to do anything
about it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros delivered the knockout punch Wednesday behind another
strong effort from Jose Lima, who held the Pirates to one run in
eight innings to key a 6-2 Astros victory at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Championship fights have been stopped with less bloodshed than
the Astros forced on the Pirates, who were outscored 31-10 in the
three-game series. The Astros completed their third series sweep of
the year and their first at home. They have won 12 of their last 14
games against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' run total for the last three games matches the
Pirates' run total against the two-time defending division champs
since the start of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some problems with this team,'' Pirates manager Gene
Lamont said. ``We came up against a team with hot bats, and their
pitching was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have come to expect that from Lima, who evened his
career record at 31-31 and won for the sixth consecutive start. He
has pitched at least eight innings in three of his last four
outings.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored a run off Scott Elarton in the ninth and had
the potential tying run in the on-deck circle, but Elarton was able
to avoid disaster despite issuing three walks in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely out of rhythm,'' Elarton said. ``I'm glad it
wasn't a 2-1 ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   He could thank the Astros' explosive offense for that. The
Astros overcame a 1-0 deficit by scoring four runs in the sixth
inning. Carl Everett led the attack with three hits, but Richard
Hidalgo delivered the game-winner with a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Big hits are becoming second nature for Hidalgo, who has driven
in 15 runs in his last 18 games while compiling a .317 batting
average during that stretch. Seventeen of Hidalgo's 31 hits have
been for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has come up with some huge hits for us,'' Astros
second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He's a hell of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima moved into some good company Wednesday, joining
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling as the only six-game winners in the
NL. Three of Lima's wins have come at home and three on the road,
but the Astrodome has been particularly good to him. Wednesday's
effort lowered his ERA to 1.97 at home, compared to 4.67 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love pitching in the Astrodome,'' Lima said. ``I love
hearing those people cheering for me. No one thought I'd be at this
point (6-1), but I am. I want to be the No. 1 guy someday.''
</P>
<P>
   He's well on his way. Lima's only stumbling block Wednesday
occurred in the first inning when Pirates left fielder Al Martin
led off with a triple and scored on Mike Benjamin's single. Lima,
who struck out a career-high nine batters, didn't allow another
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That triple didn't bother me,'' Lima said. ``After that, I
kept the ball down and pitched well inside. If you leave the ball
up, they're going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five innings, it appeared the Astros had
exhausted their offensive resources the previous night when they
tied a club record with 19 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Jason Schmidt, whose career record fell to 0-7
against the Astros, retired five of the first six batters he faced
and skirted trouble in the third, fourth and fifth innings when the
Astros had runners in scoring position but failed to cross the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was going to cruise,'' said Bill Spiers, who
started at shortstop for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in the sixth when the first five Astros reached
base. Ken Caminiti drew a leadoff walk, and Everett followed with
the second of his three singles. Both scored on Hidalgo's second
triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good pitch to hit,'' Hidalgo said. ``It was a
fastball. As soon as I hit the ball, I had third base on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates center fielder Brant Brown must have felt like the
Astros were picking on him. Hidalgo's triple got under his glove,
Spiers' subsequent RBI triple flew over his head, and Paul Bako's
broken-bat single landed in front of him. By the time reliever Brad
Clontz could put out the fire, the Pirates' one-run lead had turned
into a three-run deficit.

   After pitching at least six innings in each of his first five
starts, Schmidt has been knocked out after five innings in his last
two trips to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery to me,'' said Schmidt when asked about his
record against the Astros. ``I'm frustrated with myself and
wondering why I can't beat these stinking guys.''

ANGELS WIN, THEN HEAR BAD NEWS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their 1-0 victory over the New York Yankees on
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium might have seemed too good to be
true for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it was.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the clubhouse after Chuck Finley (eight innings)
and Troy Percival (one inning) outdueled Yankees pitcher David
Cone, it was announced that Angels right fielder Tim Salmon will
miss at least five more weeks with a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, examined by hand specialist Dr. Norman Zemel, had an
arthrogram performed Wednesday, a procedure in which dye is
injected into the affected area to enhance X-rays. It showed the
sprain is worse than initially thought and he was fitted with a
short cast he'll wear for three weeks. After the cast is removed,
Salmon will need a minimum of two weeks for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it ever,'' the Angels' Mo Vaughn said when
asked about the team's injuries this season. ``It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has already missed eight games since spraining the wrist
trying to make a sliding catch on a sinking liner by the White
Sox's Paul Konerko at Edison Field on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of being able to enjoy being the first team to shut
out the defending World Series champions this season, Angels
manager Terry Collins had to contemplate a lineup without another
of his top players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You beat the best team in baseball in a tremendous ballgame...
talk about getting a sock in the gut. We got one tonight,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of Sunday we're watching him swing the bat and he feels
good. Then Monday it doesn't feel so good and he's out a week to 10
days. The next thing you know it's six weeks. We have to suck it up
again. We'll take a look and see what our options are, what we got
lineup-wise. Let's just hope he doesn't need surgery after six
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't need Salmon on Wednesday, the way Finley
pitched. He struck out a season-high 11 and allowed three hits _
all singles _ in his eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees only threatened once _ in the third inning _ when
they used a single by Shane Spencer, a throwing error by third
baseman Troy Glaus and a wild pitch to put runners on second and
third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley got four strikeouts in the inning to escape. That's
right, four, tying a major-league record.
</P>
<P>
   After having already struck out Scott Brosius, Finley struck out
Chuck Knoblauch with runners on second and third for strikeout
No.2. Then he struck out Derek Jeter with a a forkball in the dirt,
but catcher Charlie O'Brien couldn't find the ball, which sat on
the dirt just behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The base runners stayed, but Jeter reached first to load the
bases for Paul O'Neill, who struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 33rd time in major-league history a pitcher has
struck out four in an inning, the 14th time in AL history and the
second time by an Angel (Ryne Duren, May 18, 1961 for the L.A.
Angels).
</P>
<P>
   Finley (2-3) came out after the eighth inning because he had
made 131 pitches, and Percival slammed the door in the ninth for
his seventh save. Percival struck out two in a 1-2-3 ninth,
including getting a curveball past Tino Martinez to end it.
</P>
<P>
   American League hitters were batting .133 against Cone (4-1)
going into the game Wednesday, the best by any pitcher in the
majors. The Angels managed five hits off him in seven innings, the
big hit coming from No.9 hitter Andy Sheets. Sheets' hit-and-run
double to right field in the seventh scored Orlando Palmeiro with
the only run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew David was throwing the ball great, he was pretty much
matching me pitch for pitch, inning for inning,'' Finley said.
``Combine pitching like that with their lineup, you figure you got
a tough night ahead of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't nibble, nibble, nibble. You've got to go after them
because you can't let them get in a hitter's count where they can
kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, appeared stunned when told of the news on
Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `it's early in the season' (nonsense) ain't there
anymore,'' he said. ``That's bad news, especially facing teams that
are at full strength. The same kind of thing seems to follow us.
The sunshine never can break through.''

COURT RULES MICROSOFT TEMP WORKERS ENTITLED TO STOCK PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At least 10,000 former temporary workers at Microsoft
Corp. must be allowed to purchase the valuable shares of Microsoft
stock they were denied during their stints there, a U.S. Appellate
Court panel ruled late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a case called In Re Vizcaino, in its narrowest
reading means that a large class of temporary workers at Microsoft
must be permitted to participate in the Redmond, Wash. company's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives discounts of 15 percent
or more on Microsoft stock.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreted more broadly, the Vizcaino decision may mean that
Microsoft _ and all employers in the Western states covered by the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals _ must give the same benefits to past,
present and future temporary workers that conventional employees
receive, including employer-matching 401(k) plans and
employer-funded health insurance, said David Stobaugh, one of the
attorneys who brought the class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, Microsoft will have a hard time saying
people who are employees for the purpose of stock-plan eligibility,
as the court here has said they are, are not employees for other
purposes,'' said Stephen Strong, a colleague of Stobaugh in the
Seattle law firm of Bendich, Stobaugh &AMP; Strong, P.C.
</P>
<P>
   And the ruling _ unless overturned by the full appellate court
or the U.S. Supreme Court _ poses much broader concerns for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant ruling because it cuts across the industry
and cuts across business,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga
Group of Santa Clara, Calif. ``Employers are going to have to
rethink how they classify employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hadn't received the opinion Wednesday and spokesman
Dan Leach said he couldn't comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Enderle estimated that the financial damages to Microsoft
from the decision might be between $15 million and $20 million. He
also said the ruling, which came down after the stock market closed
Wednesday, might also dent Microsoft's stock price today. Microsoft
stock rose five-eighths on Wednesday to close at 80 and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Punishing as a $20 million hit might sound, Microsoft likely can
absorb it. The mammoth software maker has $22 billion in cash on
hand and $2 billion more flows into its coffers every three months.
</P>
<P>
   The class of workers covered in the decision includes temporary
workers and independent contractors who worked 20 hours per week or
more for at least five months over the course of a year, any time
after the end of 1986, Stobaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Former temporary workers at Microsoft who think they're members
of the eligible class can print out forms from a Web site,
www.bs-s.com, to submit a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft currently has 5,500 to 6,500 temporary workers. It
says contingent workers help it affordably expand and contract its
work force when starting and finishing large software projects.
These workers are employees of temporary agencies, not Microsoft,
so they don't receive all the benefits Microsoft employees do,
though they frequently earn higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what remedy former workers will receive hasn't been
determined. The federal court said they should receive the value of
the stock as if they had bought it at the time they first could
have and then held it for one year. Stobaugh and Strong have argued
that the proper holding duration is the average holding period of
people in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Temp workers on Wednesday expressed jubilation over the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding! Oh, wow! I think it's wonderful _ but I bet
temporary agencies will cut back on their wages now,'' said
Charlotte Quinn of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a great victory'' said Marcus Courtney, a
co-founder of WashTech, a union representing computer-industry
technical workers, ``It's not everything we wanted, though.''

 TENTATIVE ACCORD REACHED ON EMERGENCY MILITARY SPENDING BILL  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring their leaders' wishes to hold the spending
down, congressional negotiators tentatively agreed on Wednesday to
spend $11.7 billion in emergency money to finance the fighting in
Yugoslavia and a host of Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee cut deals past midnight in a
game of political poker that began with President Clinton's bid for
$6 billion for the bombing in the Balkans. After two days of
intense haggling, they had not begun to fight over how to pay for
the emergency bill. Nor had they rid it of a myriad of
multimillion-dollar Senate amendments and riders favoring special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Senators sought hundreds of millions for mining, gas, oil,
fishing and other business interests, not everyone's definition of
an emergency, as some Democrats pointed out. Political
conservatives remained furious that most of the money would come
out of the social security surplus. Democrats trying to add
billions for farm aid and school safety programs were voted down as
midnight neared.
</P>
<P>
   Other emergency spending measures for Central American and
Caribbean countries struck last year by hurricanes seemed likely to
grow to include close to $1 billion for the victims of last week's
Midwest tornadoes and American farmers crippled by falling food
prices. That would bring the emergency package to more than $13
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The chief negotiators, Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska and Rep. C.W.
(Bill) Young of Florida, both Appropriations Committee chairmen,
rejected pleas from the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, and the House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, to hold the military spending down to $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Rep. Jerry Lewis, the head of the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee, disagreed on the meaning of the $11
billion figure sought by the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven billion is a ceiling, not a floor,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis responded: ``It was a floor.''
</P>
<P>
   That set the tone for the conference, which veered on Wednesday
from deadly serious to nearly madcap.
</P>
<P>
   Proceedings halted for nearly an hour as Stevens and his fellow
Alaska Republican, Sen. Frank Murkowski, argued for a measure aimed
at helping commercial fishermen ply the wilderness of Glacier Bay
National Park. Conference members stared into space and up to the
heavens as that debate ground on. The measure was opposed by the
House members.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens succeeded in inserting $3 million for commercial
reindeer herders, ``my Santa Claus amendment,'' he called it.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments ground on over another amendment, which would let
natural-gas producers avoid repaying $235 million in penalties and
interest they owe to overcharged consumers in 23 states, ``a
straight special-interests versus public-interest issue,'' said
Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The conferees were working on a deal to kill the natural gas
amendment if House negotiators agreed to restore $150 million they
planned to cut from a program to store 50 tons of Russian
weapons-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Some members wondered allowed what such provisions were doing in
an emergency spending bill aimed at financing NATO's air war. ``The
question of whether it's a emergency or not is in the eye of the
beholder,'' sighed Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Well after midnight, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sought $175
million to provide up to $1 billion in loan guarantees for steel
and iron-ore industies.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Young, the chief appropriators, agreed on $11.7
billion, about $5.7 billion more than Clinton requested for NATO
operations in Kosovo. They added $2.25 billion for military
operations and maintenance, $1.84 billion for a military pay
increase, $300 million for aircraft, $475 million for conbstruction
at overseas bases, $250 million for missiles and munitions, $200
million for the Coast Guard and $100 million for military
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to spend $819 million for war refugees from
Kosovo, far more than the White House sought.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest stumbling blocks lay ahead. Moderates still
must convince converatives that they should pay for the package
with money from the Social Security surplus, rather than cutting
domestic programs. House members had to keep twisting senators'
arms to convince them that they should drop the amendments and
riders benefitting home states and pet interests.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that happened, Obey said, the bill would resemble ``not a
Christmas tree, but a Christmas tree farm.''

MARTINEZ WOWS MARINERS WITH 15-K OUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ken Griffey Jr. thought back to Randy Johnson. David
Segui couldn't make any comparisons. Edgar Martinez remembered last
April 11 ... the last time the Mariners faced the best pitcher on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez humbled some of baseball's best hitters Wednesday
night, striking out 15 Mariners over eight innings in a 9-2 win for
the Boston Red Sox. The Fenway Park crowd of 28,177 chanted
``Pe-DRO! Pe-DRO!'' throughout the night, and hung as many ``K''
cards as they had the last time Martinez pitched.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander is now 7-1, with an earned-run average of 1.81,
and he's making a fine case to start the All-Star Game in his home
park. He has at least 10 strikeouts in six straight starts, the
first pitcher to do that since ... the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go back to Randy,'' said Griffey, when asked of
the last time he'd seen such dominance. ``He's just got everything
out there. You just go up there swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   And often, you go down swinging. Griffey struck out three times,
as did Jay Buhner. Every starting Mariner but John Mabry struck out
at least once. David Bell hit his career-high 11th home run, but
only three others got hits.
</P>
<P>
   No Mariner had more experience against Martinez than leadoff man
Brian Hunter. But familiarity didn't help him; Hunter fanned twice
and now is 5 for 28 lifetime off Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pumped up at the start of a game, and he's throwing
hard,'' said Hunter. ``It felt like he was throwing about 100 miles
per hour early in the game. He's a real smart pitcher, because
he'll use his fastball more early in the game, then later, when
you're gearing up for it, he'll throw his breaking ball for a
strike. He just keeps you guessing. After one strike, you almost
have to go into the two-strike (approach), and it shouldn't have to
be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was most concerned with Edgar Martinez, whom he
retired on a strikeout and fly out after walking him his first
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Junior, I just make my pitches and I hope I get away
with them,'' Martinez said. ``You have to respect him. But you know
what? To be honest, you have to be more careful with Edgar
Martinez, even more than Griffey. Griffey's going to get you,
there's no doubt, but Martinez is going to get two hits. And if
not, you have to thank God 30-hundred times.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar welcomed the challenge, even if he's still seeking his
first hit off Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to face him, because he's one of the best,'' said the
Mariners' designated hitter. ``And the way he's pitching right now,
he is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui was undaunted. Before the game, he told Martinez, a former
Montreal teammate, that he was going to get some hits off him.
Segui did double, but Martinez struck him out twice. Never shy
about displaying his frustrations after strikeouts, Segui was tame
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, he said, is the best pitcher he's ever seen. And his
``Bugs Bunny'' change-up, he added, is the ``filthiest'' change-up
he's ever tried to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never laughed after striking out before, but he made me
laugh,'' Segui said. ``I struck out on a pitch that was closer to
Jay in the on-deck circle than it was to me. I looked out, and
Pedro was laughing. Usually I would throw a bat at the pitcher if
he did that, but he's one of those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of my best friends in baseball, but it would be nice
to see him let me get a hit once in a while. Cory (Segui's son)
needs to eat, too. But he's worth every nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   With a contract that averages $12.5 million annually, Martinez
makes about as much as the entire healthy Mariner staff. Two
rookies, Mac Suzuki (0-2) and John Halama, walked seven Red Sox
last night, and hit another.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners return home having walked 55 over eight games on a
3-5 road trip. Twice Wednesday night, they walked little-known
Brian Daubach to load the bases for Nomar Garciaparra. It was
hauntingly familiar to Monday's game, when Garciaparra hit one
grand slam after a hit-by-pitch and another after a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortstop had four hits and drove in three runs last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garciaparra wants to keep us in town,'' said M's
manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mind pitchers giving up runs,'' he said. ``You don't
mind it. It's going to happen. But, boy, get hit doing it. I can
live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their careers, it's not mine. I can tell you that. Their
careers, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   When Halama walked two in the ninth, leading to three Boston
runs, it pushed his ERA to 5.14. In perhaps the most telling
statistic on the staff-wide struggles, only one Mariners pitcher,
reliever Jose Paniagua, has an ERA below 5.00.

WOMAN'S COURAGE, GRIT RIDE HIGH ATOP HORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ For many people, mounting a 1,000-pound show
horse would not be easy under the best of circumstances. Imagine
trying to do it paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Margo O'Callaghan, who faithfully climbs aboard a horse
three times a week without the use of the right side of her body,
paralyzed from a series of debilitating strokes more than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'd sort of like to refine my scramble into the
saddle,'' she jokes.
</P>
<P>
   She climbs a kitchen stepladder, then sort of hurls her 90-pound
frame across the back of the horse. Once there, her grin turns into
an infectious laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since I can't use my right arm or leg, this will have to
do for the time being,'' she says. ``At least I'm up and ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed she is, trainer Joanna Fowler of Redmond, Wash., says.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ready, all the time,'' Fowler says. ``She's a real
pro who takes very seriously the work we've been doing to get her
ready for a national competition next month.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan, who lives in Seattle with her sister, is training
for the U.S. Equestrian Team's Gladstone Festival of Champions in
New Jersey June 23-27. She'll compete in the Bradshaw Challenge, a
four-day competition involving four teams made up of six
able-bodied and one disabled rider.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the prestigious event showcases some of the
country's top riders in seven equestrian events and serves as a
qualifier for national and world championships.
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan was invited based on past competitions, including
the CALNET (California Network for Therapeutic Riding) National
Championship. She was the 1998 Champion of that event.
</P>
<P>
   Her ultimate goal: to qualify for the U.S. Paralympic Equestrian
team, which will compete in Sydney, Australia, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler has no doubt O'Callaghan can qualify, even though she's
classified as the most severely disabled competitor among those
invited to participate at next month's Gladstone Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know Margo,'' Fowler says. ``She's an incredibly
determined competitor and demanding rider who doesn't like to lose.
Look at how focused she is right now on what she's doing. She never
breaks that focus; she always gives every ride her all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Margo wants something and she wants to win a place on the
team very, very much, I don't believe anything can stop her, not
even on a borrowed horse, which is what all the disabled riders
have to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Fukumoto, O'Callaghan's close friend and riding partner,
said O'Callaghan is a great inspiration to everyone who sees her
riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say `I can't do that' when you have Margo there,
showing you she can do it even with disabilities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler agrees. She has about 50 young people taking lessons at
her stable, and they worship O'Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rush to help her out if they see she needs it. But she
helps them, too. Being around her shows them people with
disabilities can do anything an able-bodied rider can do,'' Fowler
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her courage is another lesson they won't forget. They see her
fall off a horse, bounce right back up and continue her training as
if nothing has happened. She doesn't baby herself one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukumoto wonders if she would have O'Callaghan's determination
and courage under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope if anything happens to me physically, Margo will
be around to kick my behind and help me get my life back like she
has hers,'' she says. ``It hasn't been easy for her, but you'd
never know it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fowler had to use one word to describe O'Callaghan, it would
be intrepid. ``She's amazing, fun to train, but most of all,
intrepid.''
</P>
<P>
   The skies open up, drenching horse and rider. Fowler nods toward
them. ``See what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan, 53, wasn't always the happy, upbeat woman who
laughs joyously as she completes her workout.
</P>
<P>
   When she had her strokes at age 29, she withdrew from the world
around her, sister Liz O'Callaghan recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't interested in going anywhere or doing anything,''
her sister remembers. ``She just sat around or went to her physical
therapy. It wasn't much of a life.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan might still be stuck inside, doing nothing, if it
hadn't been for her physician, Dr. Jean Nokes, who persuaded her to
try the Little Bit Therapeutic Riding Center in Woodinville, Wash.
The non-profit organization teaches people with disabilities to
ride horses.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago, and O'Callaghan hasn't slowed down since.
She still rides at Little Bit once a week, and added dressage
training with Fowler two times weekly five years ago, Fukumoto
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was and still am in awe of Margo and what she can do on a
horse, '' Fukumoto says. ``Her riding is incredible, considering
that riders usually control their horses with their legs. I just
don't know how she does it with one leg and one arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``And her balance is superb.... I don't know how she did that,
considering her condition at first. All I know is she's in complete
control all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan competes in dressage, an event that requires the
rider and horse to complete certain moves in perfect harmony. If it
were compared to ice skating, dressage would be the compulsory
figures, Fowler explains. The second phase of dressage is a
free-style routine set to music, called the Musical Kur.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we choreograph moves that fit music chosen by
the rider,'' Fowler says. ``Margo picked `Can-Can' and `Fiddler on
the Roof,''' really delightful music, but requiring a lot of
intricate moves. She's already performing the whole routine without
missing any of the moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukumoto is so committed to her friend's success she is
collecting donations to cover O'Callaghan's expenses in the 1999
show season. An account has been set up in O'Callaghan's name at
ACORD, a non-profit organization; Fukumoto said people can call her
at 206-932-1112 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumoto will pay her own expenses to New Jersey so she can
serve as support staff for O'Callaghan and the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't miss it for the world,'' Fukumoto said. ``She's my
hero.''

BOMB THREAT AT UPSTATE SCHOOL FORCES OUT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue was escorted out of an upstate high school
on Wednesday afternoon after a bomb threat interrupted a discussion
that she was having with students about the issue of school
violence. The 1,900 students at Schenectady High School, however,
were not evacuated while the building was searched.
</P>
<P>
   The Schenectady schools superintendent, Raymond Colucciello,
said security procedures have been changed in the wake of incidents
like the 1998 shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., in which false alarms
were used to lure students outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always leave,'' he said, explaining the decision not
to evacuate the students. ``The recent guidelines say if you go
outside, you may be putting them in harm's way.'
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor's chief of staff, Eileen Long, said
school officials decided to call off the visit, and they escorted
Ms. Donohue and another member of the task force, Mayor Jerry
Jennings of Albany, from the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety concerns for the students and the faculty members
that were in that school were the most important,'' Ms. Long said.
``We did not want to hamper their ability to implement their
procedures regarding school security.''
</P>
<P>
   Colucciello said school officials did not want Ms. Donohue in
the way. ``Collectively, the governor's staff and our staff decided
to end the interview,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colucciello said a search by school and law enforcement
officials quickly determined that the threat was a hoax. He said
the caller seemed to be an older woman, not a student, who did not
know the school well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donohue is the chairwoman of a state task force on school
violence and had been meeting with about 25 students in the school
library to discuss the issue. In recent weeks, she has been
visiting schools across the state. She was about midway through the
conversation, which included a discussion of bomb-scare procedures,
when the threat came in by telephone shortly before 1 p.m.,
Colucciello said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force was formed several weeks before the Littleton,
Colo., killings pushed school violence issues to the forefront of
national attention. Ms. Donohue's visit to Schenectady was widely
publicized.

HUNDLEY HOMER SPARKS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi did it Monday and again Tuesday. Hit
the home run. Actually, two each night.
</P>
<P>
   The third night wasn't charming. With an opportunity to tie the
game with a base hit or give the Dodgers the lead with a homer in
the eighth inning, Mondesi struck out.
</P>
<P>
   It was no big deal because Todd Hundley had his back.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer in the ninth tied it and the Dodgers rallied for
a 3-2 win against the Chicago Cubs in front of 40,007 Wednesday at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer came off Cubs closer Rod Beck, a Grant High
product. He hit Beck's fourth pitch into the right-field bleachers
to tie the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros followed Hundley's fifth homer with a double down
the left-field line. Tripp Cromer pinch-ran and Beck intentionally
walked Todd Hollandsworth. Adrian Beltre moved the runners over a
base with a bunt and Cromer scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who has allowed three homers this season, fell to 3-3.
Jamie Arnold (2-0) pitched one scoreless inning of relief for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the Dodgers were pressing to score before then is
best illustrated by the eighth inning. Trailing 2-0, Beltre led off
with a single and pinch-hitter Dave Hansen doubled to the right
field wall.
</P>
<P>
   But a strong relay throw from Cubs second baseman Mickey
Morandini to catcher Sandy Martinez, who blocked the plate well,
was enough to get Beltre at the plate. Instead of having runners at
second and third and none out, Hansen was left on second with one
out.
</P>
<P>
   After Eric Young grounded out, Jose Vizcaino doubled off Cubs
starter Kevin Tapani to right-center and pull the Dodgers with 2-1.
Reliever Scott Sanders walked Gary Sheffield but struck out Mondesi
with a 3-2 curveball. Mondesi entered the day with a
major-league-best 13 homers, including four in the first two games
against the Cubs. Tapani allowed one run in 72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were in need of a good pitching performance from
starter Darren Dreifort and he brought one. He allowed two runs in
52/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Sheffield and Mondesi singled with two outs in the first
and were stranded when Todd Hundley struck out, the Dodgers got one
runner past first base in the next five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dreifort baffled the Cubs the first time through the
order and didn't allow a hit until Sammy Sosa doubled with two outs
in the fourth. An inning later Tyler Houston hit his second homer
of the series. He led off the fifth with an opposite-field homer to
left on a 2-0 count to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. It was Houston's
third homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs stretched their lead to 2-0 in the sixth, and it was
again the leadoff hitter who did the damage. Lance Johnson singled
to right and moved to second on Jose Hernandez's single.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grace flied out to the warning track in right, which
allowed Johnson to move to third and bring Sosa to the plate.
Before any semblance of fireworks could begin, Dreifort uncorked a
wild pitch that Hundley tried to backhand. It allowed Johnson to
score. Sosa grounded to shortstop for the second out and reliever
Pedro Borbon retired lefty-hitting Henry Rodriguez on a grounder to
first to finish the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed two runs on four hits in a serviceable outing,
but Tapani bordered on brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   After Karros singled to center with two outs in the fourth,
Tapani retired the next 10 Dodgers in order without a ball being
hit out of the infield.

KNICKS CRUSH HEAT, 97-73 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was as if Latrell Sprewell had thrown a match down
on the court just before the half and a flame quickly spread
throughout the building. By the middle of the third quarter, the
crowd looked on fire as they twirled their orange towels over their
heads like helicopter blades and nearly lifted Madison Square
Garden off its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Elephants could fly on Wednesday night during the New
York Knicks' inconceivable 32-2 run that was stoked by Sprewell in
the second quarter, carried on by an assortment of his teammates
into a wild third and left a crestfallen Pat Riley staring into the
stands long before the final buzzer sounded to end his team's
misery.
</P>
<P>
   His Heat, the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, is one
game from elimination after the Knicks grabbed a 2-1 lead in this
three-of-five-game series with an emphatic 97-73 victory in Game 3.
The Knicks can advance to the second round by winning Game 4 on
Friday night at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   An inspired Sprewell helped put them in their enviable position
by stepping onto the floor in the middle of a somewhat flat start
by the Knicks and swiping a pass by the Heat's Tim Hardaway 12
seconds into his appearance. By the time he released a silky
3-pointer to give the Knicks a lead with 3 minutes second left in
the second quarter _ a lead they would not relinquish _ Sprewell
had the place jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a way of getting you pumped up,'' said Sprewell, who
scored a game-high 20 points and fed off the crowd's fever. ``The
energy was as high as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   This night was not just about Sprewell's love affair with the
crowd. It was about the pained Patrick Ewing pushing forward on his
aching left Achilles' tendon to grab 8 rebounds and score 15 points
on the night. It was about a Allan Houston fighting off flu
symptoms that left him alternating a diet of Advil and bottled
water and coming up with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think emotion carried me,'' Houston said. ``I feel
great. We won. So I feel tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of reason. This nearly seamless production by
the Knicks struck an uncanny resemblance to the way the Knicks
dominated the Heat in Game 1. Once again, Houston and Sprewell
found a groove together. Once again, the Knicks led by as many as
30 points in the game. Once again, Miami was unthinkably out of
sync from the perimeter, missing its first 17 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sort of settled for those, you know,'' Riley said.
``The shot was there, but it wasn't going in for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The more they missed, the more long rebounds ended up in the
hands of players like Chris Childs, who pushed the Knicks toward
easy baskets in transition. Childs was at the root of Hardaway's
meltdown, too. Once again, Hardaway was lost in territory that used
to be his. He was 0 for 5 from 3-point range and was so frustrated
he didn't stick around to see the end. With 8:45 left in a game
that had been put away, Hardaway felt he was fouled by Childs. He
argued, cursed and ranted some more at the official Mike Mathis.
And for that, he was mercifully ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to pull him away from there because we needed him
in the game,'' said Alonzo Mourning, who scored a team-high 18
points for Miami. ``I thought Mike was wrong. He was kind of quick
to do that. But I mean, it's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The afterglow has a 48-hour limit for the Knicks. They know what
it's like to hit the Heat with a blowout, just as they did in Game
1, and have the favor returned the next time, as in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go back and watch Game 2,'' Houston said. ``And I
want to see what we did wrong in that game and learn from it.
Hopefully, we can learn from it. I know the next one is going to be
a war.''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``war'' keeps getting bandied about when these two
teams are involved. But through three games, the finishes have not
been tense, not even close. In each game, there has been a big run
to decide the game. This one was no different.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' 32-2 run began with a jumper by Ewing with 3:34 left
in the first half and ended when Jamal Mashburn hit only the second
field goal in a 12-minute span on a jumper with 4:15 left in the
third. In between, the Knicks dived for every loose ball and
harassed the Heat with their defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to see a rabid Marcus Camby defying his spindly
frame by beating the rugged P.J. Brown to rebounds. It was another
to watch Ewing, playing with every joint of his 36-year-old body in
need of ice, flying on the floor for a loose ball in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of effort was the opposite of the lethargic start that
left the well-oiled Heat up, 11-4, in the opening four minutes of
the game. A couple of minutes later, Sprewell arrived to strike a
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute a lot of this to the crowd,'' Sprewell said.
``They had me pumped. It was just great, just a lot of fun.''

WASHINGTON TEACHER IN CHINA FINDS PROTECTIVE STUDENTS AMID
TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROSEMARY ADANG, SPECIAL TO THE P-I  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Rosemary Adang, a faculty member at Highline
Community College in Des Moines, Wash., for nine years, is teaching
English this academic year at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in
China. As part of a faculty exchange program, she also is studying
Chinese culture. In the wake of NATO's accidental bombing of
China's Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last Friday, Adang
described the tensions in Shanghai in e-mail messages to the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The time references are in Shanghai
time, which is 15 hours ahead of Seattle time. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ I taught two classes of first-year students
Wednesday. They, like students from all the major universities,
have been involved in the demonstrations (against NATO), and do
generally believe the bombing (of China's Embassy in Belgrade last
week) was intentional. It's a sad statement about our relations
with the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the English Department went into each class before
me to pave the way, but I don't know exactly what she said to them.
She had told me her intention was just to remind them to respect me
as an international guest.
</P>
<P>
   But the students did not direct any of their anger at me; in
fact, they were as protective as the faculty. One student even gave
me a hand-folded origami crane and told me it was a symbol of peace
and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Another student asked me during a break if I had been scared.
When I said that I had (been fearful) to some extent, he said not
to worry because people know that individual Americans are not at
fault. But then he said, ``But there are radicals out there, so be
careful and stay at home as much as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   My third-year classes on Friday may be a bit rougher as they are
much more politically active, but I think they'll also hold the
distinction between the American government, which most of them see
as evil, and individual Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a sad week here in Shanghai. In an unrelated incident,
one of my graduate students committed suicide last weekend, and
that's been a big focus of my attention and feelings as well as the
bombing. (On Wednesday) after teaching for four hours, I attended
the funeral. There is no evidence that it was related to these
other events....
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night I attended the (meeting of the university's vice
president), where for over an hour he spoke about the bombing in
the most inflammatory terms possible, referring to the brutal,
vicious action; telling us we did not know the truth because we get
our information from the Western press; saying that the explanation
given by the United States and NATO was clearly false; and
referring to the eventual triumph of good over evil.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that the university guaranteed our safety on campus
and in our apartments and that we should be cautious elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I think we're safe right now here in Shanghai, though the recent
events are very disturbing....
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy happened just as I was going into an
unusual stretch of five days without classes to teach.... Being
away from my normal environment and my students (made) gauging the
tension somewhat more difficult, but at least here we have access
to CNN and some Chinese news in English....
</P>
<P>
   Our Chinese friends tell us that the American apology has not
been carried in the Chinese press, though apparently Tuesday
morning the Chinese government finally issued a public statement of
the apology.
</P>
<P>
   We're just a few blocks from the American Consulate, where there
have been protests since the bombing, and there are many more
police on the streets than usual, but the people in the hotel and
in a nearby restaurant have been very kind to us.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese person told us that reasonable people here know that
(President) Clinton and NATO have not gone mad. Another said that
because of the upcoming 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
protests, the government is eager to turn any unrest outward.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as far as we know all the local universities
have bused students to the protests, and many of my own students
are suspicious enough of American foreign policy to be sincerely
angry and skeptical of the explanation of the bombing as an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, we've witnessed the presence of many police, a
convoy of about eight military trucks and one group of soldiers
that we saw running together toward the consulate. Police were
turning cars away from the intersection next to our hotel, which is
a route to the consulate.
</P>
<P>
   People on the streets, though, have not been noticeably hostile
to us. We've received some looks that I would call even more
searching than usual, but we've also received friendly looks and
nods that to me seem to be attempts to reassure us of their good
will.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm sure you know, Chinese people receive very little news of
the plight of the Kosovo people, hearing instead phrases like ``the
forced expulsion of the Albanians'' as the most negative reflection
of the situation. Many believe the stories on CNN are Western
propaganda and greatly exaggerated or possibly even fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   We're not very afraid for our personal safety, but it's
disturbing knowing that many Chinese people do hold America
responsible and believe that this could have been a purposeful
action....
</P>
<P>
   Again, we think we and Americans who happen to be in Shanghai
right now are probably safe as long as they stay away from the
protests and don't provoke reactions.

EQBAL AHMAD, SCHOLAR AND ANTIWAR ACTIVIST, DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eqbal Ahmad, a political scientist and peace activist who as one
of the Harrisburg 7 was accused of planning to abduct Henry A.
Kissinger to protest the Vietnam War, died on Tuesday in Islamabad,
Pakistan. He was 67 and lived in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad died when his heart failed after surgery for colon cancer,
said his wife, Julie.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring four years ago as professor of political science
at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., he returned to Pakistan,
where he had grown up. In retirement there, he wrote regularly on
international affairs for publications in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his academic career, he took strong positions on many
issues, which he made known through Op-Ed articles in The New York
Times and other newspapers, as well as other writings. He was a
longstanding defender of the Palestinian cause, opposed the drift
to religious absolutism and publicly denounced the death threat
made against the author Salman Rushdie in 1989 by the Iranian
government. Edward Said, the Columbia University scholar,
characterized Ahmad as ``an unconventional radical.''
</P>
<P>
   Noam Chomsky, a longtime friend, said that since Ahmad had
returned to Pakistan he had unsuccessfully sought to establish an
independent university there ``in a context of extreme danger,
brutal violence and rabid intolerance,'' and that ``his friends
constantly feared for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in January 1971 that Ahmad, then a fellow at the Adlai
Stevenson Institute of International Affairs at the University of
Chicago, was indicted along with six Catholic pacifists on charges
of plotting to blow up heating tunnels under government buildings
in Washington and then to kidnap Kissinger, who at the time was
President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad's co-defendants included Philip Berrigan, then a Catholic
priest; Elizabeth McAlister, then a nun; two other Catholic
priests, a former priest and a former nun. Ahmad, a Muslim, was
with Chomsky, one of the earliest and most vocal opponents of
American policies in Vietnam and Cambodia to emerge on the nation's
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   By the winter of 1971, when the trial got under way, it became
clear that much of the government's case was based on the evidence
of an FBI informer who was a fellow prisoner of Berrigan's at the
Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. At the time, Philip
Berrigan was serving a prison sentence for raiding a Selective
Service office in Catonsville, Md., and pouring blood on the files.
The court heard that Sister Elizabeth McAlister, who would later
marry Berrigan, had written letters to him in Lewisburg saying that
someone identified as ``Eq'' had proposed the kidnapping as an
antiwar move.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Ahmad, who was free on bail, held a news
conference at which he conceded that an abduction of Kissinger was
discussed over cognac at a dinner on a hot August evening in
Westport, Conn., after the guests had had a number of drinks. He
said a ``citizen's arrest of Nixon'' had been discussed. The idea
was to stage a sit-in at the White House where ``a people's grand
jury would issue a subpoena for the national leader to face a war
crimes tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it could not be done,'' Ahmad said. ``There was no
agreement that a kidnapping could be done nonviolently nor that it
would have the desired impact on the war. Consequently there was no
plan.``
</P>
<P>
   After the prosecution took five weeks to present its case,
Ramsay Clark, the former attorney general, shocked the court when
he rose and represented his clients with three terse sentences.
``Your Honor,'' he said, ``the defendants shall always seek peace.
They continue to proclaim their innocence. The defense rests.``
</P>
<P>
   It proved sufficient, for on April 5, after the jury spent 59
hours without reaching unanimity, a mistrial was declared. Ten
members of the jury had voted for acquittal while 2 said the
government had proved its case. No new trial was sought.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Ahmad said, ``We shall be out on the streets as
fast as we can to continue our antiwar demonstrations.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros can't lose anybody else. Otherwise, Jose Lima will have
to find a bigger cap.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the level of his pitching acumen, he may have to
anyhow. His head swells a little bit every fifth day. Could you
picture Lima clutching the Cy Young Award?
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, try. Lima, the Astros' resident oddfellow _ even in a
clubhouse that includes Derek Bell _ is having a year that should
distinguish him from the pack, as if that were necessary. On
quirks, silly faces and animated gestures, he stands apart. A
greater eccentric you will be hard-pressed to find.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at present, a tougher pitcher to hit. He beat the Pirates
6-2 Wednesday night for his sixth consecutive victory after taking
the mound wearing a hat upon which he had scrawled the numbers of
all his fallen comrades. There was an 18 for countryman Moises
Alou, a 12 for Ricky Gutierrez, a 21 for Mitch Meluskey, a 19 for
Doug Henry and a 25 for Jose Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McCraw's 16 will be there, too, when Lima makes his next
start Tuesday in Los Angeles. The Astros' hitting coach will be
taking a leave of absence after Sunday's game to begin treatments
for his recently diagnosed prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Lima said. ``Tom's my boy. But his situation is
different, more serious. He has cancer. I pray for him. I hope God
takes care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers serve to remind Lima that, because his ballclub is
playing short-handed, he ``must work that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima wears his knickers high and his heart on his sleeve. The
stronger he pitches, it seems, the more animated he gets. And he's
pitching beautifully right now, good enough at the puzzled Pirates'
expense to have joined the Phillies' Curt Schilling as the National
League's first six-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the same distinction a year ago. That's right. He was
also 6-1 at the outset last season en route to the breakthrough
16-8 finish that forewarned of his potential to be a serious,
reliable, every-fifth-day starter. There will be no more comical
(bullpen) relief in Jose's foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   This guy is good. Funny, too.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his reaction to Ed Sprague's left-field foul
ball in the sixth inning that missed becoming a monster three-run
homer by mere feet, Lima said: ``I go AHHHHHH! I blow it (foul). I
say, `God, God, please, please.' No way I hang a pitch like that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima's evolution from erratic thrower to polished pitcher has to
do with a change in his animal instincts, suggests manager Larry
Dierker. Two years ago, when Lima was in the process of going 1-6
doing mostly garbage-time middle relief, Dierker sat him down and
spoke to him of ``the way of the dog and the way of the cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Lima was a dog _ in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog challenges every hitter, strength against strength,''
Dierker said, ``and you're going to lose a lot of those
dogfights.''
</P>
<P>
   Re: Lima vs. Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The cat, of course, is stealthier and sneakier. He ambushes the
hitter, which is what Lima has learned to do, although he said of
Dierker's dog/cat parable: ``I remember he said that to me, but I
don't understand it. Tell it to me again, so I can comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, never mind, Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a more sophisticated pitcher now,'' Dierker said.
``He's very good at challenging hitters but also at being careful
when he needs to be. He knows when it's OK to come after a guy and
when to throw the ball out of the zone. He's finally figuring
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker called Lima's walking Jason Kendall earlier in the sixth
after Kevin Young's double ``semi-intentional, a sign of his new
maturity. He's no longer afraid to put a man on.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturity? One Pirate begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That jumping-around (stuff) gets to you,'' Pittsburgh's Al
Martin said. But Martin added: ``He's definitely a tough pitcher.
His changeup is one of the best in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima hasn't had a truly bad outing yet. His lone loss, in his
first start April 8, still saw him go eight innings, giving up just
two earned runs and striking out seven. At Chicago on April 20, he
lasted only five innings but earned a win anyway because the Astros
scored 10 runs behind him.
</P>
<P>
   This night, his mates got him four in the sixth and two more in
the seventh, making moot the quick run he gave up in the first when
Martin led off with a first-pitch triple and the second hitter,
Mike Benjamin, singled Martin home.
</P>
<P>
   Lima would go eight innings, losing his chance for a second
consecutive complete game only because, with a day off today,
Dierker thought Scott Elarton needed some action. The Astros' thin
pen is actually overrested at present.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, in part, to Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' he said, ``is to be No. 1. With more hard work,
someday I can be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he'll paint it on his cap.

BASS TOURNAMENT TO BENEFIT ABUSED CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB WHEAT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASTAIC, Calif. _ Joan Flynn knows how much of a difference fishing
can make in a child's life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Flynn adopted an 8-year-old boy she met two years
earlier at Royal Family Kids Camp, a Costa Mesa summer retreat for
abused, abandoned and neglected children. Today the camp is one of
two charities that benefit from her work in bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to camp is one of the few happy moments for these kids
(age 7 to 11) in their young lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn is helping coordinate the seventh annual Bassing for
Abused Kids team-fishing tournament Saturday at Castaic Lagoon.
Proceeds benefit the camp and Santa Clarita's First Nurturing
Touch, which assists in the training of foster families. To
encourage family participation, a free trout derby for children is
also staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many top pros who fish the tournament, but we also
have a lot of great `buddy teams' made up of father-son,
mother-daughter, even mother-in-law and son-in-law combinations,''
Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Manifold, Royal Family Kids Camp director, said the money
raised from Bassing for Abused Kids is crucial to his budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at least a third of our budget, and it comes down
literally to how many kids can go,'' Manifold said. ``We were
founded nationally here, but this tournament has allowed us to have
58 camps in 24 states going this summer. So think of the dramatic
impact anglers can have on (helping) hurting kids, just by doing
what they love doing best _ fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many campers don't have even bare essentials _ socks, shoes,
toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide that for them,'' Flynn said, ``as well as a
`birthday party' day for all 110 kids because a lot of times
they've never had anyone to even acknowledge it in the past. Can
you imagine being a kid and never having a birthday party? Or even
(not) getting a card, much less a present?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never more than two campers to one counselor because
these children need special attention. Sometimes people think
abused kids are somebody else's problem.... We provide love and
change to break the cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament director Ron Cervenka donates his time and the time
of his staff; he figures it's the least they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only tournament me and my staff does for nothing
each year, and that's because we know the money really goes to
directly help these kids,'' said Cervenka, a Burbank homicide and
robbery detective from Saugus who also directs the Southern
California division of the Western Outdoors News Bass
team-tournament circuit. ``Bass fishing has been really good to me,
so it's only right that I can give something back.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn notes that every year the event has grown, with 78 teams
vying for the $1,000 top prize and some 650 children enjoying the
derby last April, when $20,000 was raised for Southland children.
The event was moved to May this year _ even though April is
National Child Abuse Month _ because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Bassing for Abused Kids charity event is Saturday at Castaic
Lake Recreational Area. Take the Golden State Freeway (5) north,
exit at Lake Hughes Road and turn right. Turn left on Ridge Route
Road and right into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is $6 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A free trout derby for those 15 and younger is from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. at the lower lake _ Castaic Lagoon. Other activities include
face-painting, games for children and a charity raffle ($2 per
ticket). The grand prize a 1999 Ford Ranger pickup. Raffle tickets
can be purchased in advance at the Magic Ford dealership at the
Valencia Auto Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The bass-fishing team tournament begins at sunup at the upper
lake's west ramp. Entry is $120 a team; registration is from 6 p.m.
to 10 p.m. Friday and again from 4 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. Saturday at
the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   Trophies are awarded to the top three placers, to the big-fish
winner (a $20 optional entry) and to the top man/woman and
child/adult combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Event information: (805) 521-1319 or (714) 540-6690. Park

NO FIREWORKS AS ANGELS SHUT OUT YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hostilities were expected at Yankee Stadium Wednesday
night, one night after some nastiness between the New York Yankees'
Derek Jeter and Anaheim's Troy Percival. Instead, there was nothing
but brilliant pitching, and ultimately, frustration for David Cone
and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, the Angels' ace, carried a 5.92 earned run average
into the game, but pitching against the Yankees brings out the best
in him. He struck out 11 in eight innings and allowed just three
hits in a 1-0 decision over Cone, before a crowd of 23,540.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim run came in the seventh inning, and it was the
bottom of the Angels' order that finally got to Cone. Orlando
Palmeiro, the No. 7 hitter, worked a leadoff walk. Charlie O'Brien
tried and failed three times to bunt, a strikeout, but then the
right-handed hitting Andy Sheets leaned over the plate to stroke a
line drive into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro got a terrific jump off first base and by the time Paul
O'Neill recovered the ball and relayed it back to the infield,
Palmeiro was across the plate and Sheets was standing on third.
Jeter, standing near first base, dropped his head in disgust, and
Cone, backing up home, kicked at the dirt slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone kept the Angels from scoring any more runs, lobbying loudly
to the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre to remain in the game before
retiring Mo Vaughn on an inning-ending pop out. But one run was one
too many and Cone (4-1) suffered his first loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley improved his season record to 2-3 and went to 16-8
against the Yankees for his career. Percival earned the save for
the second straight night, striking out Chili Davis and Tino
Martinez in a quiet ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Percival hit Jeter with a fastball in the ninth inning of
Tuesday's game, an overnight of reflection did nothing to change
opinions. Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, was still
convinced Wednesday that Percival nailed Jeter on purpose, and
Percival maintained that the Yankees were ridiculous to think he
would intentionally create a situation in which O'Neill and Bernie
Williams would get to bat with a chance to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The ill feelings were there before Wednesday night's game, and
the umpires did not attempt any pre-emptive actions to curtail a
possible brushback battle. When Terry Collins, the Anaheim manager,
strolled to the plate to exchange lineup cards with the Yankees
coach Chris Chambliss, the plate umpire, Dan Morrison, quietly
sorted out the copies and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Only Cone knows if he went to the mound intending to retaliate.
Only Cone knows if he was waiting for the proper circumstances to
plunk somebody: two out and no one on base and some noteworthy
Angel at the plate, whether it be Darrin Erstad or Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone and Finley quickly locked into a duel and there really
was no margin for error or retaliation. Every runner represented
the potential lead run; the outcome could have turned with any
batter.
</P>
<P>
   Most American League umpires are calling a narrowed version of
the strike zone, without fringe benefits: You must throw it over
the plate to get a strike. But Morrison was giving both pitchers a
bit extra off the corners, and Finley and Cone seized on this
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, armed with a live fastball and reacting jauntily on close
pitches, threw strikes consistently and only reached two-ball,
no-strike counts once in the first 19 batters he faced. The
left-handed Finley was both predictable and unhittable. He threw
fastballs to get ahead in the count, and then, almost without
exception, he finished off the Yankee batters with his
split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had their chances against Finley. Shane Spencer led
off the third inning with a single to left. Scott Brosius struck
out, but Troy Glaus, the third baseman, threw the ball away on Joe
Girardi's grounder, and the Yankees had first and second and one
out. Finley threw a wild pitch to advance the runners before
striking out Chuck Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   With Jeter due to bat, O'Brien went to the mound to mull over
the situation. Jeter is among the game's hottest hitters, first
base was open, and the slumping and discouraged O'Neill was on
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Finley pitched to Jeter carefully, but once he got two strikes,
Finley threw a splitter that Jeter chased unsuccessfully; the ball
went in the dirt near home plate, O'Brien lost sight of it and
Jeter hustled to first. Bases loaded for O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill struck out, Finley's fourth strikeout of the inning,
tying a major league record. O'Neill is 0 for 14 with runners in
scoring position since May 1.

<P>
   BUFFALO _ It was not his fault. The Bruins Wednesday night lost
a playoff game that they should have won, but no one was blaming
goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The B's thoroughly outplayed the Sabres for two periods. Dafoe
faced only seven shots in the first 40 minutes, and Boston led,
2-1. But the Sabres outshot the Bruins, 18-7, in the third and won,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was not right. This is upstate New York. You do not expect to
get your wallet picked in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about not staying back,'' Dafoe said. ``But we
didn't practice what we preached. A one-goal lead in the Stanley
Cup playoffs after two periods has got to be enough. But we sat
back and totally let them come at us. Why it happened, I don't
know. They outshot us, 14-1, at the start of the third, and that's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey guys don't point fingers. An NHL locker room has no Wade
Boggs saying, ``Hey, I got my three hits.'' In a league largely
populated by Canadian farm boys, Eastern Europeans, Scandinavians,
and snow-belt Americans, there is no room for the blame game. Dafoe
knew he outplayed the great Dominik Hasek in Game 3, but there was
no need for excuses or chest-thumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in pretty good shape,'' said the polite, sad-eyed
goalie. ``But for one reason or another . . . I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Bruins felt there was reason for confidence after two
periods. The B's had the Sabres back on their heels (do skates have
heels?). Fans at Marine Midland Arena were booing the locals. The
game belonged to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought that,'' said Dafoe. ``We're a very good
team when we have a lead. Those first two periods were the best
periods we've played in the series. I was very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has carried the B's quite a few times this season, but he
was little more than an interested bystander when the Bruins
humbled the Sabres in periods one and two. Seven shots. Six saves.
One softie goal after a Ray Bourque penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dreaded third. The B's went to the Patrick
Buchanan (conservative) game plan, and it backfired. Teams that
play to win usually win. Teams that play not to lose usually lose.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Rhett Warrener tied it in the seventh minute of the
third period, and Dixon Ward put the hometown team ahead a couple
of minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to lose one or two assignments, and they
capitalized,'' reasoned Boston coach Pat Burns. ``That second goal
changed everything. I knew when they got that second goal that the
whole momentum changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrener's goal was a second-chance effort. Dafoe saved the
defenseman's first shot but was unable to control the puck. ``I
made the save with my stick, but it went straight back out to
him,'' said Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   These Bruins are young. Most of them had never won a playoff
series before beating Carolina in the first round of these
playoffs. Dafoe had never won a series before he beat the
Hurricanes, and he remembers that Boston trailed, 2-1, before
winning the final three games of that series. The experience serves
them well now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at this as a panic situation,'' said the
goalie. ``If we win Friday, we've accomplished what we set out to
do here.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be important to put Game 3 in the rear view mirror. All
the B's went to bed Wednesday night knowing that they gave one
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-goal lead after two periods in the Stanley Cup playoffs
has got to be enough,'' said Dafoe. ``But for one reason or another
_ I really don't know _ we sat back and they totally came at us. We
shouldn't be doing that at this point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stop the puck, that's all. It's the one thing I do. But
this is not the way this should have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more experience than some of our younger players,''
said Burns. ``What we have to do is convince the younger guys that
it'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe may need a little convincing. He knows he played well
enough to win Wednesday night. He made more saves and more
difficult saves than the indomitable Dominik. But his team lost the
game, a game it should have won.

SONICS COULD BE SEEKING SWEETER ARENA DEAL THROUGH WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One thing you hate to hear is that maybe the
SuperSonics would use Seattle's love of women's basketball as a way
of gaining more control of KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   A theory of that sort was floated in city hall this week _ after
the mayor got a letter from the Sonics ownership arm, The Ackerley
Group, asking for, among other things, dates for WNBA games and the
ability to book more events at the Seattle Center venue.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor's office released a letter it sent back to
the Sonics outlining lease concessions the city would grant the
Sonics for WNBA games, should the Sonics be awarded one of four
expansion franchises for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Mayor Paul Schell told public radio listeners he and
city council members were not comfortable giving the Sonics extra
dates, as requested.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the Sonics, through their operating and ownership
groups, Full House and The Ackerley Group, were not amused that the
city had given the appearance of taking the offensive in these
negotiations over WNBA arena dates.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a city deal, per se. Bringing a WNBA team to Seattle
is the Sonics' call. The whole point of the WNBA was for NBA teams
to have summertime sports entertainment to help fill vacant arenas
during the NBA's offseason.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the grass-roots, girls-need-role-models-too
business model used by the now defunct American Basketball League,
which brought the Reign to play in front of a loyal and
not-so-small circle of fans in a more community-oriented fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But with the ABL gone, the only hope for pro women's hoops rests
with the NBA and its mega-corporate franchises. For women's hoops
fans, it is sort of like little sister meets Big Brother _ and
watch out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson in how quickly the good feelings surrounding
women's pro basketball can be shredded in the corporate world of
big bucks sports entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   All but four of the existing 12 WNBA teams now own or control
their arenas. So the Sonics have been told by the league that it
would be good to find out exactly what kind of deal the Sonics can
get from the city, since a model for success in the WNBA is based
on arena control and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics asked for the moon, according to city hall insiders.
</P>
<P>
   The city responded by offering the Sonics the stars.
</P>
<P>
   So now the city and the Sonics are dancing a dance that both
sides hope ends with a WNBA expansion team and no toes stepped
upon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the good-faith partnership was tested last week by a
newspaper editorial in which John Dresel, president of Full House
outlined ``an extraordinarily generous offer to the Seattle Center
and the city of Seattle'' by ``taking on the debt service ($7.5
million) and event-management responsibility for the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The city was not amused. Apparently, no one in City Hall or at
Seattle Center had at that time received a copy of this
``extraordinarily generous offer,'' and were offended when Full
House made a public plea for understanding and support on an issue
that had never reached formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dresel said the mayor and city council had
``misunderstood'' Full House's latest proposal for extra KeyArena
dates. Dresel said Full House has abandoned any notion of obtaining
sweeping control of KeyArena and instead is seeking the ability to
``cross-promote WNBA dates using open dates'' that would give the
city added revenue, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (enhanced management of KeyArena) was an old deal. What
we are looking for is a win/win solution and getting on with the
business of getting a WNBA team here,'' Dresel said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the public posturing by Full House as late as last week
did leave city officials wondering what exactly the Sonics want in
their KeyArena arrangements _ and how far they will go to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dresel's adamant disclaimer that Full House is no longer
seeking widespread control of KeyArena, a little paranoia on the
city's part is justified.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of big business sports, things like this happen
when governments partner up with sports teams. The local
authorities want control and taxpayer protection. The teams,
however _ which often control volatile emotional strings of their
sports-loving public _ often get the upper hand, since at any time
they can make threats, including packing up and moving.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Mariners have a new stadium that they will run.
It is why billionaire Paul Allen has a new football stadium ordered
for his Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to think negotiations for a WNBA team
between Full House and the city can be done without a hitch. But
don't think for a minute these sweetheart deals for the M's and
Hawks _ completed after the Sonics signed their KeyArena deal with
the city five years ago _ did not make the Sonics guess this might
be the right time to go back to the well. It doesn't hurt that they
could use as collateral for concessions such a welcome thing as a
women's basketball team.

SABRES BEAT BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bruins are in this morning. They will downplay
it, talk about how it was only Game 3, that there is lots of time
left in this series that there are many chances, that they are only
down by one game. The fact is, it's very likely the Bruins will
look back on Wednesday night, a 3-2 defeat at Marine Midland Arena,
as the turning point in this Eastern Conference semifinal series,
as the one that got away, as, dare we say it, the one that was the
beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Bruins were the better team for 40 minutes.
They employed a nearly perfect (and ultra-boring) game plan. They
suffocated the Sabres. Then, in the third, they allowed the Sabres
to come up for air and not only did they take a breath, they blew
the Bruins away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Boston trails, 2-1, in the best-of-seven series
with Game 4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on us,'' said wing Steve Heinze. ``We can't have third
periods like that and expect to win. It was two different games.
Unfortunately we played three periods and not two because we were
the better team for two periods but they were just way better in
the third. We didn't put them away or have the killer instinct or
the eye of the tiger to put them away. When it slips away like
that, shame on us. You've got to have the killer instinct in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a 2-1 lead heading into the final period but in a
span of less than three minutes, the Sabres closed the gap and took
the lead for good. Right wing Dixon Ward tallied the winner at 9:38
of the third. Center Michael Peca dished a pass to Vaclav Varada,
who centered the puck out in the slot for Ward. Ward one-timed it
past goalie Byron Dafoe and the Bruins couldn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came out with a strong game plan, though it nearly
derailed before it got started. Just 10 seconds into the game, Ray
Bourque was whistled off for hooking, giving the Sabres a power
play that defenseman Jason Woolley converted at 1:37. The Sabres
were up, 1-0, and no one had even worked up a sweat for the Bruins
except coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a hiccup, though, because the Bruins came
charging back on the power play. With Wayne Primeau serving a
holding-the-stick call against Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek, center
Joe Thornton dished a pass from below the right circle through the
crease. It caromed off Anson Carter and went right onto the stick
of Heinze, who banged in a quick shot at 8:47 for his third goal of
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' second goal came as a result of a fortuitous
long-range slapper by defenseman Dave Ellett that went off the left
knee of Hasek, momentarily stunning the goalie. Hasek went right
down to the ice and couldn't move. The Sabres tried to clear the
puck but Thornton corralled it and flung it down to Carter, who was
heading for the net. Carter tapped it into the empty net at 12:48.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was all Boston as the Bruins managed the most
boring, but convincing 20 minutes of defensive hockey they've
played in the series. They trapped, they clogged the neutral zone,
they kept the Buffalo forwards to the perimeter. They managed to
hold the Sabres to a measly four shots in the period and seven
through the first 40 minutes while generating 14 themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wheels fell off. The momentum shifted dramatically in
the third, with the Sabres leaving the Bruins in the dust. At the
7:35 mark, Buffalo had more shots (10) than it had in the first two
periods combined and Boston had none. The Bruins' first shot on net
in the period came from Don Sweeney at 7:57.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start working until the third period,'' said Buffalo
coach Lindy Ruff. ``They played a pretty smart game in the first
two periods and our lack of hustle allowed them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rhett Warrener tied the game, 2-2, at 6:44 when he
swatted in his own rebound from the right circle. The Sabres gained
enormous energy from the score and kept coming like a tidal wave.
When Ward scored it was lights out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't finish,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hope this game won't be the one that finishes them.

FISHING LINE OFTEN OVERLOOKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY BRIGHTENBURG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Fresh line.
</P>
<P>
   It's the simplest and least expensive measure to improve the
odds of boating fish, yet it is the most overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Between the terminal tackle, the ticket for the charter and the
hamburgers and drinks on board, anglers can easily spend $150 on an
albacore trip; it always amazes me that the one thing neglected is
the line.
</P>
<P>
   You never want to defend the loss of a fish of a lifetime by
stating, ``The line (begin ital)looked(end ital) OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Line deteriorates with heat and sunlight, and bad line is going
to snap faster. Prevent the loss of its strength by storing reels
in dark, cool, dry places.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after use _ depending on how much action, the amount
of tangles it has seen and how long it's been in the sun and water
_ line must be changed. But how can you tell when?
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, when in doubt, change it out. Depending on
the brand, expect to pay $8 to $12 to fill an average reel. A spool
of line is a lot cheaper than losing a trophy fish.
</P>
<P>
   There are many colors of line on the market; think like a fish
to make the best selection. When the fish will be looking up at a
line _ fly-lining or other topwater applications _ use clear or
blue line that blends with the sky; when fishing in a vertical
manner _ with sinkers or on the bottom _ fill reels with green or
``smoke'' line that mixes with the darker-colored brine.
</P>
<P>
   As for line strength, inquire with the landing or a tackle store
for a recommendation to match the test of the line to the target
species.
</P>
<P>
   I change my line every other trip for small-diameter bass-style
baitcaster reels. If it is stored well and used less often, heavier
line can last longer. But even if it is well preserved, another
downside of keeping line on a reel over time is that it carries a
memory. That is, when cast the line tends to remain in coils, is
easier to snarl and acts like a big spring in the water, minimizing
the angler's feel for the bait.
</P>
<P>
   One way to alleviate a memory problem is to let out 75 to 150
feet of line _ only the line, no terminal tackle _ behind a moving
boat. It will straighten out. Then wind it tightly back on the reel
and you're ready to cast. During this maneuver, check for nicks and
abrasions in the line that might need to be cut out. Carry filler
spools of line and ask a deckhand to help tie on new line if you
are unsure of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A last line on line: Dispose of it responsibly. Don't dump coils
of line in the water; it will act as a gillnet, catching and
killing fish, birds and mammals for years to come. Use a trash can;
that's what it's there for. &QL;

YOUNG BRUINS HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Kevin Paul Dupont  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Young teams have nights like these, growing pains, and
there was pain aplenty for the Bruins to wallow in Wednesday night
after they watched their 2-1 lead disappear into the western New
York night.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes from taking a 2-1 series lead over the Sabres,
the Bruins spent too much time standing around, looking around,
looking like out-of-place teenagers in the executive board room.
Suddenly, everyone was wearing pinstripes and wingtips, and they
were still in highcut sneakers and cutoff jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried, we were still in the game,'' said Boston defenseman
Kyle McLaren, reflecting on Rhett Warrener's goal that pulled the
Sabres into a 2-2 tie with 13:16 to play. ``We wanted to get back
on track, but it never happened. I think we hung our head too
low.''
</P>
<P>
   One minute they were there, the next minute they were the
hang-down-your-head Tom Dooleys.
</P>
<P>
   It's just what you have to live with when you back an evolving
team, a work in progress. Should the Bruins have won Wednesday
night? Absolutely. The Sabres played somewhere between poorly and
OK for the better part of 40 minutes, and the Bruins came out for
Period 3 hoping to nurse a one-goal lead to the winner's circle _ a
sure ticket to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It took Boston nearly eight minutes to land its first shot on
net in the final period. By then, the Sabres already had Warrener's
tying goal, just one of 10 shots they had on Byron Dafoe before Don
Sweeney landed the first on Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be doing that at this point in the season, but we
did,'' said Dafoe, who once again outplayed the great Hasek,
something he now has done twice in this series. ``We have to
correct that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Bruins did was correct. In Game 2 at the Vault,
the Sabres came storming out of the gate and landed 17 shots on
Dafoe in the first period. The Bruins were pinned in their own end,
unable to get out from under the Sabres' forechecking blanket.
</P>
<P>
   They came into Game 3 needing to be much quicker behind their
own blue line, and they were, not allowing the Sabres to mount any
kind of offensive pressure. Buffalo's one goal came when Dafoe
errantly pushed a puck into the slot, only to see it wash back in
his crease when it deflected off Michal Grosek and Sweeney. Jason
Woolley potted it from a bad angle with only 1:37 gone. An awful
goal. But, the Bruins didn't give up another shot for the rest of
the period. It was symptomatic of the entire night: small mistakes
and huge consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they know more than some of our younger
players,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``I thought Joe Thornton responded
well, after having a so-so game on Sunday. Now, if we could get
everyone to respond like that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was another one of those, shall we say,
maturity issues. Dixon Ward swatted in a one-timer from the top of
the crease to put it away with 10:22 to play. Rarely do you see
someone left so wide open so low, especially in Burns's
defensive-minded scheme. Ward had slipped his coverage, just by
inches, with Landon Wilson just a step out of synch in his
man-to-man coverage. Across came Vaclav Varada's feed and Dafoe had
no chance at blocking the Ward rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost one or two assignments,'' said Burns. ``That Ward goal
was a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fell into a 2-1 deficit in their first-round series
against the Hurricanes and turned it around dramatically by smart,
controlled play, withstanding some intense forechecking. They were
patient, smart, and confident enough with their game and maintained
their poise. They found a way out.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't the same margin for recovery with the Sabres. They
hop on mistakes and bury them (translation: they don't have a
Martin Gelinas to double hit the puck in front of a wide-open net).
Don't be misled. Buffalo isn't quite an NHL powerhouse. But there's
enough here, especially with Hasek in net, for them to play poorly
for two periods and know, if the score remains close, they've got
enough talent and energy to knock off a team that just isn't quite
as mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to be close games,'' said Boston
captain Ray Bourque. ``We knew most likely they'd be one-goal
games. And most of the game, we did the right things. It's just
that it got away from us in the third period. We felt pretty good
about our game, but we sat back a little and we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque called Friday's Game 4 here a ``must win'' for the
Bruins. The accompanying truth to that is they must not lapse into
what has become their young man's twilight zone. They could
eliminate all the prolonged hiccups and still lose. But failing to
eliminate them virtually guarantees defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Under Burns's knowing watch, they have chalked up two dreadful
periods in this series. That's a concern. The coach can see it
playing out in front of him, but he doesn't have the fix.
</P>
<P>
   The cure in this case is experience, knowledge, coming of age.
None of that can be accomplished with a 30-second timeout, some
chest beating and an X-and-O diagram scribbled on the top of the
dasher.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more bodies, more talented bodies, and most of all it
takes time _ the shortest commodity of all.

<P>
   Like fine wine, Pedro Martinez just gets better and better. With
each outing he turns in another vintage performance, somehow
outdoing the previous masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a Seattle Mariners lineup that includes several of the
premier hitters in the game, Martinez put on another dominating
performance in a 9-2 Red Sox victory Wednesday night at Fenway
Park. With much encouragement from a crowd of 28,177, Martinez ran
his record to 7-1, the best mark in baseball, and matched his
career high with 15 strikeouts, which he reached in his previous
outing Friday against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost his no-hit bid on a leadoff double by David Segui
in the fifth, allowing him to concentrate on strikeouts. He had
nine through four innings, and 13 through seven. He picked up two
more to start the eighth, tying his career best.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd knew he didn't have a shot at the major league mark of
20 shared by Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood. But it was pulling for
Martinez to outdo himself. Manager Jimy Williams could have removed
him after a two-out single by Raul Ibanez, but let Martinez, who
had thrown 125 pitches, face Seattle's David Bell, who had homered
earlier. Martinez got Bell to fly out and left to a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear the crowd getting louder and louder with every
batter I faced,'' said Martinez. ``Fortunately, it doesn't get me
any more excited than I normally am. Jimy knew I'd been over 120
pitches in the last four outings. He's concerned and I know that.
He's only trying to protect me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the crowd to get on Jimy if anything happened in
the game. I'd rather take responsibility myself. I knew I could get
the hitter out. I know how I feel and he trusts me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to talk to the man,'' said Williams of his
conference with Martinez. ``He didn't say a word until perhaps at
the end. You've got to stay with the man. To me he was still
pitching good. When he told me `I can go get him,' that's all I
needed to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not trust Martinez? He has 10 or more strikeouts in six
straight outings, a feat matched only by Randy Johnson since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Martinez struck out the side for the 119th
time in his career. He lost his no-hitter on a double by Segui in
the fifth. Bell hit a solo home run in the sixth, the first off
Martinez in 221 batters. Other than that, Seattle was overmatched
as Martinez allowed four hits and one walk over eight innings.
Derek Lowe pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything going tonight,'' said Martinez. ``I had a
good fastball and pretty good command of my breaking ball. I had my
pitches working today and I felt strong. I've had quite a few
stretches like this in my career. I normally go five or six games,
sometimes longer. So far this year I have been healthy and I'm
doing the things I have to do to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had plenty of offensive support, racking up 11 hits.
Nomar Garciaparra led the way with two doubles and two singles and
three RBIs. The four-hit game was the eighth of his career and gave
him 14 runs batted in for the series. Jose Offerman went 3 for 5
with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But the hitters weren't the story Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as dominant as there is in the game,'' Mike Stanley said
of Martinez. ``I haven't seen anybody dominate a game the way he's
doing now. Nobody is coming close.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garciaparra: ``You definitely feel the energy out there.
Pedro is doing his job. That lets us go out and do our job. He's
getting us back into the dugout quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to face him because he is one of the best,'' said
Seattle's Edgar Martinez. ``And the way he's pitching right now he
is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey didn't enjoy his night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got everything going out there,'' he said. ``You just
have to go up there swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams knows his ace isn't done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a human being like everyone else,'' said Williams. ``But
he's a very special athlete. He understands he has a gift and he
knows how to use it.''

   How much longer do we have to endure the folly of NATO's war in
the Balkans? In just 50 days, the Atlantic alliance has failed in
everything it set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   It has failed to protect the Kosovo Albanians from Serbian war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It has failed to cow Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It has failed to force the withdrawal of Serb troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It has broken international law in attacking a sovereign state
without seeking a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   It has killed hundreds of innocent Serb civilians _ in our name,
of course _ while being too cowardly to risk a single NATO life in
defense of the poor and the weak for whom it meretriciously claimed
to be fighting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war cannot even be regarded as a mistake _ it is a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, now part of the mantra of all criticism of
NATO that we must mention Serb wickedness in Kosovo. So here we go.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dreadful, wicked deeds _ atrocities would not be a strong
enough word for it _ have gone on in Kosovo: mass executions, rape,
dispossession, ``ethnic cleansing,'' the murder of intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of NATO's propaganda program has done more to cover up such
villainy than disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as we all know, the dozens of Kosovo Albanians massacred on
the road to Prizren were slaughtered by NATO _ not by the Serbs as
NATO originally claimed. But I have seen with my own eyes _
travelling under the NATO bombardment _ the house-burning in Kosovo
and the hundreds of Albanians awaiting dispossession in their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the subject _ and perhaps my first question should
be put a little more boldly. Not: ``How much longer do we have to
endure this stupid, hopeless, cowardly war?'' but rather: ``How
much longer do we have to endure NATO?
</P>
<P>
   ``How soon can this vicious American-run organization be
deconstructed and politically `degraded,' its pontificating
generals put back in their boxes with their mortuary language of
`in-theatre assets' and `collateral damage?'''
</P>
<P>

leaders realize that they are not fighting a replay of the Second
World War nor striking a blow for a new value-rich millennium? &QL;

<P>
   In Middle East wars, I've always known when a side was losing _
it came when its leaders started to complain that journalists were
not being fair to their titanic struggle for
freedom/democracy/human rights/sovereignty/soul.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair started the
whining.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 days of television coverage soaked in NATO propaganda,
after weeks of NATO officials being questioned by sheep-like
journalists, Blair announces the press is ignoring the plight of
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this is a lie is not important. It is the nature
of the lie. Anyone, it seems, who doesn't subscribe to Europe's
denunciations of Fascism or who raises an eyebrow when _ in an act
of utter folly _ the prime minister makes unguaranteed promises
that the Kosovo Albanians will all go home, is now off-side,
biased.
</P>
<P>
   Or worthy of one of Downing Street's preposterous ``health
warnings'' because they allegedly spend more time weeping for dead
Serbs than the numerically greater number of dead Albanians (the
assumption also being, of course, that it is less physically
painful to be torn apart by a NATO cluster bomb than by a Serb
rocket-propelled grenade). &QL;

<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton _ who will in due course pull the
rug from under Blair _ tells the Kosovo Albanians that they have
the ``right to return.'' Not the Palestinian refugees of Lebanon,
of course. They do not have such a right.
</P>
<P>
   Nor the Kurds dispossessed by our NATO ally, Turkey. Nor the
Armenians driven from their land by the Turks in the world's first
holocaust (there being only one holocaust which Clinton and Blair
are interested in invoking just now). &QL;

<P>
   Blair's childish response to this argument is important. Just
because wrongs have been done in the past doesn't mean we have to
stand idly by now. But the terrible corollary of this dangerous
argument is this: that the Palestinians, the Armenians, the
Rwandans or anyone else cannot expect our compassion. They are
``the past.'' They are finished. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what is all this nonsense about NATO standing for democracy?
It happily allowed Greece to remain a member when its ruthless
colonels staged a coup d'etat which imprisoned and murdered
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had no objection to the oppression of Salazar and Caetano _
who were at the same time busy annihilating ``liberation''
movements almost identical to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only time when NATO proposed to suspend Portugal's
membership _ I was there at the time and remember this vividly _
was when the country staged a revolution and declared itself a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Is it therefore so surprising that NATO now turns out to be so
brutal? It attacks television stations and kills Serb journalists _
part of Milosevic's propaganda machine, a ``legitimate target,''
shrieks Britain's Clare Short.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Chinese embassy? Did the CIA really use an
old map? Or did the CIA believe that because Mira Markovic (the
wife of the Yugoslav president) had such close relations with the
Chinese government that both she and President Slobodan Milosevic
might be sleeping in the Chinese embassy?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, had already targeted the Milosevic residence in
an attempt to assassinate him. It had already _ according to one
disturbing report _ tried to lure the Serb minister of information
to the Serb television headquarters just before it was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   So why not the Chinese embassy? Would NATO do anything so
desperate? Well, NATO is desperate. It is losing the war, it is
destroying itself. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for General Wesley Clark, the man who thought he could change
history by winning a war without ground troops, we have only to
recall his infantile statement of last month about President
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are winning and he is losing _ and he knows it,'' General
Clark told us.
</P>
<P>
   He did not explain why Milosevic would need to be told such a
thing if he knew it. Nor did he recall that he had once accepted
from General Ratko Mladic _ the Bosnian Serb military leader whose
men were destroying the Muslims of Sarajevo _ a gift of an engraved
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, of course, did General Clark remind us that General Mladic
and his colleague Radovan Karadjic remain free in Bosnia _ which is
under the firm control of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are we going to be given the good news which this war
portends for General Clark's most loyal allies, the arms
manufacturers of our proud democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hit a 52-week high last week with stock trading at just
under $44 a share. British Aerospace share prices have gained a 43
percent increase since NATO's bombardment commenced.
</P>
<P>
   The British government said on Tuesday that ``military
operations'' were costing $60 million ``excluding munitions.'' Now
why, I wonder, did this figure exclude munitions? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me wonder, too, if this disastrous war isn't
going to be the end of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   I hope so. As a citizen of a new, modern Europe, I don't want my
continent led by the third-rate generals and two-bit
under-secretaries who have been ranting on our television screens
for the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want Europe to be ``protected'' any longer by the U.S.
If that means the end of the Atlantic alliance, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Because an Atlantic alliance that has brought us to this
catastrophe should be wound up. Until it is, Europe will never _
ever _ take responsibility for itself or for the dictators who
threaten our society.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Europe will never lay its own lives on the line for
its own people _ which is what the Kosovo Albanians need.
</P>
<P>
   Until NATO is dead, there will never be a real European defense
force. And until NATO is dead, there will be no need to seek the
international mandate from the United Nations which ``humanitarian
action'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. is the only institution the poor and the
sick and the raped and the dispossessed can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops are not going to die for Kosovo. So what is the
point of NATO? &QL;

   NATO had no objection to the oppression of Salazar and Caetano _
who were at the same time busy annihilating ``liberation''
movements almost identical to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only time when NATO proposed to suspend Portugal's
membership _ I was there at the time and remember this vividly _
was when the country staged a revolution and declared itself a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Is it therefore so surprising that NATO now turns out to be so
brutal? It attacks television stations and kills Serb journalists _
part of Milosevic's propaganda machine, a ``legitimate target,''
shrieks Britain's Clare Short.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Chinese embassy? Did the CIA really use an
old map? Or did the CIA believe that because Mira Markovic (the
wife of the Yugoslav president) had such close relations with the
Chinese government that both she and President Slobodan Milosevic
might be sleeping in the Chinese embassy?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, had already targeted the Milosevic residence in
an attempt to assassinate him. It had already _ according to one
disturbing report _ tried to lure the Serb minister of information
to the Serb television headquarters just before it was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   So why not the Chinese embassy? Would NATO do anything so
desperate? Well, NATO is desperate. It is losing the war, it is
destroying itself. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As for General Wesley Clark, the man who thought he could change
history by winning a war without ground troops, we have only to
recall his infantile statement of last month about President
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are winning and he is losing _ and he knows it,'' General
Clark told us.
</P>
<P>
   He did not explain why Milosevic would need to be told such a
thing if he knew it. Nor did he recall that he had once accepted
from General Ratko Mladic _ the Bosnian Serb military leader whose
men were destroying the Muslims of Sarajevo _ a gift of an engraved
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, of course, did General Clark remind us that General Mladic
and his colleague Radovan Karadjic remain free in Bosnia _ which is
under the firm control of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are we going to be given the good news which this war
portends for General Clark's most loyal allies, the arms
manufacturers of our proud democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hit a 52-week high last week with stock trading at just
under $44 a share. British Aerospace share prices have gained a 43
percent increase since NATO's bombardment commenced.
</P>
<P>
   The British government said on Tuesday that ``military
operations'' were costing $60 million ``excluding munitions.'' Now
why, I wonder, did this figure exclude munitions? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me wonder, too, if this disastrous war isn't
going to be the end of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   I hope so. As a citizen of a new, modern Europe, I don't want my
continent led by the third-rate generals and two-bit
under-secretaries who have been ranting on our television screens
for the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want Europe to be ``protected'' any longer by the U.S.
If that means the end of the Atlantic alliance, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Because an Atlantic alliance that has brought us to this
catastrophe should be wound up. Until it is, Europe will never _
ever _ take responsibility for itself or for the dictators who
threaten our society.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Europe will never lay its own lives on the line for
its own people _ which is what the Kosovo Albanians need.
</P>
<P>
   Until NATO is dead, there will never be a real European defense
force. And until NATO is dead, there will be no need to seek the
international mandate from the United Nations which ``humanitarian
action'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. is the only institution the poor and the
sick and the raped and the dispossessed can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops are not going to die for Kosovo. So what is the
point of NATO? &QL;

HUNDLEY'S HOMER SPARKS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before the series began with the Chicago Cubs, the
Dodgers held a players-only meeting in which the message was to
watch each other's back.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi had everyone's back for most of the season. Todd
Hundley had Mondesi's back Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Mondesi struck out in a crucial eighth-inning at-bat,
Hundley led off the ninth with a homer to tie the score.
Pinch-runner Tripp Cromer then scored on Rod Beck's wild pitch with
one out as the Dodgers rallied to stun the Cubs 3-2 in front of
40,007 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of jolt the Dodgers needed heading into today's
day off and into their three-game series in St. Louis. Instead of
limping in after another abysmal homestand, the Dodgers have
momentum and have won their fourth series in five attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it had to do with Hundley's swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the key guys in this lineup, we need his power,''
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said of Hundley. ``Hopefully,
he can get in a rhythm, and so can some other guys, including
myself, and we can get something going.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time it appears the Dodgers have the makings of a streak,
something goes awry. Their eighth comeback win of the season was
also the first time since April 6 the Dodgers won a game in their
final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   About the only one who hasn't gone through a dry spell is
Mondesi. In the first two games of the series he hit four homers,
and the pieces were in place in the eighth for another momentous
occasion. However, with two runners on, one run already in and the
Cubs leading 2-1, Cubs reliever Scott Sanders struck out Mondesi to
preserve the lead, albeit momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   It was also another infamous undoing of Beck, the Cubs closer.
He's blown four of 11 save chances and dropped to 2-4. Dodgers
right-hander Jamie Arnold (2-0) pitched one scoreless inning of
relief for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to protect a 2-1 lead for starter Kevin Tapani, who
pitched 72/3 innings, Beck's fourth pitch was a fastball Hundley
hit into the right-field seats to tie the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for my teammates, most for the guys in here, to
prove to them that I can hit and contribute offensively,'' Hundley
said. ``Mondesi's been carrying us basically all year. It's nice to
sneak on them (the Cubs). That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros followed Hundley's homer with a double down the
left-field line. Cromer pinch-ran, Beck intentionally walked Todd
Hollandsworth and Adrian Beltre moved the runners over a base with
a bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Beck was ahead of pinch-hitter Mark Grudzielanek 1-2, which
meant little when catcher Sandy Martinez couldn't handle a pitch
low and far outside. It allowed Cromer to score and give the
Dodgers the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a (very poor) fastball (to Hundley),'' said Beck, a
Grant High product. ``Right now I (really) suck. I'm angry and I'm
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's ninth-inning homer was a long-overdue moment for the
switch-hitting catcher who finally has his timing at the plate
after missing spring training and hitting a miserable .158 with two
homers and four RBI in April. This month Hundley is hitting .378
(14 for 37) with three homers and eight RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's maybe not doing the things you want to see him do (all
the time), but he's my guy,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``I feel real good for him. He wants it, and he'll get it. It's
going to be fun going to war with him this season.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``So...'' growled Boris Yeltsin and the pause seemed to
last for an eternity before he continued: ``You are not sitting in
the right seats. Stepashin is the First Deputy. Sergei
Vladimirovich, move up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ginger-haired and, by all accounts, modest Sergei V.
Stepashin, appointed days earlier as First Deputy Prime Minister,
blushed so deeply that his ears and neck went red and changed seats
with a lesser official at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
   On the instructions of Yeltsin's press secretary, Russian
television has cut scenes of the president rambling incoherently.
But it did show this game of musical chairs that the Kremlin leader
unexpectedly played last week in the middle of a planning meeting
supposed to be devoted to celebrations for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians took it as further evidence that their
unpredictable president was going senile. Experienced Kremlin
watchers saw it as a sign that Stepashin, who has had an up and
down career, was about to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed Wednesday Yeltsin appointed him acting prime minister
in place of the ousted Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, 47, has been dubbed by the Russian media ``the
rosy-cheeked hawk.'' Before his promotion Wednesday, he combined
the job of first deputy prime minister with that of interior
minister, which put him in charge of thousands of internal troops
and over a million police.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Yeltsin had that in mind when he sacked Primakov, a
move he knew must enrage the communists and nationalists in the
State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the appointment of Stepashin is little short of a
Kremlin coup.
</P>
<P>
   If political passions boil over and the confrontation between
president and parliament becomes physical, as it did in October
1993, Yeltsin now has not only a loyal prime minister but also a
man who can command the tank drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, born to a military family on a then-Soviet base in
China, began his career as a ``politrabotnik'' (political
activist), the Communist equivalent of a chaplain in the army.
</P>
<P>
   He also lectured at a military academy and wrote a doctorate on
``Party leadership in Leningrad's fire brigades during World War
II.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms gave him a better
opportunity to use his qualification as a lawyer and he became a
parliamentary deputy, known for his liberal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, six months after the failure of the parliamentary
uprising against him, Yeltsin appointed Stepashin to head the FSB,
the successor to the KGB secret police. Here he gained a reputation
for being calm.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his cool, however, during the ill-fated war against
Chechnya, which Yeltsin was later to regret as his greatest
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by hostage-takers, who kidnapped Russian civilians in
the town of Budyonnovsk, Stepashin applied too much force, which
only increased the number of casualties, and had to resign in
disgrace in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin brought him back from the political wilderness in 1997,
giving him the Justice Ministry, where one of his main tasks was to
improve conditions in Russia's notoriously overcrowded and
disease-ridden jails.
</P>
<P>
   He became interior minister last March after Yeltsin sacked
Viktor Chernomyrdin's entire cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yeltsin, who Wednesday criticized Primakov for allowing
stabilizing policies to turn into stagnation, is hoping that his
protege will revitalize Russian economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   At a cabinet meeting where Primakov said goodbye to his team,
Stepashin was blushing again as he said he had ``honestly'' not
known that he was about to he promoted over his boss's head.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov said that he wished him well. The awkward body language
gave away what the two politicians were really thinking. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Woe betide he who is perceived to threaten an ailing, wrathful
czar. Thus may be explained the fate of Yevgeny Primakov, the
latest victim of this age-old law of Russian governance.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin resented Primakov because his prime
minister was infinitely more popular and, thanks to his support in
the Duma, in some respects more powerful than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he had permitted investigations into alleged corruption
to go ahead against members of the president's family and inner
circle. In earlier times, Primakov might have faced a show trial;
instead he has merely been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative modesty of the punishment should not hide the
disturbing implications of what has happened; both for Russia's
internal political stability and for the management of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight months in office, Primakov did little to tackle his
country's appalling economic difficulties. But inertia brought a
stability of sorts that has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The one Russian politician who might have persuaded the
parliament to vote for the tough reforms demanded by the
International Monetary Fund, essential if the country is to put its
financial house in order, has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, the largest single party in the Duma, are up in
arms, and could well prevent confirmation of Sergei Stepashin,
Yeltsin's young protege, who has been named to succeed Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh elections may be unavoidable, there are even mutterings of
a coup in the offing. At the very least, the stalled impeachment
proceedings against Yeltsin will gain fresh momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's erratic behavior could destroy hopes of
Russia playing a role in ending the Balkans war.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's threat to withdraw from the diplomatic process because
NATO has ignored Russia's demand for a halt to its bombing suggests
he is seeking to assuage his nationalist critics, led by the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   If he is obliged to carry out the threat, and thus dash
prospects of an agreed U.N. resolution, the Kosovo crisis would
enter a more perilous phase.
</P>
<P>
   By sacking Primakov, Russia's modern czar has done both his
country and the international community a grave disservice. &QL;

<P>
   Woe betide he who is perceived to threaten an ailing, wrathful
czar. Thus may be explained the fate of Yevgeny Primakov, the
latest victim of this age-old law of Russian governance.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin resented Primakov because his prime
minister was infinitely more popular and, thanks to his support in
the Duma, in some respects more powerful than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he had permitted investigations into alleged corruption
to go ahead against members of the president's family and inner
circle. In earlier times, Primakov might have faced a show trial;
instead he has merely been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative modesty of the punishment should not hide the
disturbing implications of what has happened; both for Russia's
internal political stability and for the management of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight months in office, Primakov did little to tackle his
country's appalling economic difficulties. But inertia brought a
stability of sorts that has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The one Russian politician who might have persuaded the
parliament to vote for the tough reforms demanded by the
International Monetary Fund, essential if the country is to put its
financial house in order, has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, the largest single party in the Duma, are up in
arms, and could well prevent confirmation of Sergei Stepashin,
Yeltsin's young protege, who has been named to succeed Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh elections may be unavoidable, there are even mutterings of
a coup in the offing. At the very least, the stalled impeachment
proceedings against Yeltsin will gain fresh momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's erratic behavior could destroy hopes of
Russia playing a role in ending the Balkans war.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's threat to withdraw from the diplomatic process because
NATO has ignored Russia's demand for a halt to its bombing suggests
he is seeking to assuage his nationalist critics, led by the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   If he is obliged to carry out the threat, and thus dash
prospects of an agreed U.N. resolution, the Kosovo crisis would
enter a more perilous phase.
</P>
<P>
   By sacking Primakov, Russia's modern czar has done both his
country and the international community a grave disservice. &QL;

 SAN FRANCISCO LIBRARY DOES ABOUT-FACE ON `READING WIZARD' BOY  &HT;     By YUMI WILSON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An 11-year-old boy who wanted to dress up as the
Reading Wizard and introduce preschoolers to the joy of books at
his local San Francisco library soon will get his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown ordered library officials Wednesday to end a
``bureaucratic runaround'' and told them to ``immediately implement
a program'' in which John O'Connor can dress up, in a jester's hat
and black cape, and read to preschoolers at the Presidio library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not turn them
off,'' said Brown, who took action on an official trip to
Washington, D.C., after learning in The Chronicle that library
bosses had brushed off John's idea. ``We should be rewarding young
people with creative ideas, not discouraging them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mayor has invited John to give his first reading at
City Hall for children from the nearby Tenderloin neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome all entrepreneurial volunteers in our city,
regardless of their age,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's cause was taken up by schools, community groups and
the media across the country Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the article in the paper, and I just thought the kid
was unique,'' said Steve Ridgeway, segment producer for the
``Tonight Show,'' who called a reporter in hopes of reaching
O'Connor. ``It's not every day when you find an 11-year-old doing
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, staffers at the San Bernardino Sun
newspaper started a collection drive so they could buy books for
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, an ambitious and articulate sixth-grader at St.
Vincent de Paul School, said he was happy that his dream is coming
true. He was, however, a little surprised by the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this kind of attention,'' he said. ``It got on
the front page, and then this happened. It's just shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Michael O'Connor, applauded the city for helping his
son fulfill a dream to help others through reading. The elder
O'Connor gave special thanks to Supervisor Gavin Newsom and his
aide Michael Farrah, who agreed to help John make his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate the courtesy and respect that they've
shown my son,'' O'Connor said. ``They treated him like an
intelligent person, which he is. I think it's a great introduction
to the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   John came up with the idea to be a Reading Wizard two months ago
while talking to his mother, Shannon Bracht, about how he could
perform community service. Introducing kids to reading, he figured,
beat having them watching TV or playing video games all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But a staffer at the library told him, ``We don't do that kind
of thing.'' Other appeals were similarly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he contacted Newsom's office, then wrote a
letter to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials had planned to send letters to John to explain
that trained staffers were given the task of reading to
preschoolers and preparing ``an entire program for the event.''
</P>
<P>
   But before they could get the missives in the mail, the mayor
was preparing his press release.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was ``appalled that this has been going on for two months
and, a) it has not been brought to a resolution, or, b) to his
attention,'' said his spokeswoman, Kandace Bender.
</P>
<P>
   City Librarian Regina Minudri said Wednesday that the library
would, indeed, launch a program to give O'Connor and other youths
an opportunity to read to preschoolers. It will be called ``Kids
Read to Kids at the Library'' and become part of the summer reading
program for youths 10 to 16. Librarians will train John and others.
</P>
<P>
   At the steps outside Presidio library Wednesday, Minudri
explained that she never got a copy of John's letter until reading
about it in the paper. She also apologized to John if he ``felt he
was rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   But she stood by Sadako Kashiwagi, the children's librarian at
Presidio, who ``did what she was supposed to do when she declined
John's offer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a librarian who has been with the San Francisco
library for 10 years and has never received a complaint from the
public,'` Minudri said. ``In fact, she hosts a very popular
children's reading hour at the Presidio branch.''
</P>
<P>
   With that said, however, Minudri said it was time to take
O'Connor's idea to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good ideas often come from unexpected places, and we want to
thank John for his great idea to start a reading program for
children by children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John may be reading at a lot more places besides the library.
Since the story broke, he has gotten offers from local schools, the
Boys and Girls Club, Internet companies and others _ all asking him
to come read to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers just called to applaud John for standing up to
what they view as bad rules and too much bureaucracy, which they
say makes it tough for anyone to volunteer for good causes.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said one caller had invoked the recent high school
killings in Colorado as a reason to look favorably upon ideas like
John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is better than a cure,'' the caller told Newsom.
``Things like this are a solution to Littleton-type massacres.''

<P>
   There is a game that you can play in bars across America now,
after a few beers, and it takes a few beers for it to make much
sense. The game goes like this: who was the best, John Elway,
Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
   It is not a very smart game, and the conclusion usually depends
(unsurprisingly) on whether you are an American football,
basketball or hockey fan.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty obvious, actually, but we'll let that pass
for the moment. The point is that a nation has just lost three of
its sporting heroes, all of them preeminent in ways that few
individuals could ever dream of in their chosen careers, within the
space of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where heroes get built up very big, the sports
media have chewed over little else.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to go was John Elway, 38, the quarterback for the
Denver Broncos and one of the greatest players of the decade. Elway
won more games than any other quarterback in history, and his
clean-cut looks made him a favorite for those who didn't follow the
Broncos, or even football.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way Wayne Gretzky, late of the New York Rangers, was
an icon for the game, the best possible advertisement. And Michael
Jordan made the Chicago Bulls not just the leading team in the NBA
but one of the greatest sporting formations of any kind, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of these three greats has, of course, spurred
interest in the next faces on the scene: not just in the sports
bars of middle America, but in the boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For these are the figures who will keep sport booming, keep the
value of franchises accelerating by 20 percent a year and make sure
there are names to sell everything from phone cards to chewing
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it takes decades to build the kind of skills, loyalty
and character that these three could summon, it is in some ways
pernicious to pick names early, but that hasn't stopped anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to start speculating is football. Following in
Elway's footsteps, probably the greatest quarterback in the game
today is Troy Aikman, 33, of the Dallas Cowboys. But amongst the
younger generation, the brightest star is 29-year old Brett Favre
of the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first player in NFL history to win three consecutive
Most Valuable Player awards and his 110 touchdowns over the last
three years leads all NFL quarterbacks. He may be a little cocky,
but he's good and he has years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three sports, the one that most badly needs to build up
new stars is basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's retirement broke up the Bulls, that was bad
enough; and few have shone for the last year in a game that is
slightly tarnished in the fans' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The player's strike helped rip a lot of the guts out of the
season, and it is hard to pick any single individual as the obvious
heir to ``the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the media has tried to push Grant Hill of the
Detroit Pistons, but it doesn't quite work. Kobe Bryant of the Los
Angeles Lakers has a big following, but has had a run of weak
games. Tim Duncan, 23, of the San Antonio Spurs is worth keeping an
eye on.
</P>
<P>
   But none is Jordan, which is hardly surprising: they are
younger, less experienced and far, far less rich.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL decided (apparently collectively) that Gretzky's torch
has been passed on to Jaromir Jagr, the Pittsburgh Penguins'
27-year-old right wing from the Czech Republic, against whom
Gretzky played his last game.
</P>
<P>
   He is a perfect skater with the most intricately developed sense
of gravity and balance, his long hair flying out from under his
helmet. He was the NHL's leading scorer in 1998, though a
persistent groin injury has laid him low again this season.
</P>
<P>
   But is he a Wayne Gretzky? Because in the end, he has to be the
greatest of the three retirees in purely sporting terms.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was a remarkable player, one of the greatest but not the
greatest by a long chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, Joe Montana of the San
Francisco 49ers or Joe Namath of the New York Jets all get higher
billing from the critics. Indeed, Elway was once best known for his
inability to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has a very plausible case to make for his place in
sporting history with his six NBA championships, 10 scoring titles
and five MVP awards. But still there are plenty of others to claim
the title of the best hoops player ever _ take your pick from Wilt
Chamberlain, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He will be hard to follow, but there will be another Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be another Gretzky _ ever. He loomed over his
sport in a way that neither of the others can claim. He is the
NHL's all-time leader with 2,857 points, 894 goals and 1,963
assists with four teams. When he scored his 1,072nd goal in March,
he beat Gordie Howe's record to become the all-time leading
goal-scorer.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his trade from Edmonton to Los Angeles in 1988 that
helped open up hockey for audiences who had previously preferred to
spend their winter evenings elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that anyone will emerge who is close to Gretzky:
alone of the three, he was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He
gained (as was his due) instant access to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the three is the likeliest to still be remembered in a
decade's time outside their own sport?
</P>
<P>
   Not Gretzky, whatever his achievements. Jordan is still racking
up millions in endorsements and ad campaigns, part of a
mini-economy that is worth billions. And it might be worth
remembering that one of the American presidential candidates this
year, Bill Bradley, started out life with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has dropped $1,000 Bradley's way as a campaign donation,
a sign that his ambitions may stretch a little further than his own
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jordan sounds fine; President Jordan might just sound
even better. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin Wednesday tried hard to persuade the
world that the reason he fired his prime minister and the cabinet
was because they failed to do enough for Russia's emaciated
economy.
</P>

   But his true motives for plunging the country into fresh
political chaos, and picking a perilous fight with parliament, have
more to do with pique, personal rivalry and the erratic whims of an
autocratic and unwell president...

   Yeltsin has _ yet again _ dropped a bombshell.

   Tony Blair's recent self-justifying speeches, delivered with
laryngitic, manic jerkiness, persuade me that war is almost always
an act of madness.

   And the rhetoric that he uses, with its pseudo-Churchillian
echoes and its allusions to the Second World War, provoke
disturbing, unwelcome thoughts _ not merely about the current
conflict in Kosovo, but about the whole of 20th-century history,
and the brave sorrows which our parents' generation underwent... &LR;  &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: That burning issue again
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like one of those ever-reviving creatures in a cheap monster
movie, the push to whittle down the free-speech guarantee in the
Bill of Rights is back among us. Did you ever notice how much
harder it is to kill a damn fool idea than a good one?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has voted 11-7 to approve a
constitutional amendment that would create the first-ever exception
to the First Amendment so that show-offs who burn American flags
could be prosecuted as criminals.
</P>
<P>
   This cheap political hustle remains, as in its earlier outings,
not just a solution in search of a problem but a solution that
would provoke the very problem it pretends to oppose. Flag-burnings
are rare and little-noticed when they do occur, but criminalize
them and you raise their value. Every two-bit cause monger would be
assured a courtroom forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington handicapping on this latest effort is all over
the tote board. House approval is a given. The Senate is, as they
say, too close to call. Many Congress watchers figure this year's
push has a good shot at the necessary two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Others figure legislation Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has
introduced will provide political cover for a crucial two or three
senators to hide in by way of ducking the amendment. His bills
would punish the burning or desecration of a flag to incite riot
and the destruction of a flag stolen from the U.S. government or
removed from federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court routinely discards attempts to dodge its
ruling that flag-burning is constitutionally protected speech and
the court is unlikely to be worn down by this one. Even so, a vote
for McConnell's legislation would be a talisman against the tawdry
political trick of charging that members who oppose chipping at the
First Amendment are thus supporting flag-burning and maybe even
hoping for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, flag-burning is a noxious act, but it is precisely because
the act is so heinous to most that it also carries such big
political magic. And because it carries that mojo, it is exactly
the sort of powerful political speech, however symbolic, that the
justices have consistently judged must be constitutionally
sheltered. No protection is required for unexceptionable utterance.
</P>
<P>
   If one theatrically unpatriotic act can be constitutionally
anathematized, the push will be on to banish others, for the same
petty political advantage that can be wrought of defaming
principled opponents as unpatriotic. That way lies, at the far end,
a sort of democratic lese-majeste that could punish indignities to
elected officials as totems of the nation. No more heckling
presidents or members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment has served us brilliantly. The odd
flag-burnings that occur under its indulgence inevitably, by their
excess, discredit the very point they are intended to make.
Flag-burning is its own worst enemy, overwhelmed by the contrary
free speech it energizes.
</P>
<P>
   How foolish, if we begin to erode our actual freedoms in order
to sanctify their symbols.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE McCAIN FACTOR
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 16.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On this fine spring day, early in the presidential
culling process, John McCain's campaign travels had left him bone
tired. A quiet-spoken and fiercely disciplined man, McCain has
never fully regained his strength, which was sapped when he spent
five years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, politics consumes much of McCain's life. His quest for
the White House usually puts him on the road for all but the three
days in midweek that the Senate meets.
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps him apart for long periods from his second wife,
Cindy, whom he married in 1980 and who lives in the same gated
Phoenix house where she grew up. It was Cindy who brought Bridget,
at 7 the youngest of their four children, home from Mother Teresa's
orphanage in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was down in Atlanta this weekend, giving a speech, some
guy asked me how does my position on Kosovo effect my presidential
chances?'' McCain recalled as we sat in his sunlit Senate office.
``I told him, I don't know and I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain's long-odds presidential quest prevail, it will be
neither as a result of his ordeal in Hanoi, nor his impressive
intellect, but because a consensus emerges that it's time to put a
truth-teller in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows that his reply to the Kosovo question in Atlanta is
the practice of politics at its best. And he knows that his
reputation as a maverick, while politically useful, is false. On
issues that count, he's in sync with most Republican primary
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is now the one challenging George Bush for the
nomination,'' Mary Anne March, a political consultant in New
Hampshire, told a CNN reporter the other day. ``The more people
know about him, the more they like him. John McCain could pull an
upset in New Hampshire, and if he does that, then all bets are
off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like George Bush,'' McCain told me. While McCain clearly
wants to be president, it's also clear that he would have no
regrets if the young Texas governor, whom he views as his only real
rival for the nomination, beats him.
</P>
<P>
   Being president ``would put my family through an ordeal,''
McCain said. ``Anyway, one way or another, we'll know 10 months
from now how it turns out. And, whatever happens, I'll still have a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain respects Bush and his advisers. He doesn't respect
Clinton and his advisers. As he puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war,
rather than do the hard work, the politically risky work of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on Earth should
fight when our interests and our values are imperiled. Shame on the
president if he persists in abdicating his responsibilities, but
shame on us if we let him.''
</P>
<P>
   I suggested to McCain that electoral appeal of Bush the Younger
might be a dynastic one _ much as the English in 1660 embraced
Charles II, whose father had been beheaded by the Puritans and who,
after years in exile, was restored to the British throne on his
30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he agreed. ``And I suspect that some Republicans feel
quite ashamed these days for having abandoned Bush to back
Clinton.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ It was not his fault. The Bruins Wednesday night lost
a playoff game that they should have won, but no one was blaming
goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The B's thoroughly outplayed the Sabres for two periods. Dafoe
faced only seven shots in the first 40 minutes, and Boston led,
2-1. But the Sabres outshot the Bruins, 18-7, in the third and won,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was not right. This is upstate New York. You do not expect to
get your wallet picked in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about not staying back,'' Dafoe said. ``But we
didn't practice what we preached. A one-goal lead in the Stanley
Cup playoffs after two periods has got to be enough. But we sat
back and totally let them come at us. Why it happened, I don't
know. They outshot us, 14-1, at the start of the third, and that's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey guys don't point fingers. An NHL locker room has no Wade
Boggs saying, ``Hey, I got my three hits.'' In a league largely
populated by Canadian farm boys, Eastern Europeans, Scandinavians,
and snow-belt Americans, there is no room for the blame game. Dafoe
knew he outplayed the great Dominik Hasek in Game 3, but there was
no need for excuses or chest-thumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in pretty good shape,'' said the polite, sad-eyed
goalie. ``But for one reason or another . . . I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Bruins felt there was reason for confidence after two
periods. The B's had the Sabres back on their heels (do skates have
heels?). Fans at Marine Midland Arena were booing the locals. The
game belonged to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought that,'' said Dafoe. ``We're a very good
team when we have a lead. Those first two periods were the best
periods we've played in the series. I was very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has carried the B's quite a few times this season, but he
was little more than an interested bystander when the Bruins
humbled the Sabres in periods one and two. Seven shots. Six saves.
One softie goal after a Ray Bourque penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dreaded third. The B's went to the Patrick
Buchanan (conservative) game plan, and it backfired. Teams that
play to win usually win. Teams that play not to lose usually lose.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Rhett Warrener tied it in the seventh minute of the
third period, and Dixon Ward put the hometown team ahead a couple
of minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to lose one or two assignments, and they
capitalized,'' reasoned Boston coach Pat Burns. ``That second goal
changed everything. I knew when they got that second goal that the
whole momentum changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrener's goal was a second-chance effort. Dafoe saved the
defenseman's first shot but was unable to control the puck. ``I
made the save with my stick, but it went straight back out to
him,'' said Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   These Bruins are young. Most of them had never won a playoff
series before beating Carolina in the first round of these
playoffs. Dafoe had never won a series before he beat the
Hurricanes, and he remembers that Boston trailed, 2-1, before
winning the final three games of that series. The experience serves
them well now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at this as a panic situation,'' said the
goalie. ``If we win Friday, we've accomplished what we set out to
do here.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be important to put Game 3 in the rear view mirror. All
the B's went to bed Wednesday night knowing that they gave one
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-goal lead after two periods in the Stanley Cup playoffs
has got to be enough,'' said Dafoe. ``But for one reason or another
_ I really don't know _ we sat back and they totally came at us. We
shouldn't be doing that at this point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stop the puck, that's all. It's the one thing I do. But
this is not the way this should have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more experience than some of our younger players,''
said Burns. ``What we have to do is convince the younger guys that
it'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe may need a little convincing. He knows he played well
enough to win Wednesday night. He made more saves and more
difficult saves than the indomitable Dominik. But his team lost the
game, a game it should have won.

YOUNG BRUINS HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Kevin Paul Dupont  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Young teams have nights like these, growing pains, and
there was pain aplenty for the Bruins to wallow in Wednesday night
after they watched their 2-1 lead disappear into the western New
York night.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes from taking a 2-1 series lead over the Sabres,
the Bruins spent too much time standing around, looking around,
looking like out-of-place teenagers in the executive board room.
Suddenly, everyone was wearing pinstripes and wingtips, and they
were still in highcut sneakers and cutoff jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried, we were still in the game,'' said Boston defenseman
Kyle McLaren, reflecting on Rhett Warrener's goal that pulled the
Sabres into a 2-2 tie with 13:16 to play. ``We wanted to get back
on track, but it never happened. I think we hung our head too
low.''
</P>
<P>
   One minute they were there, the next minute they were the
hang-down-your-head Tom Dooleys.
</P>
<P>
   It's just what you have to live with when you back an evolving
team, a work in progress. Should the Bruins have won Wednesday
night? Absolutely. The Sabres played somewhere between poorly and
OK for the better part of 40 minutes, and the Bruins came out for
Period 3 hoping to nurse a one-goal lead to the winner's circle _ a
sure ticket to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It took Boston nearly eight minutes to land its first shot on
net in the final period. By then, the Sabres already had Warrener's
tying goal, just one of 10 shots they had on Byron Dafoe before Don
Sweeney landed the first on Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be doing that at this point in the season, but we
did,'' said Dafoe, who once again outplayed the great Hasek,
something he now has done twice in this series. ``We have to
correct that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Bruins did was correct. In Game 2 at the Vault,
the Sabres came storming out of the gate and landed 17 shots on
Dafoe in the first period. The Bruins were pinned in their own end,
unable to get out from under the Sabres' forechecking blanket.
</P>
<P>
   They came into Game 3 needing to be much quicker behind their
own blue line, and they were, not allowing the Sabres to mount any
kind of offensive pressure. Buffalo's one goal came when Dafoe
errantly pushed a puck into the slot, only to see it wash back in
his crease when it deflected off Michal Grosek and Sweeney. Jason
Woolley potted it from a bad angle with only 1:37 gone. An awful
goal. But, the Bruins didn't give up another shot for the rest of
the period. It was symptomatic of the entire night: small mistakes
and huge consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they know more than some of our younger
players,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``I thought Joe Thornton responded
well, after having a so-so game on Sunday. Now, if we could get
everyone to respond like that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was another one of those, shall we say,
maturity issues. Dixon Ward swatted in a one-timer from the top of
the crease to put it away with 10:22 to play. Rarely do you see
someone left so wide open so low, especially in Burns's
defensive-minded scheme. Ward had slipped his coverage, just by
inches, with Landon Wilson just a step out of synch in his
man-to-man coverage. Across came Vaclav Varada's feed and Dafoe had
no chance at blocking the Ward rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost one or two assignments,'' said Burns. ``That Ward goal
was a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fell into a 2-1 deficit in their first-round series
against the Hurricanes and turned it around dramatically by smart,
controlled play, withstanding some intense forechecking. They were
patient, smart, and confident enough with their game and maintained
their poise. They found a way out.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't the same margin for recovery with the Sabres. They
hop on mistakes and bury them (translation: they don't have a
Martin Gelinas to double hit the puck in front of a wide-open net).
Don't be misled. Buffalo isn't quite an NHL powerhouse. But there's
enough here, especially with Hasek in net, for them to play poorly
for two periods and know, if the score remains close, they've got
enough talent and energy to knock off a team that just isn't quite
as mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to be close games,'' said Boston
captain Ray Bourque. ``We knew most likely they'd be one-goal
games. And most of the game, we did the right things. It's just
that it got away from us in the third period. We felt pretty good
about our game, but we sat back a little and we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque called Friday's Game 4 here a ``must win'' for the
Bruins. The accompanying truth to that is they must not lapse into
what has become their young man's twilight zone. They could
eliminate all the prolonged hiccups and still lose. But failing to
eliminate them virtually guarantees defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Under Burns's knowing watch, they have chalked up two dreadful
periods in this series. That's a concern. The coach can see it
playing out in front of him, but he doesn't have the fix.
</P>
<P>
   The cure in this case is experience, knowledge, coming of age.
None of that can be accomplished with a 30-second timeout, some
chest beating and an X-and-O diagram scribbled on the top of the
dasher.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more bodies, more talented bodies, and most of all it
takes time _ the shortest commodity of all.

<P>
   Like fine wine, Pedro Martinez just gets better and better. With
each outing he turns in another vintage performance, somehow
outdoing the previous masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a Seattle Mariners lineup that includes several of the
premier hitters in the game, Martinez put on another dominating
performance in a 9-2 Red Sox victory Wednesday night at Fenway
Park. With much encouragement from a crowd of 28,177, Martinez ran
his record to 7-1, the best mark in baseball, and matched his
career high with 15 strikeouts, which he reached in his previous
outing Friday against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost his no-hit bid on a leadoff double by David Segui
in the fifth, allowing him to concentrate on strikeouts. He had
nine through four innings, and 13 through seven. He picked up two
more to start the eighth, tying his career best.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd knew he didn't have a shot at the major league mark of
20 shared by Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood. But it was pulling for
Martinez to outdo himself. Manager Jimy Williams could have removed
him after a two-out single by Raul Ibanez, but let Martinez, who
had thrown 125 pitches, face Seattle's David Bell, who had homered
earlier. Martinez got Bell to fly out and left to a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear the crowd getting louder and louder with every
batter I faced,'' said Martinez. ``Fortunately, it doesn't get me
any more excited than I normally am. Jimy knew I'd been over 120
pitches in the last four outings. He's concerned and I know that.
He's only trying to protect me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the crowd to get on Jimy if anything happened in
the game. I'd rather take responsibility myself. I knew I could get
the hitter out. I know how I feel and he trusts me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to talk to the man,'' said Williams of his
conference with Martinez. ``He didn't say a word until perhaps at
the end. You've got to stay with the man. To me he was still
pitching good. When he told me `I can go get him,' that's all I
needed to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not trust Martinez? He has 10 or more strikeouts in six
straight outings, a feat matched only by Randy Johnson since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Martinez struck out the side for the 119th
time in his career. He lost his no-hitter on a double by Segui in
the fifth. Bell hit a solo home run in the sixth, the first off
Martinez in 221 batters. Other than that, Seattle was overmatched
as Martinez allowed four hits and one walk over eight innings.
Derek Lowe pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything going tonight,'' said Martinez. ``I had a
good fastball and pretty good command of my breaking ball. I had my
pitches working today and I felt strong. I've had quite a few
stretches like this in my career. I normally go five or six games,
sometimes longer. So far this year I have been healthy and I'm
doing the things I have to do to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had plenty of offensive support, racking up 11 hits.
Nomar Garciaparra led the way with two doubles and two singles and
three RBIs. The four-hit game was the eighth of his career and gave
him 14 runs batted in for the series. Jose Offerman went 3 for 5
with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But the hitters weren't the story Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as dominant as there is in the game,'' Mike Stanley said
of Martinez. ``I haven't seen anybody dominate a game the way he's
doing now. Nobody is coming close.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garciaparra: ``You definitely feel the energy out there.
Pedro is doing his job. That lets us go out and do our job. He's
getting us back into the dugout quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to face him because he is one of the best,'' said
Seattle's Edgar Martinez. ``And the way he's pitching right now he
is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey didn't enjoy his night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got everything going out there,'' he said. ``You just
have to go up there swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams knows his ace isn't done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a human being like everyone else,'' said Williams. ``But
he's a very special athlete. He understands he has a gift and he
knows how to use it.''

   BUFFALO _ Big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bruins are in this morning. They will downplay
it, talk about how it was only Game 3, that there is lots of time
left in this series that there are many chances, that they are only
down by one game. The fact is, it's very likely the Bruins will
look back on Wednesday night, a 3-2 defeat at Marine Midland Arena,
as the turning point in this Eastern Conference semifinal series,
as the one that got away, as, dare we say it, the one that was the
beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Bruins were the better team for 40 minutes.
They employed a nearly perfect (and ultra-boring) game plan. They
suffocated the Sabres. Then, in the third, they allowed the Sabres
to come up for air and not only did they take a breath, they blew
the Bruins away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Boston trails, 2-1, in the best-of-seven series
with Game 4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on us,'' said wing Steve Heinze. ``We can't have third
periods like that and expect to win. It was two different games.
Unfortunately we played three periods and not two because we were
the better team for two periods but they were just way better in
the third. We didn't put them away or have the killer instinct or
the eye of the tiger to put them away. When it slips away like
that, shame on us. You've got to have the killer instinct in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a 2-1 lead heading into the final period but in a
span of less than three minutes, the Sabres closed the gap and took
the lead for good. Right wing Dixon Ward tallied the winner at 9:38
of the third. Center Michael Peca dished a pass to Vaclav Varada,
who centered the puck out in the slot for Ward. Ward one-timed it
past goalie Byron Dafoe and the Bruins couldn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came out with a strong game plan, though it nearly
derailed before it got started. Just 10 seconds into the game, Ray
Bourque was whistled off for hooking, giving the Sabres a power
play that defenseman Jason Woolley converted at 1:37. The Sabres
were up, 1-0, and no one had even worked up a sweat for the Bruins
except coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a hiccup, though, because the Bruins came
charging back on the power play. With Wayne Primeau serving a
holding-the-stick call against Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek, center
Joe Thornton dished a pass from below the right circle through the
crease. It caromed off Anson Carter and went right onto the stick
of Heinze, who banged in a quick shot at 8:47 for his third goal of
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' second goal came as a result of a fortuitous
long-range slapper by defenseman Dave Ellett that went off the left
knee of Hasek, momentarily stunning the goalie. Hasek went right
down to the ice and couldn't move. The Sabres tried to clear the
puck but Thornton corralled it and flung it down to Carter, who was
heading for the net. Carter tapped it into the empty net at 12:48.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was all Boston as the Bruins managed the most
boring, but convincing 20 minutes of defensive hockey they've
played in the series. They trapped, they clogged the neutral zone,
they kept the Buffalo forwards to the perimeter. They managed to
hold the Sabres to a measly four shots in the period and seven
through the first 40 minutes while generating 14 themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wheels fell off. The momentum shifted dramatically in
the third, with the Sabres leaving the Bruins in the dust. At the
7:35 mark, Buffalo had more shots (10) than it had in the first two
periods combined and Boston had none. The Bruins' first shot on net
in the period came from Don Sweeney at 7:57.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start working until the third period,'' said Buffalo
coach Lindy Ruff. ``They played a pretty smart game in the first
two periods and our lack of hustle allowed them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rhett Warrener tied the game, 2-2, at 6:44 when he
swatted in his own rebound from the right circle. The Sabres gained
enormous energy from the score and kept coming like a tidal wave.
When Ward scored it was lights out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't finish,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hope this game won't be the one that finishes them.

675,000 FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOST MEDICAID, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leap from welfare to work has cost two thirds
of a million low-income people their health insurance, an advocacy
group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through 1997, about 675,000 former recipients and
their family members lost coverage under Medicaid, according to a
study released by Families USA, a Washington-based advocacy group
that concentrates on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is the government's insurance program for low-income
families. About two thirds of those losing this coverage _ 62
percent _ were children, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on data drawn from the government's Health Care Financing
Administration, which administers Medicaid, and the U.S. Census
Bureau's Current Population Survey, the Families USA report is the
latest tremor in a series of aftershocks following the 1996 law
restructuring welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by President Clinton in August of that year, the law
requires people to go to work after being on welfare two years and
limits their number of years on welfare to five over their
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republican congressional leaders have trumpeted the
law's success in dramatically reducing the number of families on
welfare. Welfare rolls have declined by 4.6 million people, or 38
percent, since Clinton signed the legislation. In January 1993,
when he took office, welfare rolls totaled 14.1 million people. The
figure now is 7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 federal law followed similar state welfare-to-work
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, mostly liberals who opposed the law and predicted it
would cause increased suffering and homelessness for the very poor,
say the welfare-roll decline masks the obstacles that former
recipients face.
</P>
<P>
   They fill mostly low-income jobs which rarely offer health
insurance, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony here is that the reward these people get for doing
what they were supposed to do is they are now uninsured,'' said Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of Medicaid enrollees has declined from 41.2
million in 1996 to 40.3 million in 1997, the latest year for which
the federal Department of Health and Human Services has data.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack attributed the former recipients' loss of Medicaid to
several factors.
</P>
<P>
   Government rules permit new workers to stay on Medicaid for a
year or more after leaving welfare. But state and local social
service agencies often do not inform them that they are still
eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Others have exhausted their transition benefit and now find
themselves among the 43 million Americans who have no health
insurance whatsoever. And still others who are dropped off welfare
rolls without steady employment lose Medicaid coverage even though
their income remains low enough to qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicaid and welfare are no longer bound together _ as
they were before 1996 _ people now going on welfare do not
automatically receive Medicaid. They must apply for it through a
separate procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``needs to be much more careful in monitoring the
Medicaid program to make sure these cutoffs do not occur,'' Pollack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the government information available goes only
through 1997, he added, ``We should expect there are many more
people who will lose health coverage with each passing year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Matt Salo, senior policy analyst for the National Governors
Association, called the Family USA report numbers ``fuzzy.'' But he
added the states take the issue seriously. ``States are looking
past welfare reform to see what cracks have developed, and they're
moving quickly to fill the holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute
of Government in Albany, N.Y. said better technology may help ease
the problem of low-income workers lacking health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case managers need the tracking capability to help families be
independent and get what they are entitled to,'' he aid.
</P>
<P>
   In March the Department of Health and Human Services issued a
guide to help ex-welfare families keep their health insurance.
Officials sent the guide, called ``Supporting Families in
Transition,'' to welfare and Medicaid administrations nationwide
along with a letter asking them to enroll ``working families
unlikely to enter the welfare office, but (who are) likely to be
eligible for Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute,
which is aligned with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council,
said the Medicaid problem is actually a victory in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to subsidize the health care of low-income workers is
where this debate is headed,'' he said. ``But we wouldn't be headed
there if we hadn't broken the back of the old welfare system.''

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Julia Roberts
with Hugh Grant in ``Notting Hill.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Look in the dictionary under ``type-casting,'' and you might
find a picture of Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    No, she's not a prostitute, a conspiracy-busting law student or
a wedding-sabotaging food critic. But look at her next couple of
films.
 &HT;    In ``Notting Hill,'' opening May 28, the $20-million-a-movie
superstar plays the world's most famous movie star, a tabloid
fixture whose scandal-ridden personal life is common knowledge the
world over.
 &HT;    Then there's ``Runaway Bride,'' which will open in August.
Working with Richard Gere and Garry Marshall, her co-star and
director in her breakout film, ``Pretty Woman'' (l990), Roberts
plays a woman who has a habit of changing her mind just as she's
about to walk down the aisle.
 &HT;    If that reminds you of Roberts' notorious vanishing act just
before her scheduled 1991 wedding to Kiefer Sutherland, you're not
the only one.
 &HT;    Roberts herself denies any connection between the actress and
the role. Settling in for an interview at London's posh Dorchester
Hotel, she says with a straight face that she doesn't see any
similarities between ``Notting Hill's'' superstar actress and
Hollywood's real-life Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``In almost every way she's different from me, a different
person coming from a different place,'' Roberts says. ``I'm not
having fun at the expense of my own life _ but I am getting a kick
at the expense of her life.''
 &HT;    Co-star Hugh Grant, who plays a mild-mannered bookseller who
captivates the celebrity, scoffs at her denials.
 &HT;    ``She's either deluding herself or lying,'' he says. ``There
were times in this movie that she'd deliver a speech I felt was
coming from somewhere deep in her soul.''
 &HT;    Writer/producer Richard Curtis, who also directed Grant in
``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' (l994), admits that the
resemblances aren't coincidental.
 &HT;    ``I wrote the script with Julia in mind,'' he says, ``and
frankly I never expected her to say she'd do it. But she said it
was the best romantic comedy she'd ever read.
 &HT;    ``Still,'' he adds, ``we were very surprised by her reaction. We
thought she was going to be able to give us so many more insights
into what it was like to live under the harsh glare of fame and
celebrity. But she's not playing Julia Roberts _ she's playing
another person entirely.''
 &HT;    As for ``Runaway Bride,'' Roberts has left more than a few
suitors in her wake. In years gone by she's been linked to Liam
Neeson and Jason Patric, engaged to marry Sutherland and, in 1993,
married to and divorced from singer Lyle Lovett.
 &HT;    She's currently hot and heavy with Benjamin Bratt, the New
York-based actor who stars in NBC's long-running television drama
series ``Law and Order.'' Roberts recently accepted a fraction of
her normal salary to do a guest spot on the series, playing a
seductive New York executive whose one-night stand with a prominent
investment banker results in his ``death by Viagra.''
 &HT;    The May 5 episode revolved around Roberts' attempts to seduce
Bratt's Det. Reynaldo Curtis, who hangs onto his virtue and his
marriage by his fingernails.
 &HT;    ``I begged for the part,'' Roberts says with a laugh.
 &HT;    The 31-year-old star, her dark hair pulled back severely, looks
waif-thin in the current Hollywood fashion, in form-fitting black
slacks and jacket. The whole effect is very movie-star, which of
course is what ``Notting Hill'' is all about.
 &HT;    ``Fame is not a big deal,'' she insists. ``It's a myth. People's
perception of my life or an actor's life is a lot more hectic and
outrageous and pressure-filled and glamorous than I have ever known
my life to be, or the life of any of my actor friends.
 &HT;    ``People will just assume that, because I'm playing an actor in
this movie, she is me or I understand everything about her life,''
she adds. ``I don't. All actors are different _ we're not an
assembly-line breed.''
 &HT;    Despite all appearances to the contrary _ including past
complaints about the agonies of life in a celebrity fishbowl _
Roberts insists that she isn't unusually stressed by her Hollywood
lifestyle.
 &HT;    ``I don't feel any pressure in my life,'' she says. ``Pressure
is a choice ... As my celebrity and power in Hollywood has
increased, I have become more relaxed. Being famous brings with it
an understanding of how to deal with all that comes with fame.
 &HT;    ``I possess a knowledge of who I am and what I want and why I
want it,'' she says. ``And that makes me a very centered person.
I've always had a certain amount of perspective. I came into this
business with my eyes wide open.''
 &HT;    Grant has had his own brushes with the down side of fame _
including media fascination with his long-lived relationship with
supermodel-turned-actress Elizabeth Hurley and his arrest for
soliciting a prostitute _ but Roberts says that the film was hardly
an act of retaliation. In fact, she says, at times it was downright
silly.
 &HT;    ``Hugh would tease me relentlessly,'' Roberts recalls. ``But he
learned quickly that I could give as good as I get.''
 &HT;    Grant confirms her report.
 &HT;    ``Sure,'' he says. ``I'd tease her about her hair, clothes and
her entourage and everything that she cares a lot about.
 &HT;    ``We'd end our debates by having food fights,'' he says. ``She'd
throw food at me and I'd throw it back _ and then I'd see her
enormous bodyguard closing in and I'd be intimidated. So I lost
most of the food battles.''
 &HT;    Roberts laughs.
 &HT;    ``This is classic Hugh Grant material and what he does so
well,'' she says. ``It's been really fun to watch him be this
clever, fumbling, sweet guy he plays in the movie.''
 &HT;    Even fame has its limits, Roberts adds. There are some
celebrities who are dismayed when they are not recognized, but she
says that she welcomes it.
 &HT;    And, yes, there are indeed people who don't recognize Julia
Roberts.
 &HT;    ``At a party a woman turned to me and said, `Well, what do you
do for a living?''' she recalls. ``When I said I was an actress,
she replied, `Would I have seen you in any particular film?'
 &HT;    ``Then another woman came over and began screaming `Oh my God,
it's Julia Roberts!'''
 &HT;    The actress rolls her eyes.
 &HT;    ``I envy that woman who didn't know me,'' she says. ``She has a
full and fulfilling life to not know who I am.''

 &HT;    Bush wants to go `off the record' at public event
 &HT;    By Mike Elswick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush was talking presidential
Wednesday _ but in a private way _ even though he was in one of the
state's most public buildings and talking to a crowd that included
public officials.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through a 10-minute stand-up briefing to Longview
Partnership representatives in Austin for a two-day visit, Bush
abruptly stopped talking when he saw a reporter from the Longview
News-Journal taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the state's top elected public official standing in a
public office in the Texas State Capital on the taxpayer's payroll,
said all of his comments were ``off the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, pointing a finger, and with what one Longview
visitor called ``a laser beam look,'' threatened to leave the room
if a note pad was not put away and a tape recorder not turned off.
</P>
<P>
   He continued his presentation but reiterated two more times that
his comments were ``off the record.'' Although he has not yet
declared his candidacy for president, Bush is considered a
front-runner for the Republican Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Longview News-Journal publisher Glenn McCutchen, who was part of
the Longview Partnership group meeting with state officials, said
he was incensed over the idea of the state's highest elected
official not being willing to stand behind comments he was making
on public issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 35 years in journalism I've never seen anything like
this,'' McCutchen said. ``It raises the question of whether Gov.
Bush is telling one story in private and another in public.''
</P>
<P>
   In general terms, Bush discussed his feelings on a variety of
issues from the end of the current Texas Legislative session, the
morale of United States military troops, national leadership and
world issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry in a separate briefing to about 20 Longview
Partnership representatives, was not so reluctant to be quoted as
he praised the leadership Texas is receiving from Sen. Bill
Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant. As chairman of the Texas Senate Finance
committee and as a senior senator, Perry said Ratliff is a key
player in helping shape the future of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an extraordinary job Bill Ratliff is doing representing
you and all of Texas,'' Perry said. ``The appropriation process is
so vitally important. He listens to requests judiciously and is
very fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry called Ratliff's job as chairman of the finance committee
``one of the toughest in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said as the Texas Legislature moves into the final weeks of
the session the intensity level is increasing dramatically. But he
said Texas continues to be a model of bi-partisan politics with
both Democrats and Republicans
</P>
<P>
   working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children's education has been one of the major focuses,''
Perry said.

   KEN: Trial of Kenneth Demarrias provides look at youth violence
and what's being planned to stop it. He is charged with two counts
of first-degree murder for killing a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old
over a basketball game at Winner Park. The murders last year
outraged a city trying to come to grips with rising juvenile
homicides. In response to last year's murders, the Partnership for
Children and 25 other agencies will soon release a series of
recommendations to curtail youth violence in Kansas City. An
official with the partnership says it's necessary to intervene
earlier in children's lives. Demarrias was 18 at the time of the
killings and faces life without parole if convicted. Joe Lambe. 20.

 &HT;    PLIGHT OF KOSOVO ALBANIAN CHILDREN, RUNS PARALLEL TO THOSE OF
BOSNIAN WAR
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ They joke and laugh and draw
pictures, just like so many children the world over. For a moment,
it's easy to imagine the eight- and nine-year-olds in Hamdija
Pasic's art class are just like other children.
</P>
<P>
   But these children have seen the worst the adult world has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the bloody civil war ended here, many of
Bosnia's youngest victims are still reeling from the horrors they
lived through. Horrors that aid officials worry are now being
repeated on a new wave of innocents from the war-torn Serb province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Pasic and scores of psychologists, psychiatrists, social
workers and teachers struggle to undo the damage the war did to
Bosnia's children, they hope that their work here sheds some light
on the problems sure to arise with Kosovar Albanian refugee
children.
</P>
<P>
   Pasic, a counselor with the Christian aid organization World
Vision, particularly worries
</P>
<P>
   about one little boy. There's one like him in every class, a
withdrawn, troubled child who won't talk about the memories that
haunt him. When he draws a picture of himself, he scribbles over
the face, obliterating the eyes and nose, scratching out the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a refugee, but we're not sure what else happened
to him,'' Pasic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some pretty serious problems, self-esteem issues. We
think there are family problems, but we're not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   So how will the children of Kosovo fare? What ongoing effects
will they feel years from now?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say, experts in Bosnia say. Nationwide statistics
aren't available, though counselors say they're seeing some very
serious problems, including an increase in juvenile crime and
suicide. A few months ago, a Sarajevo 13-year-old committed suicide
with a hand grenade, a method that's become increasingly common
since the war here ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the world will never understand what these children
have suffered,'' said
</P>
<P>
   sociologist Milanka Mikovic. ``Hundreds of thousands lost their
homes, their friends, their
</P>
<P>
   schools, their pets, and all the things that make the lives of
kids what it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikovic studied a group of 500 schoolchildren between the ages
of six and ten in Sarajevo. Twenty-three percent had seen a
relative wounded; 38 percent had seen dead bodies in the street; 46
percent were refugees within the city. Among those children, she
found an unusually high incidence of insomnia, aggressive behavior,
panic attacks, depression and problems in school.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, 45,000 children lost a parent. More than
3,000 lost both parents. And tens of thousands lost relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors like Pasic do what they can for the children. The
World Vision program includes music therapy and group discussions
about things like conflicts and how to resolve them, fears and how
to cope with them, memories and how to understand them. At
HealthNet, another humanitarian aid group working here, counselors
work one-on-one with the more seriously disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to make a prognosis,'' said psychologist
Amira Gradincic. ``What we're
</P>
<P>
   seeing, is it going to be a damaged generation in two years?
It's hard to know. In 15 years, yeah, maybe. They did suffer a lot
and they are still carrying those experiences with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's children are also struggling with the physical
consequences of the war. More
</P>
<P>
   than 35,000 were wounded and approximately 4,000 of those
suffered disfiguring injuries,
</P>
<P>
   according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed a lot of eye problems and more leukemia than we
used to,'' said pediatrician Mira Ademovic. ``But we don't have the
funds to do any kind of systematic analysis to be able to say for
sure, this child's problem is because of the war or we have more of
this type of problem because of the war. We don't even have the
equipment to do analyses to determine nutritional deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ademovic said she has seen many children who's growth was
stunted by poor diet and health care during the war and even three
years later; they're shorter and smaller than
</P>
<P>
   their ages would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, counselors at Moj Prijatelj, which means ``My
Friend'' in Serbo-Croatian,
</P>
<P>
   work with another group of children struggling just to be kids.
</P>
<P>
   The girls in the seven- to 12-year-olds group idolize the Spice
Girls and worship the
</P>
<P>
   Back Street Boys. They come to the center every afternoon to
practice dances they'll do
</P>
<P>
   in a play they're planning.
</P>
<P>
   A video-tape of last year's play, which the children wrote
themselves, seems to start like any other school play. The princess
complains she's bored and one of her friends suggests she have a
new dress made. No, the princess says, she has too many dresses.
Another friend suggests she start another war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We've already fought everyone. I'm bored with war,'' the
princess says, almost hopefully.

 &HT;    ISRAELI ELECTION'S TWO FRONTRUNNERS: DIFFERENCES IN STYLE OVER
SUBSTANCE
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-ELECTION-$ADV16.
 &HT;    For Sun., May 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis go to the polls Monday to choose their next
prime minister. Though they could face a run-off on June 1, the two
clear frontrunners are incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin ``Bibi''
Netanyahu and challenger Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   THE INCUMBENT UNDER FIRE: BENJAMIN ``BIBI'' NETANYAHU
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS: Elected in 1996, heads the right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE: The American-educated 49-year-old is smooth and
telegenic. First Israeli prime minister to really resemble American
politicians. Fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   BRAINS: Went to high school in the United States, got a master's
degree in business from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   BRAWN: Commando captain in the Israeli army. Was shot in the
hand by friendly fire during the rescue of a hijacked Sabena
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWS: Fierce opponent of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
Oslo peace process. Since being elected, he has slowed the process
down.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING: Support from Jewish settlers living in the disputed
West Bank territories, ultra-religious Jews and the blue-collar
Jews whose families immigrated to Israel from other Middle Eastern
countries.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNTESTED CHALLENGER: EHUD BARAK
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS: Barak heads the left-wing Labor Party, but spent most
of his career in the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE: The 57-year-old is short and stocky, and speaks with
heavily accented English.
</P>
<P>
   BRAINS: Master's in engineering systems from Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   BRAWN: Israeli army's most decorated soldier. Was Netanyahu's
commander. Once sneaked into Beirut, disguised as a woman, and
assassinated terrorists in a PLO headquarters. His campaign
commercials call him ``soldier number 1.''
</P>
<P>
   VIEWS: Would accelerate Oslo peace process but says he will give
up little more than Netanyahu. He has stressed economic and social
issues in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING: His support mostly comes from secular Jews of European
descent and Israel's large Arab population.

   JERUSALEM _ As Israelis prepare to vote in elections Monday, the
question of how their country will co-exist with its neighbors is
being pushed slowly aside by the question of how Israelis will live
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   They will be voting according to their disparate views on
whether Israel should be a Western-styled democracy or a Jewish
fundamentalist state. They will be expressing their frustration
over a recession and looking for candidates that sympathize with
their particular ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   And, while they revel in the politics of the region's only
democracy -- voter turnout is sure to be over 80 percent -- the
divisions between what many call Israel's ``tribes,'' are in plain
view.
</P>
<P>
   On major intersections across the country, religious Israeli
youth -- boys in yamulkas and girls in long skirts -- carry signs
for the several right-wing and religious parties. Opposing them are
left-wing secular youth, in halter tops and jeans -- touting their
favorite pols.
</P>
<P>
   Five candidates vie for prime minister. The clear front-runners
are incumbent right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin ``Bibi'' Netanyahu
and former general, left-winger Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The minor candidates -- former defense minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, extreme right-winger Benjamin ``Benny'' Begin and Arab
candidate Azmi Bishara -- could likely drop out before Monday's
vote. If not, Netanyahu and Barak will probably face each other in
a June 1 run-off. Polls currently show Barak with a small lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, and Netanyahu, 49, used to be in the same elite
commando unit, but they battle each other now under the guidance of
their American political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu tells Israelis that even the Arabs want Barak because
he's weak. Barak, on the other hand, seems to appeal on a wider
range of issues. He tells Israelis that Netanyahu has left the
country ``stuck'' on all fronts, from economic development to
religious tolerance to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, far from world peace, the race could hinge on the
personality of Netanyahu, who seems to both inflame and personify
the country's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters are the ultra-religious and ethnic groups that
proudly call themselves ``the rabble.'' They feel Netanyahu fights
for them against Israel's elites just as he does against the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's opponents are fed up with that confrontational
nature. They call him a liar who is exploiting Israel's divisions
and pushing it toward war its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of Netanyahu's cabinet ministers have abandoned and
bad-mouthed him. The distrust seems to trickle down to his voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay loyal to who is with the right wing,'' says reluctant
Netanyahu supporter Eliyahu Mordechai, 33. ``But, as far as the
personal aspect goes, there have been changes. He's not so
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai sells nuts in Jerusalem's Mehaneh Yehudah produce
market, long a Netanyahu stronghold. The market is filled with
blue-collar Jews descended from other Middle Eastern countries who
feel alienated by Israel's Jews of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai removed the prime minister's picture from his stall
after Netanyahu fired a popular defense minister. Striding out of
his shop toward the crowded market, Mordechai sums up the changing
mood: ``Barak is going to win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former Netanyahu supporters have been repelled by the
power he has granted to the ultra-religious parties in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union voted heavily for Netanyahu in 1996, tipping the election his
way. They were hawks on security and felt ignored by the Labor
Party elites.
</P>
<P>
   But they are largely secular, and Netanyahu's religious allies
have challenged their Judaism, making it difficult for them to get
married or bring other relatives to the country. Polls show many
Russians are looking toward Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week(CQ), as he plunged in public opinion polls, the brash
Netanyahu turned to contrition. Telegenic as always, the
American-educated politician called his Likud Party loyalists home,
trying to remind them of the issue that has usually mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching a moment of truth in these elections,''
Netanyahu stated. ``I never said I was free of errors, but there is
one thing I can say, with my hand on my heart: That I have lead the
state of Israeli on the only road that can bring security and
peace. . . . I implore you to put aside all other concerns. I
implore you to come home to the Likud.''
</P>
<P>
   But, security is a tougher sell this year than in the past.
Barak's stance toward the Arabs differs little from Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sting of the campaign, the Arabs, has been neutralized,''
said pollster Hanoch Smith. ``It's very hard to differentiate among
any one of the candidates as to what they're saying about the main
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Netanyahu may be tough, but Barak was Netanyahu's
former army commander. He is also Israel's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, he would likely move quicker than Netanyahu on small
issues in the peace process, but stay firm on the major principles.
He refuses to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians, insists on
keeping most of the West Bank settlements in place and says he'll
be stingy with West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference is one of attitude. While Netanyahu reminds
Israelis of their fear of Arabs, Barak tells them they have nothing
to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more powerful than any neighbor. We can afford to
pursue peace from a position of strength,'' says Barak, whose short
and stocky physique belies his commando past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to fight terrorism. I will not let anybody strain
our security,'' Barak says.
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk has helped Barak bring the Labor Party toward the
political center, just as U.S. President Bill Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair did when their parties were viewed as too
far left of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak has taken cues from the outside world, world leaders
seem to be pulling for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Clinton administration appeared to back Netanyahu's
losing opponent, Shimon Peres. Now, it has been careful to remain
neutral. But it's clear that Netanyahu has frequently upset Clinton
by stalling the peace process and encouraging settlements on
disputed West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   Several Arab leaders, through appeals to his opponents, indicate
they also want Netanyahu out.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact Netanyahu is quick to publicize. But, it doesn't
matter to people like Galit Natan, a 30-year-old architect who
brought her daughter to a ``Just not Netanyahu'' rally recently.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barak and Netanyahu will make similar concessions in
the peace process but, ``the process to get there with Netanyahu
will be horrible. It's the person. We are voting for a person, not
a party.''

`TEA' LADIES WALLOW IN OBLIVION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Tea With Mussolini'' is a painfully annoying
film about a group of self-absorbed English biddies who wonder why
they should be prevented from enjoying their afternoon tea just
because the surrounding world is at war.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from a chapter in director Franco Zeffirelli's memoirs
that should have been left in the drawer, this period piece never
gives the audience much of a reason to care about its arrogant and
obstinate characters. Indeed, when their lives are threatened near
the end by a bunch of humorless, monocle-wearing Nazis, the
audience's rooting interests may land squarely with the fascists.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Florence on the eve of World War II, the film follows a
group of English expatriates known as the Scorpini. These
insufferable ancients mostly take tea in the Uffizi, throw lavish
parties and look down on anyone they deem unworthy of their
intimate circle.
</P>
<P>
   Of these women, the only good soul, Mary (Joan Plowright),
decides to take on a protege, a 5-year-old Italian boy named Luca
(Charlie Lucas), who was born out of wedlock. Luca's father
eventually sends him to school in Austria (German, not English, is
believed to be the language of the future) and when he returns, he
finds his native country much changed. (Baird Wallace plays the
older Luca.) Italy is on the brink of war and Mussolini's fascists
are telling the Scorpini to the leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Obstinate to their core, the women refuse to budge and are soon
herded up and taken to an abandoned hospital in nearby San
Gimignano. From the way they react, you would think these spoiled
twits had landed at Auschwitz. (The film includes some superficial
references to Jewish suffering, which only underscores the ladies'
laughably ignorant behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Arabella (Judi Dench) laments her separation from her beloved
dog; Lady Hester (Maggie Smith) calls it an outrage since she once
had tea with Mussolini and believes she deserves special treatment
from the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   The ``atrocities'' soon subside when a rich American art
collector, Elsa (Cher), pays to have the women moved into a nice
hotel with clean sheets and proper china. The Brits think Elsa is a
vulgar American, but she doesn't care. ``Everyone knows how I live
my life,'' she says. ``I live my life as a crazy woman!'' The line,
in Cher's ham-fisted hands, is just as insipid as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The film contains many such inanities, resulting in remarkably
poor performances from its distinguished cast. Dench, in
particular, would probably like to delete this film from her
credits, coming as it does on the heels of her Oscar victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Scorpini display some mild heroism near the film's end, but
it's difficult to summon much feeling for a group of women who
bemoan the quality of the Earl Grey tea while never giving a
thought to their families back in England suffering through the
blitz. Quite simply, apart from some nicely photographed Florentine
locales, there is no reason for ``Tea With Mussolini'' to exist. &QL;

 &HT;    With his pen in his hand
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The memories are distant, so distant that the
words come back only in bits and snatches. Sentence fragments.
Sparks off a campfire, scattered wide by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But I can see clearly in my mind's eye the two old men sitting
outside on whatever was handy, smoking and passing a quart of beer
while they told each other stories.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of brave souls and treacherous ones. Stories of lost
love and lost treasure. Stories about white horses with magic
powers and the men who rode them. Stories that bedazzled a boy of
3.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing I like better than a good story. It is the
inheritance my grandfather Crecencio Garcia left me and one shared
with most of his children and their children.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather was through being a janitor every day at 3 p.m.
On his way home, he would pick up a canteloupe or watermelon to
bring to my mother. He would get me in the trade and down the dirt
street we'd go to the corner grocery for beer, a pouch of tobacco,
rolling papers and a soda for me.
</P>
<P>
   Properly supplied, we would arrive at the home of his
story-swapping buddy and the tales would commence. I see them
still, my Papa Cencho and his friend Ramos, two old men rolling
cigarettes, sharing beer and talking of other days.
</P>
<P>
   The memory comes and goes but rode a fast horse last week when I
heard that Americo Paredes had died. He was the storyteller's
storyteller. He knew my grandfather without ever having met him and
he knew him well.
</P>
<P>
   The transmissions of culture, values and folk history are the
storyteller's crops. You'll find the soul of a people in their
stories and that is the field in which Paredes labored long and
labored well.
</P>
<P>
   He was a journalist at his roots, beginning as a reporter for
the Brownsville Herald and in the military. A compendium of
outstanding ``Stars and Stripes'' stories carries one about the
Japanese war crimes trial under Americo Paredes' byline.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of us, and he never really quit being one of us,
although he left the daily business to pursue a higher education
and university teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   He never quit listening, though. And we all know that the
absolute best storytellers and journalists are the best listeners.
</P>
<P>
   He listened while the old men told their stories. He tape
recorded their music. If he hadn't been around to do that, those
stories and songs would have scattered like those sparks that glow
brightly but die quickly in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   And we would be the poorer because we would have lost a part of
our heritage, a piece of the culture that molds us into who we are.
</P>
<P>
   The good doctor expresses that thought well in the
acknowledgments (even that was poetic) in his famous ``With His
Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero'':
</P>
<P>
   ``To the memory of my father,
</P>
<P>
   who rode a raid or two with
</P>
<P>
   Catarino Garza;
</P>
<P>
   and to all those old men
</P>
<P>
   who sat around on summer nights,
</P>
<P>
   in the days when there was
</P>
<P>
   a chaparral, smoking their
</P>
<P>
   cornhusk cigarettes and talking
</P>
<P>
   in low, gentle voices about
</P>
<P>
   violent things;
</P>
<P>
   while I listened''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican American journalists in particular owe Dr. Paredes a
great deal. He was in this racket long before we were welcome in
it. Even in the late '60s when we started to enter the field in any
kind of numbers, it wasn't easy for us. I can only imagine what it
was like for a Chicano reporter in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of the love for storytelling my grandfather left
me and the inspiration of Dr. Paredes keeps me in this business.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard about Dr. Paredes' death, I thought about what
Miles Davis once said about Duke Ellington: ``I think all musicians
should get together on a certain day and get down on their knees
and thank Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, today's crop of Mexican American journalists should
get down on their knees and thank Dr. Paredes.
</P>
<P>
   My deepest sympathy to the family. Their loss is profound, and
one shared by anyone who loves words.

 &HT;    Hate-crimes bill could hurt Bush either way
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Would Gov. George W. Bush push the Texas Senate
to pass a hate-crimes bill if President Clinton called and asked?
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of James Byrd Jr., the black man who was dragged to
death behind a pickup truck near Jasper, says Clinton told her
Friday during an Austin visit that he would call ``if he thought it
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely the president will make that call _ since it probably
would have zero effect on the governor if he did.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton was the guy who removed George W.'s dad from the
White House _ albeit with Ross Perot's help.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and probably more important, is the widespread
presumption that the governor-who-would-be-president would prefer
the bill stay stalled so he isn't faced with having to declare
himself for or against.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he thinks Texas already punishes hate crimes
enough. And indeed, critics of the hate-crimes legislation point
out that the first of the three men tried for Byrd's murder got the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill passed the House, by a surprisingly large 83-61
margin, after some impassioned speeches and with some Republicans
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Wolens (D-Dallas), who has carried the bill for
years, used words like ``spic'' and ``nigger'' to an
uncharacteristically hushed House chamber as a reminder of the
venomous epithets used against people simply because of their skin
color.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Moreno, a lawyer from El Paso who uses a wheelchair,
told of housing discrimination in Austin while he was a law
student.
</P>
<P>
   Behind many of the votes against the bill in the House, and
opposition in the Senate, is conservative fear that it gives new
standing to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glen Maxey (D-Austin), the Legislature's only openly gay
member, said he was gratified when several rural, conservative
Democrats who had said they would vote against the bill wound up
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the toughest vote I've cast this session,'' said one of
them, Rep. David Counts (D-Knox City). Counts said it became clear
``that the hate had escalated. As I listened to the debate, it
occurred to me that it was time to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where a bill must have a two-thirds majority to
be brought up for consideration, the bill is stuck. Even though all
15 of the Democrats are for it, its sponsors need six of the 16
Republicans to get it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats, with newfound political fervor now that
former Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock isn't there to keep them in
check, have made the hate-crimes bill their defining cause this
session. Some have said they'll start killing other bills,
including the appropriations bill, if hate crimes remains stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Several opponents back the party line broadcast by Texas GOP
Chairman Susan Weddington, that Texas has tough criminal penalties
already and shouldn't make it a bigger crime to hurt one group of
people than another.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Texas already has a hate-crimes law, which stiffens
penalties for crimes involving hate or bias but does not specify
which groups are covered.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ including some who have voted for the bill in the
past _ simply don't want to vote this time and put themselves or
Bush on the spot. Sen. Florence Shapiro (R-Plano), who co-sponsored
the current hate-crimes law, says she can't see what the new one
would add. ``I haven't made a decision one way or the other,'' she
said Wednesday. ``I'm still looking for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that if it passed and Bush doesn't veto it, that
could hurt him with conservatives in Republican presidential
primaries. If he did veto it, or even let it become law without his
signature, that could cost him in the general election with
minority group members, homosexuals and civil-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Armbrister of Victoria, probably the most conservative
Democrat in the Senate, says even though he's for the bill, and
even though some Republicans might vote yes were it to come up,
most of his Republican colleagues will be against it _ no matter
what.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that are going to vote no are like the people that
are going to vote yes,'' Armbrister said. ``There ain't nothing you
can do to scare 'em.''

 &HT;    When hammering doesn't work, this campus does
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ After the Columbine shootings, amid the stories of
the campus loners who killed, Chris Hanks felt chilled. In the
school where he works, Hanks sees many students who'd be seen as
likely candidates for the Trenchcoat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   They may not dress that particular way. They may not have death
wishes plastered all over them and posted on the Internet. But,
said Hanks, they fit the media profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dress oddly, listen to strange music, and for the most
part are on the fringes of their high school community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' chill? It wasn't from fear that those students would turn
violent. Hanks likes them, trusts them. The chill comes when he
wonders what those young people must think about all of this.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hanks sees them every day means they're not headed
in the direction of violent oblivion. They know the direction to
that, which is out the door.
</P>
<P>
   They attend OPTIONS, an alternative high school at McLennan
Community College. It is fed by districts throughout McLennan
County. OPTIONS is an acronym representing more words than you need
to know. What you should know is this: It's a place for students
who've decided the traditional high school is no place for them.
Hanks is its coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS is voluntary and structured much like a workplace.
</P>
<P>
   It's designed for students who otherwise would drop out or zone
out. It is self-paced. Scheduling is flexible, in some cases to
allow a student to hold a job and stay in school. The students may
have family problems, may have their own children, may have medical
or emotional problems that caused them to fall behind, or simply
were bad fits in their high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary aspect is pivotal. Students who are disruptive or
belligerent are gone from OPTIONS. When the bell sounds, you work _
just like on the job. You set goals and you are there to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Some students will return to their home campuses when they catch
up on their academic goals. Many will earn their diplomas at
OPTIONS. Some are there to get their GED.
</P>
<P>
   The program, serving ages 15 to 20, has been successful enough
in its five years that Hanks is hoping to expand the program to
14-year-olds who might be spinning their wheels trying to advance
to high school and also to students who are older but who don't
have the requisite sixth-grade-level academic skills that OPTIONS
requires.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing exotic about OPTIONS. Essentially it's a
one-room school tucked into the former Waco High School building.
</P>
<P>
   Though in its infancy it relied heavily on computer software for
self-paced learning, today it relies most heavily on textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Success in getting underachievers to succeed often hinges on
finding exactly where they stand academically and proceeding from
there.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are students who have high intelligence but lack
the motivation, or who simply can't stand to be in the traditional
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks had a long talk with some of his students about the
Columbine incident and school violence in general. ``They want to
talk and they have opinions,'' he said. He said his students saw
some of themselves in the depictions of the two boys now seen as
evil's archetype.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS is a place where students who felt marginalized on their
home campuses feel more mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is social promotion, whether it's social
alienation, school districts that want to do the right thing will
offer options. Or they'll simply let those at the margins drift off
the edge.

   LOS ANGELES _ Midsummer Night's Dream'' is Shakespeare in love,
but don't let that fool you. While the exuberance and goofiness and
lyrical eloquence of the text remains, director Michael Hoffman's
plodding adaptation suffers from an incoherent vision and a fatal
lack of magic. There are still some wonderful moments and an array
of fine performances, but those elements don't coalesce in a manner
that is meaningful or enchanting.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who also wrote the screenplay, puts this ``Dream'' in
turn-of-the-century Tuscany, where, as the prologue relates, the
good news is that high collars and bustles are disappearing. The
new sensation is the bicycle, which Hoffman uses at every
opportunity to symbolize both the psychological freedoms and
obstacles the film's lovers face. Given the number of antique
bicycle sightings here, you half expect to see Paul Newman's Butch
Cassidy ride through town to the strains of ``Raindrops Keep
Fallin' on My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the golden Tuscany landscapes (Frances Mayes
would be delighted), we meet the four star-crossed lovers, Hermia
(Anna Friel) and Lysander (Dominic West) and Demetrius (Christian
Bale) and Helena (Calista Flockhart). Hermia loves Lysander, but
her father has promised her to Demetrius, much to the chagrin of
Helena, who is passionately devoted to Demetrius. (Shakespeare
would have been a natural ``Melrose Place'' scribe.)
</P>
<P>
   The four find their way to a forest ruled by the fairy king
Oberon (Rupert Everett) and his queen, Titania (a radiant Michelle
Pfeiffer), who are having their own problems with love. Soon Oberon
dispatches his impish prankster, Puck (Stanley Tucci), to deliver
potions that will throw the mortals' world into chaos and
eventually make Titania fall in love with the actor-jackass, Bottom
(Kevin Kline).
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is a narratively
complex work that requires a director skilled enough to weave all
the elements together. Hoffman only partially succeeds. Much of the
problem comes from the pedestrian use of the setting. The dark
forest looks like an outgrowth of Disneyland's jungle safari ride.
Kitschy, yes; enchanting, no. And the fairies sadly call to mind
another Disney creation _ Tinkerbell.
</P>
<P>
   When the squabbling lovers stumble into the woods, the pace
turns leaden. By the time they re-emerge for the concluding
play-within-a-play from Bottom and his talentless troupe, so much
ground has been lost that the movie never quite recovers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Brits fare best with the Bard. Friel and
West make a convincing romantic couple, and Everett's Oberon
registers well. Flockhart and Kline give engaging, broader
performances that at times seem at odds with the film's overall
tone, a fault of the director, not their own. Tucci, though a bit
long in the tooth for Puck, plays the spirit with a winning charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' has been adapted for film twice
before _ Mickey Rooney played Puck in Max Reinhardt's 1935 version,
and the Royal Shakespeare Company (with Judi Dench) weighed in in
1968. It's a tough play to film with all its surreal and
fantastical elements, a challenge Hoffman undoubtedly discovered
when he tackled the project. His ``Dream'' is a credible effort.
Maybe another filmmaker will capture Shakespeare's magic someday.

CHICK FLICK COVERS FAMILIAR GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   1 1/2 stars

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Mascara'' is a nicely made, well-acted
independent film that unfortunately just doesn't have much to say.
Writer-director Linda Kandel, a native Angeleno, has made a
good-looking movie that supports stereotypes about L.A. and about
``chick flicks'' in general.
</P>
<P>
   The film centers around three pretty, upper-middle-class women
living in Los Angeles _ Ione Skye, Lumi Cavazos and Amanda de
Cadenet _ who are all facing problems and transitions in their
lives as they near age 30. One is getting married; one is unhappily
married; one is in a dead-end relationship with an older but
immature man, played quite well by former Sex Pistols guitarist
Steve Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotype No. 1: In chick flicks, men are mostly hateful
losers; women define themselves by their relationships with men,
then kvetch about it. One husband is a philanderer. One is a
philanderer AND a compulsive spender. The boyfriend is a boozy
lecher who lustfully eyes his teen-age daughter's rear end.
</P>
<P>
   The young women talk and obsess about all this for an hour and a
half. The best solution in the end appears to be leaving the men
behind. Pretty depressing, and nothing's really learned.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotype No. 2: Los Angeles is full of navel-gazing,
insulated, beautiful people who lead such cushy lives that they
have to invent problems for themselves. It's not really clear why
the character played by Cavazos (of ``Like Water for Chocolate'')
walks out on her husband of seven months early in the film.
</P>
<P>
   It seems justified later when we find out what a loser he is,
but the excuse she seems to have at the time is that her
``traditional'' parents pressured her to get married. Young, indie
filmmakers should just have a single actress play the social
climbing/pressuring/insensitive mother in all these films, so we'd
get the idea immediately, instead of having to sit through the
tedious, obligatory scene establishing this character. It still
wouldn't solve the problem of the child's character being
spineless.
</P>
<P>
   Cavazos' character announces she's pregnant about three-quarters
of the way through the film. We've known this for a while, since
she keeps throwing up. The final scene has her giving birth,
flanked by her two girlfriends and no men. Yes, sisterhood is
powerful _ but it's hard to feel joyous about another life being
brought into the middle of this messed-up, self-centered trio.
</P>
<P>
   In her ``director's statement,'' second-time director (Kandel's
first feature, ``Naked Jane,'' was _ run for the hills _
``acclaimed at the Sundance Film Festival'') says she wanted to
make a film about ``friends who at times have led empty bourgeois
lives, but don't or can't do it any longer.'' If only that
transformation had been more apparent on the screen.

MUCH ADO ABOUT `ALLY MCBEAL' STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
BY BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The rising debate about violence in the media
hasn't yet taken into account a certain kind of violence the media
perpetrates.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly deadly, of course, but it can still be harmful.
Just ask Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're awfully fickle, those press people,'' chuckles the
star of TV's hit ``Ally McBeal'' series and a new film adaptation
of Shakespeare's fantastical comedy ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
She makes a lot of jokes, in fact, some at her own expense and
others about the absurdly intense media scrutiny of her weight.
</P>
<P>
   But there are serious things to say about her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exploitation of human beings is astonishing,'' says the
actress, 33. ``Yet, you think, why? Is it because we, the public,
want it, we want the gossip? I believe we do, but is it also
because that's what they're feeding us? What came first? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we don't really have one religion that everybody
believes in, so we sort of have these gods of idolatry that we
make, these celebrities,'' she adds. ``And then we want their dirty
laundry. Since we made them gods, we want to humanize them a bit so
they're more like us. Also, it seems all glam and exciting,
celebrity love rumors and affairs, even though it's not even
happening. People can live sort of vicariously through them,
somehow. I know I do!''
</P>
<P>
   Romance rumors about Flockhart have been flying recently. A New
York tabloid reported she was seeing comedian Ben Stiller the same
week a British tab linked her with Sam Mendes, the director of the
recent, acclaimed ``Cabaret'' stage revival. Flockhart wants to
keep her love life private and says that both men are friends.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about possible anorexia _ which the naturally thin,
size-2 actress has been denying since they first surfaced after she
appeared somewhat emaciated at last September's Emmy Awards _ won't
go away. She's addressed the subject in countless magazine articles
and newspaper interviews since then.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Flockhart canceled an appearance on NBC's
``Today'' show when it became apparent that they wanted to harp on
the weight issue, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' her press representative said, not
illogically. Especially when there's so much else worth talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   In only its second season on the Fox Network, ``Ally'' has
become the most discussed show on television and a frequent Nielsen
Top 20 finisher. The wacky lawyers show's outrageous mix of comedy
and courtroom drama, surreal asides and sexually provocative story
lines, poignant character insight and post-feminist incorrectness,
have made it both controversial and adored. It's that rare
television phenomenon that people tune into without ever knowing
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the star-studded ``Midsummer'' movie. It marks
Flockhart's first post-``Ally'' film appearance (she was
prominently featured in ``The Birdcage'' and a few small
independents before the TV show hit). It's also a return to her
beloved Shakespeare; the Rutgers-trained actress has played Juliet,
``King Lear's'' Cordelia and ``Much Ado About Nothing's'' Hero on
stage, not to mention classic heroines from Chekhov, Inge and
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Flockhart plays Helena, a lovelorn woman who gets
embroiled in a bizarre love quadrangle with three other young
lovers one night in a fairy-infested woods. English actors Anna
Friel, Christian Bale and Dominic West play the befuddled fellow
romantics Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander.
</P>
<P>
   In other frolics, Kevin Kline plays the ham actor Bottom,
Michelle Pfeiffer (who is married to Flockhart's boss, ``Ally''
creator David E. Kelley) is the fairy queen Titania, ``My Best
Friend's Wedding's'' Rupert Everett plays the resentful fairy king
Oberon, and Stanley Tucci is his trouble-making trickster, Puck.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Italy 100 years ago, the movie was filmed on Roman
soundstages and in the Tuscan countryside. For Flockhart _ who grew
up in various Midwest and Northeastern locales and has spent most
of her adult life in New York City _ one of her few trips outside
of the country was a great break from ``Ally's'' demanding taping
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Italy for six, maybe seven weeks,'' she recalls
fondly. ``I had never been there before, and I especially loved
Rome. I walked miles and miles, just got lost among all the street
life, did all of the sightseeing, loved the cafes and restaurants
and people and the chaos. I'd just moved out to L.A. and I was very
homesick for New York, and it was reminiscent of that for me, I
felt back in the city. And Tuscany was just so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't entirely a joyful indulgence of Italian landscapes and
Elizabethan verse, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the corsets were fine, unless you wear them 18 hours a
day,'' she says of her otherwise exquisite, Victorian-era costumes.
``Corsets are tight; it doesn't matter what size you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart admits that Shakespeare's Helena and TV's Ally share
certain characteristics, like a love that drives them to absolute
distraction. Still, she's not too concerned about people confusing
the two characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare didn't know about Ally McBeal,'' she notes. ``I
would say that he wrote a theme that we all identify with. People
get fixated, and people fall in love and, maybe, become obsessed
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was thinking in terms of both characters, I don't think
that Ally would ever go quite as far as Helena does. But through
`Ally McBeal' permeates a playfulness, and I think that `A
Midsummer Night's Dream' is very playful. They're both about things
that get kind of frivolous, but it's always anchored in real human
emotion. That description could apply to almost anything that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Midsummer'' adapter and director Michael Hoffman hadn't seen
``Ally'' at all when he cast Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew her from the theater,'' Hoffman says. ``I didn't
understand that I'd cast this television megastar. To me, it was
the way she ascribes to the archetype of the waif, the orphan.
Somehow, she's this frail thing with this great spirit inside of
her. For Helena, that was so fantastic, because she's not really a
victim, however much she may seem like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else she is, Ally is no victim. She's been known to
kiss one of her married law partners _ and get into catfights with
his wife, who also works at the firm. Judges have thrown her out of
their courts for wearing her skirts too short. And her
self-revealing dialogue is sometimes so raunchy that it sparks
national debate, despite not being printable in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said that women aren't like that, and they take
offense to it,'' Flockhart acknowledges. ``Yet I always say that
this is not representing all women. This is one woman, this is how
Ally McBeal behaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, even Flockhart is taken aback by that
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, things will come up that make me go, `Oh great,
David, get me into trouble again. The tabloids are gonna run with
this one,''' she reveals. ``But I can't really say that Ally would
never do this because she would, and that's what David wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all just have so much fun,'' she adds. ``And I hope
we're broadening the boundaries of TV a little bit. It seems to me
that David Kelley has raised the bar, and it's going to end up
challenging people to write great television.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart herself says she shares neither Ally's nor Helena's
mating obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not preoccupied with it, I'm not panicked about it,'' she
says. ``I just feel that it will happen if it's supposed to happen,
and it will happen in good time. But I'm so busy now, it's just not
what I'm focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   She's happy enough in her new L.A. home with her dog of many
years, a stray named Webster that a former New York roommate
rescued from a dumpster. She's learned to love what L.A. has to
offer: hiking trails, world-class museums and mega-bookstores
where, she says, she's still able to browse and read for hours
without being disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do come up to me, but they're so nice that it
makes me feel very nice,'' she says. ``Nothing particularly
invasive or cruel or weird. It's tranquil.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a nice contrast, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I took it personally a bit,'' she says of the press
panic. ``I was shocked, I couldn't believe it. What happens is
that, once one has the story, they all want the story. You're just
a victim of that machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then something happened to me. I don't know how to explain
it or what happened, but I just turned around and really ignored it
and maintained my sense of humor about it. I realized it has
nothing to do with me and it was out of my control. It's gonna have
to go away at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it doesn't, Calista Flockhart seems to have more
than enough self-awareness to keep it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story that made me laugh the most was the one that said my
dog was also an anorexic,'' she says with a hearty laugh. ``Now
that is so clever, you have to admit.'' &QL;

Thomas Dyer in a new book, ``Secret Yankees,'' just published by
Johns Hopkins University and getting some national attention.
Yanks'd been here for years, and actively helped the Union. It's
taken two decades of research, starting with an old diary in the
UGA archives, but Dyer's found that Atlanta was crawling with Union
sympathizers and spies. Historians praise the scholarship because
it took a dogged investigation to find out that Atlanta's
population wasn't as unified as Gone With The Wind has led most
folks to believe. (Hendrick, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

TAKE-OUT CONTAINERS POSE DANGER WHEN REHEATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STEVENS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Recycling and reusing are good for the
environment, but those old margarine tubs you keep using to reheat
leftovers are bad for your health. So are the plastic bowls from
the take-out won-ton soup, and the polystyrene box that held the
chicken wings from yesterday's lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Those containers are fine for the food that was originally
packaged in them, but shouldn't be used for any other purpose,
according to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic wrap, foam meat trays, convenience food dishes and egg
cartons have been approved for one-time use and one-time use only,
Bessie Berry of the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline says. They have
not been tested or approved for any other use, including cooking,
Berry says.
</P>
<P>
   They can't take the heat, so get them out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Berry says consumers misuse containers and wraps, which can
contaminate food when heated. Worse yet, the food doesn't have to
come in direct contact with the material to be contaminated. For
example, plastic wrap used to cover a dish for reheating in the
microwave can melt onto the food. Also, excessive heat applied to a
closed container can cause chemical gases to contaminate the food,
according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   Microwave food in the package it came in only if the package
says it's microwave safe, and then only use it once, advises the
Food Safety and Inspection Service. Don't let the plastic wrap
touch the food, and do not reuse the wrap. Foam meat trays and
other plastics should not be used in the microwave oven because
they are not heat-stable. To be safe, remove the meat from its
packaging before cooking or defrosting in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic packaging materials also should not be used in
conventional ovens. They can catch on fire or melt, causing
chemical contamination of the food. Sometimes these plastics are
inadvertently cooked with a product. For instance, giblets might
accidently get cooked inside a turkey or the absorbent pad from a
pork roast might end up in the oven. If this happens and the
packaging materials do not melt or come apart, the cooked meat will
not pose an imminent health hazard, the Food Safety and Inspection
Service says. But if the packaging does become altered, either
melted or changes shape in any way, do not eat the food.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of wraps and containers can you use in on your
stove, in your microwave and conventional oven? _ Boil-in-bags: A
sealed container made of heat-resistant material that holds food
and allows the bag to reach boiling temperature. Rice, frozen
entrees and some vegetables are packaged in these bags.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oven cooking bags: Both the bags and their closure ties are
made from heat-resistant nylon. They can be used in a microwave or
conventional oven set no higher than 400.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parchment paper: An odorless, tasteless paper made from cotton
fiber and pure chemical wood pulps. The parchment may be waxed or
coated and is greaseproof or grease-resistant. Parchment paper is
primarily used in baking and as a pan liner or to wrap foods in for
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wax paper: A triple-waxed tissue paper; made with a food-safe
paraffin wax that is forced into the pores of the paper and spread
over the outside as a coating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microwavable containers: Make sure the plasticware says
microwave-safe or microwave heat-resistant. If you're not sure, do
not use it to microwave.

<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Americans -- at least those who own stock -- have not only
endorsed the infallibility of the markets, they have also endorsed
the infallibility of the people who watch over those markets.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was long ago elevated to
divinity.
</P>
<P>
   And Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who announced his
resignation Wednesday, has joined Greenspan in the pantheon of
Money Gods. (There are no atheists in bull markets.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, but especially since rumors of his
departure began circulating this spring, Rubin has been bathing in
media slobber. He has been credited with eliminating the deficit,
captaining the U.S. economy through seven fat years, vanquishing
the Asian financial crisis, transmuting base metals into golds, and
generally doing eight impossible things before breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rubin deserve this sanctification? Is there, in fact,
ANYTHING wrong with Bob?
</P>
<P>
   As with Greenspan, Rubin's godliness rests on a foundation of
genuine accomplishment. In 1993, Rubin was one of several Clinton
advisers who urged deficit reduction rather than economic stimulus.
This tightfistedness set the table for the current boom, leading to
low interest rates, job growth, the Wall Street explosion, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rubin's cautious advice has helped ensure that the
administration did nothing to screw up the prosperity. Rubin
lobbied for NAFTA and GATT.
</P>
<P>
   His friendly relations with Greenspan -- a dramatic contrast to
the Bush administration's squabbling with the Fed -- has soothed
bankers and investors. His deft manipulation of the debt ceiling
during the 1995-96 government shutdown prevented a U.S. default and
guaranteed that the political war between the president and the
Republican Congress would not derail the thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as a conservative Wall Street veteran in a White House of
Democratic political operatives, Rubin brought market credibility
to the Clinton administration, reassuring the New York money folks
that Washington would not go loopy on them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling evidence of Rubin's accomplishment
may be, perversely, Wall Street's yawn at his resignation. The Dow
dropped more than 200 points on the news, then gained most of it
back within the hour. This is testament to Wall Street's faith that
Rubin has been so successful that the White House won't dare change
his pro-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's deification is not simply the result of having done
a good job. Who HASN'T done a good job during the past few years?
</P>
<P>
   His reputation depends on style as much as substance. In a
Republican administration, Rubin would be another gray suit,
another dull rich guy moonlighting as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has been blessed with a boss and colleagues who make
him look good by comparison. Clinton is emotional, loud, chaotic,
horny, and enveloped by Monica sleaze. Rubin is ascetic,
controlled, rational, quiet, and untouched by any of the zillion
Clinton scandals. During Flytrap and since, Rubin's chilliness has
been a welcome adult relief from the childish president.
</P>
<P>
   In a more democratic Democratic administration, Rubin's wealth
-- estimated at $125 million or more -- would have made him
suspect. But among the Clintonians, it has burnished him. He seems
the Cincinnatus of Washington: Unlike the political types around
him, he has proved himself in another arena.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need the power and prestige of Washington and feels
no compulsion to claw his way up. This is rare among D.C. pols.
Having been assigned the role of the Amateur Politician, Rubin
seems pure next to the sleazy pros. (He is not, of course, an
amateur.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's work on Social Security reform has demonstrated his
comfort with the everyday politics of compromise and spin. Rubin is
skeptical about government investment of Social Security funds in
private markets and fought it during the administration's internal
debates. The president's plan endorses massive government
investment in Wall Street. Rubin, a loyal soldier, has emerged as
one of the administration's top spokesmen for the plan and doesn't
talk about his objections to it.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has another rare quality. He does not seek press coverage,
and when he is covered, he speaks with blandness in order not to
make news.
</P>
<P>
   This silence impresses those who cover him: Compare the media's
worshipful treatment of Rubin with its scorn of publicity-seekers
such as Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo or Treasury
Secretary-designate Larry Summers, Rubin's longtime deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's reticence, as well as his praise of underlings and
colleagues, has earned him an enormous, though not fully deserved,
reputation for humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This humility stuff is nonsense,'' says a former White House
colleague of Rubin's. ``He does not need to elbow others out of the
way and brag, but it's not because he's humble. It's because he is
totally confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin subtly enhances his own reputation for perfection by
talking frequently about his imperfections. In interviews, he
repeatedly emphasizes the uncertainty of his job. He describes to
reporters how he focuses on weighing and reweighing percentages
until he makes the best possible decision in ambiguous
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine way to make decisions, as Rubin has proved, but
it is an equally good way to protect your image. If a decision
turns out well, it's because you calculated it would. If it turns
out badly, it's not your fault: You made the most rational choice
you could.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin agnostics will be glad to learn that there are two weak
spots in his record. He arrived in Washington as a supposed
champion of the poor. He was expected to use his position as head
of the National Economic Council and later as treasury secretary to
redirect federal resources toward inner cities and the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's cautiousness has got the better of him. Although he
strongly disagreed with the welfare reform bill, he didn't battle
hard to prevent Clinton from signing it. And instead of lobbying
for large-scale anti-poverty or urban revival programs, Rubin
settled for mini-government: small efforts to prod banks to extend
credit in troubled neighborhoods, micro-loan programs to encourage
entrepreneurship among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Rubin's defense, his stewardship of the economy has done more
to help the poor than any federal grant program could have.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary has also been excessively obeisant to Wall Street.
Though Rubin has bucked Wall Street by opposing a capital-gains tax
cut, he comes from Wall Street, and most of his closest friends and
advisers are Wall Streeters, and he generally heeds the street.
</P>
<P>
   During the global financial crisis, Rubin has halfheartedly
warned Americans not to invest cavalierly in weak foreign
economies, but anytime foolhardy American investors have been
threatened, Rubin has rushed to save them. During the Asia, Russia,
and Brazil crises, Rubin constructed bailout deals that benefited
outside creditors above all.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was not trying to help Wall Street. According to
Rubin's logic, safeguarding investors in these troubled economies
prevents contagion from spreading. If American investors thought
they were going to lose the billions they had unwisely put in
Korea, they might pull out of Latin America, Eastern Europe, or the
rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists, especially non-Americans, complain that
Rubin has been far too obliging toward his old colleagues and
indifferent to the poor Russians and bankrupted Koreans damaged by
his decisions. (After all, when Wall Streeters say today that the
Asia crisis is ``over,'' what they mean is that American exposure
is over. The economies of Asia are still a mess.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's relief for Americans has encouraged a moral hazard -- an
inducement for people to speculate excessively because they know
the United States will rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory capture of Rubin by Wall Street has not only
benefited Wall Street, it has also polished Rubin's reputation.
When Rubin makes decisions that aid Wall Street, analysts and
traders reciprocate in the financial media, telling CNBC, The Wall
Street Journal, Bloomberg, et al., just how wise the good secretary
is.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin himself probably does not care about such back scratching,
but it is a lesson that heir-apparent Summers, an eager press
hound, has surely absorbed. Be nice to Wall Street, and perhaps you
can be a money god, too.

</P>
<P>
   Americans -- at least those who own stock -- have not only
endorsed the infallibility of the markets, they have also endorsed
the infallibility of the people who watch over those markets.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was long ago elevated to
divinity.
</P>
<P>
   And Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who announced his
resignation Wednesday, has joined Greenspan in the pantheon of
Money Gods. (There are no atheists in bull markets.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, but especially since rumors of his
departure began circulating this spring, Rubin has been bathing in
media slobber. He has been credited with eliminating the deficit,
captaining the U.S. economy through seven fat years, vanquishing
the Asian financial crisis, transmuting base metals into golds, and
generally doing eight impossible things before breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rubin deserve this sanctification? Is there, in fact,
ANYTHING wrong with Bob?
</P>
<P>
   As with Greenspan, Rubin's godliness rests on a foundation of
genuine accomplishment. In 1993, Rubin was one of several Clinton
advisers who urged deficit reduction rather than economic stimulus.
This tightfistedness set the table for the current boom, leading to
low interest rates, job growth, the Wall Street explosion, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rubin's cautious advice has helped ensure that the
administration did nothing to screw up the prosperity. Rubin
lobbied for NAFTA and GATT.
</P>
<P>
   His friendly relations with Greenspan -- a dramatic contrast to
the Bush administration's squabbling with the Fed -- has soothed
bankers and investors. His deft manipulation of the debt ceiling
during the 1995-96 government shutdown prevented a U.S. default and
guaranteed that the political war between the president and the
Republican Congress would not derail the thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as a conservative Wall Street veteran in a White House of
Democratic political operatives, Rubin brought market credibility
to the Clinton administration, reassuring the New York money folks
that Washington would not go loopy on them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling evidence of Rubin's accomplishment
may be, perversely, Wall Street's yawn at his resignation. The Dow
dropped more than 200 points on the news, then gained most of it
back within the hour. This is testament to Wall Street's faith that
Rubin has been so successful that the White House won't dare change
his pro-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's deification is not simply the result of having done
a good job. Who HASN'T done a good job during the past few years?
</P>
<P>
   His reputation depends on style as much as substance. In a
Republican administration, Rubin would be another gray suit,
another dull rich guy moonlighting as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has been blessed with a boss and colleagues who make
him look good by comparison. Clinton is emotional, loud, chaotic,
horny, and enveloped by Monica sleaze. Rubin is ascetic,
controlled, rational, quiet, and untouched by any of the zillion
Clinton scandals. During Flytrap and since, Rubin's chilliness has
been a welcome adult relief from the childish president.
</P>
<P>
   In a more democratic Democratic administration, Rubin's wealth
-- estimated at $125 million or more -- would have made him
suspect. But among the Clintonians, it has burnished him. He seems
the Cincinnatus of Washington: Unlike the political types around
him, he has proved himself in another arena.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need the power and prestige of Washington and feels
no compulsion to claw his way up. This is rare among D.C. pols.
Having been assigned the role of the Amateur Politician, Rubin
seems pure next to the sleazy pros. (He is not, of course, an
amateur.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's work on Social Security reform has demonstrated his
comfort with the everyday politics of compromise and spin. Rubin is
skeptical about government investment of Social Security funds in
private markets and fought it during the administration's internal
debates. The president's plan endorses massive government
investment in Wall Street. Rubin, a loyal soldier, has emerged as
one of the administration's top spokesmen for the plan and doesn't
talk about his objections to it.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has another rare quality. He does not seek press coverage,
and when he is covered, he speaks with blandness in order not to
make news.
</P>
<P>
   This silence impresses those who cover him: Compare the media's
worshipful treatment of Rubin with its scorn of publicity-seekers
such as Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo or Treasury
Secretary-designate Larry Summers, Rubin's longtime deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's reticence, as well as his praise of underlings and
colleagues, has earned him an enormous, though not fully deserved,
reputation for humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This humility stuff is nonsense,'' says a former White House
colleague of Rubin's. ``He does not need to elbow others out of the
way and brag, but it's not because he's humble. It's because he is
totally confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin subtly enhances his own reputation for perfection by
talking frequently about his imperfections. In interviews, he
repeatedly emphasizes the uncertainty of his job. He describes to
reporters how he focuses on weighing and reweighing percentages
until he makes the best possible decision in ambiguous
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine way to make decisions, as Rubin has proved, but
it is an equally good way to protect your image. If a decision
turns out well, it's because you calculated it would. If it turns
out badly, it's not your fault: You made the most rational choice
you could.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin agnostics will be glad to learn that there are two weak
spots in his record. He arrived in Washington as a supposed
champion of the poor. He was expected to use his position as head
of the National Economic Council and later as treasury secretary to
redirect federal resources toward inner cities and the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's cautiousness has got the better of him. Although he
strongly disagreed with the welfare reform bill, he didn't battle
hard to prevent Clinton from signing it. And instead of lobbying
for large-scale anti-poverty or urban revival programs, Rubin
settled for mini-government: small efforts to prod banks to extend
credit in troubled neighborhoods, micro-loan programs to encourage
entrepreneurship among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Rubin's defense, his stewardship of the economy has done more
to help the poor than any federal grant program could have.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary has also been excessively obeisant to Wall Street.
Though Rubin has bucked Wall Street by opposing a capital-gains tax
cut, he comes from Wall Street, and most of his closest friends and
advisers are Wall Streeters, and he generally heeds the street.
</P>
<P>
   During the global financial crisis, Rubin has halfheartedly
warned Americans not to invest cavalierly in weak foreign
economies, but anytime foolhardy American investors have been
threatened, Rubin has rushed to save them. During the Asia, Russia,
and Brazil crises, Rubin constructed bailout deals that benefited
outside creditors above all.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was not trying to help Wall Street. According to
Rubin's logic, safeguarding investors in these troubled economies
prevents contagion from spreading. If American investors thought
they were going to lose the billions they had unwisely put in
Korea, they might pull out of Latin America, Eastern Europe, or the
rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists, especially non-Americans, complain that
Rubin has been far too obliging toward his old colleagues and
indifferent to the poor Russians and bankrupted Koreans damaged by
his decisions. (After all, when Wall Streeters say today that the
Asia crisis is ``over,'' what they mean is that American exposure
is over. The economies of Asia are still a mess.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's relief for Americans has encouraged a moral hazard -- an
inducement for people to speculate excessively because they know
the United States will rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory capture of Rubin by Wall Street has not only
benefited Wall Street, it has also polished Rubin's reputation.
When Rubin makes decisions that aid Wall Street, analysts and
traders reciprocate in the financial media, telling CNBC, The Wall
Street Journal, Bloomberg, et al., just how wise the good secretary
is.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin himself probably does not care about such back scratching,
but it is a lesson that heir-apparent Summers, an eager press
hound, has surely absorbed. Be nice to Wall Street, and perhaps you
can be a money god, too.

HORSE'S OWNER IS CHARISMATIC, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ At first, it appears he's just too nice. Too
charming, too gracious, too humble. This is the 1990s, and it seems
anyone who acts overly friendly turns out to be a fraud running
some sort of scam. But the more you talk to Bob Lewis, who, along
with his wife, Beverly, owns Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic, the
more you believe he is genuine. It is simply impossible to dislike
the man.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, on Lewis's 75th birthday, he stood near the stakes
barn at Pimlico, where the 124th Preakness will be run Saturday,
and accepted congratulations, while revealing that he knows a
little more about horse racing than most, and a lot more about
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine being this age and having this much fun?''
said Lewis, who survived a heart attack in 1972 and recovered from
subsequent bypass surgery. ``It's just been bubbling over, and it's
really incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob met Beverly when both were students at the University of
Oregon, and they were married in 1947. Their horses run in the
green and yellow of the Oregon Ducks. Bob, whose parents took him
to the races at Santa Anita as a tyke in 1934, made his money as a
beer distributor. The Lewises have been successful almost from the
time they started investing in thoroughbreds in 1990, and last year
their horses, who are trained primarily by D. Wayne Lukas and Bob
Baffert, earned $5.7 million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wayne and I put Charismatic in that $62,500 claimer (at
Santa Anita Feb. 11), I would have been delighted if he had been
claimed,'' said Lewis. ``I never told Wayne that, but I make no
bones about it. I'd have salvaged $62,500 from the $200,000 I paid
for him. I know that's poor business economics, but Charismatic
loves to eat. He's a glutton and he was eating me out of house and
home. We have 90-plus horses, with 55-60 in training, and finishing
third and fourth doesn't pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in thoroughbred racing could this happen. It just
happened overnight. All of a sudden, a claimer can blossom, and
here we are on hand for another Preakness.'' Silver Charm, owned by
the Lewises and trained by Baffert, won the Derby and Preakness in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The collective egos of Baffert and Lukas wouldn't fit in the
Grand Canyon, yet Lewis deftly manages the two highest profile
trainers in the game. ``My approach was developed by lifelong
experience with business,'' said Lewis. ``You employ people. If
they prove they can do the job, you give them the ball and let them
run with it. We don't interface between the two trainers. We don't
carry communications from one to the other. If you don't honor
their confidences, you hurt your chances. One of the problems
owners have in this business is that they get on a winning streak,
and, all of a sudden, they know more than the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let the trainers call the shots, and we run along behind
them and spend the money. We've had good counsel, and it's just
come together for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious Lewis knows how to delegate authority. But Lukas
will tell you there's much more to him as a horse owner than that.
``There aren't many Lewises in this sport,'' said Lukas. ``He's a
higher echelon owner. You don't often find people of this caliber
in racing. The way they handle themselves, accepting the ups and
downs, they represent the game so well. They represent me and Bob
well. They're very understanding, win or lose. They are
appreciative of their trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stepped up to the plate. They didn't get here by
winning the lottery. Bob started as a beer salesman and he's worked
hard. I'll tell you, he's got guts. He's big in the sales ring.
He'll go for $1 million, $1.2 million, $1.5 million. He doesn't
lack the courage of his convictions and he really backs you up. If
I say there's one I want, he won't stop until we get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is also very active in charity work, is racing's
greatest goodwill ambassador, greeting everyone on a first-name
basis, with a warm smile and a firm handshake. But it's also
obvious he comes to play. Charismatic beat Cat Thief, who is
trained by Lukas but owned by W.T. Young of Overbrook Farm, by less
than a length in the Derby, and Lukas is sending Cat Thief out in
the Preakness. It is possible Cat Thief could cost Charismatic not
only the Preakness but the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat Thief is a meaningful threat, and Baffert has the two
fillies (Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting),'' said Lewis.
``It's just like the beer business, it's competitive as all get
out. But it's part of this great sport we participate in. I'm
confident, I think we have a hell of a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lewis could probably sell just about anything to just about
anybody. And you'd be happy to buy it.

RETHINKING RADIATION AFTER A BREAST SURGERY  
 OF DIET AND FOLATE LEVELS: FORTIFICATION IS PAYING OFF  
 GAINS IN ANXIETY BATTLE, TESTING FOR COLON CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 Rethinking radiation after a breast surgery
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women who undergo localized breast surgery for the removal of a
common early-stage cancer condition can have their need for
follow-up radiation eliminated if surgeons remove an extra
centimeter of tissue around the lumps, a new study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The study involves ductal carcinoma in situ, abnormal cell
growths inside milk ducts. DCIS comprises a quarter to a third of
the 180,000 new US breast cancer cases detected each year. Medical
authorities long have debated the health and lifestyle merits of
wider tissue removal versus breast conservation. About half of
later breast cancers in women who have had DCIS removed are
invasive, metastatic forms.
</P>
<P>
   In the current New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Melvin J.
Silverstein of the University of Southern California School of
Medicine and colleagues (including Dr. Bernard S. Lewinsky,
Monica's father, who is an oncologist) report on 469 women with the
cancer who were treated at two California facilities between 1972
and February 1998. Just under half of them had no follow-up
radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Among women whose lumps were removed with a one-centimeter
margin of tissue (10 millimeters or just over a third of an inch),
more than 97 percent had no recurrence of cancer, and radiation
therapy did not lower recurrence rates. Silverstein's study found
radiation therapy benefited only women who had one millimeter or
less of extra tissue removed around the DCIS.
</P>
<P>
   For women facing a DCIS removal surgery, the findings suggest a
trade-off: Having more tissue removed might alter or disfigure the
breast but eliminate or delay the need for what is normally 30 days
of fatiguing, follow-up radiation treatment. Deferring radiation
has another benefit. Standard US practice is to resort to
mastectomy if a first round of radiation fails to keep cancer away,
but women who had DCIS removal and then got breast cancer could try
radiation before needing a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Carolyn Kaelin, director of the Comprehensive
Breast Health Center at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital,
noted that Silverstein's pathologists used a meticulous way of
measuring how much tissue was removed around the DCIS lump. Their
approach may be too expensive for health plans or hospitals to
support its wide use in advising women whether enough tissue was
removed to justify no radiation. Kaelin said she would encourage
women who choose extra tissue removal in DCIS operations to decline
later radiation only if they were being ``closely followed'' with
semiannual breast examinations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Of diet and folate levels: fortification is paying off
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US government's two-year-old program to require grain-based
products to be enriched with folate, a form of folic acid, is
showing ``substantial improvements'' in people's levels of the
substance, according to another study in the current New England
Journal of Medicine. For women of childbearing age, consuming
adequate folate from food or supplements sharply reduces the risk
of having a baby with spina bifida or a neural tube birth defect,
and it may reduce all people's risk of stroke and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Tufts University, the Framingham Heart Study,
and Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island followed 1,100 children of
participants in the heart study, comparing blood folate levels from
groups of people seen before grain fortification was required and
after. Overall, average blood folate levels more than doubled after
the change. The percentage of people with low folate concentrations
plunged from 22 percent before to 1.7 percent later. The age of
study participants averaged 55, but the researchers have ``no
reason to believe'' folate fortification is not yielding the same
benefits for women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Gains in anxiety battle, testing for colon cancer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators this week have approved use of Paxil, a
common treatment for depression and panic disorder, for social
anxiety disorder, a debilitating condition. . . . Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center researchers led by Dr. Martina Morrin
report promising results testing a new kind of colon exam that uses
injections of air followed by a CT scan to find possibly cancerous
polyps. Traditional exams use enemas or endoscope insertions. . . .
Eating a Mediterranean-style diet rich in monounsaturated fatty
acids can help prevent memory loss and cognitive slippage in later
life, according to a study in this month's journal Neurology. It
followed 278 Italians who got on average 15 percent of their daily
calories from olive oil, a prime source of the fatty acids.

<P>
   BENITO JUAREZ, Mexico _ Scorched pines appear to scream against
the sky here, the victims of devastating fires that swept through
Mexico last year and sent plumes of smoke wafting into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican forestry experts say parts of the Chimalapas wilderness
in southern Oaxaca and Chiapas states -- which includes Mexico's
last virgin jungle and cloud forest -- were left in ashes and will
need a century or two to grow back.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than forest fires that threaten one of the world's
most biologically diverse landscapes, where pine-studded mountains
blend into lowland jungle and misty cloud forest so rugged it has
never been fully explored.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts to teach other ways of farming have begun,
many peasants in the Chimalapas this spring are continuing to use
slash-and-burn farming to prepare fields for planting and make way
for cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The centuries-old practice of setting fire to land is killing
off life in once lush valleys and slopes of the Chimalapas. Because
Mexico's National Ecological Institute estimates that more than 95
percent of the country's original tropical and rain forests(CQ)
have been decimated since the Spanish nearly 500 years ago, the
Chimalapas is a precious survivor dear to conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   The forest, which occupies much of Mexico's Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, is home to plants that grow nowhere else on the planet
and endangered animals like jaguars and the green-plumed quetzal
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Slash-and-burn farming was blamed for sparking many of last
year's fires, along with fires set by squatters clearing land for
cattle pastures and narcotics traffickers carving out space to
plant marijuana or opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal logging continues to claim threatened cedar and mahogany
in the Chimalapas. And squatters continue to encroach on lands
belonging to the native Zoque (pronounced, ``So-kay'') Indians
sparking violent clashes over land ownership the government has so
far failed to address.
</P>
<P>
   After the fires last year, a presidential decree was issued to
prevent charred forest from being colonized. But the World Wildlife
Fund and Zoque natives here fear the decree is being ignored --
easy enough in a region so remote and wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man's only limits to moving in are his own,'' said Domingo
Jimenez, a Zoque Indian with a third-grade education who fought
fires last year and is a passionate environmentalist, organic
farmer and foe of slash-and-burn agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Casteneda of the World Wildlife Fund in Oaxaca said the
organization has already received reports of people moving into
fire-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF collaborated with the Mexican government on a post-fire
study that estimated that at least 35 percent of the vast
Chimalapas forest -- which is more than 1.4 million acres -- was
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated four percent of the damaged area was completely
incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the WWF and the government agree that most remote
sections of the jungle terrain are too sensitive to be reforested
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of acres of jungle teems with as many as 400 species of
flora or fauna and reforestation would probably upset that delicate
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the diversity is so great that if people don't enter
the forest to use the land or raise cattle on it then it has a
greater chance of recovering,'' Casteneda said. ``But in no less
than 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wendt, a University of Texas at Austin botanist who began
exploring the Chimalapas in the late 1970s, said keeping people out
is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fires were devastating,'' he said. ``But the real problem
is what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Squatters have been picking at the edges of the Chimalapas for
decades, eroding pines by repeated burnings and moving further into
the heart of the forest, where only a handful of communities are
legally entitled to own land.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are worried that a highway under construction
on the forest's northern border with Veracruz will cut through the
jungle and create more pressure to open up it up for exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxacan government officials are considering making the
Chimalapas a protected biological reserve. But they've run into
resistance from the Zoque, who fear outsiders will end up
exploiting the forest, not protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a writer and one of Mexico's most outspoken
environmentalists, says the Zoque have a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in Mexico is that laws protecting biological
reserves are constantly being violated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez agrees, and believes the Zoque should be made stewards
of a reserve. ``We know the valuable resource we have and we know
we're capable of taking care of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old farmer lives in Benito Juarez, a hamlet of
wooden huts with no electricity that's three hours into the
Chimalapas by car and 40 miles from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bone-crunching drive with rivers to ford and narrow
twists that drop off into mist-filled canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Peaks topped by cloud forest soar above pines covered in
epiphytes and flocks of parrots circle in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez knows the Chimalapas as well as anyone, and last year he
walked through smoke and flames into the jungle to cut landing
zones for firefighters dropped in by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The carbonized remains of pines and other trees disturb the
beauty of the landscape along the road to Benito Juarez. But the
most devastated areas -- where 200- and 300-year-old trees were
killed -- are at least a six-hour hike into the jungle, Jimenez
said.
</P>
<P>
   When smoke from the Chimalapas fires and others in Mexico wafted
across the Gulf of Mexico in May 1998, communities in Texas were
forced to declare environmental alerts. After diplomatic haggling,
Mexico finally asked for help and a team of U.S. firefighting
experts arrived in the Chimalapas to offer technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spent $7.6 million in aid, especially for the
rental of special airplanes to help douse flames that hop-scotched
through the jungle. Never before, natives said, had the moist cloud
forest been consumed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico's spring rains were late last year, the jungle
was drier and vulnerable to sparks from controlled fires that
leaped out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and other farmers who harbor a deep distrust for the
government also believe arsonists set fires to help open the way
for the government's large highway project.
</P>
<P>
   This year rain has already moistened the Chimalapas, squelching
fear of a similar catastrophe, said Oscar Sedeno, director of
forestry for Mexico's environmental ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Although slash-and-burn farming has not been prohibited, Sedeno
said, federal officials are offering workshops on how farmers can
turn the remains of corn stalks and other crops into mulch rather
than burning their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who belongs to an environmental group in Oaxaca called
Maderas del Pueblo, or Forests for the People, is way ahead of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Maderas del Pueblo, he's been leading a revolution
among villagers by teaching organic farming methods.
</P>
<P>
   He's been slashing and plowing under crop remains for five
years, fertilizing his land with compost he makes instead of
relying on ash from burnings. He mixes insecticides from the same
herbs he uses as medicinal teas and poultices.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 80 families in Benito Juarez have been converted to
organic farming, especially after they saw Jimenez's crop yields
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to just strike a match and walk away,''
Jimenez said. ``It's almost double the work to plow the field
under. But it pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The village of Benito Juarez and neighboring villages of outside
colonizers live in an uneasy truce. But Jimenez says many outsiders
aren't interested in protecting the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over control of the Chimalapas go back to colonial times,
when Jimenez's ancestors were forced to buy back their land from
the Spanish, giving birth to the name, ``Chimalapas,'' which means
``gourd full of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the road to Benito Juarez, Jimenez surveys fresh ash
covering a hillside that a colonizer has burned for several years
each spring so new grass will grow as pasture land.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day nothing will grow here, not grass, not trees,''
Jimenez said. ``There are alternatives to this, but it's hard to
break with tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires set by other farmers were crackling along the road, some
smoldering unattended -- a violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Juarez resident Miguel Maya turned over the names of two
offenders of the law to authorities this month and is waiting to
hear the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should get jail,'' he said. ``The people who burn the
forest endanger the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maya joined one of the new fire brigades Mexico's environmental
ministry established this year to patrol Mexican forests at risk.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chimalapas still doesn't have sufficient look-out
towers, but at least the brigades are better equipped than last
year, when kerchief-clad peasants tried to fight fires by swatting
at flames with branches.
</P>
<P>
   Sedeno said the country has tried to improve its firefighting
capability over the last year with more training, radio
communication systems and public information campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This month U.S. Forest Service employees paid a follow-up visit
to talk about safety in areas where firefighter fatalities
occurred, Sedeno said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has established a system for offering quick
financial and technical support again if Mexico requests it, said a
spokesperson at the United States Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico was severely criticized at home and in the
United States for not requesting aid sooner from the United States
to extinguish the fires, some of the worst this century.

   MAP INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Benito Juarez, Oaxaca is a village inside the Chimalapas forest,
which occupies half of Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
</P>
<P>
   For big picture purposes, Benito Juarez is about 254 miles
southeast of the capital city of Oaxaca and about 40 miles north of
the small city of Zanatepec, which is on Highway 190 on the
southern half of the Isthmus. Zanatepec is 53 miles east of the
city of Juchitan, a relatively large city also on Mexico's Highway
190.
</P>
<P>
   The Chimalapas forest is a massive area of some 1,467,180 acres.
Its western border is, roughly, Mexico's Highway 185 and its
southern border is Highway 190. To the west, the forest extends
into Chiapas almost to the city of Cintalapa and north to the
reservoir Netzahualcoyotl. The northern border of the forest is the
state of Veracruz.

A DISPLAY OF EXCESS IN `PHANTOM MENACE' COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time magazine has already devoted a cover story to ``Episode I _
The Phantom Menace,'' replete with ``exclusive pictures'' and an
interview with filmmaker George Lucas. Entertainment Weekly
produced its own cover treatment, hyping ``ten pages of exclusive
photos.'' It's been celebrated on the pages of Vanity Fair, Wired,
and even Popular Mechanics. A computer search _ just for the period
from May 3 to May 11 _ unearthed almost 600 stories on the ``Star
Wars'' phenomenon. Variety film reporter Oliver Jones calls it
``the most hyped movie in the history of movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this mind-boggling, stage-managed, pre-event
publicity, the decision of three newspapers to publish reviews last
weekend before the film's May 19 opening has provoked cries of
jounalistic skulduggery from 20th Century-Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all lived for the last 20 years with trust in each
other,'' says Fox Domestic Film Group chairman Tom Sherak,
referring to the unwritten agreement between studios and newspapers
that films will not be reviewed until they open. ``These people
have broken that trust. . . . What do we teach our kids about our
words, our ethics, our morals?''
</P>
<P>
   If Sherak's sense of deep moral betrayal seems to strain
credulity, that's because it does. Cynics noted that Fox's response
may have something to do with the fact that two of the early
reviews _ in The New York Daily News and The Toronto Star _ were
less than enthusiastic. (The third scofflaw, the Los Angeles Daily
News, handed out three and-a-half stars. And USA Today chimed in
with a three-star review Wednesday.) Jones thinks the studio
doesn't ``honestly care'' about early reviews, but that the protest
may be intended ``to engender sympathy because the advance word on
the movie has not been great.''
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman's agreement on reviews has loopholes big enough to
drive an 18-wheeler through. Newsweeklies, for example, are exempt
from the embargo foisted on newspapers. Early Internet reviews now
sprout like weeds. And then there is the laughable hairsplitting.
Detroit Free Press film critic Terry Lawson went to a screening
last Friday and wrote a Sunday piece cataloging the impressions of
his colleagues (``the instant reviews were decidedly mixed.'')
Doesn't that qualify as a review? Not according to Sherak, who gave
Lawson a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the embargo breakers are not exactly contrite. ``We
thought the hype and orchestrated leaks about the film really took
it into another category,'' said Jim Travers, managing editor of
The Toronto Star. ``What they are trying to do is use us as the
hype mechanism.'' Los Angeles Daily News entertainment editor Rob
Lowman was also unmoved by criticism from the ``Star Wars''
spinmasters, noting that they tried to ``control and create the
media buzz at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman sees a rough
justice in all this. ``The grand irony (is that) the early negative
buzz has basically been the hype of the movie coming back to bite
the studio,'' he said. ``It's a bit disingenuous for them to be
complaining about this when they've basically been counting on
weeks and weeks of publicity. I think the whole media crossed the
line with this movie. Too much, too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the marketer, a ``disappointed'' Sherak, manages to mix one
final ``Star Wars'' plug with his media scolding, characterizing
those embargo-breaking papers as ``the true side of the dark side
of the force.''
</P>

   Like the Vietnam War itself, the bitter residue of CNN's
``Valley of Death'' story refuses to fade into history. That
program _ on June 7, 1998, alleging US use of nerve gas in a covert
mission during the Vietnam War _ left a bloody trail of
professional casualties. (The most recent was Peter Arnett, the
``Valley of Death'' narrator who departed CNN last month and just
signed on with www.foreigntv.com, a new Internet global news
outlet.)
</P>
<P>
   Of all the parties to this fiasco, no one has battled harder to
regain her reputation than April Oliver, the fired CNN producer who
has insisted that ``Valley of Death'' was solid journalism and that
CNN buckled under pressure to disavow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN has served us up to the military with great fanfare,''
Oliver said after filing a May 7 lawsuit against CNN and a
countersuit against retired Major General John Singlaub.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub, who sued Oliver and CNN for defamation last year, has
been a vocal critic of ``Valley of Death.'' What raised eyebrows
was Oliver's decision to identify him in her suit as a confidential
source who confirmed crucial aspects of ``Valley of Death'' in six
conversations with her. Singlaub's attorney, Philip O'Neil, said
Singlaub ``does not deny talking to'' Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's identification of Singlaub invited comparisons to Mike
Gallagher, the former Cincinnati Enquirer reporter who identified a
confidential source to minimize his criminal liability for stolen
voice mail messageshe used in an investigative report on Chiquita
Brands International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did make the promise to go to jail to protect him,'' said
Oliver of her confidentiality agreement with Singlaub. ``Once he
sued me, I was released. . . . He thrust it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances, journalistic ethics experts tend to
agree with Oliver. ``I think all bets are off when your source sues
you,'' said Paul McMasters, the Freedom Forum's First Amendment
ombudsman. ``If there's ever an occasion where (naming a
confidential source) is justifiable, this is it,'' added Jane
Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. ``Essentially, you're talking about a complete
breakdown between source and journalist.''

WHAT'S NEW FOR NEW MOTHERS: EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the first session of every new mother support group she
leads, parent educator Margaret Hannah drops what amounts to a
bombshell: You need to grieve the person you were before you became
a mother, because you will never be her again.
</P>
<P>
   For women struggling to know ``Who am I now that I'm a mom?''
this is not exactly a comforting thought.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah is undeterred. She approaches the topic almost like
castor oil for the psyche: Even if the who-am-I question is not
causing anxiety, even if you have not yet articulated it to
yourself, getting it out in the open makes you feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a mother is a huge psychological event. It takes
adjusting to,'' agrees developmental psychologist Brenda Hunter of
Vienna, Va., who has studied the subject for decades and is author
of ``The Power of Mother Love'' (Water Brook).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, women overdo preparation for the logistics of
motherhood _ stocking a nursery, reading baby-care books,
interviewing a pediatrician _ and underdo coping with what Hunter
calls the psychic earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   That lapse can have profound ramifications years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your kids are grown when you wonder for the first time,
`Who am I?' it's scarier and harder to figure out,'' says social
psychologist and researcher Carin Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this is a starting point for Hannah, who leads
groups for WarmLines, a parent resource center in Newton. Amy
Hummel of Brookline, whose son Conor is 12 weeks old, can already
see changes in herself. ``I always thought of myself as a fearless
person, but suddenly I'm fearful of all sorts of things,'' she
says. ``It's very nerve-racking.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear that something might happen to the baby and,
concurrently, that you are responsible for its survival, is
probably the most awesome of emotions new mothers feel. Even women
who have worked for years in powerful and important jobs say this
is the line in the sand that makes them feel truly grown-up, says
Rubinstein. She is author of ``The Sacrificial Mother: Escaping the
Trap of Self-Denial'' (Hyperion).
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any woman feel inadequate _ ``How can I do
this?'' ``Will I ever get it right?'' _ and vulnerable. That, in
turn, affects her sense of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ways in which we have to relinquish control,
because things are out of our control,'' says Hannah. ``To many
women, this feels like they are making mistakes. That makes them
feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hummel wasn't necessarily a risk-taker, but she wasn't a
worrier, either, and as a dedicated runner she knows what it means
to be passionate about something. Nonetheless, the love she feels
for Conor is far more intense than she expected, and so is the fear
and worry. When it threatens to overtake her, she looks for joy in
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I focus on the here and now, like that he's smiling today.
Then I feel emboldened instead of vulnerable,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not all woman are able to do that; indeed, many become
immobilized. When she was a new mother, psychologist Harriet
Lerner, author of ``The Mother Dance: How Children Change Your
Life'' (HarperCollins), remembers being unprepared for how
frightened and emotional she felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You discover you're open to a wider range of emotions,'' she
says, ``including that you aren't the clear-thinking, highly
evolved person you fancied yourself to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she says, ``You wrap feelings of guilt and
inadequacy around you like a familiar blanket, even if they are
feelings you never had before.'' She felt guilty even before the
birth of her first child. A difficult pregnancy led to a premature
labor, and she remembers being sad: If she couldn't even get
pregnancy right, what kind of mother would she be?
</P>
<P>
   A more humble person, for starters. One of the first changes she
noticed was a newfound sense of humility. ``Before I had
children,'' says Lerner, ``I was amazed at the `improper' behavior
of other mothers. I knew I would never yell at my kids, fight with
my husband in their earshot, or feed them at McDonald's. Of course,
I've done all of those things and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about motherhood,'' she says, ``is that we don't
have a clue what it will evoke in us until it's our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some research, however, that predicts how we will
react. Studies bear out the idea known as attachment theory: A
child's early ``attachment'' to her mother will affect that child's
ability to form other relationships throughout her life. Thus a
woman whose own mother was warm and caring will be less anxious,
less vulnerable, and more nurturing than a woman whose mother was
emotionally unavailable to her. The woman who wasn't nurtured
herself tends to be more fearful, because she feels less capable;
in order to compensate for her higher sense of vulnerability, she
tends to be more rigid _ keeping a strict schedule, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman who had a lot of nurturing has a stronger sense of
herself and brings more confidence to her mothering,'' says Hunter.
``It's as if there's a deeper well of her own mother love to draw
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Maura Wayman, also in Hannah's group, may be a good example. The
oldest of five children, she was raised in a nurturing family where
she began baby-sitting at 8. She says she and her sisters are calm,
confident mothers who rarely second-guess themselves. The
responsibility of motherhood ``doesn't feel scary to me,'' she
says, ``but it does surprise me that, no matter how tired you are,
you are able to do what you have to do and do it with love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter says that's because women with a nurturing history are
more able to ``surrender to motherhood: to go with the flow as
opposed to saying, `This baby isn't going to change my life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, women who don't have the well of nurturance to draw
from aren't doomed. Two things can make a difference for them:
</P>
<P>
   --A supportive husband who nurtures her while she nurtures the
baby;
</P>
<P>
   --A community. Whether it's a mothers' group, an extended
family, or an informal network of women, ``knowing you're not alone
gives you perspective and strength,'' says Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the question of ``Who am I?'' is most vivid
around questions of work. The woman with a strong personal history
of nurturing, studies show, has an easier time making decisions
about whether to go part time, leave temporarily, or change to a
position with less status. ``It's less of a crisis,'' Hunter says,
``because she has a stronger sense of self.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayman had an easy time making the decision to work only part
time as a corporate video producer, but she felt split between her
roles as professional and mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was odd my first day back. Everyone treated me the same,
which was good in one way but weird in another,'' she says. ``I
wanted to say, `Do you know how different I am? I'm a mom!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah tells women that they often become more efficient and
more compassionate as workers. ``When you see you are competent
enough to have life-and-death responsibility for a baby, it changes
your perspective. Office politics may seem petty.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman Rubenstein worries about most is the one who buries
her identity when she becomes a mother. ``You still need to do the
things you love, the things that make you you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months after giving birth, she says, mothers need
to reengage to some degree in activities they enjoy, from running
to reading. Otherwise, they become sacrificial, not even seeing
themselves as a separate person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like that,'' she says. ``I didn't buy clothes for myself
for years. But it's not healthy for yourself or your children.''
For every woman, the balance of being a person versus being a
mother is different and sometimes a struggle to achieve, ``but you
need to at least work at it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Wayman thinks of herself as a pie whose slices are thinner than
before. ``I can still do things I like to do, just with a lot less
intensity,'' she says. ``I used to go mountain biking three times a
week, now I go only once. If we see friends, it's for two hours,
not four.'' Amy Hummel, who did an ultra-marathon before she
conceived, no longer runs every day but still runs ``when I need
to,'' albeit at 5 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As much as she enjoys it, however, there's also something
different about it that reflects what Hannah says about never being
the same. ``Before, my head was always into the run,'' says Hummel.
``Now my head is back home, with Conor.''

   --Emotions in the first few weeks or month are often due to
hormonal surges, not necessarily part of the identity struggle.
</P>
<P>
   --When you make time for yourself, don't do it when no one in
your family sees it happening but rather when they can notice, so
that it registers that you think enough of yourself to take time

CONNECTICUT DRUG TRADE: LUXURY CARS ARE CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ After more than 10 years tracking the deadly
commerce of street drug crime, Hartford Police Sergeant Christopher
Lyons thought he had seen every exchange imaginable: Drugs for
cash. Drugs for guns. Drugs for jewelry. Drugs for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lyons and others say, Hartford's drug dealers and buyers
have found something new to trade: Cars for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the aftermath of the crack '90s, they have come to be
known in Hartford and other areas of the state as ``half-g'' cars _
cars rented by the hour or day to drug dealers, typically in return
for a half-gram of cocaine. In some cases, strung-out addicts short
on cash loan the cars indefinitely to pay back deep debts to
unforgiving suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the phenomenon drew widespread attention and fueled
community-wide anger in Hartford after a black teenager was shot by
police following a chase. The teen, Aquan Salmon, was riding with
friends in a car later identified as a half-g car, registered to a
white female from an outlying suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tracked the emergence of half-g's in Connecticut
say the trend has mushroomed with deadly potential, arming young
dealers with new mobility and a new sense of power. Once a code
word among street gangs, they say, half-g's have become familiar
shorthand in narcotics units from Hartford to Bridgeport to New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem, and I don't see an end to it,'' said
Lyons, who headed the Hartford Police Department's gang task force
in the early 1990s and watched the trend emerge. ``The people
buying the crack come in with their cars, and they smoke for as
long as they can. And then the kids use the car for all kinds of
other crimes _ drive-bys, delivering drugs to other locations,
robberies, reckless driving, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about how widely the trend has spread
nationally. Police and researchers who track drug and gang activity
in Massachusetts say the phenomenon has not crossed the border.
Even Connecticut law enforcement officials are divided about
whether the trend might be occurring in other cities, and known by
another name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people selling drugs for cars, for weapons, for lots of
things,'' said Bridgeport Police Sergeant Rafael Villegas, who is
assigned to the FBI's gang task force for the city. ``We've even
seen junkies who lease their cars out all the time, going from one
high to the next. It's the enterprise system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, police say it would be nearly impossible to
document or prove every half-g transaction.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons said he knew something was up when he began seeing
street kids _ kids he had always seen walking or riding the buses _
riding in legally registered cars, many of them high-end Hondas,
Acuras, or even Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming across case after case where kids in the city
were driving around in these cars,'' Lyons said. ``These were 14-
and 15 year-olds. We'd stop some of them and ask where they got the
car from, and they'd say, `Oh, it's my friend from Stratford or New
Haven or Berlin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, owners of cars began reporting them stolen
after dealers refused to return them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you have these owners saying their cars were
stolen, then the car turns up with the keys in the engine, and the
ignition isn't even popped,'' said retired Hartford Deputy Police
Chief Gerry Pleasent. ``You look at that and you know something is
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally used in cocaine deals, the phenomenon now involves
trades of almost any drug, in varying amounts, for anywhere from a
few hours to a few days' use of a car.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new-fangled street leases, officials say, is
a symbiosis between suburban addicts and young urban street dealers
who live worlds apart but share a common craving: anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For suburbanites hiding crippling habits, the exchange offers
hours-long binges three or four highway exits from home, without
having to give up hard cash. For the teenage lookouts, runners, and
small-time dealers who make up the core of the industry, a half-g
is a ``clean'' ride, a new opportunity to commit crimes without
being traced.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the whole war on drugs, cars were the weak link for a lot
of these kids,'' said Sergeant Maura Hammick, spokeswoman for the
Hartford Police Department. ``It has a plate that can be traced. It
has a distinction to it. If a kid drove it all the time, neighbors
would know, and if someone witnessed the car in a crime, they could
say `Oh, that's so-and-so's car.'
</P>
<P>
   Following a national push to crack down on street-level drug
dealing by seizing cars involved in drug crimes, Hammick said, ``it
became very appealing to some of these kids to use a complete
stranger's car, because nothing they did could be traced back to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting of Aquan Salmon, community
activists have called for new statutes targeting drug users who
loan cars to urban teenagers in exchange for drugs. While a
polarized community in Hartford waits for state investigators to
conclude their probe into the case, some say the consequences for
buying drugs must be handed down equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in from the suburbs, score their drugs and get on
out of town, and those people who are living here end up getting
all the (jail) time,'' said the Rev. Nora Wyatt, Jr., president of
The Greater Hartford African American Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said the half-g trend preys on young teens who have known
only poverty. Many of them have never seen a Mercedes-Benz or a
Lexus, much less driven one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have laws so that people contributing to kids
committing crimes are held as responsible as the kids themselves,''
he said. ``They're part of the problem.''

S-CLASS MERCEDES LEAVES EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are cruising in the flagship over the high hills of Vermont,
down to the rolling sea of farmland just over the border in New
York State. Our goal: the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And what smoother way for three young boys and two old ones to
travel than in the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz line, its new 2000
S-Class luxury sedan?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is still your father's Mercedes (assuming he could
afford one). Some cars are made for true drivers _ those who love
the feel of the road at toe, heel and hand, and what I like to call
the Gee Forces of amazement in high speed turns. This car, however,
is made more for travelers: folks who want to feel right at home,
as in livingroom comfortable, as the miles roll away.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Mercedes, this is also a transitional model as the
company attempts to lower the average age of its S model buyer from
55 to somehwere near 50. They're doing it with snappy speed and
electronic wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   This is a surprisingly quick car, given that it weighs just over
two tons. This 2000 S-Class, an S430, will do 0-60 in just under
seven seconds and even at highway speed will burst out to pass with
eye-opening acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Ever been bothered by drivers who, when you roll out to pass
them, suddenly speed up for God knows what reason? In this car,
that is not a problem. Touch the pedal and they are suddenly a
speck in the rear-view mirror as you accelerate like Lou Brock
swiping second. And since this is a baseball journey we are on, it
is worth noting there are many traits that this car shares with
Hall of Fame ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   --The enduring legacy of Babe Ruth
</P>
<P>
   Accept it: When you talk about the Bambino of Luxury, and you
talk endurance, and you talk snubnosed recognition, Mercedes is the
best-known name in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, as folks aged in this country, they dreamed of that
Cadillac or that big Lincoln as their last car. Today, that's
changing, and many aging Americans have opted for luxury SUVs.
Mercedes, meanwhile, has held its market and is looking for this
sleeker, less boxy model, to broaden that appeal.
</P>
<P>
   --The crafty inventiveness of Satchel Paige
</P>
<P>
   If traveling in this car is like sitting in your living room,
then driving it is like sitting in your computer room at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of its electronic wonder is the COMAND system,
which stands for Cockpit Management and Data. Between buttons
mounted on the steering wheel and a complex array of
instrumentation featuring a video screen, sound, climate and even
navigation are controlled by this system.
</P>
<P>
   When we left the New Hampshire seacoast, Cooperstown-bound, the
onboard computer was asked to find us the shortest route. It did
just that, and every step of the way warned us by voice of upcoming
turns and then told us when we were at those turns.
</P>
<P>
   And we couldn't fool it. Stray off course and the computer first
tells you to turn back to the original route. Then, as if deciding
you must just be numb, it automatically recalculates a route from
wherever you are to wherever it is you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, just when we thought we had fooled the computer,
my human navigator suggested that a right-hand turn through the
Adirondacks must be coming up. The words were no more out of his
mouth than the computer, having figured out our game, announced
that a right-hand turn was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more: Want to make a telephone call? Press a button
on the wheel and tell the system what number you want. It calls it
and you then have a hands-free conversation. An electronic
phonebook will accept up to 99 numbers which it will recognize by
name only, as in, ``Call Tony's Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Have an emergency _ a wreck, an illness, a carjack attempt? Push
the SOS button and a crisis center comes on line. If you can't
speak, it figures out where the car is, what color it is, and sends
help. Deployed airbags set it off.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down? Push the little button with a wrench on it.
Mercedes sends the repair truck.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Push ``i'' as in information, and a Mercedes rep comes
on line to talk you through the operation of your car.
</P>
<P>
   --The raw power of Mickey Mantle
</P>
<P>
   The hills over the spine of Vermont are steep. It is the only
stretch of road in the East I know of with runaway truck lanes. The
Mercedes, all 17 feet and two tons of steel, charged up the passing
lanes like running on a Salt Flat.
</P>
<P>
   What is a whisper quiet ride is broken not by the sudden sound
of highspeed, whistling wind, but instead by the stacatto chatter
of the sleeping giant under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   If I have a complaint with the car, it is that it is so smooth,
even at speeds well over the limit, that you have to be a flatout
lawbreaker to appreciate what this car will do.
</P>
<P>
   --The elegance of Joe DiMaggio
</P>
<P>
   Leather is everywhere. The front seats have 14 points of
adjustment and by using buttons on the doors can be programmed to
remember how you like all those seat parts arranged when you enter
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Airbags are everywhere. Front and rear, doors, up high to
protect the head.
</P>
<P>
   Each frontseat passenger has individual heat/air controls and it
is remarkable how one side of the car can be steaming while the
other is chilly.
</P>
<P>
   --The grace of Roberto Clemente
</P>
<P>
   There is an effortless ease with which this car takes tight
turns, bumps _ frostheaved Adirondack roads were the test here _
and straight-ahead, numbing hours of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes and throttle automatically correct for oversteer and
understeer; cruise control not only maintains your speed, but a
radar up front maintains a preset distance from any car ahead of
you.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting is nifty: fully automatic, or, when the mood strikes, a
plus-minus, left or right click of the lever turns it into a manual
shifter.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this is a traveler's car, not so much a driver's car,
though drivers can have fun with this one, fun in a deceptively
fast and sporty way.
</P>
<P>
   It was Satchel Paige who warned of life that we should never
look back because something might be gaining on us. In the 2000
S-Class, you don't need to look back because nothing will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
NICE TOUCHES:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The seat controls on the front passengers' doors. Each button
is shaped like a piece of the seat and together they make up a
silhouette of the seat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Underdash carpeting that comes all the way to the knees. No
edges, no wires, no scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no Autobahn in America.
</P>
<P>
   _ The shiny strip of fake wood that bisects the dashboard. It is
so shiny, it reflects whatever is going on above the car _ clouds,
trees _ and as these roll by the effect is like having a television
scroll out of control before your eyes.

MODEL DIVERSITY STARTS ON THE `PLATFORM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the early 1990s and General Motors was a wounded
automotive giant. The company's product line was stagnant, its
reputation tarnished, its bottom line suffering.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point was the company's Cadillac division, longtime
top American producer of luxury automobiles, which suddenly found
itself lacking as other companies, notably foreign manufacturers,
flooded the market with cheaper luxurious cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we needed an entry-level luxury car,'' recalls
Jan-Willem Vester, assistant director of communications at
Cadillac. But the problem, with cash tight, was how to develop a
new car from scratch. The answer, and one which is playing a
significant role in auto development today, was simple: Don't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cadillac looked to Germany where GM's Opel branch was
already manufacturing an entry-level luxury car, the Omega. Today,
using the platform on which the Omega is based, Cadillac builds its
entry-level Catera and sells it anywhere in the world the Omega is
not sold.
</P>
<P>
   Platform-sharing, long practiced effectively as body-on-frame
construction in the world of trucks, is today a significant player
in the ability of auto manufacturers to enter and compete in the
myriad of niche markets that have sprung up on auto lots across the
land.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking plain old ``badge swapping'' as practiced by
GM in the 1980s, when it fooled no one that a Chevy was really a
Caddy or that a simple change in hood ornamentation meant different
handling and performance.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking sedans that become small SUVs; four-seaters that
become whistling two-seat coupes; trucks that become behemoth SUVs;
trucks that become SUTs _ as in Sport/Utility Trucks. And it's all
done on identical or similar platforms with common attachment
points for engines, suspension systems and the sheetmetal that
forms the widely different bodies of the various models.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about cost-effectiveness in a world where a good niche
might mean 25,000 annual sales of a particular model _ good numbers
but hardly enough to warrant from-scratch development. Instead,
using about 20 percent shared components, manufacturers are
building truly different cars on similar platforms and building
some cars that might otherwise never have been developed.
</P>
<P>
   Seen the New Beetle, that zippy little commuter vehicle from
Volkswagen? It's built on the same platform as the VW Golf. And
when you spot your first Audi TT Coupe, note that it, too, is built
on the same platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is doing the same with its SUT (essentially, an SUV with
its back cut off to allow for some semblance of a pickup truck bed)
and its new SUV, the Xterra.
</P>
<P>
   Ford rolled out a Thunderbird prototype earlier this year. It
will share platform characteristics with the Lincoln LS and the
Jaguar S-type.
</P>
<P>
   And when you see one of the behemoth, four-door Ford F-Series
pickup trucks, with an 8-foot bed roll by, picture that enclosed as
the company's giant new SUV, the Excursion, which will be nearly a
foot longer than the Chevrolet Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   There can be ``great, massive difference between models,'' says
Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn, ``but why not gain the efficiency of
sharing platforms?''
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a star on the stage of shared platforms, it
would have to be the Toyota Camry. You'll find its platform on the
Lexus ES300 sedan and in stretched or altered versions on the
Sienna minivan, the swank Avalon, and even the Lexus RX300 SUV.
</P>
<P>
   It was through alteration of the Camry platform that Lexus was
able to quickly enter the SUV field. The big Lexus LX470 and the
Toyota Land Cruiser also share a platform. Further, Toyota plans to
put its 2000 Celica atop the Corolla platform, making the Celica
``lighter and peppier'' with as much as 180 horspower, according to
Wade Hoyt, a Toyota spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of how shared platforms can let a company roll
out a fairly specialized auto can be found at DaimlerChrysler,
itself a recent hybrid. They've developed the new Neon, a year 2000
model that will be sold under both the Dodge and Plymouth badges.
This is a pretty standard move and at that level of auto, consumers
don't seem to mind even if they know badge-swapping is going on.
</P>
<P>
   But what is intriguing is that DaimlerChrysler used the
development of this platform to launch a radically different car,
the Chyrsler PT Cruiser. Jan Zzerina, the company's senior manager
for car and truck platforms, likens this development process to
getting two cars for the price of one. At just over $1 billion in
development costs, he's right on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, shared platforms make it easier from many
aspects when you talk about an overall program investment,''
Zzerina says.
</P>
<P>
   ``By getting all these shared efficiencies up front we end up
with a common framework, a common process'' yet when the two cars
roll off the assembly line ``we have very distinct products
visually'' with different wheel bases, different engines, different
performance characteristics and, most important, widely different
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers stalk the auto landscape looking for the latest
trend, swapping the van for the truck for the SUV for the SUT for
the sports car, what Zzerina calls ``flexible architecture'' will
be a key in any company's meeting our needs at prices we can
afford.

MAKING THE WEB ACCESSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's much to be said for being a titan of industry. There's
the money, the corporate jet and the private island. But there's
also the power to bend others to your will.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean crushing a few labor unions or stamping out some
annoying government regulation. Or it could mean the kind of
far-sighted move that IBM Corp. recently made. IBM said it would
stop advertising on any Web site that didn't pledge to respect
visitors' privacy. ``Our objective is not to cancel advertising,''
said IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky, ``but to get people to
comply.'' And comply they shall, if they want a slice of IBM's
$60-million Web advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic case of a big, powerful mega-corporation throwing
its weight around in exactly the right way. At a single stroke, IBM
gave every major Web site an incentive to do what they should all
be doing anyway--looking out for the privacy of Internet users.
It's good business for IBM to reach out to Internet-shy customers
fretful about losing privacy. But it also comes across as a noble
deed.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, I'd follow up the privacy
triumph with an even more daring act of enlightened self-interest.
I'd tell my Web advertising partners that in a year's time I'd stop
doing business with them unless their Web sites were redesigned so
that blind people can use them.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is known as ``universal Web accessibility,'' and
even many Web savvy readers are probably ignorant of it. Those who
encounter the idea often respond with derision. The Internet, they
figure, is an inherently visual medium. Designing Web pages for
blind people makes as much sense as designing sports cars for them.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Web sites can be designed to work with computer
technologies long used by blind people, such as software that will
read electronic text aloud. But to reliably use these technologies,
the Web site must follow some basic principles of accessible
design.
</P>
<P>
   There's no excuse for not knowing the principles. The World Wide
Web Consortium in Cambridge, the international body that sets
standards for the Web, released a set of accessibility guidelines
last week. They list a number of relatively simple steps to ensure
disabled visitors can make use of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these steps aren't just good for blind people; they make
sense on general principle. For instance, if you attach text tags
to all pictures on a site, a blind user's screen-reader program
will tell him what he's missing. But the same tag also flashes on
the screen, so it's useful as a caption for sighted Web surfers.
Ever notice how a department store's wheelchair entrance is the
easiest one to use? In the same way, adding accessibility to a Web
site makes it a friendlier place for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Complying with the accessibility standards is well within the
ability of professional Web designers. There's even a Web site
called Bobby, created by the Center for Applied Special Technology
in Peabody, that'll test the site. To Bobby-test some of your
favorite sites, go to www.cast.org/bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, major Web sites may have no choice but to become
accessible. There's a running argument about whether the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses and government
agencies to make their sites universally accessible. So far, the
courts have offered no guidance. But it's not unthinkable that the
same law that requires wheelchair ramps will soon be interpreted to
require universal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   I share an entrepreneur's distaste for government intervention,
even in a good cause, but I'd set that instinct aside for the good
of 8.5 million Americans with serious visual impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should the government bully Web designers into
doing the right thing, when IBM can do it instead? Let them
threaten to pull their ads from sites that neglect the disabled.
Perhaps Microsoft will join in -- those guys love to twist arms.
Maybe even the resurgent Apple Computer Inc. might issue such a
threat. It's been awhile since Apple has been strong enough to push
people around. Here's a chance for them to get back into the habit.

PRESERVING THE EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Adobe's Acrobat system has been the gold standard for
publishing printed documents over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer companies distribute their manuals as Acrobat
``PDF'' (Portable Document Format) files from their Web sites,
letting customers download the files and print them out.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of PDF is that you can view a PDF file and
print it out on almost any computer, no matter whether you have a
Windows-based PC, a Macintosh, or even a UNIX workstation.
</P>
<P>
   The second advantage of PDF is faithfulness: PDF documents are
designed to look and print exactly the same on every combination of
computer and printer. That's why the Internet Revenue Service
distributes tax forms in PDF format, and why a growing number of
scientists are using Acrobat and PDF to distribute preprints of
their scientific papers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Adobe released version 4 of its preeminent Acrobat
software. This new package has powerful features for creating and
managing PDF files. It's also a really handy tool if you want to
sue somebody over their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For the litigation-minded, Acrobat 4 is truly a breakthrough.
The new product will automatically download pages from the Web and
use them to create a PDF file, completely preserving the text,
links, and images. You can then take the Web site, digitally sign
it, and save it away into a single file. This is really useful,
because when there is objectionable information on a Web site, it
can change quickly. Acrobat 4 gives attorneys and others a powerful
tool for preserving the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to download all the images and pages from the Web is
great even if you aren't going to take somebody to court. For
example, a salesperson going on the road could download their
entire company's Web site. They could then give a fast presentation
on a laptop computer, using Acrobat, without having to find a
telephone jack and deal with the slowness of a modem connection.
</P>
<P>
   Acrobat has always been great for electronic forms. A small
newsletter, for example, might use Acrobat to create a form for
advertising insertion orders. The sales manager could then keep a
copy of the form's PDF file on her computer's desktop. When
somebody needs the form, she could print it out and send a paper
copy, fax it using her fax modem, or e-mail out the Acrobat file.
With Acrobat 4, you can also generate Web pages complete with
complex JavaScript, giving the manager even more publishing
options.
</P>
<P>
   Although Acrobat 4 has a lot more options than its predecessor,
the program is actually easier to use. For example, when you go to
create an Acrobat file using Adobe's ``Acrobat Distiller'' program,
there is a simple pull-down menu that lets you optimize the PDF
file for screen display, for printing, or for a printing press.
With the previous version of Acrobat, you had to go into several
configuration screens and change about a dozen options to get the
correct results.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that I had with Acrobat version 3 was deciding
between Adobe's PDF Writer and the Acrobat Distiller. Both programs
can be used to create PDF files. The PDF Writer program was easier
to use, but the Distiller did a better job. With Acrobat 4 you
still have the choice of Distiller and the Writer, but they are now
both easy-to-use. Oh, Distiller still does a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, Acrobat 4 also has a lot of tools for
editing Acrobat files themselves. You can change text, add
annotations, delete pages from files, or combine Acrobat files
together. This editing capability can be really handy. If you
discover a small glitch in a big manuscript, you can just go in and
fix the error, rather than regenerating the original PDF file.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have created a PDF file, you can password-protect it.
This prevents somebody else from opening the file without knowing
the password. Unlike the password systems used by Microsoft Word
and Word Perfect, Acrobat's password system is based on RSA Data
Security's encryption technology. This makes it much harder for
somebody to access the contents of your Acrobat files without your
permission. Besides the password, you can also specifically
disallow printing, changing, selecting text, and making
annotations.
</P>
<P>
   As I hinted above, Acrobat 4 also adds a comprehensive digital
signature system for documents. With Acrobat 4 you can create your
own digital signature. You can then use this signature to digitally
``sign'' a PDF file. Along with the signature you can specify that
you are the author, that you have approved the file, that the file
is certified, and so on. This is an important step for giving
electronic documents the legal standing that paper documents now
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the best things about Acrobat 4 is file
compatibility. All of the files that I created with Acrobat 4 I
could easily read back with the freely-available Acrobat 3 reader.
I wish that other companies would follow Adobe's lead by creating
software that has both forward and backward file
</P>
<P>
   compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've noticed that a lot of companies have started
e-mailing Microsoft Word files as a way of sharing documents.
Unfortunately, this is a rather dangerous practice, since Microsoft
Word files can carry computer viruses and other hostile macros.
It's far safer for companies to e-mail PDF. Let's hope that Acrobat
4 makes them reconsider their ways.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my only objection to Acrobat 4 is the price _ a rather
steep $230 each for the Macintosh and Windows versions. If you
don't want to pay for Acrobat but you need to generate PDF files,
you might look into the program GhostScript. Available for UNIX,
Linux, Windows, and many other operating systems, GhostScript has
the ability to generate its own PDF files that can be read back
with the Acrobat reader. Unfortunately, GhostScript's PDF files
tend to be between 10 and 100 times larger than the compact PDF
files that Adobe's
</P>
<P>
   Distiller creates.

RADCLIFFE DONATIONS RISE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGE IN ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Heartened by the recent announcement that it would
reshape itself into a Harvard institute for the study of women,
Radcliffe College donors have been contributing in record numbers,
with $6.5 million given in the three weeks since the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of pledges, compared with $4 million in the nine
months before the announcement, came as a relief to officials at
both Harvard and Radcliffe, who feared that alumnae would be so
angry that the college had ceded the education of undergraduate
women to Harvard that they would refuse, even rescind, donations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, donors and alumnae appear to be championing the new
role for the 105-year old women's college, hailed as a major
addition to a university still struggling to shake a longstanding
``women problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pledges range from $150,000 to $2 million, and come from
non-alumnae as well as alumnae, men as well as women. One alumna
changed her will the week after the announcement of the Harvard
merger, leaving the new Radcliffe $1.5 million when she died two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Some donations were unexpected, other donors had been long
expected to make some kind of gift. But what sealed the deal, the
college's fund-raisers say, was the announcement on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their way of saying, `I really believe this is going to
be a significant piece of the future with Harvard and Radcliffe,'
'' said Joanna Brode, Radcliffe's director of development. ``The
future looks terrific. People are giving to what there is at
Radcliffe already and what they expect the future will be, based on
Harvard's new commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe was originally founded to educate a gender that as
late as 1969 a Harvard dean said would not make ``any significant
contributions to society.'' An agreement in the mid-1970s allowed
women to be jointly admitted to Harvard and Radcliffe, but
Radcliffe retained its independence and functions as the college
for undergraduate women at Harvard, granting degrees and
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   That undergraduate role ended with the agreement approved by the
boards of trustees of both institutions and announced in April.
Harvard is to absorb Radcliffe's $450 million in real estate and
endowment into its own $13 billion portfolio, and contribute $350
million to endow the new Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study,
which is to be primarily focused on women, gender, and society.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe trustees fought with Harvard in nearly two years of
merger negotiations to prevent the women's college from being
demoted to an affiliate, which would have put it on par with the
Arnold Arboretum or Memorial Church within the Harvard universe.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Radcliffe would become a so-called ``tub''
_ on par with the law school, or the Kennedy School _ was seen as a
victory for Radcliffe and for women at Harvard. It was even more of
a victory to those who had watched Harvard's public battles over
the relatively small number of tenured women professors, which
remains about half the national average. A report done by Harvard
administrators two years ago acknowledged that women do not feel
invested in the university, either as students or as alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe alumnae had resisted relinquishing the undergraduate
role, saying Harvard needed Radcliffe to prod it on tenure, the
mentoring of new graduates, and issues of particular interest to
undergraduate women, like sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honestly surprised that there hasn't been more
negativity,'' Brode said. ``There's sadness, as there is with
anything that changes or passes, or comes to an end and starts a
new beginning. But everyone feels very good that Harvard has . . .
validated Radcliffe and its program.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement to create the new Institute, Radcliffe
President Linda S. Wilson said, would do more to promote women's
interests _ at Harvard and beyond. While the institute will not
grant degrees, it will hire faculty for the first time in its
history. (Classes at the original Radcliffe were taught by Harvard
professors in their off hours.)
</P>
<P>
   The burst of support from the Radcliffe community, Harvard
president Neil L. Rudenstine said, ``reinforces what we all
believe, that the Radcliffe Institute will be an enormously
important resource for Harvard and for the scholarly world at
large. These early signs of support help to ensure that the
Institute will be well-launched and well-supported from the
outset.''

PRICKLY BOY-WONDER FACES TEST OF POLITICAL SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Larry Summers mastered macroeconomics. He chewed
through problems in finance, in taxation, in labor economics,
writing papers so numerous and insightful that Harvard made him a
tenured professor at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fields that people specialize in and try to carve
out careers in,'' said Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard economics
professor. ``Larry took them all on at the same time. There are a
lot of geniuses around here, but there's no doubt that Larry always
stood out by comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy-wonder economist has been slower to grasp the subtle art
of politics, however, where a soft touch is important and those
with less nimble minds, when they hold high office, must be
respected. Now, nine years after leaving Harvard for Washington,
Summers's political and intellectual skills will face their
greatest test if he becomes the next US Treasury Secretary,
replacing Robert Rubin, who resigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the No. 2 Treasury official, Summers was nominated by
President Clinton for the top job. Senate confirmation is
considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Summers will be the first Treasury chief in
memory who is also a ``technical'' economist _ a man who thrives on
the fractions and equations in textbooks. Economics is in his
blood: He is the son of two economists and the nephew of two Nobel
prize-winning economic thinkers, Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers will also have to massage egos on Capital Hill and
on Wall Street to do his job well. Although he has apparently
worked in recent years to smooth his notoriously prickly edges,
many people in Washington still remember demeaning lectures from a
man commonly called abrasive and arrogant -- a huge contrast to the
genteel and smiling Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more political and partisan than Rubin,'' said
Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey Republican who deals often
with the Treasury as chairman of Congress's Joint Economic
Committee. ``I hope he will grow into this new role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the day-to-day face of the Treasury Department on Capitol
Hill, he has been abrasive and rude,'' said a Republican aide who
works often with Treasury officials. ``He's super-bright, but not
modest about it,'' said Gary Hufbauer, a scholar at the Institute
for International Economics. Rather than using gentle persuasion,
he said, Summers has a ``tendency to try to educate you in a way
that's moderately or severely humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are still quick to mention that Summers, while chief
economist at the World Bank in the early 1990s, signed on to a memo
that suggested that developing countries were ``under-polluted''
and could make money by accepting more toxic waste. The incident
left Summers looking like an indifferent academic, with no heart --
and no ear for politics. He later described the memo as a mistake
and said it did not reflect his views.
</P>
<P>
   As the Treasury's top deputy for international affairs, Summers
took heat from Congress over a 1995 loan package to Mexico during
its peso crisis, an incident during which many lawmakers complained
that the Clinton administration kept them in the dark and ignored
their authority.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, business lobbyists still smart at a comment Summers
made while a Treasury official that the only argument in favor of
lower estate taxes was ``selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few doubt that the Senate will confirm his nomination.
Summers has been a key part of the team that has won wide credit
for the nation's long-running prosperity, at a time when Asia and
much of the rest of the world sank into recession. Time magazine
put him on its cover as part of the ``Committee to Save the
World,'' along with Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Summers's reach has been as vast as his academic
exploits. He has been a central player on issues ranging from
Social Security, to reforming the International Revenue Service to
the global warming debate, in which he helped persuade President
Clinton to reduce its commitment to an international effort to
lower certain pollutant emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Summers has also been the administration's point man behind the
international rescue-loan packages for troubled Asian nations. He
has shuttled at times from Indonesia, to South Korea and China,
earning him a comparison to former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   While has the Asian crisis has subsided, some critics have
charged that US policy needlessly forced troubled Asian nations to
raise taxes and interest rates, which threw millions of people into
joblessness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As he became an international diplomat, Summers also has
apparently worked to become more diplomatic in his dealings in
Washington. ``I think a lot of the rough edges have come off,''
said Robert Litan, a scholar at the Brookings Institute. ``Larry's
become a statesman. He's learned the lingo and how to stroke egos.
That's a skill you learn in Washington. It's not a skill you have
to practice in academia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence H. Summers was born in 1954 in New Haven. The father of
twin daughters and a son, he is married to Victoria Summers, a tax
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, the family owned a home in Newton. Summers's latest
government financial disclosure statement, for 1997, shows assets
of at least $900,000 _ far less than Rubin, who made tens of
millions of dollars on Wall Street. It also shows liabilities of
more than $500,000, primarily from a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Summers earned his undergraduate degree at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1975. As a sophomore, a recommendation
from his father won him a coveted job as a researcher to Martin
Feldstein, the high-profile Harvard economist. Over the next few
years, the two became partners, and they eventually wrote
pioneering papers on the effects of taxation on capital formation.
Some credit their work with helping to convince Congress to cut tax
rates in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Summers won a job on the MIT faculty before he finished his
doctoral work at Harvard. He was named a tenured Harvard professor
in 1983, and is widely believed to have been the youngest person
with that distinction at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard spokesman Wednesday could not confirm that honor, but
said a 26-year-old mathematician, Noam Elkies, became the youngest
tenured professor in university history in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With scores of academic papers to his credit, Summers is best
known as a leading writer on the factors that determine how and
where people invest. He also helped deflate a popular economic
theory that claimed that people would respond to higher tax rates
and other changes in fiscal policy in a way that nullified the
effect of the new policy. His research showed that fiscal policy
can have a direct effect on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   He also gathered data to poke holes in another popular theory,
which held that markets always quickly adjust prices to reflect new
information.
</P>
<P>
   Summers first went to Washington in 1982 as a staff economist
for the Council of Economic Advisers, then headed by Feldstein.
Another entre to politics came when he met Rubin and other
Democratic insiders while working on Michael Dukakis's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Summers was chief economist at the World Bank but fell short in
a bid for its presidency. Looking for a role after Clinton's
election in 1992, he was bypassed as head of the National Economic
Council but landed as Under Secretary of Treasury for International
Affairs. He won the No. 2 spot at Treasury in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a far different resume than Rubin's, Summers is unlikely
to set a new direction at Treasury this late in the Clinton
presidency. The biggest change? ``Now, you've just got to practice
saying `Secretary Summers' instead of `Secretary Rubin,' '' said
Martin Regalia, chief economist for the US Chamber of Commerce.
``Is the administration likely to change its position on tax cuts
or Social Security? I don't think so.''

NEW VERSION OF `CABARET' LOSES THE MUSICAL'S SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CABARET 
Musical in two acts. Music by John Kander. Lyrics by Fred Ebb. Book
by Joe Masteroff. Based on the play ``I Am a Camera,'' by John Van
Druten and on ``Berlin Stories,'' by Christopher Isherwood. 
Directed by Sam Mendes. Codirected and choreographed by Rob
Marshall. Set, Robert Brill. Lighting, Peggy Eisenhauer and Mike
Baldassari. Costumes, William Ivey Long. Produced by the Roundabout
Theatre Company. Presented by Broadway in Boston. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Cabaret'' began life in 1966 it was far too timid in
exploring the psychosexual politics of life in Berlin at the dawn
of the Nazis' rise to power. By the time Bob Fosse, Liza Minnelli,
Joel Grey, and Louis Armstrong got through with it you could be
excused if you thought the cabaret was a healthy haven of hedonism,
a Cheers bar where everybody knew your name.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes, director of the new ``Cabaret'' that took New York
by storm last year and has now set up shop at the Colonial Theatre,
can be given some credit then for turning the musical on its head
and serving up a clearer view of what the cabaret represented _ a
decidedly decadent place that symbolized the amorality, and
ultimately immorality, of political indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in giving ``Cabaret'' such an attitude adjustment
Mendes discarded the heart and soul that made the musical special
in the first place. If Fosse and Minnelli gave the original,
somewhat stilted musical an amphetamine rush of showstoppers, then
Mendes is overly satisfied with the heroin chic of fashion ads. For
all the radical rethinking and restaging that goes on here, the new
``Cabaret'' is, like Mendes's ``Blue Room,'' a soullessly dark look
into a world where the pursuit of happiness, particularly sexual,
obscures any hope of achieving a higher humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This, I admit, is a minority view. Most, though not all, of the
New York critics hailed the new version, and the Tonys beamed on
Mendes, Natasha Richardson as Sally Bowles, and Alan Cumming as the
Emcee. Be that as it shouldn't, the touring version here isn't the
same production that played New York. Teri Hatcher and Norbert Leo
Butz are serviceable, but nowhere near the dominating presences of
Richardson and Cumming. It was also decided not to transform the
Colonial into the Kit Kat Klub setting that Henry Miller's Theatre
and Studio 54 became. That isn't all to the bad, as the cabaret
setting of ``Cabaret'' _ making the audience into complicit Germans
_ was as glib as most everything else about Mendes's staging.
</P>
<P>
   Boston audiences, though, are not spared Mendes's bleak chic. We
still have Butz and various Kit Kat Boys and Girls prowling the
borders of Robert Brill's black-and-silver set, peering through the
large off-center frame above the action, and casting scowls on the
attempts of the two couples to transcend the travails of their time
and place. Even the sweetest song in the score, ``Married,'' is
snatched from Herr Schultz and Fraulein Schneider, and turned into
a Dietrich-like turn, complete with strobe light. Butz plays the
Emcee like a vampiric, lascivious bisexual cross between Sting and
Billy Idol, which is along the lines of Cumming's slightly gayer
portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't quite have the menace he should, but the problem
isn't with him, or that Hatcher seems to have based her portrayal
of Bowles on watching Joanna Lumley in ``Absolutely Fabulous.'' It
isn't even with the darkness of Mendes's vision. Julianne Boyd's
version that played at the Hasty Pudding and Foxborough a couple of
years ago was such a shining success because it did darken the
original's hues, but it also made us care about the content of the
characters and the politics of the cabaret in a way that Mendes
seems utterly unconcerned about.
</P>
<P>
   That's the important failing of this ``Cabaret.'' The music by
John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb still make up one of the last
great scores the American musical produced, and if some of the
numbers get lost in less than melodious deliveries, at least the
band hits its targets with distinction. (Joe Masteroff, who wrote
the book, was in attendance.) Some of Rob Marshall's choreography
is impressive. Dick Latessa as Schultz complements a Topo Gigio
persona with an Ezio Pinza vocal style. Hatcher's singing wouldn't
make you run out to buy her CD, but it wouldn't make you run out of
the theater, either. It's competent if not distinctive, and if she
shouts too much in the title song, so does Richardson. At least she
doesn't pervert it into the song of personal liberation that
Minnelli did. (Would that we could be as generous to her acting.)
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher is not the show's main virtue or flaw. When Mendes has
the Emcee change into his final costume of the evening _ one that
flies in the face of everything that comes before _ it's the final
insult to the audience's intelligence. But then this is a
production that seems to be aiming at the audience's head when,
like the cabaret itself, it's really aiming much lower.

WHEN PARENTS NEED ANSWERS, THEY TURN TO NETMOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night, I found myself in a chat room on America
Online, waiting for Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine to get
to the point. Along with Hillary Rosen, president of the Recording
Industry Association of America, Morello was on-line to discuss
violent music in the aftermath of the shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of addressing the subject, Morello began with a
screed about the war in the Balkans and got on a soap box about
politicians decrying violent lyrics while NATO engages in a bloody
bombing campaign. Morello certainly wasn't the first to make that
connection, but the thing was, nobody in the chat room was there to
discuss it. Most of the teen-agers just wanted to type love letters
to Morello, but some of the parents on-line had genuine concerns.
What, if anything, should they be doing to monitor their kids'
exposure to pop culture? And what about the Internet? How do you
ensure kids' safety on-line without hindering their exposure to its
enormous potential?
</P>
<P>
   Forget the chat room: All you got there was ``Blah, blah, blah,
Yugoslavia,'' ``Blah, blah, blah, President Clinton,'' and ``Blah,
blah, blah, Tom Morello is God.'' I gave up and zapped off an
e-mail to NetMom, an expert in youth culture on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are concerned, NetMom replied. She's seen a dramatic
increase in hits to her informative site (www.NetMom.com) since the
Littleton tragedy. ``Kids are more savvy about the Internet than
their parents are,'' says NetMom, aka Jean Armour Polly, a former
librarian and author of ``The Internet Kids and Family Yellow
Pages.'' ``But that doesn't mean parents should go off the deep end
and pull the plug. They should investigate it. If you don't have it
at home, go to a cyber cafe or the public library. See what's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polly is an Internet pioneer and something of a Net evangelist
(she coined the term ``surfing the Net''), and she's not about to
offer alarmist views about cyberspace. ``There are dangers out
there, but outweighing those dangers is the wonder of the Internet
and the fabulous sites created for and by kids. The educational
benefits are so rich, and I'd hate to see parents scared off
because of stories saying that the Internet is evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Polly urges parents to allow the Internet into their
homes on their own terms. And she offers some sensible advice on
how to do just that. The first thing, of course, involves
old-fashioned, non-technical communication. ``People don't talk to
their kids,'' she says. ``You can have someone on-line talking in a
chat room about how to be a better parent while their own kid is on
the floor behind them. It's so funny. You can reach across the
globe in a chat room, but why can't you reach out to your own
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson number one. But what about that eerie feeling that
your kids are one click ahead of you out there in cyberspace? Here
are NetMom's suggestions. Some parents opt to filter the Internet
in a variety of ways. First, some Internet service providers filter
certain content for children; these providers can be found by
checking out http://thelist.internet.com; do a search on
``filtered.'' AOL, for instance, offers its members a parental
control option.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the filtering software packages, which have been
controversial since they came on the market. First Amendment
activists are against them as a general rule, especially in public
libraries. But even the staunchest free speech advocates would
admit that people can make their own choices about what content
comes into their homes. These packages, which include products like
CyberSitter and SmartFilter, allow parents to block pages that
contain pornography and hate speech. When they were first
introduced, they were creaky, blocking sites that might have a
chicken breast recipe or a discussion of breast cancer. They've
gotten better, though, and the question ``To filter or not to
filter'' is a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have filters in our house,'' Polly says. ``Son of
NetMom (Stephen) is almost 13, and we do a lot of talking about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Son of NetMom, of course, is pretty adept on-line. And his
mother can tell you about plenty of places where kids can learn
on-line in a safe environment. She raves about some of the search
engines designed specifically for children. The popular Ask Jeeves
site, for instance, has a site designed for youngsters called Ask
Jeeves for Kids (www.ajkids.com). Polly also recommends
www.yahooligans.com and Kids Click, a site created by librarians
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/kidsclick!/).
</P>
<P>
   The point is, you don't have to be powerless and you don't have
to turn to chats with rock stars to figure out what to do. Danger
may be only one click away in cyberspace, but so is a wealth of
educational experiences. Just ask NetMom. She knows.

   Liesl Clark didn't expect to be deluged with media requests when
she ascended Mount Everest to film a PBS Nova documentary. But
early this week, the team of climbers discovered the body of George
Mallory, the British adventurer who disappeared on Everest back in
1924. Word travels fast in these days of instant communication,
especially when you're chronicling your adventures on a Web site
(www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/).
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were waiting at Base Camp, the climbers used their
satellite phone and laptop to announce the news to the world,''
Clark wrote in an e-mail to this column. ``Instantly, the whole
world knew... Somehow, Web-casting has taken the world by storm,
and anyone can post news, without understanding the repercussions.
While the outside world feasted on the breaking news, we were
holding on at Base Camp for the team to return, still very much in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we deluged with media requests? Just about every major
magazine and newspaper has been in touch with us, asking for photos
of Mallory and doing interviews. I just got off the satellite phone
with the Sunday Times in London. I'm not so sure the media would be
quite so anxious to speak with us if we were in Boston. I can only
tell you that when I call a reporter and say, `This is Liesl Clark
calling from Everest Base Camp,' they, amazingly, don't put me on
hold.''

 &HT;    LEVITT'S STRATEGY AT SEC IS SPELLED D-I-S-C-L-O-S-U-R-E
 &HT;    740&AMP;add.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expect to hear more from the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the coming months about the need for
additional disclosure by mutual funds on the cost of investing and
the impact of taxes. Ditto for plain English documents.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the issues SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt _ one year
into his second five-year term _ has on his mind. In an interview
with David McNaughton of Cox News Service, the 68-year-old Levitt
also addressed other questions about the agency's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The SEC has a number of issues on its plate, in addition to
the much-publicized Internet fraud. Does the agency have enough
resources to do its job?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think any law enforcement agency has sufficient
resources to assure the public that all misdeeds will be
anticipated, or addressed. But I think a focused enforcement arm
can try to address those areas which we feel represent the greatest
threat to the American investor or to the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we could use additional resources. ... But I don't think
there is a law enforcement agency in this country which wouldn't
say the same.
</P>
<P>
   Do I think the public is being violated because we're so
understaffed? Not really. We still have good people coming to us
for amounts of money that is much less than what they could make in
the private sector because they believe in what we are doing,
because they're really patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the subject of Internet fraud, there have been suggestions
that the SEC conduct undercover stings to combat it. Is that
something the agency would consider?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think it's a good idea. I think you have to approach
that very carefully. It involves privacy issues. I suppose if you
allowed every law enforcement agency the ability to do anything
they want, you'd probably have less crime. But at what price? It's
a price that I don't think I would be prepared to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about investment-related Internet chat rooms? Should
they fall under investment advisory regulations?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think as long as people know that chat rooms can be
unreliable, and as long as we are prepared to go after people who
make fraudulent use of chat rooms, by being paid to promote certain
securities _ as long as we can go after that kind of miscreant, I
think our role is to educate people as to the dangers of believing
everything they hear in the chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are penalties for securities law violations sufficient,
particularly in regard to repeat offenders?
</P>
<P>
   A: Boiling in oil would be suitable in some cases, I suppose,
but I wouldn't ask for that remedy. I think we have at our disposal
what I think is certainly more than any other regulator any place
in the world (has), and I think probably adequate to our needs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of priorities, what would your selection be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would say seeing to it that the numbers available to
investors are as comprehensive and accurate as possible, consistent
with our mandate of full disclosure. That means America's
accounting must keep pace with our markets and our financial
system. So seeing to it that our numbers are accurate and reliable,
stamping out accounting fraud, coming down hard on those companies
that abuse the system by trying to make numbers that will satisfy
short-term-oriented analysts, is a major target of this commission.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing structural issues in our market by seeing to it that
the explosive changes occurring in our markets create a system
where competition is both fierce and fair. I mean adjusting to
electronic markets and deciding which new entrants will be treated
as an exchange or dealer, what the level of oversight will be, how
to deal with the rules and regulations submitted by the various
self-regulating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing to it there's no compromise in the kinds of protections
investors have in U.S. markets in terms of the new formulation of
international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening the role of the audit committee, a protection for
the public investor. I appointed a blue ribbon committee to
evaluate the role of the audit committee and now we intend to
implement those recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to diminish the influence of pay-to-play, both in the
municipal market and in the corporate market, and to extend that to
the role of investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Greater disclosure on the part of mutual funds in terms of what
it's costing investors to invest in those funds, and the risks that
those investors endure in those funds.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: The SEC has several options to produce its desired results.
Among those, how effective has jawboning been?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've been amazed at how important the bully pulpit is. When I
give a speech on a serious subject, the lawyers and accountants of
America write to their clients and say, ``This is what the SEC is
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's been a far more reliable device than either rule-making
or seeking legislation. Legislation is my last alternative because
it's so unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You raised objections in congressional testimony about the
House version of proposed financial services deregulation. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most serious problem, which makes this bill in my
judgment very, very bad for investors, is that the banking
exemptions are so arcane and ill-suited to today's environment that
in effect they permit and encourage banking regulators to oversee
securities activities that are conducted within the bank. And
that's just wrong. And dangerous to investor interests to allow
that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you feel it's dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way the system works best is when banking regulators
watch the bank and securities regulators watch securities
activities. If banking regulators are concerned about the safety
and soundness of the bank, and they have as a subsidiary a
brokerage operation, and the banking part of the bank is undergoing
some financial trauma, it's all too easy to suck up the resources
of the brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   If the brokerage firm is guilty of some fraudulent activity, how
would the bank deal with that in terms of its overall reputation?
The culture of the brokerage industry is to publicize misdeeds.
That is not the culture of the banking industry, which fears (for)
safety and soundness. They want to handle it themselves in their
own way and keep it quiet. The brokerage industry has remedies. The
banking industry does not. We can kick someone out of the brokerage
field and keep them out of financial services. You can't do that in
banks.
</P>
<P>
   We also have a whole mechanism of enforcement and surveillance.
Banking examiners don't do that. Different culture. Different
levels of protection. And I'm interested in one level, and that's
investor protection. It's kind of the mantra that guides every
decision we make.

RUBIN'S EXPERTISE IN TIME OF CRISIS WILL BE MISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial types typically don't have much use for government.
</P>
<P>
   To Wall Street, government is a big, clumsy player that is more
likely to make things worse rather than better. Investors prefer to
place their trust in the collective wisdom of free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those times when markets stop working, when fear is
in the air, and financial problems look as if they will snowball
into full-scale disasters. At times like those, investors dump
their laissez-faire attitudes, along with their stocks, and turn to
government for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican crisis in late 1994 was one of those times. So was
the Asian crisis in 1997 and the Russian crisis in the summer of
1998. ``We are living in a period that has demonstrated both the
strengths and the limitations of markets,'' says Fred Breimyer,
chief economist at State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those times of crisis that Robert Rubin made his mark
and why he will be so sorely missed on Wall Street. As Treasury
secretary, Rubin was the fireman who kept the fire from spreading,
the cop on the corner who prevented the fight from spiraling into a
full-blown riot.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his
designated successor, Lawrence Summers, Rubin kept the US market
and the US economy insulated from the worst of the damage. Along
the way he became so valuable to President Clinton and so highly
regarded on Wall Street that he couldn't leave his job, even though
he clearly wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is resigning now means the worst of the
global crisis is over,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist at
Regional Financial Associates, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 200 points
Wednesday morning when news of Rubin's resignation first became
public. The market later came back, closing for the day with a loss
of just 25.78. Investors may have been reassured when Greenspan
spoke favorably about Summers.
</P>
<P>
   All three men have had plenty of experience on the international
front. When the Mexican peso collapsed, Rubin and company backed an
emergency loan to Mexico over the strong objections of the
Republican Congress. Mexico went into a painful recession, but its
economy and market bounced back quickly. Just as important, the
rest of Latin America and the rest of the world avoided disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases of Asia and Russia, the Rubin team worked through
the International Monetary Fund to stabilize markets and rebuild
investor confidence. Asia remains a work in progress. Some
countries, including Korea and Thailand, have bounced back; others,
most notably Japan, have not. Russia is still a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sense that those in charge knew what they were
doing _ that the fate of the financial world was in good hands.
``Rubin is just an incredibly competent man,'' says Nancy Kimelman,
chief economist at Technical Data in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Rubin steered Clinton toward deficit
reduction and impressed upon his boss the importance of keeping the
bond market happy. He also made sure the administration avoided
criticizing the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Neither policy initially went over well with the liberals, but
they were hard put to complain in the face of a strong economy and
a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin earned the enmity of Republicans in 1995 when he juggled
funds to keep the government running when Congressional Republicans
tried to shut it down. They were no more pleased with his efforts
to block a variety of proposed tax cuts. More often than not, he
got his way.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin visited Boston a number of times over the years. He was
always a terrible interview. He never had anything of interest to
say _ at least on the record. If he ever gave a major speech, no
one can remember it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for an important public official he was remarkably
closed-mouthed. He rarely said anything about financial markets,
even though he spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs. When he was asked
about the dollar, he said he favored a strong US dollar and that
was it. He seemed to know when it was useful to speak up and when
silence could be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   In person Rubin cut an impressive figure. He came across as
bright and in charge. He never looked rattled. In the financial
community, he inspired confidence, a precious commodity. In
Washington he sometimes seemed like one of the only grown-ups in a
town full of out-of-control teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a mensch,'' says Kimleman, using a Yiddish word
that literally means man but actually refers to a solid, decent
person in whom you can place your trust.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, Rubin's heir apparent, is brilliant, experienced, and
knows as much as anyone about the US and world economies. His
challenge will be proving to the markets and to Washington that he,
too, is a mensch.

CAN NEW SIDING GO OVER OLD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Two contractors have bid to re-side my house, which now has
aluminum siding on the front and cedar shingles on the sides and
back. The shingles are over original clapboards. One contractor
said to take off the cedar shingles; another said there is no need
to remove them. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   P. M., Ashland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. They both are, although the one who said there is no need is
lazy, or not willing to take them off and charge more money. Most
new siding (vinyl, clapboards, or shingles) can be applied over old
siding, but since your sides and back already have two layers, a
third layer would bring out the wall much too far, requiring some
treatment to the window and door casings so that the new siding
would not end in midair where it meets the casings. If the windows
are treated to prevent this midair meeting, the windows and doors
would look indented _ pretty silly on a house. So, while it may be
more expensive to remove the old shingles, I would do so.
</P>
<P>
   As for the aluminum, it definitely should come off no matter
what kind of siding you apply to the front.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting a distinct smell of cigarette smoke in the
living room of my apartment since a smoker moved in below me, and
it migrates to the bedroom as well. I have been in the 25-story
building since it opened in 1963. The maintenance people caulked
along the baseboard, and I think around a pipe coming out of the
floor, which helped a little. The baseboard heater is several
inches above the floor. Is there anything else that I can do?
</P>
<P>
   J. W., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Physical blocking is the best thing you can do to keep out
the smoke, and caulking is physical blocking. Have any and all
joints caulked; it may not look so hot but it may help. The joints
that can be caulked are at the top of the baseboard (which I assume
is what was already caulked), between the baseboard and the floor,
around pipes coming through the floor or wall, and possibly around
window casings because the smoke may be coming up through the wall
and into your unit around the window casing. Do this on inside
walls as well as outside ones.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a shoe mold (a quarter-round molding) between the
baseboard and floor. If you have hardwood flooring, there may be a
half-inch open joint under that shoe mold; that is an expansion
joint to allow the wood floor to expand and contract, which is good
because it prevents the floor from warping. But that open joint may
be a perfect conduit for the smoke from below. The best way to
caulk that joint is to remove the shoe mold, caulk the joint
heavily, fill the open joint, and put the shoe mold back on. This
will make a good closure, and be invisible. The caulking is
flexible enough that it will not interfere with the expansion and
contraction of the floorboards.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to try is to have your neighbor have his unit
caulked between wall and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Caulking has to be complete and thorough; a lick and a promise
will not do. The more seams and joints and cracks you caulk, the
better off you will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could I douse the weeds that grow in the cracks in my
driveway with bleach to keep them away? Would that pose an
environmental risk?
</P>
<P>
   ED BOOTH, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that would work, and the environment is not compromised
because bleach converts to a less toxic, less caustic material when
it contacts the ground. But I think that vinegar will be more
effective, and will prevent new weeds from growing for nearly the
whole summer. Vinegar is concentrated acid rain, and we all know
what acid rain does. One caveat: Whether you use vinegar or bleach,
don't put it on any area where you don't want the plants killed.
</P>
<P>
   This all will work on weeds that grow between bricks and other
paving materials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I power-wash my house? It is 70 years old and the siding
is shingles.
</P>
<P>
   KIRSTEN LEWIS, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the shingles are painted, or stained with a solid color
stain, you can power-wash, which will take off loose paint or
stain. If you plan to repaint or restain, let the shingles dry out
for four or five dry days. If the shingles have a semitransparent
stain, you can also power-wash, but it may fade the stain
considerably, requiring restaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shingles that are intact and lying flat on the wall can be
power-washed; so can clapboards that are well nailed. If the
shingles are curling a bit, or the clapboards are lifting, I
suggest not power-washing because the strong stream of water can
get too far under the shingles, causing delays in drying out.
</P>
<P>
   I would not suggest power-washing vinyl or aluminum siding
because if water gets into the seams and behind the siding, it
would take a long time to dry out _ not a good idea or a good thing
for the sheathing or whatever wood is under the siding.
</P>

CLMBING THE LADDER TO SUCCESS SAFELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone has a ladder story, so with the ladder season upon us,
it's time to make sure that we do all the chores that require
ladders safely and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those chores are painting, washing and reglazing
windows, putting up shingles, taking down shingles, repointing the
chimney, reroofing or repairing a roof, cleaning gutters. Chances
are that this summer you will be doing one or more of these chores.
</P>
<P>
   Working on ladders carries an inherent hazard; after all, you
are not working on the ground (the safest and most comfortable
place to be, usually); you may be just a few feet above ground, or
up to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Any work above 20 feet high is best left to the pros. And, if
you don't like heights, then don't even bother. The better part of
valor is to stay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most accidents on ladders are due to operator error or
carelessness. The operator may have leaned too far to one side
trying to reach a distant area without moving the ladder. Or, he
stood on a step too high up the ladder, losing his balance. Or, he
positioned the ladder too steep or too shallow, inviting a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other causes are defective equipment or using a ladder not
designed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The handyman has his own ladder mishaps; you can decide if it
was his own fault or not.
</P>
<P>
   This one he couldn't blame on anyone else. The handyman had a
wood ladder, which he stored outdoors for some years. But he took
good care of it, keeping it well oiled, and not painting it,
because painting could cover defects.
</P>
<P>
   So he set up the ladder carefully, stepped on the bottom rung,
and foomp! The decayed rung broke at each end, sending the handyman
down suddenly. The fall was only 12 inches, but it was enough to
get rid of the ladder in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but what if the rung that broke was the top rung?
</P>
<P>
   Another intrepid ladderman (whose name we will not mention to
protect the guilty) set up a scaffold board suspended from two
ladders, safe when done rigfht.
</P>
<P>
   Our friend did do it right, but from then on didn't do anything
right. He couldn't reach part of his project, so he put a few
plastic milk cartons on the scaffold board to get just a little
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Lo, the jury-rigged cartons tottered and fell, sending our
friend down the wall for 12 feet, feet first. He landed on his
feet, bounced back, and ended up on his back. He was unhurt, but
you should have seen the fingernail marks on the wall, where he
clawed and clawed to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All these stories are simply to stress the need for good
equipment, proper use of it, and the usual safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Ladder Co. of Greenville, Pa., has been making ladders
and accessories for 75 years now, and is well aware of the need for
quality in its products, but also the need for safety, proper use,
and intelligent behavior while sky high.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Ladder &AMP; Scaffolding Co. of West Lynn, Mass. is a
manufacturer of all kinds of ladders, scaffolds, and accessories,
and has branches in Orwigsburg, Pa., Washington, D.C., and West
Springfield, Mass. It, too, has plenty of tips on safety and proper
use of ladders.
</P>
<P>
   In the market to buy a ladder? Consider what you will use a
ladder for. Extension ladders come in four weight-carrying
categories, extra heavy (300 pounds); heavy duty, 250 pounds;
medium duty, 225 pounds, and light duty, 200 pounds. Remember, the
pound rating includes the weight of the climber as well as
everything he is carrying. For most residential uses, the medium
duty is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   What material?
</P>
<P>
   What material? Wood is economical, electrically non-conductive
when clean and dry, and heavy. While aluminum and fiberglass
ladders are generally lighter than wood, they still are not
featherweight.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum is strong, lightweight, and corrosion resistant.
Fiberglass is electrically non-conductive and strong.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is yours and may depend on the cost of the ladders.
But don't expect any cheapies from either Werner or Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   A most important part of operating a ladder safely is how far
the base should be from the house. If it is too close to the house,
the climber could tip over backwards as he gained height. Too far,
and the ladder should skitter down the wall, carrying the climber
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Werner says the right angle for an extension ladder is 75 1/2
degrees between the base and upper support point. That makes the
ratio of setback and height 1 to 4. In other words, the setback
(distance of the base from the house) should be one foot for each
four feet of height from base to upper support point. For a 20-foot
ladder, the setback would be 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Read the rules
</P>
<P>
   Before you start, think safety. Read all ladder labels, pay
attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect the ladder for defects, damage, or loose or missing
components.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure working parts move properly and connections are
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Keep ladders in good condition. Clean spills or drips, and keep
the ladder free from oil, paint, and other slippery materials.
Lubricate moving parts.
</P>
<P>
   Use a fiberglass or a dry, clean wood ladder when working near
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Open stepladders completely and lock into position. Make sure
all ladder feet are on a firm base, and both rails of an extension
ladder are firmly against the house.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now, finally, you can start climbing. Well, not before a few
rules are dunned into you head:
</P>
<P>
   Get help if the ladder is too heavy to lug around. Avoid
carrying an extension ladder in the vertical position; it's too
easy to lose balance and break the ladder, yourself, and anyone in
your way.
</P>
<P>
   Climb facing the ladder. Center your body between rails.
</P>
<P>
   And a few don'ts: Don't stand above the highest safe-standing
level. Don't stand above the second step from the top of a
stepladder and the fourth rung from the top of an extension ladder.
Don't exceed the duty rating of a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the dos and don'ts are based on common sense and
logic. Let's hope we all have some.
</P>
<P>
   And, one piece of logic you can apply if you don't like heights
and don't like ladders: Have someone else do these strange things.
Paying him is worth it.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR LAUNCHES ADS ATTACKING TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Starting this weekend, tobacco executives get
skewered as liars and hypocrites with a series of anti-smoking TV
ads recently approved by California Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson shelved the ads because he didn't think
taxpayers should pay for personal attacks on a legal business but
should concentrate on the harmful health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The ads approved by Davis also include a new campaign featuring
emotional testimony from children who lost their parents to cancer.
Another black-and-white piece features a plea from the brother of
the rugged-looking actor who played the ``Marlboro Man'' and later
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still another features a woman with a weathered face who says
she started smoking at age 10. ``I started smoking to look older,
and I'm sorry to say it works,'' the woman adds regretfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ads will tell the truth in plain, unvarnished fashion,''
Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Although California has the second-lowest smoking rate in the
nation, behind Utah, the teenage smoking rate has begun to climb.
Anti-smoking groups claim teenagers respond better when authority
figures like the tobacco industry are ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Davis, ridicule is again state policy.
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad produced for $350,000 in 1995 and never used, dubbed
``Insurance,'' shows shadowy-looking tobacco executives smoking
cigarettes and laughing over their money, then switches to the
front door of an insurance company that gives lower rates for
people who don't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies are not named, the ad is referring to
British American Tobacco and Lorillard, cigarette makers owned by
conglomerates that also include life insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry. They profit, you lose,'' says the ending
voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   The next Wilson-era ad approved by Davis appeared briefly before
Wilson pulled it in the mid- 1990s. Dubbed ``Boardroom,'' the
30-second piece shows video footage from an April 1994
congressional committee where tobacco executives testified that
nicotine is not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   It ends with the tagline: ``Do they think we're stupid?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the company has no problem
with state-sponsored TV ads and campaigns that target teenage
smoking, but it objects to the ``essence'' of the ads that directly
attack tobacco executives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the recent mega-settlement with tobacco companies, about
$1.5 billion has been set aside for anti-smoking ads throughout the
country. Many of those ads are under development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the state devotes a significant portion of their
settlement funds to youth smoking-prevention programs,'' said
Philip Morris spokeswoman Mary Carnovale. ``As far as these
(Davis-approved) ads are concerned, we just don't feel they are
accurate depictions of Philip Morris and our people.''
</P>
<P>
   California has one of the most well-financed anti-tobacco
campaigns in the nation. Since voters raised the cigarette tax by
25 cents a pack a decade ago, about $634 million has been spent
fighting smoking under Proposition 99.
</P>
<P>
   This year's TV ad campaign costs about $25 million, and will
include an increased presence on networks that teenagers tend to
watch more, like MTV and Fox. Most of the new ads will be on the
air this weekend, then briefly trail off during the summer when
fewer people watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco forces had been frustrated with Davis for not
quickly approving the Wilson-era ads and about 19 new ads produced
by Asher &AMP; Partners, the state's Los Angeles-based agency. Several
of those new ads remain in the pipeline, Davis said Wednesday, and
should be approved within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The recent settlement with the tobacco industry also gave
California health officials control last month of 366 billboards
that were being used to advertise cigarettes. Anti-smoking groups
praised Davis for moving quickly to seize that $10 million windfall
and approve ads for them.
</P>
<P>
   The new billboard campaign includes a more aggressive use of ads
linking cigarettes to impotence. One billboard shows a mock
Marlboro Man with a droopy cigarette in his mouth and the word
``IMPOTENT'' behind him.

A SMALL VICTORY FOR COMMON SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much power should fear have over your life? That's a
question each of us has to confront.
</P>
<P>
   A friend told me this story last week. She'd run errands with
her two children, Suzie, 8, and Greg, 4. She had to return a video
and pick up Greg's bike from the repair shop, but luckily, the two
stores were within sight of each other. When she arrived at the
video store, however, Suzie wanted to look at the children's videos
without anyone rushing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can return the tape by myself,'' she'd said confidently,
stepping out of the car. ``I'll meet you at the bike store.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of leaving Suzie on her own took her mother's breath
away. ``I have one nightmare that chills me to the bone, the
thought that something might happen to either of my children
because of poor judgment on my part,'' Karen said to me. ``Did I
want to let Suzie out of my sight for even one minute? Absolutely
not, but this wasn't only about what would make me comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand that Karen's daughter had been the most
outgoing of kindergartners until the school showed a video warning
her and her classmates about the danger of being abducted by
``friendly strangers.'' Looking back, Karen believes Suzie's
innocence was shattered when she was told to beware of people who
were nice to her and to view even their neighbors as a possible
threat. Suddenly the place where her child had formerly felt
completely safe became populated with potential kidnappers,
fiendishly disguised as friends, who might steal her if she let
down her defenses.
</P>
<P>
   What other defense does a 5-year-old have except to stay afraid?
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain that Suzie was afraid to go upstairs in
her own home? Why else would kidnappers have haunted her dreams,
waking her several times a night for over a year? Why else would
she panic at the sight of a strange man on her street? All her
family's reassurances were useless against her terror. She remained
hyperalert, having lost faith in the power of adults to protect
her, for isn't that what we're confessing when we place so much
responsibility for her own safety upon a child's small shoulders?
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, her family has been encouraging Suzie
to reclaim her fearless self, to look up and see blue sky instead
of dark clouds, to regain her confidence in herself and the world
around her. Recently her parents transferred Suzie to a private
school, which operates on the philosophy that it is crucially
important to awaken and preserve a child's innate sense of wonder,
awe, and reverence, in part by providing positive experiences while
limiting unmediated access to violence in the media.
</P>
<P>
   So here was Suzie, apparently in recovery, and how did her mom
react? She was tempted to say she was too scared to leave Suzie
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Karen believes we are eroding the sense of security necessary
for learning and growing and loving life by giving children
frightening information beyond their conceptual and geographical
scope. She has seen her child haunted, and hindered, by her
overwhelming preoccupation with possible hidden dangers in her
immediate environment.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety can do that. It drains life of pleasure. It makes us
flee from stressful situations rather than cope with them. It
adversely affects our ability to be curious, to think clearly, to
respond appropriately, to focus on the challenges we actually do
face rather than those we fear. Anxiety is, above all, irrational.
It blinds you to the subtle signs you really should be heeding by
making you see danger everywhere all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Karen knew that. After all, she was fighting her own anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   This is what she did.
</P>
<P>
   She looked up the street. She looked down it. Whatever evil was
happening elsewhere, all the strangers she could see looked
extremely friendly. They looked like folks who vote at town meeting
and recycle their newspapers and walk for AIDS. They looked like
people who volunteer to walk abandoned pets and coach soccer teams
in their free time. They looked exactly like all the decent, kind,
and trustworthy people Karen and her family had lived happily among
for the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   She walked Suzie into the store. She said to Stan, the very nice
guy who owns the place, ``Keep an eye on her, will you?'' Then she
walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   You'd better believe she gave Suzie an enormous hug when the
child, all smiles, was safely back in her arms.

MONEY CAN, IT SEEMS, BUY HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; want to make the journey to financial wholeness.
</P>
<P>
   I want to release the energy of money.
</P>
<P>
   I want to set out on the hero's path toward money power. For, as
the mythologist and philosopher Joseph Campbell once said, ``Money
is congealed energy, and releasing it releases life's
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   I think I sense something congealing here, although I'm not
entirely sure it's the energy of money. It could be a publishing
trend. But it may be something else.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently I never knew money could be so spiritually
enriching. Then I discovered two new books, Suze Orman's ``The
Courage to be Rich'' and Maria Nemeth's ``The Energy of Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two books are different in many ways, they share a
common goal, to make readers one with their money, in a holistic,
New Age sense.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, both Orman and Nemeth are already one with my money,
since I parted with $24.95 for each book. That's a total of $49.90,
plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Because money isn't money as we remember it from the booming
'80s _ you know, the old
let's-buy-everything-we-can-lay-our-hands-on kind of money. Here in
the booming '90s, the new money is a metaphor for self-esteem,
self-empowerment, and spiritual enrichment. It's a vehicle for
self-actualization, a path to inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   The basic message of both books is simple: Quit spending money,
save it instead. This isn't exactly a new idea, but tarted up with
a lot of New Age concepts and psychobabble it seems different,
somehow. More marketable.
</P>
<P>
   With consumer debt heading toward the stratosphere, both Orman
and Nemeth would seem to be fighting an uphill battle. But
precisely because so many people are deeply in debt, both have
found eager audiences. Orman, particularly, is wildly popular, with
her PBS special ``The Courage to be Rich,'' her regular appearances
on the Oprah Winfrey program, her own show on QVC. Her first book,
``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' sold 2 million copies; the new
book has been on the New York Times bestseller list since it was
published eight weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Orman writes, ``unbelievable as it may seem, it takes courage to
be rich. Why? Because choosing wealth as a goal requires facing
everything about your money bravely, honestly, with courage _ which
is a very, very hard thing for most of us to do. But it can be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   If you face up bravely to your finances, Orman promises you'll
feel ``rich in every way, both in the way your bottom-line numbers
read and in your heart, your soul and the way you live each day.''
You can find your bliss in your bank balance. Isn't that nice?
</P>
<P>
   Nemeth's book is even more New Age-y than Orman's. It grew out
of her ``You and Money'' course, a series of seminars for the
financially bewildered. Nemeth, a clinical psychologist, is
inspired by Joseph Campbell's ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces''
and applies his ideas to mastering ``the energy of money.'' She
also invokes a host of sages _ Jung, Shakti Gawain, Sogyal
Rinpoche, Marianne Williamson, among others _ and tosses around a
lot of New Age terms and concepts _ Metaphysical Reality, Facing
the Shadow, Conquering the Dragon, Dancing With the Monkey.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to one thing: Stop squandering your money.
Which is good advice, no matter how you say it. You could start
your hero's journey toward mastering the energy of money by
borrowing these books from your public library, instead of buying
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Victorian Age would not be fully understood or
appreciated till the year 2000, Charles Hammond Gibson Jr. wrote in
1939, his crystal ball no cloudier than most. To help things along,
he took a step that has helped us visualize life a century ago: He
made arrangements for his family's residence at 137 Beacon St., in
the heart of Boston's Back Bay, to become a historic house museum.
Gibson House, as it's called, opened to the public in 1957; now, it
is attracting some long-overdue attention and undergoing needed
restoration work. Refreshment of the wallpapers alone will bring
back some idea of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   But the real charm of the house is the hodgepodge of its
decorations. Three generations of Gibsons and their many servants
lived in this narrow, five-story row house, and it's the task of
Edward W. Gordon, museum director, to figure out the waves of
Gibsonian acquisition and redecoration.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the stuff belonged to the Gibsons. When the house got
under way as a museum, it attracted many a donation of the unloved
and the unwanted. ``For a while, we were a drop-off center,'' says
Gordon, who is also president of the New England Chapter of the
Victorian Society in America, as he eyes a sentimental ``Rogers
Group'' sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The house itself is good-goods: the Victorian view of the French
and Italian Renaissance. Built in 1859-60 for Charles Gibson's
grandmother, Katherine Hammond Gibson, the house is a sort of
architectural equivalent of that Victorian-Renaissance favorite,
Longfellow's verse translation of Dante's ``Divine Comedy.'' In
decor, however, it's more complicated; the house we see today is
less Katherine Gibson's than her daughter-in-law Rosamond Gibson's,
and her taste did swerve once or twice. Just because she loved all
things French did not mean that Rosamond, Charles's mother, would
not find a place for Colonial Revival, which was American, or Art
Nouveau via Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Our story begins with the great landfill that transformed tidal,
smelly Back Bay into the modern grid of streets that became
Boston's newest swell neighborhood. Katherine Gibson had lived on
Beacon Hill till her husband, who imported rum from Havana,
perished in a steamboat accident. What impelled her move to Beacon
Street can't now be known, but move she did, into a brick and
brownstone house designed in the Italianate mansard style by Edward
Clarke Cabot, architect of the Boston Athenaeum. While the widowed
Katherine was one of the first women to own a Back Bay house, she
had comfort and company right next door (at 135 Beacon), in an
almost identical house built for her nephew. Cabot, by the way,
probably designed more than just the house: In the mid-1800s,
interior decoration was still largely the province of architects.
It would not surprise Ed Gordon to discover that Cabot furnished
the upstairs music room with the heavy French Renaissance Revival
cabinets and chairs that now crowd the downstairs front hall.
</P>
<P>
   When Katherine died in 1888, the house went to her son and his
wife, the former Rosamond Warren. Boston owes its position in
medicine to the doctors Warren. A smallpox vaccine was developed by
Rosamond's great-uncle, General Joseph Warren, who died at Bunker
Hill in 1775; John Collins Warren would help found Massachusetts
General Hospital and pioneer in the use of ether as an anesthetic.
Gibson House has other historic links as well, though visitors
hoping to find a connection with Charles Dana Gibson will be
disappointed, Gordon says, for the illustrator who gave us the
all-American ``Gibson Girl'' was a New Yorker. But Charles Hammond
Gibson Sr. played in the first known lawn tennis game in America,
at the family's summer place on Nahant in 1874, the year of Charles
Jr.'s birth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Beacon Street house hers, Rosamond set about imposing
her taste. She was ``a huge fan of French culture,'' Gordon says;
she traveled to France often and hired a French governess for young
Charles and his two sisters. She did over the music room in what,
for the time, passed for 18th-century French, a LouisSomething
homage of striped wallpaper and furniture painted white. Edith
Wharton and Ogden Codman were doing it, too; none of this was
``period'' or ``authentic,'' but that wasn't the point. Big, comfy
sofas, meanwhile, assured Boston that Rosamond hadn't gone native.
She observed the usual pieties, continuing to display the Warren
family's China Trade dinner service and the Gibson family's
Limoges. She also continued to hang the Old Masters. That the
paintings were mostly copies _ a good Guido Remi but a bad Raphael
_ was no cause for shame but proof of travel and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Then it gets interesting. We don't know the circumstances, but
Rosamond swerved into the kind of Art Nouveau called ``Aesthetic.''
This was not really a detour but the natural progression of the
French taste for the exotic. In the 18th century it had been
Chinoiserie, concocted of Chinese plus Persian plus Indian, and all
of it made in Europe for Europeans. Then, in 1854, America pried
Japan open for Western trade, and Japonisme was the rage.

   Rosamond's bedroom suite, all 15 pieces of it, may look like
bamboo, but it was made of bird's-eye maple in 1871 by John Vaughn
near Boston's Union (North) Station. The ``Shinto gate'' curtain
rods and the ``Japanese gate cresting'' headboard tell you it's
Japanese. The bedroom fireplace looks backward and forward in time.
The Gibson house was a modern residence when built, with central
heating and indoor plumbing, and its many fireplaces burned coal.
Gordon points out that Rosamond had her fireplace deepened so she
could have a proper log fire under her Colonial Revival
mantelpiece. The unglazed tile fireplace surround is ``after
William Morris,'' making Arts &AMP; Crafts another link to the
aesthetic movement. Altogether a room rich in competing
19th-century styles.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosamond's gift to Boston (and Victorian studies) is the
astonishing wallpaper she hung in the front hall and staircase
hall. This is called ``Japanese leather.'' It was indeed made in
Japan, but of molded paper with the raised pattern gilded. ``Meiji,
19th century,'' Gordon says of the Japanese origin for the swirls
of pomegranates, roses, and vines. He smiles and adds: ``It really
gives you an idea of what was meant by the `Gilded Age' in
America.'' Americans who traveled in Europe would have come across
walls covered in the similar ``Spanish leather,'' which was
sometimes real and sometimes pretend. Victorians liked figuring out
how to produce the pretend, such as pinchbeck, an affordable metal
that passed for gold. Victorians patented wallcoverings that
mimicked wood paneling, such as lincrusta and anaglypta; Gordon
relishes showing off American-made lincrusta, a sort of linoleum,
used for the dressy wainscoting in Rosamond's bedroom and Charles's
red study.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, keeping up with the Gibsons must have taken some
doing, and later on Charles played the eccentric for all it was
worth. He wore spats, well after they'd gone out of vogue. For a
costume party in Newport, he donned Chinese silk pajamas with
matching yellow slippers. He was always writing to the kings and
queens of England, and back would come, on red-crested paper, a
typed acknowledgment signed by a courtier. These he framed and
displayed in his dressing room, along with a pinup of Joe Louis in
boxing trunks. Long before he died in 1954, he tried the house out
as a museum. Chairs were roped off, museum style, with gold cord.
People sat on the stairs drinking Charles's martinis, which, during
Prohibition, he made with his own bathtub gin. The world, he knew,
would not look on his like again, and Gibson House would be his
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles wrote descriptions of some of the reception rooms and
attempted a catalog. But the only known interior photograph is a
picture in Life magazine for March 24, 1941, of novelist John P.
Marquand interviewing Charles, all starch collar, in the library.
Gordon speculates that something of Charles's nostalgia for the
past went into the eponymous hero of ``The Late George Apley,''
which won Marquand the Pulitzer Prize in 1937 for its satiric view
of Beacon Street in genteel decline.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hammond Gibson Jr. may have been as stuffy as his photo
portraits made him look; in any case, people back then didn't grin
into the camera. He spent a year studying architecture at MIT and
was interested in architectural history; he was a poet, as the
English royals well knew, and his good works included service on
the Boston Parks Commission. He also did the family genealogies. He
inherited the house in 1934, and in 1939 he wrote his prophetic
letter on understanding the Victorian Age. The recipient was
William Sumner Appleton, founder of the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities; Charles was pitching his
family home as a historic house museum. Alas for Charles, SPNEA's
mission was Colonial and Federal. Nor did the Massachusetts
Historical Society care to buy the house.
</P>
<P>
   So the Gibson House as a public museum slumbered on, till the
world discovered the Victorians. As a tourist destination, Gordon
admits, the house has a long way to go. ``The best-kept secret in
Boston,'' he says. There are guided tours; they run Wednesday
through Sunday all summer. (Telephone 617-267-6338 for further
information.) A friends organization raises money and puts on house
parties for people interested in architecture, antiques, and
literature. Film companies use the house; scenes from the
Merchant-Ivory production of ``The Bostonians'' were done here in
1983. A commercial for Victoria's Secret was shot in Rosamond's
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   And now restoration has started, under Gary Wolf Architects of
Boston and contractor Tom Cooney of South Boston. There are 27
windows to restore or repair, as well as the roof to mend, and this
will take all (and more) of the initial matching grant of $35,000
from the Massachusetts Historical Commission. Only when the
envelope is secure can Gordon push on to restore and refresh the
interiors. She who gave her name to the Victorian Age died in 1901.
That centennial is an anniversary to shoot for.

AS THE APPLES BLOSSOM, A BITE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's apple blossom time: romantic, nostalgic, wonderful days in
May when all the world is fragrant, blooming, and beautiful. No
flowering tree so symbolizes spring in America as the apple.
</P>
<P>
   Brought by the first European settlers, apple trees were
necessary for survival in Colonial times and in settling the West
as well. As soon as land was cleared and a cabin built, an apple
orchard was planted. Fresh apples and apple butter were staples in
the settlers' diets. Boiled apple cider and vinegar were used to
preserve food, and alcoholic applejack, always in demand, could be
used to barter for flour, sugar and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Johnny Appleseed sowing apple seeds all over the
country is well known, but American Forests, an old, nonprofit
organization devoted to greener cities, ecosystem restoration, and
helping people plant and care for trees, has researched his real
story.
</P>
<P>
   Born John Chapman in Leominster, Mass., he left home after
serving in the Revolutionary War to start apple tree nurseries, and
then sold the trees to settlers for about 6 cents a piece. As the
settlers began moving to western Pennsylvania, then to Ohio and
beyond, he would precede them by some years going by canoe or on
horseback. In a yet unpopulated area, he would purchase a tract of
land, surround it with a rough brush fence and sow more than 1
million apple seeds on the land. When the settlers finally came, he
would return to his nursery and sell his apple trees to make their
lives more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A frontiersman of intense religious passion, he believed that
all things existed simultaneously in the physical and spiritual
worlds, and as he planted, he preached as well. Many legends arose
about him, hiding underwater and breathing through a reed to escape
hostile Indians or walking barefoot across a frozen lake. He died
in 1845 in Fort Wayne, Ind., at the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his trees are long gone, but a few years ago, an
original 140-year survivor was found by Jeff Meyer, American
Forests' horticulturist, who took cuttings and has propagated this
original tree. A very large, vigorous fast-growing tree, it
produces winter apples, called Rambo. If the idea of growing Johnny
Appleseed's historic tree appeals to you, a 3-foot sapling, which
comes with a certificate and a planting tube to protect it from
deer and weather, can be ordered ($35, plus $8 shipping).
</P>
<P>
   American Forests Historic and Famous Trees Program has other
fascinating trees. How about progeny of the tulip poplar originally
planted by George Washington at Mount Vernon in 1785? Or a white
oak from Franklin Roosevelt's Hyde Park home? You might consider
offspring of the crab apple shading John Kennedy's gravesite in
Arlington National Cemetery. On a lighter note, American Forests
has descendants of trees from Graceland, Elvis Presley's estate. To
learn more about this planting program, check out American Forests'
Web site at www.amfor.org/fht, or call 1-800-320-8733.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to grow apple trees as ornamentals, they are lovely
and produce more than enough fruit for applesauce, apple butter,
pies and such. Excess fallen fruit on a lawn needs to be raked up.
To grow apples as a serious crop requires pruning, using resistant
varieties, spraying for diseases and insects, and usually growing
dwarf varieties so one does not have to harvest with a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're waxing romantic about apple blossoms, why not a
little sentimentality for moms on Mother's Day? I just picked a
small bouquet of violets, actually weeded them out of the perennial
bed, to be honest. But it brought back memories of days long gone
when, in our woods, I would pick little bouquets of violets for my
mother. There were always wild violets along the path.
</P>
<P>
   Violets are reliable as the return of spring. I grow lots of
them, purple, white, pinkish, speckled and every hue in between. Or
rather, I let them grow, for they volunteer everywhere, their seeds
carried by ants and other critters.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers grow in the lawn, where they are a considered a weed
by the green carpet crowd. In the perennial bed, they have to be
kept from surrounding weaker plants. In the vegetable garden,
despite being edible, they get plowed under. By summer's end their
tired leaves wear brown-splashed fatigues. But in May, they are
fresh and young, ready to be picked for a nostalgic nosegay for
someone special.
</P>
<P>
   Because violets can become intrusive, where to plant them and
let them run is a challenge. Some spots to consider are under
shrubs, behind the mulch pile, around the play equipment, beside
the garage, edging the vegetable plot, along the property line.
Like all wildflowers, they will move slowly southward to follow the
sun. Good soil, moisture and fertilizer will help them grow strong.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should have some sprigs of violets to pick, for like
the ever-returning spring, their cheerful faces add grace to the
month of May. And someday, they may stir a memory for your family
of days long gone.

REVOLUTION'S ROLE TO SELF-DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The adventurer's life is determined by destiny. And
fate surely will be involved in Walter Zenga's arrival Saturday in
Columbus, Ohio, some 500 years after the city's namesake Genovese
explorer sailed to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga also has discovered a new world, one in which
soccer-specific stadia are rare. Now Zenga will lead the Revolution
into their eighth game of the season, the first in Columbus Crew
Stadium, which has been constructed as a model for MLS teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe my team will become a part of history,'' Zenga said
Sunday. ``But my team must not think about the inauguration and the
party, it must think only about Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, not Christopher, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga believes the scale of the Crew Stadium, with 22,500
capacity expandable to 40,000, is ideal for the MLS. Zenga has
regularly performed in much larger stadia in grander cities, but he
concluded his Serie A career in Italy in a perfectly acceptable
43,000-capacity stadium in Genoa with Sampdoria, a club presided
over by a Boston University graduate, Enrico Mantovani.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been done before the first season, not in the
fourth season,'' Revolution midfielder John Harkes said. ``But it's
exciting that this is being done and that someone had the vision
and the dedication to put this kind of money into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution again will be shorthanded. Zenga (right groin
strain) and Mike Burns (hamstring) are probable. Harkes (right knee
ligament sprain) is questionable. Imad Baba (groin), Richard
Goulooze (calf strain), and Paul Keegan (right knee ligament
sprain) are doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution are facing three successive road games,
they seem optimistic. They have earned only 1 point in four home
matches, but have won twice and tied in regulation time in three
away games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to play the same soccer in Foxborough,'' Zenga said.
``But it isn't any different playing home or away.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, road trips to Eastern Conference sites can be relatively
stress-free, with little distracting or negative influence from
opposing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, expectations could be unrealistically high for the
Crew, who are in first place in the Eastern Conference after
playing their first seven matches on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the experienced players, this is another fairly big
game,'' Burns said. ``But you never know how the younger players
will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this is a conference game for us and we are
a win away from being in first or last place. We are going to have
to at least match (Columbus's) intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, an Azorean club in Portugal's Second Division, will
meet the Revolution in an exhibition at Foxboro Stadium 7:30 p.m.
June 10 . . . The Midnight Riders supporters group will travel by
bus to Columbus and to East Rutherford for the MetroStars game May
29.

NO `WRONG WAY' TO FIGHT SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might think that a group dedicated to abolishing slavery in
distant corners of the world would win near-universal acclaim in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But for its efforts, a 6-year-old Somerville, Mass. group is
instead accused of promoting slavery by the world's most celebrated
humanitarian outfit, the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Working in concert with Christian Solidarity International, a
Zurich-based human rights group, the American Anti-Slavery Group
purchases slaves in the Sudan at about $50 a head and releases them
into freedom.
</P>
<P>
   To its supporters, the group's members are human rights heroes;
to UNICEF they are simplistic do-gooders seemingly oblivious to
their role in perpetuating bondage.
</P>
<P>
   The group's front man is an escaped slave from Mauritania who
lectures church groups and students on the evils of modern-day
slavery. The group has also recently kicked off a high-powered
advertising campaign, and has the obligatory Web site
(www.anti-slavery.org), on which it wages war with its loudest and
credible adversary, UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads resemble 19th century slave-era handbills, combining
historical authenticity with a slick veneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Sudan,'' one announces, ``it's easier to buy a slave
than a VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for kids, such a polished sell job risks reducing
slavery to a road show: Moctar Tayeb, runaway slave, on tour.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a quibble compared to the shocking endurance of the
slave trade. Estimates of the number of modern-day slaves vary
wildly, both because the areas where the practice survives are not
exactly receptive to clipboard-carrying census takers, and because
there is some disagreement on what constitutes slavery.
</P>
<P>
   But best guesses place the number of Sudanese slaves in the tens
of thousands and the number of slaves in Mauritania (which on paper
has outlawed slavery three times, most recently in 1980) at
anywhere from 200,000 to a million.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudan, the age-old slave trade has a modern twist: the
on-again, off-again 30-year civil war has created a domestic
market, as Muslim forces take Christian prisoners and make slaves
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-slavery effort is simple: the American Anti-Slavery
Group raises money in the United States, representatives of the
Zurich Christian Solidarity International travel to Sudanese
villages, buy the slaves and return them through the war zone to
their homes and families. These trips are not for the humanitarian
hobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, however, sees counterproductive meddling. The children
whose freedom is bought are returned to a war zone, UNICEF says, in
which they could easily become captives again in short order.
UNICEF also argues that freeing one slave at a time accomplishes
little. And most important, in UNICEF's view, the practice of going
into the Sudan and buying slaves endorses the moral legitimacy of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jacobs, the co-founder of the AASG, dismisses the
criticism. He argues that slavery is going on already, and there is
no evidence that his group's activities are promoting further
trading. UNICEF, he charges, criticizes his group, but has done
almost nothing itself to attack slavery. The American Anti-Slavery
Group has at least done something.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs does admit that his group has little idea of what has
become of the 4,000 people it claims to have freed. They may remain
free; they may just as well have returned to bondage.
</P>
<P>
   And, as UNICEF says, it is indeed hard to see how freeing one
slave will liberate thousands, or that buying slaves, even to
emancipate them, does not tacitly encourage slavery.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. I am haunted by an image: one Sudanese child _ just one
_ walking the road to freedom, thanks to $50 in western currency.
He doesn't care about geopolitics or debates over whether the ends
justify the means. He has something precious in a thoroughly
oppressive land. For now, at least, he is free.

THE UGLY TRUTH BEHIND SUDAN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 20, 1998, Saleh Idris went to bed as a
member in good standing of the international business community. He
had friends on every continent and held ownership stakes in
business enterprises in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. One of
those enterprises was the al-Shifa pharmaceutical packaging plant
in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 21, al-Shifa was demolished by American
cruise missiles. Later that day, President Clinton justified the
attack by saying that al-Shifa was, in fact, a chemical weapons
factory linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who allegedly
masterminded the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania earlier that month.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that on the night of Aug. 21, Saleh Idris, member
in good standing of the international business community, went to
bed branded as an international terrorist. The campaign to defame
his good name continues to this day, orchestrated from the offices
of President Clinton's National Security Council. It is a
despicable campaign, made more so by the fact that everyone
involved in it knows that the charges against Idris are false.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh Idris was born in Sudan and educated in Saudi Arabia. He
went into the banking business in Riyadh and prospered. Along the
way, he made friends in high places in many countries, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Idris bought al-Shifa. In an interview with Chris
Isham of ABC News, Idris said he did so in part because of his
desire to give something back to the country of his birth. At the
time it was destroyed, al-Shifa supplied more than half of all the
medicines consumed in Sudan, a desperately poor country in
desperate need of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly enough, the Clinton administration knew none of these
facts when it ordered up the cruise missile attack. It did not even
know that Idris was the owner of al-Shifa. Unencumbered by facts,
members of the president's national security team explained the
attack as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Al-Shifa was an adjunct to the Sudanese military-industrial
complex. It was closed to the public, fenced off, and heavily
guarded by Sudanese military personnel. In addition, a soil sample
taken from the plant's premises proved that anthrax was being
produced there.
</P>
<P>
   The international press corps quickly made hash of all but the
last of these assertions. Al-Shifa was not part of the Sudanese
military-industrial complex. It was open to the public. There was
no fence, and no guards patrolled its grounds (other than the night
watchman who was killed in the attack).
</P>
<P>
   Caught, the administration reconfigured its story. The new,
improved version argued that Idris had a web of double-secret
business connections to bin Laden that could not be discussed
publicly lest sources and methods be disclosed. These connections
combined with the findings from the soil sample merited his
designation as a terrorist. Idris's financial assets in the United
States were frozen as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Being a man of considerable means, Idris hired the law firm of
Akin Gump (where his good friend and former Democratic National
Committee chairman Robert Strauss was a partner) to refute the US
government's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Akin Gump, in turn, hired the private investigative firm of
Kroll and Associates to do a complete background check on Idris.
Akin Gump also hired Tom Tullius, chairman of the chemistry
department at Boston University, to do a scientific inquiry into
whether or not al-Shifa might have been manufacturing anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The Kroll investigation exonerated Idris of any ties, real or
imagined, to bin Laden. The scientific inquiry concluded that
al-Shifa was not a chemical weapons manufacturing facility and that
the US government's soil sample was almost certainly a false
positive. The net result of these investigations proved to all but
senior Clinton administration officials that bad intelligence and
bad science had led to a terribly mistaken bombing mission.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, 1999, the US Treasury Department tacitly admitted as
much by unfreezing Idris's financial assets. Treasury did so under
orders from the Justice Department, which did so on instructions
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, true to form, continued its attack on
Idris's good name. At the same time it was (de facto) lifting
Idris's designation as a terrorist, National Security Council
staffers told reporters that Idris was in fact a terrorist who
maintained reprehensible associations.
</P>
<P>
   Having successfully sued the US government to unfreeze Idris's
financial assets, Akin Gump is now planning to sue the US
government for compensatory damages (in the amount of $30 million).
As surely as the government settled the first case, it will settle
the second.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better if the government simply confessed its error,
apologized to Idris for its disgraceful conduct, and immediately
compensated him for the damage done to his business. But this is
the Clinton administration, and the right thing to do is the last
thing it would think of doing.

   When Mount St. Joseph Academy announced it was having a spring
freshman prom, Robin Carney was wicked excited. After all, she had
a date and money for all the trappings (limo, tickets, photographs,
hairdresser, and makeup artist).
</P>
<P>
   But like a twisted Cinderella story, Carney _ a plus-size
clothes wearer _ discovered over the months that there was no way
she could go to the ball. Unfortunately for her, most retailers
don't carry prom dresses larger than a juniors's size 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my hands and knees begging stores,'' says Carney, 14,
whose dad, Bob, drove her all over Boston. ``Every store that had
my size (22) had old-lady clothes. And it was way too expensive to
have a dress made.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ugly side of prom season. While many high school
girls are tanning and cruising malls to prepare for one of the most
anticipated events of the teenage years, plenty of plus-size girls
are sitting at home in tears. (Girl magazine reports that millions
of US teenagers fall in the plus-size range.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to find dresses,'' says Jessica Boyle, 17, a
size 22 junior at Saugus (Mass.) High School who has shopped all
over the area. While she can find formals that fit, they aren't the
stylish ``must-have'' gowns featured in magazines like Prom and
Seventeen. They're mature-looking gowns designed for older women _
a big ``no'' for a student in high school.

   ``I think society has this idea of the perfect gal: the skinnier
the better,'' complains Boyle. ``I understand that I'm a teenager
and that most people my age are not my size. Still, it's unfair
that larger-size clothes are ugly. They're lime green and orange.
They say `Look at me. I could be nuclear waste.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the plus-size teen market _ size 16 and up _ has
come a long way from the past. Young, rail-thin celebrities like
Calista Flockhart are under attack for sending the wrong message to
13- to 18-year-old Americans, who number 11.3 million, according to
the US Census Bureau. The new magazine Girl meticulously places
teenagers of all shapes and sizes on its pages. Stores like Sizes
Unlimited, The Avenue, Lane Bryant and 14/16 Plus cater to the need
for fashionable casual clothes ranging from women's size 14 to 32
(Lane Bryant stops at size 28). A junior's size 18 is the
equivalent of a women's size 14, while a junior's size 32 compares
to a women's size 28.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence of eating disorders and miracle diets, however,
still stands as testimony to the fact that many in society can't
shake the notion that ``thin is in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been really slow to catch on that 50 percent of
teenage girls are size 11 or above,'' says Susannah Cahn, fashion
director at Girl, which conducted its own research. ``It's time
people accepted that. Retailers need to carry cool clothes in all
different sizes. That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But many store owners say they won't carry junior gowns over
size 18 because manufacturers charge them extra fees. ``I fight
with manufacturers every day,'' says Yolanda Cellucci, owner of
Yolanda's boutique in Waltham, Mass. ``When I say I need a 20 or
22, they tell me I have to pay $50 more. . .They think their
dresses look unattractive that large and they don't want to ship
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda's will special order dresses for girls. The store also
custom makes plus-size prom dresses but the price tags are a
shocker: $400 to $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be flip and suggest that plus-size teens who are
frustrated with their shopping options should just lose weight.
Well, Robin Carney has tried that. ``I've tried so many times to be
a size 0,'' she says. ``I tried Slim Fast, dieting, and exercise. I
couldn't do it. I've always gone back to being Robin, not being
skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, she says, it wouldn't matter. ``I think if
you're not going to be a size 2 it's not a big deal,'' she says.
``Not everyone has to be perfect in a bathing suit.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but try explaining that to the kids at school. Stephanie
Patalano, 17, says she used to come home bawling everyday after
school. ``I grew up my whole life with people making fun of me. .
.Now that I look back on it, it's terrible...the mean jokes. You
can't tell an overweight person not to care. Of course I care.''
</P>
<P>
   Her freshman year in high school in Medford, Mass., Patalano
remembers people snickering as she walked down the hall. ``Someone
threw paper in my hair once,'' says the size 22-24 senior. ``There
there was a big fight . . . someone said something. I said
something back. A fist flew and that's all I needed.'' (Patalano
won the fight.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Society thinks everyone should be a small size. It's what
we're brought up to think. It's a crock . . . I think size 2 is
disgusting. Calista Flockhart? I don't think she's beautiful at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the plus-size prom set, there's a new fairy
godmother of sorts in the Boston area. Jody Abrams, a plus-size
social worker who missed her prom, has opened Bodacious Babes in
Saugus, Mass., a contemporary clothing store dedicated to sizes 14
to 36. She carries everything from lingerie to business suits for
women to hip prom dresses for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what it's like to have a choice of not just
one thing, but many things,'' Abrams says. ``It's really affirming
when a customer comes in your store and starts screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robin Carney, who was ready to tell her date that she
couldn't go to the prom, discovering Bodacious Babes was a dream
come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the car, my Mom was like `Don't get your hopes up,' ''
recalls Carney. ``She was doubtful because we had been to so many
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Carneys crossed their fingers and walked in. ``It was
glorious,'' says Robin's mother, Susan. ``It was like walking into
heaven. There were five beautiful dresses to choose from . . . it
was the first time we've ever had that kind of selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter broke down in tears when Robin tried on the
gowns and Robin recalls her mother said, ``You're going! You're
definitely going!''
</P>
<P>
   What a change from the days when Robin _ looking for dresses for
school dances _ would stand outside plus-size stores while her
mother brought career-looking adult dresses to the door for her to
discreetly approve. ``I get wicked self-conscious,'' Robin
concedes. ``Who's going to see me there?''
</P>
<P>
   Says Susan, ``A trip to the mall turned into something very sad.
. .I would get her something. She hated it. She would get in a bad
mood and ruin the dance. . .It's so important for teenage girls to
dress right.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin's silver prom gown was certainly a hit at school but
sadly, five of her close friends (all plus-size) couldn't afford
Bodacious Babes' prices (prom gowns average $189). Rather than go
to the prom, the friends (who told Robin they were too
self-conscious to be interviewed) came to Robin's house and sat on
her bed to watch her get ready. ``They were all crying when I put
on my makeup,'' says Carney. ``They said, `I want to go so bad! I
should have gotten a dress!' They were all so surprised. They'd
never seen a plus-size dress so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carney walked into the dance hall, she says, ``I felt like
a princess. . .My dress was awesome.'' Still, she felt somewhat
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some skinny friends there. But most of my friends are my
size. I wanted my close friends there.''

DNA LINKS KILLER TO UNSOLVED CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An imprisoned killer long suspected of a string
of horrific rape-murders in the San Francisco area has been linked
to the unsolved knife slayings of an Albany couple in 1981, DNA
tests show.
</P>
<P>
   Charles ``Junior'' Jackson, 62, a onetime Oakland handyman
serving a life term for a 1982 Oakland murder, is the prime suspect
in the Nov. 22, 1981, killings of contractor Henry Vila and his
wife, Edith, during a nighttime burglary of their Albany hill home,
police officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Bill Palmini said DNA tests that hadn't been invented
when the Vilas were killed ``conclusively'' linked Jackson to the
murders, which had baffled a generation of detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never forgot this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmini said police had reopened their probe of the Vila murders
with the aid of Alameda County prosecutor Rockne Harmon, a
nationally known DNA expert who has been helping homicide
investigators use state-of-the-art DNA tests to break unsolved
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said Jackson may not be charged with murdering the Vilas
until scientists complete DNA tests on evidence from a string of
other killings in which he may be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make a charging decision until we address all the
cases we think he's committed,'' the prosecutor said. ``I can't
tell you if we've even scratched the surface with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is serving a life term in Folsom prison for the January
1982 murder of Joan Stewart, a San Francisco City College biology
professor who was raped, strangled and stabbed along a wooded road
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators declined to disclose the other cases in which
Jackson is emerging as an uncharged suspect. But according to court
records from his 1982 trial, Harmon, who prosecuted the case, told
the judge at the time that he believed _ but could not prove _ that
Jackson had committed these crimes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The rape and stabbing murder of Ann Johnson, 27, the wife of a
Highland Hospital physician, in her home in Oakland's Montclair
District in August 1975.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rape and stabbing murder of Marian Kiteas, 42, in her home
in the El Cerrito hills, eight days after Johnson died.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rape and stabbing murder of Gladys Fielding, whose age was
not specified, in her Castro Valley home in May 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is described in court records as an illiterate high
school dropout who first was convicted of a felony _ burglary _ in
1953. Over the next 30 years he repeatedly was imprisoned on
convictions for burglary, rape, assault and child molesting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he was paroled from prison after serving three years on
a rape conviction and returned to Oakland, where he began working
odd jobs, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Nov. 22, 1981, police believe Jackson broke into
the home of Henry Vila, 62, who was asleep in an upstairs bedroom
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Vila, roused by the noise, is thought to have confronted the
intruder, and was knifed to death in the bedroom after a struggle.
Edith Vila, 59, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her
bed. The house was ransacked and the phone was ripped out of the
wall, suggesting to investigators that Edith Vila may have been
trying to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, after Jackson was arrested for Stewart's
murder. Investigators targeted him for the Vila killings, but
police could not find sufficient evidence to charge him, Palmini
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, investigators decided to try DNA testing on a
sample of genetic material that had been collected at the murder
scene and preserved. Two scientific labs compared the material with
a sample of Jackson's DNA, and both concluded the samples matched
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's technology, the DNA can uniquely identify the
person,'' said Harmon, who began using DNA science as a trial
prosecutor and later served as a DNA expert in the O.J. Simpson
trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is encouraging police departments to use DNA to
re-investigate unsolved murders and rapes. He said that if DNA
evidence has been preserved, it's relatively simple to compare it
with the DNA of a suspect _ or, in cases in which no suspect has
emerged, to compare it with a state database of criminals' DNA that
is being compiled.

675,000 FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOST MEDICAID, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: REPEATING for those needing.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leap from welfare to work has cost two thirds
of a million low-income people their health insurance, an advocacy
group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through 1997, about 675,000 former recipients and
their family members lost coverage under Medicaid, according to a
study released by Families USA, a Washington-based advocacy group
that concentrates on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is the government's insurance program for low-income
families. About two thirds of those losing this coverage _ 62
percent _ were children, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on data drawn from the government's Health Care Financing
Administration, which administers Medicaid, and the U.S. Census
Bureau's Current Population Survey, the Families USA report is the
latest tremor in a series of aftershocks following the 1996 law
restructuring welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by President Clinton in August of that year, the law
requires people to go to work after being on welfare two years and
limits their number of years on welfare to five over their
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republican congressional leaders have trumpeted the
law's success in dramatically reducing the number of families on
welfare. Welfare rolls have declined by 4.6 million people, or 38
percent, since Clinton signed the legislation. In January 1993,
when he took office, welfare rolls totaled 14.1 million people. The
figure now is 7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 federal law followed similar state welfare-to-work
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, mostly liberals who opposed the law and predicted it
would cause increased suffering and homelessness for the very poor,
say the welfare-roll decline masks the obstacles that former
recipients face.
</P>
<P>
   They fill mostly low-income jobs which rarely offer health
insurance, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony here is that the reward these people get for doing
what they were supposed to do is they are now uninsured,'' said Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of Medicaid enrollees has declined from 41.2
million in 1996 to 40.3 million in 1997, the latest year for which
the federal Department of Health and Human Services has data.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack attributed the former recipients' loss of Medicaid to
several factors.
</P>
<P>
   Government rules permit new workers to stay on Medicaid for a
year or more after leaving welfare. But state and local social
service agencies often do not inform them that they are still
eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Others have exhausted their transition benefit and now find
themselves among the 43 million Americans who have no health
insurance whatsoever. And still others who are dropped off welfare
rolls without steady employment lose Medicaid coverage even though
their income remains low enough to qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicaid and welfare are no longer bound together _ as
they were before 1996 _ people now going on welfare do not
automatically receive Medicaid. They must apply for it through a
separate procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``needs to be much more careful in monitoring the
Medicaid program to make sure these cutoffs do not occur,'' Pollack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the government information available goes only
through 1997, he added, ``We should expect there are many more
people who will lose health coverage with each passing year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Matt Salo, senior policy analyst for the National Governors
Association, called the Family USA report numbers ``fuzzy.'' But he
added the states take the issue seriously. ``States are looking
past welfare reform to see what cracks have developed, and they're
moving quickly to fill the holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute
of Government in Albany, N.Y. said better technology may help ease
the problem of low-income workers lacking health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case managers need the tracking capability to help families be
independent and get what they are entitled to,'' he aid.
</P>
<P>
   In March the Department of Health and Human Services issued a
guide to help ex-welfare families keep their health insurance.
Officials sent the guide, called ``Supporting Families in
Transition,'' to welfare and Medicaid administrations nationwide
along with a letter asking them to enroll ``working families
unlikely to enter the welfare office, but (who are) likely to be
eligible for Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute,
which is aligned with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council,
said the Medicaid problem is actually a victory in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to subsidize the health care of low-income workers is
where this debate is headed,'' he said. ``But we wouldn't be headed
there if we hadn't broken the back of the old welfare system.''

FORD MOTOR CO. LOSES KEY DECISION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawyers suing Ford Motor Co. will be allowed to
present evidence that the automaker allegedly hid problems with an
ignition part to avoid environmental fines that could have totaled
$50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford called the allegations that it had hidden flaws in the
module from environmental officials ``unfounded and wildly
speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Michael Ballachey has
ruled that plaintiffs' attorneys had gathered enough evidence of
the alleged coverup to permit them to present the claim to the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough evidence here to allow that,'' Ballachey said,
overruling Ford's motion to bar the information.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in the largest class-action lawsuit to go to
trial against a U.S. automaker, with opening arguments reset to May
18. It was another setback for the nation's second largest
automaker, which has sought to have the case dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Ford withheld from federal highway safety
officials and the public information about defects in its Thick
Film Ignition (TFI) module that could cause potentially dangerous
stalling in millions of 1983-1995 cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on behalf of past and present Ford owners in
California, seeks more than $3 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has denied the allegations and says that although some
earlier vehicles had a flawed module, it offered to fix them in the
worst cases and improved them in later models. While acknowledging
the flaws could make engines quit, Ford claims there was no safety
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The TFI module controls current sent to the spark plugs and was
mounted on the engine's distributor. Internal Ford documents show
that some versions of the module were prone to heat failure.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal and state law, ignition modules are considered to
be part of a vehicles emissions system.
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey's ruling allows the plaintiffs' attorneys to argue at
trial that Ford had hidden flaws in the module not only from
federal highway safety officials, but also from environmental
regulators who had the power to impose far larger fines.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fazio, one of the plaintiffs' lead attorneys, said in a
legal brief that Ford faced a potential $10,000 fine from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for each module that it failed to
cover under a required five-year, 50,000 mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   He alleged that Ford's internal records showed the company had
failed to cover at least 500,000 modules that owners had replaced
at their own expense, meaning Ford potentially faced a $50 billion
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford faced the risk of such a penalty, which provided yet
another powerful motive to conceal the TFI problem,'' he said in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also failed to report TFI problems to the EPA and the state
Air Resources Board, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Warmer, one of Ford's attorneys, said in court papers
that the plaintiff's environmental allegations were ``hot rhetoric
and colorful visions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford denied that it had failed to honor its warranty obligations
and contended it had no duty to report module problems to
environmental officials, Warmer said.
</P>
<P>
   To show that Ford should have reported the TFI problem to
environmental officials, he argued, the plaintiffs would have to
prove it actually caused excessive exhaust levels, and they
``cannot come close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff's allegation that Clean Air Act concerns provided a
motive for Ford to conceal TFI module performance issues is ...
unfounded and wildly speculative,'' Warmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballachey concluded the plaintiffs had shown enough evidence
to present the issue at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence included Ford's sworn statement earlier in the case
that TFI module problems could cause erratic engine performance,
described as bucking and running rough, he said.

D-BACKS PUT SQUEEZE ON VENDOR

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For Scott Fader, competing head-to-head with the
Arizona Diamondbacks has been like a Little Leaguer going up
against Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But, since opening day of last season, Fader has stood his
ground, not backing away from inside pitches, not striking out.
He's even slapped a single or two.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has irritated the suits with the big offices in
Bank One Ballpark. So much so, they recently decided to play (begin
ital) real (end ital) hard ball with Fader, making his life like
facing Randy Johnson _ blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a 10-pound bat.
</P>
<P>
   With one arm tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have money and power, no doubt about it,'' Fader says.
``The best I can do is talk to guys like you.''
</P>
<P>
   At every Diamondbacks home game, Fader and his small squad of
vendors sell an alternative program called ``Beat on Baseball''
outside Bank One Ballpark. The cost is $1.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of last season, the Diamondbacks' official
program sold for $5. As time went on and Fader thrived, the
Diamondbacks lowered their program price to $3.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, it was dropped to $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to put me out of business,'' Fader says. ``It's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Diamondbacks President Rich Dozer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to put him out of business,'' Dozer says.
``We're just trying to increase our circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, would eventually have the same result. &QL; 
STRIKE 2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing new. At the beginning of last season, team
officials sent a squad of security goons to roust Fader and his
vendors from the street outside the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want ``Beat on Baseball'' sold near the ballpark,
claiming it was illegal. The team even got the city of Phoenix to
go along with it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we prevailed on that one,'' Fader says. ``And I eventually
got a check for $10,000 from the city for my troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just the beginning, though, like scoring a run in the top
half of the first inning, before the opposition sends up its heavy
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's become a vendetta by people at the
Diamondbacks,'' says Joseph Kreamer, Fader's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Kreamer sent a letter to the team's attorney threatening to sue
over what he calls a predatory attempt to bankrupt Fader. ``If you
try to deprive someone of their business, you can be liable for
those acts,'' Kreamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozer says the Diamondbacks aren't trying to create a monopoly,
but only responding to economic pressures. He also says management
is upset because Fader prints an advertisement for a topless
nightclub on the back of his program.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got us in a tizzy was the family-entertainment thing,''
Dozer says. ``We say baseball is family entertainment and they're
selling a publication that has strip-bar ads in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a smoke screen,'' Fader says. ``They allow `The
(Arizona) Republic' to be sold at the ballpark, and they run ads
from all kinds of strip clubs.'' &QL; 
CURVE BALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a local television station produced a news
segment taking Fader to task for the risque advertising in his
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The report was done by a station that has a contract to
broadcast Diamondbacks games. The same station that broadcasts the
``Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hypocrisy here,'' says the attorney Joseph
Kreamer. ``Scott's really getting hurt by this, and it's sad in
light of (Diamondbacks managing general partner) Jerry Colangelo's
new book. Here's Jerry offering advice for small-business men (in
the book), then turning around and smashing one for doing something
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Fader says he has no plans to back off. ``If I started selling
beer, do you think Jerry would lower his price to a buck?'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fader's a little guy in the big leagues. It's tough enough
to make solid contact when the opposition's hurling high hard
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He's got no chance against spitballs. &QL;

   SALEM-TRAVEL (Salem, Mass.) _ Stand by the second-story window
of the nearly two-century-old Custom House here and you will find
yourself gazing over a waterfront that once linked the young United
States with the world's farthest corners. All's quiet now. But the
place once saw ships in such numbers _ en route to or from China,
Europe, the West Indies, the South Seas _ as to rank Salem among
the nation's most cosmopolitan and wealthy cities. Salem is
probably most closely linked in the public imagination with the
1692 witchcraft trials, but it contains much more of interest. By

DESPITE ALL IT HAS GOING FOR IT, THIS `DREAM' IS NO GREAT SHAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Michael Hoffman's idea-stuffed production of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' spins vigorously. Setting the film in
turn-of-the-century Tuscany, he uses Shakespeare's material for
Freudian implications, as a way to shake off the binding clothes of
the Victorian era _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, we see the quartet of young lovers (Calista
Flockhart, Christian Bale, Anna Friel and Dominic West) passed out
in a field, blissfully stripped of their clothing. It feels,
though, as if it took a long time and lot of work to get them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman put together a dream cast for this film. It includes
Flockhart (in the first film she has done since ``Ally McBeal''),
Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci and
David Strathairn. Everett, speaking his lines with magisterial
slowness, plays Oberon, the fairy king who sets the romantic farce
into motion when he spies the young lovers _ some of whom are
chasing the wrong person _ and decides to meddle in human affairs.
He sends his emissary, Puck (Tucci), to cast spells that will bring
the right couples together. Puck fails miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oberon's beloved Titania (Pfeiffer) falls for Bottom
(Kline), a strutting blowhard and no-talent actor who has been
transformed into a donkey. The makeup choice here is smart. It
exaggerates Kline's features instead of putting a donkey mask on
his head, so that we can still see his shining, cocky eyes _
although from certain angles, his floppy ears and big teeth make
him look more like a live-action version of Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   The director's use of actors parodying themselves in an unreal
world can be overwhelming. His 1991 comedy ``Soapdish'' is a
delirious farce of entrances and exits, with Kline as _ again _ a
vain, minimally talented egomaniac actor. ``Soapdish'' also
featured Robert Downey Jr. as a furiously ambitious network
executive who, in the movie climax, staggers off shattered by the
truth and wrings his hands in such a freakish and unique gesture
that you'll be hitting the rewind button to watch several times.

   ``Dream'' could've used Downey's ethereal quick-wittedness.
Hoffman was asked if he considered Downey for Puck _ a role he was
born to play _ and the director replied that he wanted Downey, but
that the actor was having legal troubles and could get no
dispensation to leave the country. (Tucci doesn't do a bad job. His
Puck is closer to the ground, more lizardlike than you imagine.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Midsummer'' features peculiar staging, in which once again the
American actors seem not up to what's asked of them, Flockhart in
particular. She's tantrum-y _ as if she's losing an argument with
McBeal's Fish _ and races through her lines, seemingly in an effort
to finish as quickly as possible. Pfeiffer, shot through the
soft-focus Fairy-cam, is wistful and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's heavy-lidded emphasis seems strange at first, but he
at least shows some command. The movie itself, as oddly deft as it
is sometimes, does not. Coming after ``Shakespeare in Love,''
movies using the Bard now have a huge obstacle to surmount, and ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' isn't up to the race. It feels more like
one of love's labors lost.

   AMERICAN-BALLET-MEN (New York) _ Attention must be paid this
season to the male dancers at American Ballet Theater. Rarely has
so much talent at the top come together at one time: like planets

   SALEM-TRAVEL (Salem, Mass.) _ Stand by the second-story window
of the nearly two-century-old Custom House here and you will find
yourself gazing over a waterfront that once linked the young United
States with the world's farthest corners. All's quiet now. But the
place once saw ships in such numbers _ en route to or from China,
Europe, the West Indies, the South Seas _ as to rank Salem among
the nation's most cosmopolitan and wealthy cities. Salem is
probably most closely linked in the public imagination with the
1692 witchcraft trials, but it contains much more of interest. By

 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown is getting
weird on us. I'm not talking about micro-management, like issuing
orders to branch librarians about preschool reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   I say promote the 11-year-old boy who wants to read to little
kids for a half-hour a week in the library. I don't know if he's
the Reading Wizard, as he claims, but he's the Wizard of Spin.
</P>
<P>
   How'd he like to be mayor?
</P>
<P>
   No, micro-managing and issuing edicts are not weird for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   What's weird is all the stuff he's trying to take away from
people, from shopping carts to cars. He's willing to take any kind
of vehicle from the despised of the Earth, as long as it's a
vehicle for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is going to be re-elected as mayor anyway, but he's still
running scared. He may not prove as popular with voters as he is
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hell having an ego as big as the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when most voters want to check out.
</P>
<P>
   So now we have government by confiscation _ and not just
confiscating tax money to pour into City Hall sinkholes.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like he'll never get those shopping carts out of the
clutches of the homeless, so now he has another election-eve ploy.
He wants to take cars from people arrested for allegedly soliciting
prostitutes or buying drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor sees a threat to the city from degenerate
out-of-towners in BMWs. As if there aren't enough degenerate San
Franciscans, in BMWs or otherwise. But now we have to talk about
outside agitators for degenerateness.
</P>
<P>
   Great city forced to import degenerates.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many official city cars will be seized. If such a
law existed a few years ago, a few high elected officials I won't
name would have been doing a lot of walking.
</P>
<P>
   So here we have this allegedly liberal city that's going fascist
on us, and worse, getting its ideas from Oakland. The city is going
to seize and hold people's property before they've been convicted
of anything.
</P>
<P>
   I had to check the World Almanac to see if the Constitution had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's still there in the Fifth Amendment, the thing about how
no person shall be ``deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.''
</P>
<P>
   But heck, by the time the courts sort it out, the election will
be over.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This from the Irish end of the Internet: ``News flash: White
House _ President Clinton announced today an all-out bombing
offensive against England will begin in two weeks, unless a peace
accord is ratified by England and its break-away province of
Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a joke, Guinness-fueled. This is not a joke: Gloria La
Riva, our favorite perennial leftist candidate for governor, is off
to Belgrade with Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general. La Riva
is taking a video camera and says she's going to document ``U.S.
genocide against the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked how long she'll be gone. ``Until Thursday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if that's enough time to cover a genocide, but I
think she meant next Thursday. I wished her luck, and told her to
stay away from embassies.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;   &QC;  I'm more of the school that the United States is committing
stupidicide in the Balkans. The accidental bombing of the Chinese
embassy is so stupid it must make Clinton crazy, given how much
he's sucked up to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to bomb a Chinese facility, why not hit Los Alamos?
The U.S. technical blunder in bombing the embassy sends a clear
message to the Chinese: Maybe those bomb secrets they stole from
the United States aren't so valuable after all.

BOOK TELLS HOW SOME DOWN-TO-EARTH GUYS MADE IT BIG IN HARDWARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank may not be familiar,
but if you're a homeowner, you sure know their store.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the suburbanite's main supplier. The place new
homeowners go and drop a hundred bucks every week for what seems
like years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever wondered how such a great concept developed, or how
much a retailer could influence American life, read ``Built from
Scratch: How A Couple of Regular Guys Grew The Home Depot From
Nothing to $30 Billion'' (Times, 332 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Marcus and Blank, who founded Home Depot, wrote the book with
Bob Andelman.
</P>
<P>
   They offer great stories about starting and running a successful
business.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take many numbers to show how well these guys are
doing. In 20 years, the chain has gone from four stores in Atlanta
to 775 stores with 160,000 employees, or associates. The chain's
combined sales total, as the title suggests, $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This book is an open, no-holes-barred look at two brilliant yet
down-to-earth men. Their honesty shines through. They even reveal
their secret to success _ in the first paragraph:
</P>
<P>
   ``Take two Jews who have just been fired, add an Irishman who
just walked away from a bankruptcy and an Italian running a no-name
investment banking firm. Add _ then subtract _ Ross Perot. Lease
space from a shrinking discount chain, fill a space the size of a
football field full of hardware (and a few hundred empty boxes,)
and you've got a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus and Blank were fired after successfully running Handy
Dan, a subsidiary of Daylin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Without financing, the two embarked on a new type of hardware
retail store that had been in the back of Marcus' mind for years.
By 1979, he was ready to test that concept with the first Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   But they still needed money, and that is where Dallas
billionaire Ross Perot entered the picture, although only briefly.
Perot, Marcus and Blank, along with investment banker Ken Langone,
had put together a deal in which Perot would put up $2 million in
exchange for 70 percent ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But after several meetings _ and Perot's veto of Marcus owning a
used Cadillac as a company car _ Marcus knew that the relationship
would not work. He later notes that Perot's original investment of
$2 million would be worth about $58 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   But an investment group came forth with the money, and Marcus
and Blank had their company.
</P>
<P>
   There authors provide many other interesting vignettes and many
sound managerial concepts that you've read in other books, but, in
this case, also see in practice.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about building customer loyalty, employee incentives,
building relationships with vendors, giving back to the community
and providing shareholder return. Ultimately, they show how doing
all of these things right can not only make a lot of money but can
also profoundly affect a culture.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus likes to tell of speaking before the Rotary Club in
Atlanta in 1981 and asking how many people considered themselves
real do-it-yourselfers. At that time, about 20 people raised their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when he made the same speech to the same club and asked
the same question, only 15 of the 450 people did not raise their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had changed America,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   This book will tell you how.

   ``Leader to Leader: Enduring Insights on Leadership from the
Drucker''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation's Award-Winning Journal
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Frances Hesselbein and Paul M. Cohen
</P>
<P>
   Jossey-Bass, $27
</P>
<P>
   This collection of essays written by top management gurus and
managers is pulled from ``Leader to Leader,'' a quarterly started
three years ago by the Drucker Foundation. The publication has no
set agenda, but it opens the floodgate for what is on the minds of
managers, such as Drucker, and those in the thick of the work, such
as Southwest Airlines Chairman Herb Kelleher. Leadership, teams,
the global economy and the information economy are some of the
topics of these interesting essays.

   ``What Every Manager Needs to Know About Sexual Harassment''
</P>
<P>
   By Darlene Orlov and Michael T. Roumell
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1997, the number of sex discrimination claims rose
42 percent, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. Of those claims, the number involving sexual harassment
more than doubled. Darlene Orlov, a human resources consultant, and
Michael Roumell, an attorney specializing in labor and employment
law, have written a good and practical overview, complete with
concrete ideas on how to write and implement policies.

   ``Smart Guide to Starting a Small Business''
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Rogak
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $10.95
</P>
<P>
   At any given moment, about 7 million adults in this country are
contemplating starting their own businesses. This book focuses on
how to plan, start and operate a business during its first year. It
covers topics such as finding the best business to fit your
personality and skills, finding the financing and how to market
your venture. The author owns a publishing company and has written
more than 25 books.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a million potential voters discovering the
Internet every month, the presidential candidates have rushed to
hang their campaign banners in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1996, when the World Wide Web was less pervasive, about a
dozen slickly packaged campaign 2000 sites have sprung up in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   To voters, they offer a wealth of information on the candidates
and their families, speech texts, position papers and travel
schedules. As Internet bandwidth expands, the sites may offer full
audio and video services.
</P>
<P>
   What they do not offer is a critical look at their own campaigns
nor, for that matter, any others. For political comparison
shopping, Web users must look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To candidates, the Internet is a way to reach wealthier and
better-educated citizens, who are more likely to vote, and younger
ones who are politically uncommitted. It is a new way to recruit
volunteers, correspond with the public and sample their opinions,
and _ if regulators can be persuaded to go along _ even collect
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's appeal to presidential contenders is further
heightened because it's much cheaper to reach voters on line than
with such traditional methods as TV ads, direct mail or
door-to-door visits. Some experts predict the Internet could do
much to level a political playing field long tilted in favor of the
best-financed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But a site's best value to a candidate may lie in the ability to
easily create databases of thousands of loyal supporters. It takes
only a few taps on a keyboard to send highly targeted messages to
large groups via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 campaign is going to be the first election cycle when
there'll be some real campaigning done on the Internet,'' said
Craig Crawford, an analyst for the Hotline, an online political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who learn how to ``successfully inform, persuade,
enlighten, and even confuse voters'' on line will win votes, said
Gary Selnow, a professor of computing systems at San Francisco
State University and a leading scholar on the advent of political
activity on the Internet. To do so, he said, they need to sponsor
state-of-the-art ``home pages'' while also offering extensive
electronic bulletin boards and access to their data libraries.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual tour of the Web sites uploaded by the current crop of
presidential hopefuls reveals that nearly all of them are doing
just that. Perhaps predictably, the well-financed front runners _
Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Republican Texas Gov. George
W. Bush _ have also mounted the most extensive Internet efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Updated nearly every day, the Gore and Bush sites feature
interactive polling on such issues as the Colorado school killings
and video and audio clips of their campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain's site features a ``2000 Campaign Store'' where
for $25, fans can buy a videotape on line that tells the Arizona
Republican's life story.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish such tasks, presidential hopefuls have hired a
host of Internet advisers. Campaign finance records show that up to
half of the top-paid 20 presidential consultants in the first three
months of 1999 did all or some of their work on their candidates'
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And yet just how this process will evolve remains uncertain.
Some cyber-gurus doubt whether the Web can reach undecided voters
in significant numbers, a vital element in close races. ``I don't
think we're going to see that yet in 2000,'' the Hotline's Crawford
says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared to traditional campaign methods, the Internet
remains a bargain. ``For what you put into it, you get a real good
return on the dollar,'' noted Roger Salazar, Gore's political
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Pat Buchanan pays his webmaster a hefty $50,000 annual
salary, Bush compensates his top political consultant, Karl Rove,
at the far heftier rate of $2,400 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, yet another Republican contender with deep pockets
and a richly textured Web site, spent $200,000 on video production
costs in the first quarter of 1999, plus hundreds of thousands more
in direct mail appeals. The elaborate Forbes site, which he opened
to formally announce his candidacy in March, costs less than
$10,000 a month to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The 21st century is about to begin, and nobody can afford to
look like they belong to the previous century,'' says Michael
Cornfield, a political scientist who teaches a course at George
Washington University on the impact of the new media on U.S.
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet is going to change American politics and
American campaigning, but it's not going to do it the way
television did it with one dramatic event like the Kennedy-Nixon
debates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like the telephone or electricity. There are going
to be small changes by the hundreds of millions. And we're going to
look back in five years and say oh, the late 1990s and the year
2000, that's when it began.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same factor that's feeding the use of the Internet
for commerce, for E-mail. There are millions upon millions of
people who are going on line to do everything and politicians go
where the people are,'' Cornfield adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other great attraction for politicians is (they) like to
go on at length on their views, and in contrast to television,
radio, even newspapers, you can go on as long as you want on your
own Web site and nobody's going to cut you off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   While some presidential Web sites invite visitors to make
on-line contributions with their credit cards, the Federal
Elections Commission bars such donations from counting toward
much-prized federal matching funds in the hope that it will deter
donors seeking to skirt campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sharon Snyder, a spokeswoman for the commission: ``A credit
card is only a promise of payment, not the actual payment. There's
not the required documentation as you get with a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the candidates can only ask would-be donors to follow
up their on-line pledges by sending along their checks. But the
contenders want the commission to reverse its ruling, which has
stood since 1983, before the Internet played a role in politics. A
decision is due in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is clearly a much more significant part of life
than it has been in previous election cycles. It's really an
opportunity for more people to get involved in the matching
process,'' argues Eric Hauser, press secretary to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, who is challenging both Gore for the Democratic nomination
and the FCC for its ruling.

   The presidential scene in cyberspace:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley _ Easy to navigate, low-key entry offers overview
of Vice President Al Gore's sole current primary rival.
(http://www.billbradley.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore _ The site offers daily updates, interactive surveys, a
Spanish-language version and the fanciest graphics this side of
``Star Wars.'' If you sign up for E-mail snippets, you'll be
automatically invited to volunteer in your region.
(http://www.algore2000.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander _ Well-crafted Web site touches all key bases,
including online volunteer forms. (http://www.lamaralexander.com/).
When Internet search engines initially directed surfers to a
nautical supplies store in Ohio, (http://www.lamaralexander.org/),
the campaign was obliged to buy up that name too.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer _ Standard fare oriented to campaign theme of
``Advancing America's Values.'' Interns can volunteer their
services on line. (http://www.bauer2k.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan _ Finely tuned online menus link to in-depth
position papers, upcoming campaign events and instructions on how
to join Buchanan's ``Internet Brigade.'' (http://gopatgo2000.com/).
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush _ Front-runner's cyber-castle features video and
audio clips plus more family lore than most rivals offer. There's a
direct appeal for Hispanic support. (http://www.georgewbush.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole _ Stark ``Welcome Page'' opens to a fully
featured site, including links to charities providing aid in Kosovo
crisis (Dole recently visited the war zone) and an on-line version
of the campaign's 129-page quarterly report to the Federal Election
Commission. (http://www.edole2000.org/).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes _ One of the most extensive of the presidential Web
sites and one of the few that faithfully provide daily updates.
Visitors can easily click on hot links to virtually the entire
Republican political online world, plus a host of conservative
organizations and most mainstream news outlets. Press-friendly
stance extends to online sign-up for campaign coverage credentials.
(http://www.forbes2000.com/).
</P>
<P>
   John Kasich _ With short and snappy domain name, Ohio
congressman urges supporters to get involved and shows them how.
(http://k2k.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes _ Packed with speech texts and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   (http://www.keyes2000.org/).
</P>
<P>
   John McCain _ Slick site highlights toll-free number and ``get
involved'' page to process volunteers and would-be donors online.
Campaign items can be bought through an on-line store.
(http://www.mccainforpresident.org/).
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle _ No misspelled words here: Yet another highly
polished site, replete with thumbnails of Quayle's
vice-presidential years. (http://www.quayle.org/).
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith _ Visitors are bidden to buy Smith's $50 ``share'' in
America's future but aren't shown how. While there's a tab for
``media appearances,'' there were none in the offing in mid-May.
(http://www.smithforpresident.org/).
</P>
<P>
   For an independent view:
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics1'' offers strong Web starting point to examine
would-be presidential players.
(http://www.politics1.com/p2000.htm/).
</P>
<P>
   For basic up-to-date politics news, political junkies also often
turn to ``All Politics'' (http://cnn.com/allpolitics/).

   ``The Internet is clearly a much more significant part of life
than it has been in previous election cycles. It's really an
opportunity for more people to get involved in the matching
process,'' argues Eric Hauser, press secretary to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, who is challenging both Gore for the Democratic nomination
and the FCC for its ruling.

`A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM': A `DREAM' OF FOOLISH MORTALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pot luck Shakespeare is enjoying a special film vogue now, what
with the tempting prospect of hearing a ``forsooth'' or
``methinks'' from the least likely sources. The strategy of choice
is picking a travel agent's dream setting, casting attractive
actors no matter what (e.g., Keanu Reeves in ``As You Like It''),
giving an outrageous costume party and hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   But even for the Leo-does-Romeo set these productions need more
than visual flash if they hope to work. Take away smooth ensemble
acting and a unifying vision, and you're left with the dramatic
equivalent of watching Noah load the ark.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoffman's fussy production of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' is just such a parade of incongruities, with performances
ranging from the sublime to the you-know-what. Hoffman has
transported the play's humans and fairies to Tuscany, where they
switch partners under the influence of trickery from Stanley
Tucci's mischievous Puck.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no magic potion to banish the film's awkwardness or
make it more than a string of intermittent acting highlights.
Puck's ``Lord, what fools these mortals be!'' looks like an
understatement under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt unwittingly, this ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' shows how
high the bar has been raised by ``Shakespeare in Love.'' The allure
and cleverness of that film, not to mention its far more
Shakespearean spirit, make it a hard act for a hodgepodge to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Michelle Pfeiffer's commanding loveliness as the fairy
queen Titania, and her ability to speak of such things as ``my
bower'' with perfect ease, can offset the decision to have the
actors grapple awkwardly with bicycles. Not even the digital
butterflies that flutter through the opening credits look as
magical as they should.
</P>
<P>
   The hoodwinked characters of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' are
meant to be mismatched much of the time. But not like this. The
distraught Helena, played as a hand-waving, eye-rolling ditz by
Calista Flockhart, hardly fits into the same film with David
Strathairn's reserved Duke Theseus, or with Rupert Everett as a
slinky Oberon.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, like the inspired Kevin Kline as the ham actor Bottom,
is utterly at ease with this material in ways that many other cast
members are not. This Oberon makes himself seductive just by
speaking, but the film isn't taking any chances. It finds as many
ways for Everett to lounge around bare-chested as the play will
allow.
</P>
<P>
   Similar directorial inspiration guides the love-struck adventure
of the title, to the point where the film's most nubile actors _
among them Christian Bale as Demetrius, Anna Friel as Hermia and
Dominic West as Lysander _ wind up discreetly naked in the woods
the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's more memorable than just about anything
else they do. Though West and especially Ms. Friel approach their
roles with gratifying ease, Bale is once again given the cheesecake
treatment and little occasion to rise above it. This production
tarts up the play any way it can.
</P>
<P>
   One ostensible attraction is the vast woodland set built on
Fellini's old Cinecitta sound stage, a murky fairy kingdom where
much of the film takes place. Though Hoffman loads it with
high-minded clutter that recalls his ``Restoration,'' he can't
change the fact that the film is stuck in dark, unappetizing
surroundings despite its intermittent Italian scenery. The Tuscan
hill town of Montepulciano is largely wasted here.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the town that Kline's Bottom saunters into view,
looking natty and faintly woebegone in ways that invoke Marcello
Mastroianni's courtly presence. Kline's very appearance here is a
relief, since the role of Bottom is so very right for him.
</P>
<P>
   The play's trajectory is never clearer than in chronicling
Bottom's actorly affectations, then watching him come to life in
the bewitching presence of Ms. Pfeiffer's Titania. Literally
transformed into an ass, as the film uses ingenious donkey makeup
and Kline actually brays in witty fashion, this Bottom carries with
him all the story's possibilities of tenderhearted redemption
rising out of inspired folly.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical carryings-on of Bottom and company provide the
film's best attempts at comedy. Staging a play about Pyramus and
Thisbe with a troupe including Bill Irwin, Roger Rees and Sam
Rockwell (as the beauteous heroine), Bottom's acting company
delights its late-19th-century audience in ways Hoffman's film can
only occasionally manage.
</P>
<P>

`TEA WITH MUSSOLINI'` MUNCHING SCENERY LIKE CRUMPETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it ``Divas Live, 1935-1945.'' Or to be more accurate,
``Divas on Film.'' The grandes dames on parade in Franco
Zeffirelli's sudsy, picturesque World War II drama, ``Tea With
Mussolini,'' include Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith
and Lily Tomlin. With the exception of Ms. Tomlin, playing the
relatively thankless role of a butch, heavily suntanned
archeologist stomping around northern Italy 60 years ago, these
estimable actresses have been encouraged to chew up the scenery
every chance they get. And oh do they grab at it!
</P>
<P>
   Once you accept the notion that ``Tea With Mussolini'' aspires
to be little more than a kind of British-Italian ``Steel
Magnolias,'' with a patina of World War II-movie uplift, it becomes
a pleasure to watch its stars shamelessly hamming it up. Their
thespian antics go a long way toward concealing the weaknesses of a
makeshift screenplay (by John Mortimer and Zeffirelli, based on a
chapter from the director's autobiography) that has many more
characters and events than it can comfortably handle.
</P>
<P>
   The runaway winner of the acting diva derby in terms of
attention-getting lines and haughty attitudinizing is Ms. Smith, as
Lady Hester Random, widow of the British ambassador to Italy and
quintessential British snob. Lady Hester is the de-facto leader of
a small colony of English women living comfortably in Florence in
the late 1930s. Anything that doesn't conform to her refined code
of English aristocratic propriety becomes an object of withering
scorn. Take desserts. Observing a sundae being served, she sniffs
that Americans, whom she despises, have even found a way to
``vulgarize ice cream.'' Craning her long neck, her saucer eyes
bulging with indignation, Ms. Smith suggests a rare, high-strung
shore bird crankily peering down its beak at the more common
species on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Hester, and her circle, known in Florence as the
``Scorpioni,'' who have tea together every afternoon at 4,
ostentatiously worship art and poetry, and lead a charmed
expatriate life. When that existence is imperiled by the rise of
Italian fascism and some smashing of windows, Lady Hester, who
admires Benito Mussolini, arranges for herself and a pushy young
British journalist to meet with Il Duce and receive his personal
assurance that no harm will come to them. With her illusions of
self-importance, she is completely taken in by his propagandistic
flimflam and promise of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi plays Arabella Delancey, a flighty, weepy art lover
and would-be painter who flutters around Florence with a mongrel
pooch named Billyboy to whom she is passionately attached. Ms.
Plowright's character, Mary Wallace, is a bit more hard-headed than
Arabella, but still quite dithery. Until Italy aligns itself with
Germany, and English culture suddenly becomes unfashionable, she is
the tutor and surrogate mother to Luca (Charlie Lucas), an
artistically inclined Italian boy whose businessman father wants
her to instill him with English genteel manners.
</P>
<P>
   But once the political tides have shifted, Luca is abruptly
whisked off to Austria for training to become a good little Nazi.
When he re-appears late in the film to execute some improbable
heroics, he is 17 and played (badly) by a different actor (Baird
Wallace).
</P>
<P>
   Flitting in and out of the film is Elsa Morganthal (Cher), a
former Ziegfeld showgirl whose marriages to much-older men who die
have left her swimming in money. A free-spending, free-loving art
collector whose dream in life is to possess Picasso's ``Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (even if it is a fake), Elsa appoints
herself Luca's patron and later entrusts her fortune to a
suspiciously handsome and helpful young Italian lawyer who also
becomes her lover. Flouncing around in garish period fashions, Cher
is as likable as ever, dispensing her special blend of gawky true
grit and zany regality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini,'' which spans 10 years, beginning in 1935,
follows the declining fortunes of these women, who are eventually
rounded up, bused to another city and forced to share crude
barracks-like quarters. When they are transferred to a hotel, Lady
Hester believes that her supposed friend Il Duce has intervened.
She is sadly mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' belongs to an old-fashioned tradition of
escapist moviemaking in which star turns, romance and melodrama are
swirled together with pretty scenery and a dash of camp into a
confection that used to be called ``a woman's picture.'' If ``Tea
With Mussolini'' isn't believable for a second, on its own
glamorous terms it isn't half-bad.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>

`LEILA': IN IRAN, ISLAM WINS, MODERNITY LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``Leila'' was shown as part of last year's New
Directors/New Films series in New York. Following are excerpts from
Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on
March 28, 1998. The film opens in New York City on Friday.(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   The calculating monster who pulls the strings in Dariush
Mehrjui's heartbreaking film, ``Leila,'' is an imperious
mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi) whose selfishness and pride put her
in the same elite league with some of Hollywood's most formidable
Gorgons.
</P>
<P>
   On learning that her daughter-in-law is infertile, this
termagant, who is obsessed with having a male grandchild to carry
on the family line, systematically undermines the marriage of her
only son, Reza (Ali Mosaffa).
</P>
<P>
   For the Iranian filmmaker, the situation illustrates the brutal
clash between modernity and Islamic tradition in contemporary Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The world in which Reza and Leila (Leila Hatami) live
luxuriously is a land of superhighways, cellular phones and modern
biotechnology. But it is also a place where women dress in black
and wear chadors much of the time and where polygamy is an accepted
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens, the recently married lovers are celebrating
Leila's birthday with lavish gift-giving and fancy parties. They
seem to have everything _ wealth, youth, beauty and large adoring
families.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, Leila learns that she is probably infertile.
Although Reza swears he doesn't want children, Leila instantly
decides she has failed her husband. And when her mother-in-law
begins browbeating her to allow Reza to take a second wife, who
might bear him a son, Leila's self-esteem crumbles before her
relentless onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign waged by this horribly believable matriarch takes
many forms and never lets up. There are incessant haranguing phone
calls and sudden unannounced visits in which the mother-in-law
vacillates between sugarcoated wheedling and dire warning.
</P>
<P>
   She instills paranoia in Leila by insisting that her son has
told others he really does want children, and she enlists her
relatives in a search for suitable candidates to audition for the
role of second wife. As Leila's fragile self-worth evaporates, she
becomes depressed and withdrawn and continually tests the devotion
of her dashing husband, who can't really comprehend what she is
going through.
</P>
<P>
   Leila's father-in-law is sympathetic to Leila but powerless to
soften his wife's stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is Leila herself who persuades the reluctant and increasingly
frustrated Reza to meet with various young women. Some of the
movie's most upsetting scenes find her waiting alone on the street
for him to return from these meetings, in which hardheaded
negotiation plays a major part.
</P>
<P>
   When Reza finally meets someone he finds satisfactory, he drives
by the corner where Leila is waiting so she can get a glimpse of
the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Leila's despair reaches a howling peak on the night Reza arrives
with his new wife for the wedding party at the house where Leila
has been exiled to a guest room. Unable to bear the pain, she
rushes to her parents' house and collapses in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Without being simplistic, the gripping and beautifully acted
film suggests that in Iran, contemporary attitudes toward love and
marriage and modern psychology are no match for the combined force
of social pressure and Islamic tradition when ruthlessly
appropriated as weapons of intimidation. ``Leila'' is, in a word,
devastating.

SETTING SAIL FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WITH JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You read it here first, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson will not seek the Democratic Party presidential
nomination in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   However, you don't need to call up Dionne Warwick's psychic hot
line to divine Jackson's intentions for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this paradoxical Jacksonian utterance to the Democratic
National Committee last fall:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not decided to run the race in 2000, but I will set the
pace in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that meant he intended to raise certain kinds of issues,
particularly those relating to low-income and minority persons,
whether he was actually running or on the sidelines coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the portrayal of himself as the pacer suggested in
a Freudian way that he was leaning more toward making the race
again than just kibitzing.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing speculation about his 2000 intentions could not help
but make the possibility of a fourth bid for the White House more
tantalizing for him. The clincher, of course, is the spurt of
favorable publicity he has received from his free-lance diplomatic
coup in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That almost certainly elevated the thought of giving it another
shot from the tempting to the irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   As sure as tides flow in and out, Jackson has decided to run. He
knows about that tide in the affairs that Shakespeare referred to _
how it must be taken at the flood. And his poll numbers now are
flood-level. He must take the plunge now or wonder evermore about
what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's gotten too long in the tooth to envision a
better opportunity after the century turns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson cannot make his announcement at this time.
That wouldn't look right. It would seem too opportunistic, coming
so soon after the release of the three American soldiers who were
kidnapped and held by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jackson must wait until either a Kosovo peace
agreement is reached or there is indisputable progress toward one.
He will then be able to portray his negotiations with Milosevic as
a breakthrough that helped get the negotiations on track.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson can't wait too long. If he does, he won't be able to
attract the funding and support to mount a credible race. Jackson
knows that; therefore, he is likely to get off the dime before
summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be exceedingly good for the Democratic Party,
although many of the party's movers and shakers view that prospect
with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who shudder at the thought of another Jackson
presidential campaign think that his previous campaigns have
divided the party and diluted its strength.
</P>
<P>
   They can see him raising exalted expectations among
African-Americans, only to have them dashed again when Jackson
doesn't win the nomination. And he won't, again. And thousands of
disillusioned African-Americans will stay home again on Election
Day, they say.
</P>
<P>
   There are Democrats who maintain that in his three bids for the
presidency, Jackson inadvertently has been the best asset the
Republicans had going for them. And they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that was the case, this is another day. The dynamics
of the 2000 race suggest that a Jackson candidacy would boost the
Democrats' chances of retaining the White House and of regaining
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's running will indeed be pace-setting. His direct
involvement will assure that meaningful issues are addressed and
that the eventual winner will be toughened sufficiently in the
process to take on George W. Bush and the public relations
illusionists who have made him out to be the leader and thinker
that he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The operating assumption here is that the Republicans will not
be smart enough to nominate Elizabeth Dole, who really does possess
charisma, political skill and the vision thing.
</P>
<P>
   All of the good that Jackson could do for the Democrats in the
end game of the 2000 campaign, however, could go for nothing if
they don't have enough political courage to nominate him for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jackson must face reality and accept the
opportunity to become vice president as the only road to the
presidency that is open to him.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson on the ticket as the vice presidential nominee, the
Democrats would mobilize millions of African-American, Hispanic,
female and low-income voters who otherwise would sit out the
election. They could provide the margins of victory in both the
presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   As Shakespeare said: ``There is a tide in the affairs of men
...'' Jackson's star is on the rise. The Democrats would be
well-advised to ride it with him.

CBS' MINISERIES IS A SEXY, COMPLEX TAKE ON FRANCE'S VISIONARY
HEROINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding like a Neanderthal, I must admit that
the Joan of Arc put forth in Sunday's CBS miniseries is the
15th-century equivalent of Britney Spears' see-but-don't-touch
sensuality and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' kick-butt persona.
Either way, it's a turn-on for at least half the population.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other half, the feminine angle of Joan as a
strong-willed independent woman kicking up dust within a man's
domain more than suffices, particularly once she emerges as a
different kind of leader: one able to handle a sword and move
people with equal skill.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions, however, are beside the point. ``Joan of Arc,''
which airs at 8 p.m. CDT Sunday and Tuesday on CBS, is a powerful,
sensitively made movie that's as refreshing as it is surprising.
Refreshing, since heavily promoted made-for-TV movies are usually
hollow cinematic contraptions. Surprising, since it's airing during
May ``sweeps,'' when such bloated silliness (like the recent
``Noah's Ark'') is the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Director Christian Duguay has coaxed one mighty fine performance
from 16-year-old Leelee Sobieski, who successfully embodies Joan of
Arc's most amazing contradictions _ a girl who becomes a country's
heroic, headstrong savior even though she can neither read nor
write.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne d'Arc, as she was known in France, was a simple peasant
girl who rescued France from defeat in one of the darkest periods
of the Hundred Years' War with England. Her first great triumph was
to lead a French army against the English who had laid siege to the
city of Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, her first triumph was getting past her stern father,
Jacques (Powers Boothe), a well-intentioned provider who, like
pretty much everyone else, didn't quite know what to make of Joan's
deep desire for her country to be unified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your daughter is very outspoken,'' a visitor tells Jacques.
``She is young,'' is his response. ``She'll outgrow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracks Joan: ``I'll never outgrow simple decency.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a different kind of child early on: good-hearted and
spirited. As she's written here, she often battled her father over
her generosity to others. Some historians believe that Joan may
have been clairvoyant _ that she could hear everyone's thoughts.
But ``Joan of Arc'' doesn't mess around with such matters. It's
made clear that as early as age 10, Joan was having religious
visions and hearing what she believed were the voices of saints.
</P>
<P>
   Telling others that the voices were persuading her to help King
Charles VII of France drive the English from French soil was met
with skepticism, to say the least. Rather quickly, Joan is
perceived as either a young girl clearly devoted to and driven by
God, or a mad woman who needs to cleansed.
</P>
<P>
   Joan first travels to the town of Vaucouleurs and persuades one
of the king's representatives, Sir Robert de Baudricourt (Maury
Chaykin), to provide an escort to see the king, played by Neil
Patrick Harris of ``Doogie Howser'' fame. (Don't worry, he'll grow
on you.) Much of southern France had recognized the young king as
ruler _ but his enemies, the English and the Burgundians (French
citizens who supported the English), controlled Paris and the
northern part of France.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Charles had never been crowned because the city of Reims,
where French kings were crowned, lay in enemy territory. His
situation hopeless, Charles figured it would be harmless to at
least listen to Joan, who might or might not be the fabled savior.
</P>
<P>
   Joan is victorious in battles (there are bloody fight scenes,
but none involving Joan, who was used mostly as a figurehead) and
in bringing a unified front. The English come to see Joan as an
agent of the devil, and eventually imprison her for witchcraft and
heresy.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Sobieski shines, displaying different layers of
emotion, wit and intelligence. Despite the abuse of her English
captors _ including rape and torture _ she continues to insist that
her visions and voices come from God. The exchanges between Joan
and Bishop Cauchon (Peter O'Toole), Charles' spiritual adviser, are
priceless. The bishop eventually believes her, but it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of Joan burning at the stake is an emotional one, shot
with restraint and earnestness.
</P>
<P>
   This brief synopsis cannot contain all the characters and their
plot-skewing connections to Joan, but Duguay introduces each
character with much-needed clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The director uses his four hours to paint full portraits of the
key players, particularly the obsequious-but-devious bishop, who
fought his own internal demons in deciding whether to believe
Joan's claims of talking to saints. He's like a jealous crybaby,
wanting to remove her if only to mask his own failings as a
clergyman who has never heard anything resembling a higher power.
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Strauss is surprisingly effective as La Hire, a
war-weary mercenary who takes one look at Joan on the battlefield
and asks, ``Shouldn't you be in bed, child?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the only time ``Joan of Arc'' kowtows to Hollywood
caricature, making La Hire the rough military man softened by a
young girl's innocent devotion. Unless, of course, you count the
hint of sexual attraction between Joan and Jean de Metz (Chad
Willett), described in press materials as ``the handsome young
nobleman'' who becomes a trusted ally. He always seems to be
available for intimate fireside chats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Joan of Arc'' is dramatically enticing and, dare I
say, educational. Many authors have dealt with her life, so you can
imagine the various interpretations. George Bernard Shaw, in fact,
portrayed Joan as a woman with Protestant beliefs who opposed the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Here Joan is a girl who makes choices, who understands her
context in history, who is a natural leader, and whose experiences
shape and expand her actions.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Joan of Arc'' succeeds because it uses Joan to ask other
penetrating questions: Does God talk to you literally or does he
speak to you through inspiration, ideas and bursts of creativity?
Was Joan hearing her own intuition, or was she actually hearing
voices and being guided?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she remains a mysterious figure. This didn't make it
into the movie, but some historians claim another person was burned
at the stake in her place. Just something else to ponder.

`IRIS BLOND': WHERE TO GO IN DESPAIR? TO A PSYCHIC, OF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Iris Blond'' is a bittersweet romantic comedy that serves as a
reminder of a time when frequent film imports from Italy and France
constantly enriched what has come to be known as the quality of
life in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not every film was a ``400 Blows,'' ``Breathless'' or ``Claire's
Knee,'' or even ``Cinema Paradiso'' or ``Il Postino,'' nor did it
herald the arrival of a new wave or a new auteur.
</P>
<P>
   But even the modest among these films enlightened audiences
about new directors, new actors, other cultures, other landscapes
and other attitudes and customs.
</P>
<P>
   So in its skilled, commercially entertaining way, ``Iris
Blond,'' imported from Italy and filmed in Belgium, can be
appreciated for its window on other worlds and its grown-up
attitude toward love.
</P>
<P>
   For those who cherish the hallmarks of European style, let it be
said that ``Iris Blond'' reaches its denoument in classic fashion
in a Brussels railroad station and on a stage before an ecstatic
young audience.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing well-acted comedy, stylish pop music and an informed eye
for the promises and perils of romance, ``Iris Blond'' stars Carlo
Verdone, its director and co-author, as Romeo Spera.
</P>
<P>
   Like his namesake, Romeo, a composer, keyboardist and band
leader, is not lucky in love. Closing in on 50 when the film opens
in Italy, he is being informed that his latest love has been
betraying him with a married member of the band, which means that
both Romeo's relationship with the woman and the band are finished.
</P>
<P>
   Like any sane person whose life has collapsed around him, Romeo
heads for a popular fortuneteller (Nuccia Fumo), known as the
Saint, and in a richly comic scene played from a wheelchair and
behind smoked glasses, she tells him of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It resides with a woman named for a flower who is a singer to
boot. Well, in a twinkling, Romeo has a gig playing piano aboard a
cruise ship, and he and a woman of a certain age named Marguerite
(Andrea Ferreol) are exchanging goo-goo eyes across a crowded room.
</P>
<P>
   In the terrestrial realm, Romeo and Marguerite (a flower of the
chrysanthemum family) are soon sharing her digs in Brussels with
her pampered white poodle, Corneille, and Romeo is accompanying
Marguerite in her Jacques Brel nightclub act, playing ``Ne Me
Quitte Pas'' ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   So late one night Romeo uses a walk for Corneille as a pretext
to escape Marguerite's company and her diet to gorge himself in a
fast food outlet. And there he meets Iris (Claudia Gerini), a
waitress who is not only named for a flower but also Italian,
beautiful, half his age and possessed of legs that seem to stretch
from Taormina to Milan. What's more, she can sing like an angel, as
he discovers on a visit to church.
</P>
<P>
   A few drawbacks: Iris drops men as fast as she attracts them,
and although she is willing to let Romeo live with her while he
composes for her and readies her for a career as a pop artist,
there is to be no sex _ at least not with him.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone will achieve success, but in European films
as in real life, success and a happy ending are two different
things.
</P>
<P>

THE ART _ AND THE PAIN _ BEHIND A GREAT DANCE COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dancemaker,'' the Oscar-nominated documentary about
choreographer Paul Taylor, starts with a camera watching from the
wings as his company bounds onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As we hear the dancers sliding across the floor and their
footfalls slapping onto the boards, ``Dancemaker's'' uniqueness is
evident. Never before has a movie on dancers given such a sense of
their physcial presence. And we also get a sense of the man who
created the company, and whose talent and ego have made it such a
singular artistic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Diamond shows all the abrasions and scar tissue
behind keeping such a company running. A former dancer himself, he
imbues ``Dancemaker'' with the sense of Olympian physical
sacrifice. The performers, after a glorious performance, talk about
the aftermath and the toll the dancing exacts _ you can hear the
muscles rip and the bones creak.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor initially comes off as kindly and a little distracted _ a
slow-motion charmer who tosses off gentle anecdotes between hissing
plumes of smoke from a cigarette. (And the cigarette becomes a
motif _ the nicotine is the calmative that links almost everyone.)
</P>
<P>
   But the more time the camera spends interviewing him as he tells
stories of his successes and failures, the clearer it is that he
makes every single decision. His high-strung obstinacy _ a contrast
to his laid-back manner _ is also reflected in the interviews with
the dancers from his troupe, both current and former, who discuss
surviving their tenure. (One of the dancers, an enthusiastic young
woman, is fired by Taylor, who says he just didn't want her around
anymore.) This is a powerful portrait of the rewards of art, and
the cost.

A CHARACTER GUIDE TO `THE PHANTOM MENACE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen the first ``Star Wars'' trilogy so many times you
can recite the dialogue in your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   You know all about Luke, Leia, Han, Lando and Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   You know all about Death Stars and X-Wing fighters.
</P>
<P>
   You know it all.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those characters or elements are to be found in
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' which opens
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although some familiar faces will reappear, George Lucas'
universe is expanding along with his special-effects artistry, and
the new film offers an awesome amount to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   Another adjustment is the fact that it's the first part of a
prequel trilogy. ``The Phantom Menace'' begins a generation before
Darth Vader chased Princess Leia toward Tatooine at the start of
1977's ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But take heart. There's still time to cram _ and without
spoiling too much of the story.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see the film ``cold,'' read no further.
Otherwise, here's a roundup of major characters to watch for in
``The Phantom Menace,'' and how the prequel trilogy will tie into
the original.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE IT ALL BEGINS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' story starts about 30 years before ``Star
Wars.'' The greedy Trade Federation threatens the balance of the
peaceful Galactic Republic, placing a blockade around the planet
Naboo. Jedi Knights intervene on behalf of Naboo. Yet the true
threat _ ``the phantom menace'' _ is the elusive Darth Sidious.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on the desert planet Tatooine, a small boy named
Anakin Skywalker and his mother live as slaves. But the empowering
Force is strong in Anakin, and his destiny lies in the stars _ as
Darth Vader, military commander of a dark Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come in the prequel trilogy are the ``Clone Wars''
referred to briefly by Princess Leia in ``Star Wars,'' and the
near-extermination of the Jedis that's apparent in ``Star Wars,''
with the evil Empire taking over the galaxy and Obi-Wan and Yoda
living as hermits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode II'' is expected to be set about a decade later than
The Phantom Menace, with a romance between the grown Anakin and
Queen Amidala of Naboo. They will wed, and Amidala will give birth
to Luke and Leia.
</P>
<P>
   The siblings, strong in the Force, will face desperate times
during ``Episode III.'' Though separated as infants, their rescue
and survival will provide ``A New Hope'' (the subtitle of ``Episode
IV,'' which was the original ``Star Wars'' film), when the Rebel
Alliance defies the Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY'RE BACK _ BUT YOUNGER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Obi-Wan Kenobi: The Jedi Master played by Sir Alec Guinness as
an old man and mentor to Luke Skywalker in 1977's ``Star Wars''
appears here as an eager young Jedi apprentice played by Ewan
McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   _ R2-D2: The squat little astromech droid of the first trilogy
appears here in all his cute, beeping glory, looking just the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ C-3PO: The prissy gold protocol droid of the first trilogy
appears in ``Phantom Menace,'' but in unfinished, skeletal form.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anakin Skywalker: Before he became father of Luke Skywalker
and Princess Leia and then a mass murderer, Darth Vader was an
innocent, mop-topped, 9-year-old slave played by Jake Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yoda: The tiny Jedi Master voiced by Frank Oz is a bit younger
here, but still ancient. (Yoda was 900 years old in ``The Empire
Strikes Back.'') He's also less isolated as a member of the Jedi
Council.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jabba the Hutt: The huge, sluglike gangster from ``Return of
the Jedi'' appears here as gambling boss of the planet Tatooine,
Anakin's home world.
</P>
<P>
   _ Palpatine: In ``Return of the Jedi,'' Palpatine, played by Ian
McDiarmid, is the self-anointed emperor of the Empire, imposing
martial law on the galaxy and ruling with the dark side of the
Force. ``Episode I'' has Senator Palpatine, a scheming politician
representing Naboo, home world of Queen Amidala, and also played by
Ian McDiarmid. Are the senator and emperor the same? Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEW FACES, NEW PLACES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Queen Amidala: Played by Natalie Portman, 17, she's the
14-year-old monarch of the planet Naboo who faces an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Padme Naberrie: She's one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens and a
near-twin. In fact, at times Padme looks exactly like Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   _ Qui-Gon Jinn: Played by Liam Neeson, he's a veteran Jedi
Master who goes with Obi-Wan to Naboo, then to Tatooine, in the
service of Queen Amidala. Though ``The Phantom Menace'' is an
ensemble film, he is its central character.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Maul: A red-faced, horned, devil-looking dude, he's a
Sith Lord, as Darth Vader will become. (The Sith are worshipers of
the Force's dark side.) Played by Ray Parker, Maul wields a
lightsaber that's held in the middle and kills from both ends. Stay
away from this guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Sidious: Also played by McDiarmid, he's a Sith meanie
and the new film's title character. As the title hints, you won't
see him much, but you'll feel his presence throughout as he pulls
his evil strings. Maul is his apprentice, just as Obi-Wan is
Qui-Gon's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mace Windu: Played by big-time ``Star Wars'' fan Samuel L.
Jackson, he's a Jedi Master who's a senior member of the Jedi
Council. Expect a bigger role for him in ``Episode II.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chancellor Valorum: Played by Terence Stamp, he's a bureaucrat
with good intentions but no match for Palpatine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jar Jar Binks: A computer-generated character voiced by Ahmed
Best, he's an amusing, big-eared member of the Gungans, an
amphibious, froglike species of the planet Naboo. The clumsy,
hapless Jar Jar tags along with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boss Nass: Played by Brian Blessed, he's leader of the
Gungans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shmi Skywalker: Played by Pernilla August, she's Anakin's
doting mom and Luke's grandmom. She's in slavery with her son on
Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Battle Droids: Depicted via computer images, they're
mechanized soldiers of the Trade Federation. In the original
trilogy, they're supplanted by Imperial Stormtroopers.

WHEN A MAN'S `CASTLE' ISN'T HIS TO KEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the hype for the gently satirical comedy ``The Castle''
is trying to cast director/co-writer Rob Sitch as an Australian
Roberto Benigni. It's true that they do have things in common, such
as each being christened with a variation on the same first name
(and a fine first name it is). Otherwise, the comparison is mostly
specious: Sitch's dry, deadpan approach couldn't be more different
from Benigni's manic romanticism. Both styles do have the potential
to divide audiences, but not in the same ways.
</P>
<P>
   Like Benigni with ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Sitch uses comedy in an
attempt to explore some serious subjects. And like Benigni, he's
concocted a very likable family with an eccentric patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   The dad here is Darryl Kerrigan, an affable bloke who's content
to live in his humble home, where he can praise his wife's cooking,
raise his greyhounds and express heartfelt interest in the lives of
his four quirky children, even the son who's in prison. Darryl
doesn't mind that his house has power lines in the yard and is so
close to an airport that he feels like a plane could land on top of
him. In fact, he thinks it's kind of neat.
</P>
<P>
   For Darryl, ignorance is bliss, so it's no wonder that at first
he thinks it's a good thing when representatives of an airline come
knocking at his door, offering him money for his home. He politely
declines the offer only to find out that the law compels him to
give up the place he loves to make room for expansion of the
airport. No way is Darryl going down without a fight, and with the
aid of an inexperienced lawyer mate, Darryl takes on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Sitch's handling of this material is almost too droll and
laid-back for the movie's own good. Even the multiwriter screenplay
seems to be reminding itself what the movie's about, and it gives
Darryl a brief speech about aborigines that seems out of character
for such a naive guy. The movie is laced with sly wit, but it's so
leisurely that some of the jokes walk by you before you know
they're being made. It often seems to be a step behind itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sitch and his co-writers have created a great character in
Darryl, though (you could call him one of the best of 1999, except
that the film was made in 1997), and Michael Caton plays him with
amiable, unpretentious dignity. As Darryl's wife says, he's a man
of principle, and Caton latches on to him in ways you might not
even be aware of until the movie's had time to settle in your mind.
Tiriel Mora, who looks like an Australian Oliver Platt, is amusing
as Darryl's befuddled lawyer, and Costas Kilias earns the movie's
biggest _ albeit easiest _ laughs as Darryl's Lebanese neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The audience at this particular preview screening seemed to be a
bit baffled by the movie's unhurried style, which says more about
the bombastic methods employed by most U.S. comedies than it does
about ``The Castle,'' which has the calm humor of ``Local Hero''
and a bit of an angry core, like ``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's entry on the Internet Movie Database features
several laudatory comments from Australian viewers, who praise the
perceptive way the movie encapsulates Aussie eccentricities into
one close-knit family. But you don't need to be Australian to get
the message that maybe, just maybe, love and honor can triumph over
misguided progress.

`REBELS AND OUTLAWS' CD TOUGH TO BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You don't hear us put the words ``sheer'' and
``genius'' together about too many compilations, particularly
country samplers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rebels &AMP; Outlaws: Music From the Wild Side of Life''
(EMI), due Tuesday, is quite simply a fantastic idea fully
realized.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is easy to grasp: 14 tough-talking tracks from the
likes of Merle Haggard, Wanda Jackson, Faron Young and Hank
Thompson stemming from a time when ``politically correct'' was
still decades away and songs about murder, livin' fast, doing time,
cheating and causing trouble were standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``blacklisted country.'' This isn't Garth Brooks, kids.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of a fine lot are Jackson's ``Riot in Cell Block
Number Nine,'' the Louvin Brothers' ``Knoxville Girl'' and Tex
Ritter's ``Blood on the Saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also taking honors are Thompson's ``Cocaine Blues,'' Johnny
Cash's ``Folsom Prison Blues'' and Young's ``Live Fast, Love Hard,
Die Young.''
</P>
<P>
   We wish ``Rebels &AMP; Outlaws'' covered multiple CDs. Maybe it will
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the disc's cover shot probably won't make many new friends,
either. It shows a nasty Cash giving his famous one-finger salute
to a photographer. &QL;

EDITOR WHO PUSHED TO NAME NAMES FEELS STING OF BLAME GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Geneva Overholser, one of the most successful women in
American journalism, knows all too well about the weaknesses of
newspaper reporting, having weathered a bout of headlines herself.
</P>
<P>
   Overholser made her name as an editor by saying that society is
better when newspapers report on the private lives of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Then newspapers reported on her own private life. Her love life.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't entirely pleased.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a press that was too quick to jump to conclusions, too
willing to oversimplify issues. Add that to her list of complaints
about newspaper reporters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   Overholzer was in Dallas for a speech Thursday night to the
Association for Women Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Overholser made her name in 1990, when she, then-editor of The
Des Moines Register, wrote an editorial that challenged
conventional newsroom wisdom concerning coverage of rape victims.
Traditionally, newspapers have not published the name of rape
victims to ensure their privacy. Overholser wrote that adult rape
victims should be named, just as adult victims of all violent
crimes are named. Naming victims would remove rape from the
category of ``sex'' and more properly place it in the category of
``violence,'' Overholser contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rape is an American shame,'' she wrote. ``Our society needs to
... attend to it, not hide it or hush it up.'' The editorial gave
courage to one Iowa reader, Nancy Ziegenmeyer, who lived with the
frustration of delays in the prosecution of the man who had raped
her. Ziegenmeyer decided to come forward, and she allowed the
Register to use her name in a five-part series published in 1990
that won journalism's highest prize, the Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Overholser received a good share of ink in journalism trade
publications for her willingness to take a fresh look at old
journalism practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers aren't worth a damn if they don't invade people's
privacy,'' she was quoted as saying in 1990 in American Journalism
Review, then known as the Washington Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   Overholser resigned from the Register in 1995, without another
job, saying the business of journalism was so commercially driven
that newspapers were no longer operating in the public interest.
The move was widely regarded in journalism as a brave step taken
for ethical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The upper ranks of Gannett Co., owner of the Register, bristled
when they heard Overholser's negative assessment of their corporate
style, according to news accounts. Months later, on the back page
of a local news section in the Register, a story appeared about
Overholser. The former editor had purchased a house in Washington,
D.C., with the Register's former managing editor, David Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Overholser had not used her famous
forthrightness when she gave her reasons for her resignation. She
and Westphal had worked closely together at the Register, both were
married to other people, both resigned on the same day, and both
filed for divorces shortly after leaving Iowa. Overholser and
Westphal now are married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can repeat that I genuinely left the job for professional
reasons,'' Overholser wrote in a Washington Post column in 1995.
``I can say that I couldn't have added then the truth about the
course my personal life would take, because I didn't know. None of
that holds the kind of power for people that this one fact holds:
Eight months later, the two of us are together here in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she reluctantly talks about her conversion from
newsgatherer to newsmaker. ``All journalists would learn from
having a story written about themselves and placed on the front
page,'' Overholser told the Star-Telegram. ``I felt it was reported
on without much awareness of how complex the issue was. Once people
heard I was in love, they thought, well, this can't really be about
distress about her newspaper's profit pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Overholser is still outspoken about her profession.
She recently completed a term as ombudsman for The Washington Post
and now is a syndicated political and social issue columnist at the
Post. Among her complaints about journalists are: They too often
write as if they have a permanent sneer on their faces; they lean
too heavily on anonymous sources; they are suckers for ``leaks'';
and they forget that their job is not to increase corporate profits
or boost their own careers but to be part of a free press that
makes democracy work.

`EDGE OF 17': A MANY GENDERED THING, THE TRUE NATURE OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The insecurities and turbulent desires of adolescence have
rarely been portrayed more faithfully on screen than in ``Edge of
17,'' the latest and most poignant in a recent spate of teen-age
male coming-out-of-the-closet dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its nationality, one thing that sets this American
independent film apart from two likable British forerunners,
``Beautiful Thing'' and ``Get Real,'' is its sexual candor.
</P>
<P>
   When Eric (Chris Stafford), a sensitive high school boy about to
enter his senior year, has his first encounters with Rod (Andersen
Gabrych), a slightly older college student he meets at a summer job
in an Ohio amusement park, Eric is the picture of fumbling
awkwardness and vulnerable, dewy-eyed romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the Prince Charming of a gay teen-age boy's
fantasies, Rod, a hotel-management student at Ohio State
University, is a suave gay Don Juan who takes an amused pleasure in
seducing younger boys.
</P>
<P>
   In giving himself to Rod, Eric falls naively and desperately in
love, only to find himself treated with a supercilious
condescension.
</P>
<P>
   Eric's second encounter, a man he meets in a disco who drags him
into the parking lot for quickie sex, is much worse. These two
encounters leave the starry-eyed Eric with such a bleak outlook on
his romantic future that he panics, decides to turn straight and
convinces Maggie (Tina Holmes), his former girlfriend in whom he
has already confided his homosexual desires, to have sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in which poor, virginal Maggie, who really loves Eric,
fools herself and is wooed into giving him a heterosexual
initiation that proves horribly empty, is so truthful it almost
hurts to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the movie's strengths is its acutely remembered sense
of time and place. Written by Todd Stephens and directed by David
Moreton, ``Edge of 17'' is set in Sandusky, Ohio ( Stephens'
hometown), in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, British pop stars like Boy George and Annie Lennox
were at their peak of popularity, and groups like the Bronski Beat
were popularizing disco-oriented pop songs with explicitly gay
content. The movie gets the music, the clothes and the tone of the
teen-age culture of that era exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   As Eric, whom Stafford plays with a winning mixture of avid
sincerity and ingenuous narcissism, metamorphoses from a skinny,
ordinary-looking high-school boy into a preening distillation of
period British pop fashion, with flaming two-toned hair, eyeliner
and Culture Club-inspired clothes, you fear for him.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing all dolled up at a teen-age party where he does a
spaced-out solo dance, Eric endures the first slings and arrows of
peer-group homophobia and flees in tears.
</P>
<P>
   What the movie also gets right are Eric's rapidly escalating
fear and sense of being different and the confusion and
befuddlement of his nice but conventional girlfriend and loving but
uncomprehending parents.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, the oldest of three boys, has a Moog synthesizer in his
bedroom and has begun composing electronic pop ditties. He dreams
of moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the movie we learn that his down-to-earth mother
(played with a wonderful solidity by Stephanie McVay) gave up her
dreams of being a concert pianist to rear a family. She is so
devoted to her children's future that she has even gone back to
work to support the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge of 17,'' which opens in New York City on Friday, has its
sentimental touches. It gives Eric a kindly godmother in Angie (Lea
DeLaria, as incandescently feisty as ever), a raucous tough-talking
lesbian with a heart of gold who manages the local gay bar.
</P>
<P>
   The campy denizens of that bar, who take Eric under their wing,
also emerge as gay caricatures. And the film's ending in that disco
is a bit too patly upbeat. But these are minor flaws in a movie
that captures a small slice of 1980s middle-class Middle-American
life just about perfectly.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Stand by the second-story window of the nearly
two-century-old Custom House here and you will find yourself gazing
over a waterfront that once linked the young United States with the
world's farthest corners.
</P>
<P>
   All's quiet now. But the place once saw ships in such numbers _
en route to or from China, Europe, the West Indies, the South Seas
_ as to rank Salem among the nation's most cosmopolitan and wealthy
cities.
</P>
<P>
   One who would have occasionally stood here was Nathaniel
Hawthorne, who worked in an office downstairs as surveyor of
Salem's port in the late 1840s, when he also began writing ``The
Scarlet Letter.'' A few blocks away stands one of his subjects in
another of his novels, the House of Seven Gables.
</P>
<P>
   Salem is probably most closely linked in the public imagination
with the 1692 witchcraft trials, but it contains much more of
interest. Nearly 400 years old, it long thrived on maritime
commerce, a legacy you can discover downtown in an area designated
as a National Historic Site (which includes the Custom House),
inside a terrific museum and on some elegant residential streets.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is easy. A commuter train connects Salem with
Boston, 15 miles to the southwest. Or you can do what my wife,
Margaret, and I did recently and drive up Route 1A from Logan
Airport. The trip takes just half an hour, which is just as well,
since the scenery tends toward car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Salem has a workaday appearance. It does not feel
prettified, a circumstance that ends its finer neighborhoods an
authenticity that would be suspect in a place scrubbed and buffed
for tourists. Nothing really prepares you for the pleasing sight of
Federal-style buildings beside the nine-acre Common or the
impressive collections in the Peabody Essex Museum.
</P>
<P>
   We chose the Hawthorne Hotel as our base; it's a 70-year-old
brick building, recently restored and as centrally located as one
could hope. From the moment we arrived and asked for a bigger room
to accommodate a crib for our baby, we found the staff consistently
courteous and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, facing the Common, stands a statue of Salem's founder,
Roger Conant, in conical hat and swirling cape, with a plaque
telling how, ``by grace,'' he persuaded English settlers not to run
off to Virginia. That was in 1626.
</P>
<P>
   The statue can be glimpsed from the Tavern on the Green, one of
the hotel's two restaurants. When we settled in for lunch, we also
got a view into the distinctive brand of religious pluralism here,
seated as we were near a jovial group of middle-age patrons, most
wearing silver pentangles, a symbol of Wicca, or modern-day
witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do want a closer look at Wicca, whose
practitioners describe it as Earth-centered, peaceful and devoid of
belief in a devil, Salem offers small shops stocked with books,
jewelry and more. A few can be found on Pickering Wharf, like the
store run by Laurie Cabot, once dubbed the city's ``official
witch'' in a proclamation by former Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1692 trials remain before the public eye, in one form or
another, thanks to well-advertised commercial ventures. We skipped
the Witch Village, Witch Dungeon, Mayhem Manor and something called
Dracula's Castle.
</P>
<P>
   We did go to the Salem Witch Museum, where visitors are ushered
into a dark, spooky room to listen to a 20-minute taped narration
as lights illuminate life-sized figures dressed to represent people
in the trials. We emerged disappointed, thinking it low on
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   But the attached shop has a good selection of books, like
``Witchcraft at Salem'' by Chadwick Hansen. Rejecting conventional
views of the trials, it argues that in 17th-century New England, as
in Europe, some people did practice what they understood to be
witchcraft, and that two of the 19 people hanged in 1692 were
probably practicing black magic.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for a physical link to that era ought to walk
over to the Old Burying Point on Charter Street, which contains the
grave of John Hathorne, one of three judges in the trials and an
ancestor of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who added the ``w'' to the family
name.
</P>
<P>
   The graveyard also holds the remains of Nathanael Mather, a son
of the famous Boston Puritan leader Increase Mather. The father
wrote an influential book critical of the methods of inquiry used
by the Salem trial court. Many gravestones are adorned with
carvings of the death's heads and hourglasses found in
pre-Revolutionary War burying grounds.
</P>
<P>
   From there it's a few minutes' walk to the Salem Maritime
Historic Site, where the National Park Service runs tours led by
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   One tour takes in the Custom House, its exterior adorned with a
gold-painted eagle clutching a shield emblazoned with the stars and
stripes. Inside the building are artifacts from Hawthorne's days as
port surveyor. His was a political appointment served during a
period when the port was in decline. He found the duties dull. A
display case shows off what he left behind: quill pens, an inkwell,
a walking stick and other items. The tour, by the way, makes note
of another famous native, Nathaniel Bowditch, a self-taught
mathematician and astronomer and, like Hawthorne, a sea captain's
son. Bowditch's extensive corrections of British navigational
tables led to his 1802 book, ``The New American Practical
Navigator,'' the foundation of modern navigation.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to tour two historic houses at the site. Most
impressive is Salem's oldest brick home, the Derby House, on Derby
Street, overlooking Derby Wharf. The house belonged to Elias
Haskett Derby, identified by the Park Service as ``probably
America's first millionaire,'' another Salem distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Derby owned 33 ships and began trading with China in the 1780s.
He might now be hailed as an early exponent of globalization. He
was unquestionably a dominant figure at the height of Salem's
trading importance in the 1790s. At Derby's funeral, his minister
eulogized him by saying, ``Many gathered around him, many imitated
his enterprises and many shared in their success.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide, standing near a portrait of the merchant inside the
house, said that Derby's eyes were of different colors, one iris
blue, the other brown, and that he was a dedicated landsman who
shunned sea travel.
</P>
<P>
   From his parlor, Derby could keep an eye on doings at his wharf.
The room still possesses a convivial charm, with family portraits
on the walls and a diamond-patterned sailcloth rug on the floor. On
a landing on the hall stairway there is a grandfather clock with a
gold-on-black Oriental design.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably for the Derbys, the family lost its ascendancy after
Elias died in 1799. He and his wife had built a 60-room mansion in
Salem's center, but both died shortly after its completion. The
house was torn down in 1815.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I walked toward the site, but only to see some of the cultural
legacy of Salem's trade, the Peabody-Essex Museum, founded in 1799
by sea captains dedicated to collecting ``artificial and natural
curiosities'' from around the world. Exhibits range from maritime
paintings and ship models to art objects from the Far East, the
South Pacific and elsewhere. The museum is planning an expansion
that will increase gallery space by more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret and I never got much beyond the first rooms, near the
entrance, except to visit the museum's pleasant cafe, where we
found a table in a glass-fronted nook overlooking a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Among the exhibits we saw ere the rooms dealing with New
England's bond with the sea. There is good information on whaling,
although in that trade Salem ranked well behind ports like New
Bedford and Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Display cases contain scrimshaw, the whale's teeth incised by
sailors passing idle time on deck. And there are whale bones carved
as walking sticks, dominoes, even a clock, as well as the lower jaw
of a sperm whale.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings portray the explosive action of the whale hunt. One,
titled ``Attacking the Right Whale,'' became the model for the 19th
century's most popular whaling print. It shows a six-man boat
alongside a wounded whale, the hunt at its climax.
</P>
<P>
   Killing a whale was a drama in two parts, beginning with
harpooning the animal and letting it drag the whaleboat until
exhausted, after which the boat's officer dispatched the whale by
puncturing its lungs with a lance.
</P>
<P>
   It was cruel, dangerous and exciting. For those who want to know
more, Herman Melville gives a memorable description of the process
in the chapter titled ``Stubb Kills a Whale'' in ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Open the book and you'll also find a Salem connection right up
front. It is dedicated to Hawthorne.

HIGH LOWE: FUTURE BRIGHT FOR BRAT PACKER TURNED DAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday and Monday, we'll see him as John Seger, dangling from a
helicopter and scurrying atop train cars, trying to prevent a
nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he'll be the 1969 version of No. 2, doing what evil men
do to stop that masterful superagent, Austin Powers.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, we may see him as a White House employee with an
overactive libido.
</P>
<P>
   But all around and in between, Rob Lowe's favorite role these
days is playing Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently had the weird experience of being elated that my
kid got into the kindergarten he wanted,'' the 35-year-old father
of two confided. ``I thought, `It's not like it's Stanford, for
God's sake. Rob, get a grip.'''
</P>
<P>
   Parenthood agrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that visceral connection that's completely unique to you
and your child, and yet utterly common to every child and their
parent,'' he said in a recent phone conversation. ``When your kid
snags his first ground ball in T-ball, throws it to the first
baseman and turns around to look to find you to see if you've seen
it, it doesn't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing responsible parent is an about-face from the indelible
impression he left in 1988, when a video surfaced of him and an
under-age girl having sex. Before that, he was the impossibly
pretty member of the so-called Brat Pack, which included such
members as Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The video shook him up and nearly tanked his career. ``There's
no way you can know how embarrassing it was,'' he told People
magazine in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991 he married an ex-girlfriend of Estevez _ Sheryl
Berkoff, now 37 _ and became a family man. He and Sheryl are
parents to Matthew, 5, and John Owen, 3.
</P>
<P>
   And though his career stalled, it never derailed. He's made more
than two dozen films since the video incident, a couple of his
roles memorable (including Nick in the 1994 miniseries ``The
Stand'').
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back on TV. In ``Atomic Train'' (9 p.m. EST Sunday and
Monday, NBC), Lowe plays John Seger, an investigator with the
National Transportation Safety Board. It falls on John to do what
he can to stop a runaway train bound for Denver. The train carries
hazardous material and, uh-oh, one stolen nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The slender actor with the soft face relished the idea of
playing a physical role. The part called for him to jump onto a
moving train from a hovering helicopter, walk/run/crawl atop the
boxcars, and assorted other stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stunts that look the most dangerous are actually
the safest, and others that look innocuous scare the hell out of
you,'' he said. ``I think the scariest was the one where I'm
hanging from the ladder of a helicopter and they lower me to the
top of the train and I jump/fall off onto the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chopper pilot says, `Look, when I'm coming down toward the
train, if you hear any difference in the rotors, just lie down. I'm
going to try to ditch it over here. And oh, by the way, make sure
you don't touch the ladder until I've grounded it by touching it on
top of the train, because it carries an electronic charge that
could shock you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't tell you that when you're signing up. Then, you
know, I'm on top of this thing. You can't hear anything. Of course,
the weather's coming in, we're losing the light, we've got about 15
minutes to get this, it's the end of the day _ it (the nature of
the business) never changes. I got up there and thought, `What have
I got myself into?' I've got a helicopter hovering over my head; I
mean, literally the skid is touching my shoulder. I thought, `This
is crazy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But that said, it's really gratifying because when you see the
movie, you'll go, `That's really him.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's had other action roles before _ he recently made two
made-for-cable films playing a Jack Higgins hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a physical person,'' Lowe said. ``I really enjoy it. There
were days where, honestly, all I did was hang upside down, hang by
one arm, jump, swing, fall on the ground, get beat. I would come
home and sit in the tub with Epsom salts and go, ``Oh, my aching
...' I felt like a little boy, playing in the yard. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Lowe does not succeed in preventing the
train from unleashing its explosive cargo. Poor Denver is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries was filmed last fall, months before the high
school shootings in the Denver suburb of Littleton. NBC
investigated changing the location in the miniseries, then opted
not to.
</P>
<P>
   What went through Daddy's mind when he heard about Littleton?
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is that, at 5 and 3, it's not appropriate for
them to know about this,'' Lowe said. ``I don't want their
innocence compromised. My son and I read the paper every day, and
we took a little sabbatical from that. To me, the incident
reinforces what I think I already intuitively knew, which was that
you have to be involved in your kids' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this action film was one he made for his boys, he said,
``You know what? A lot of it was. They have `Atomic Train' hats
they wore to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape of the show had just arrived, and Lowe was planning to
watch it with his sons _ at least the action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe does not believe violence in movies _ even the destruction
of a city _ necessarily breeds violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people drink from the same cesspool and don't run
amok,'' he said. ``They play the same hideous games. I don't want
them in my house, but at the end of the day, if they did come into
my house, I have every confidence they're not going to send anybody
off to the deep end because we're constantly trying to cover the
other bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Lowe has the lucky fate of being in two more
high-profile projects. In ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' he plays the 1969 version of the Robert Wagner character from
the first film, No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say it without sounding like a shill because it's really
Mike (Myers') baby: It is one of the funniest movies ever made,''
said Lowe. ``It's like seeing ''Airplane!,`` ''Young Frankenstein``
or ''Caddyshack`` for the first time. I'm playing a young Robert
Wagner with frosted hair and the R.J. Wagner voice, I mean, come
on. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, we may see him in a new TV series from what Lowe
calls a ``teaming of the titans,'' Aaron Sorkin (``Sports Night'')
and John Wells (``ER''). In the hourlong drama ``The West Wing,''
Lowe plays a bed-hopping White House deputy communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people interested in me doing an hour show for many
years, and I just didn't want to commit to the time,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   This is too good to pass up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a drama, but like all of Aaron's work, it's funny. It
turned out fantastic. Everybody's really positive (that a network
will pick it up), but nothing's for sure in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has first option on the series, which also stars Moira
Kelly, Brad Whitford, Richard Schiff and Martin Sheen as the
president.
</P>
<P>
   If it's sold, it will mean more time for Lowe to spend with
family, since the show will shoot at the same set every day and
will feature a share-the-load, ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I don't have to go to Sri Lanka, and with four or five
leads, I'll have some time off.''

 DEEP SPACE NINE BEAMS OUT

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., MAY 24, 1999) 
 Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of the cast of
``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It hit Nana Visitor like a photon torpedo.
 &HT;    ``I was taking a walk around the Promenade set as they were
disassembling it, and I realized that `Deep Space Nine' was really
ending, possibly forever,'' says Visitor, who has played Col. Kira
Nerys for all of the ``Star Trek'' spinoff's seven-year run and
even married one of her co-stars, Alexander Siddig.
 &HT;    ``I'd never before allowed myself to feel so profoundly sad
about something,'' she says. ``When I'd done stage shows and the
closing notice went up, I'd just leave after the last performance.
But I can't do that with `DS9.'
 &HT;    ``Too many bits of my life are interwoven into this show, these
sets, these people,'' she concludes. ``I want a long, long
goodbye.''
 &HT;    Trekkers will have their own chance to bid farewell to ``DS9''
when its two-hour finale, ``What You Leave Behind,'' airs in
syndication the week of May 31.
 &HT;    On a rainy April day in Hollywood, the end can barely be seen
looming on Stage 18 at Paramount Pictures. Everyone's too busy
making ``What You Leave Behind.''
 &HT;    Veteran ``Trek'' director Allan Kroeker peers into a monitor,
setting up Scene 63H, which finds the enigmatic Cardassian, Garak
(Andrew J. Robinson), looking at the corpse of a Cardassian female
_ could she be his mother? _ and dashing from a claustrophobic
cellar after Kira implores him to run.
 &HT;    Crewmen blow billows of thick smoke onto the cramped set,
Robinson taps his foot impatiently and, finally, Kroeker calls
``Action!'' The actors play out the scene several times, until
Kroeker signals his satisfaction and asks the crew to reverse
camera angles.
 &HT;    As a contingent of grips, boom operators, assistant directors,
stunt doubles, stand-ins, makeup artists and extras swarms in,
Kroeker steps outside to smoke a cigarette and talk.
 &HT;    ``In a sense we're winging it because we got the script so
late,'' he says, ``and that's OK to a degree. In television, if you
get too much time to think about something you can get paralyzed.
 &HT;    ``This show has been, `Let's jump into the fray blind, and hope
for the best,''' he adds. ``But it's a good group of people I'm
working with and, knowing that, knowing that they work well under
tremendous pressure, I don't mind improvising.
 &HT;    ``And we've been doing a lot of that.''
 &HT;    Over in his office, Ira Steven Behr sheds some light on the
ambitious episode's top-secret plot. Behr has been ``DS9's''
day-to-day producer for several years now and he, with Hans
Beimler, wrote the finale.
 &HT;    ``We're going to see the culmination of the Dominion war,'' he
says. ``We're going to see the culmination of the relationships
we've been following for seven years, and we're going to give every
character _ the regulars and almost all of our recurring characters
_ at least a moment.
 &HT;    ``I think we're trying to bring a tear to people's eyes and
maybe also a smile to their faces,'' he adds. ``We're trying to do
a hell of a lot in two freakin' hours, and it's going to be
jampacked with action and fun-filled.
 &HT;    ``When it's over, I hope people will say, `Yep, that was the
final episode of a seven-year series, and they didn't punk out on
us. They threw in everything but the kitchen sink.'''
 &HT;    Behr chuckles.
 &HT;    ``And,'' he says, ``if we'd had a little more time we probably
would've thrown in the kitchen sink.''
 &HT;    Across the way in his own office, ``DS9'' co-creator and
co-executive producer Rick Berman offers his view of ``DS9's''
impending departure.
 &HT;    ``It's like having children,'' he says. ``They eventually grow
up and move out of the house. You're sad, but it's a rite of
passage.
 &HT;    ``Everyone asks if there will be `DS9' features or television
movies,'' Berman adds, ``and the truth is I don't know. I've had no
such discussions yet with Paramount.
 &HT;    ``I will say this,'' he says. ``I certainly hope that we've not
seen the last of Odo (Rene Auberjonois), Kira, Sisko (Avery Brooks)
and the others. That would be a shame.''
 &HT;    In the final analysis, ``DS9'' remains the dark and gritty
``Trek,'' the Enterprise-less saga that polarized fans, the show
that dared to push people's buttons, kill off popular characters
and spend two-plus years on a complex war story line. If ``DS9''
failed to be embraced by the masses, if it emerged as the
franchise's neglected stepchild, Behr says, so be it.
 &HT;    ``It's not a kid's show and it's not toy-friendly,
necessarily,'' the producer says. ``It's a show that makes you
think.
 &HT;    ``The franchise will never be the same because of `DS9,''' he
adds. ``The wonderful thing about `DS9' is that we've got 176
episodes that are not going to go away.
 &HT;    ``The episodes will be on video, on laserdisk and on DVD, and
they'll be syndicated. Whoever wants to discover, rediscover or
continue to discover the show will have that opportunity ... ad
nauseam.''

   BIJOU PHILLIPS/``I'D RATHER EAT GLASS'' (Almo)
</P>
<P>
   Almo wisely limits its roster to a handful of critically
acclaimed acts. So, there must be something plainly poptastic about
Phillips, the 19-year-old daughter of Papa John Phillips, right?
Actually, not really. Phillips, produced here by Talking Head Jerry
Harrison, goes for the ``angry little rich girl'' delivery of so
many others, coming up with just a couple of memorable songs along
the way. The self-pitying but hard-rocking former Calvin Klein teen
model puts across standout tunes like ``Stranded'' with genuine
verve, but too much of ``I'd Rather Eat Glass'' smacks of Alanis'
discarded diary. 2 stars

   RICKY MARTIN/``RICKY MARTIN'' (C2/Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Menudo member Martin has already sold 15 million worldwide,
but he caught the eye of many U.S. pop fans with his charismatic
performance of ``The Cup of Life'' at the Grammys in February. Now
comes the first of his four albums to be recorded in English, and
nobody's taking chances. Here, the 27-year-old Latin hottie teams
with guaranteed hit-makers Desmond Child, Emilio Estefan Jr. and
Diane Warren for a flavorful, well-crafted platter that simply
can't miss. It's bright, forceful pop: all horns, hot Latin
percussion, rock guitars and lyrics in both Spanish and English,
along with a silky duet with Madonna on the William Orbit-produced
``Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon).'' The irresistible No. 1
smash ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' and power ballad ``She's All I Ever
Had'' are included in two versions while the spicy rocker ``Shake
Your Bon-Bon'' waits in the wings. Hot in any language. 3 stars

</P>
<P>
   One of country's most versatile performers, Wariner grew up in
suburban Indianapolis mixing his Beatles infatuation with the Chet
Atkins and George Jones he heard around the house. A triple threat
as top-notch singer, guitarist and songwriter, Wariner has grown
increasingly adventurous in the years since his 1982 debut. The
hit-bound title track of ``Two Teardrops'' illustrates all that's
terrific about this award-winning artist _ aggressive playing,
insightful lyrics and emotive crooning. 3 stars

SOUNDTRACK/``SONGS FROM DAWSON'S CREEK'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Kids in droves are buying this synergistic TV tie-in, partly for
the music and partly due to a nifty marketing ploy that offers a
pic of a different ``Dawson's Creek'' star with every disc.
Musically, the album's nothing special, merely a sampler of songs
connected to the high-school drama series. It leads off with
Sixpence None the Richer's ubiquitous make-out smash ``Kiss Me.''
Then you've got Paula Cole's ``I Don't Want to Wait'' (the show's
theme), Heather Nova's seductive ``London Rain'' and the heartfelt
``Feels Like Home'' from singer-pianist Chantal Kreviazuk, a talent
deserving wider recognition. Also included are items from
labelmates Shawn Mullins, Sophie B. Hawkins, Shooter and Adam
Cohen. 1 1/2 stars

</P>
<P>
   Tribute albums are always dreadful. This ill-advised Clash
homage _ as if anyone, especially the likes of Third Eye Blind or
No Doubt, could better the originals _ is just another waste of
aluminum. If you loved the Clash, fondly remember their gigs and
recall buying their great early singles and first album on import
months before their U.S. release, preposterous attempts like
Silverchair's ``London Burning,'' Third Eye's ``Train in Vain'' and
No Doubt's ``Hateful'' will leave you unsure whether to laugh or
cry.1 star

ALICE COOPER/``THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF ALICE COOPER'' (Rhino/Warner
Archives)
</P>
<P>
   With the nostalgia-enhanced '90s revisionism that has
transformed mediocrities like Cheap Trick, Queen and Bad Company
into sheer brilliance comes a newfound appreciation for the
one-dimensional talent of Vincent Furnier, who took his stage name
from a 16th-century witch. This 81-track, four-disc box, which
moves from Vince's pre-Alice days through his '70s hits and slow
fade into golfing obscurity, is enough to make you want to put your
head in Cooper's guillotine. There are just three reasons to ever
hear Alice Cooper _ ``Eighteen,'' ``Under My Wheels'' and
``School's Out'' _ and those tracks are available in many other
places. Nice packaging, though. 1 1/2 stars

</P>
<P>
   These fine collections, available separately with 28 often edgy
live tracks in all, follow last year's best-selling Lilith sampler.
Outstanding moments from Volume 2 include Sarah McLachlan and
Emmylou Harris on a soaring ``Angel,'' Sinead O'Connor's potent
``Fire on Babylon,'' Queen Latifah's ``Life'' and Heather Nova's
gorgeous ``Island.'' Volume 3 offers Me'Shell Ndegeocello's funky
``Soul Record,'' Liz Phair's hard-rocking ``Never Said,'' Harris'
``Deeper Well'' and Suzanne Vega's gloomy ``Luka,'' among other
highlights. Lilith '99 hits the Rose Bowl on July 17. 3 stars

SHEILA CHANDRA/``MOONSUNG: A REAL WORLD RETROSPECTIVE'' (Real
World)
</P>
<P>
   Chandra began mixing Indian song and instrumentation with pop
elements in London in the early '80s and subsequently influenced
the likes of currently hot tabla player-producer Talvin Singh.
She's pursued a relentlessly independent path both musically and
financially for most of her career, licensing single production
runs of a trio of fine albums to Peter Gabriel's Real World label.
This album culls some of the best of those three works and adds two
new tracks as well, showing her gorgeous, complex vocalizations set
against the simplest of musical backing, usually just a single
drone out of any of a series of world music traditions. This is
stunning, sterling stuff _ distilled to the spare, cool, mysterious
bones of melody and atmosphere _ that is too seldom heard, given
Chandra's fierce control over her music. Here's your chance. 3 1/2

RICKY MARTIN'S HOT STUFF _ IN ANY LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You will not hear a catchier song than Ricky Martin's ``Livin'
La Vida Loca'' _ not this year, not next, not _ maybe _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   Relentlessly up-tempo, featuring a smattering of rock guitar and
an insistent chorus, it is the vehicle that former Menudo member
Martin _ he of the pretty face and the boffo appearance on this
year's Grammy awards _ is riding to be the first truly huge male
Latino crossover star.
</P>
<P>
   You will listen. You will sing along. You will, now and in the
coming weeks, have no choice. Not that you want one.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that ``Livin''' is the best thing on
Martin's eponymous English-language debut CD, which hit the stores
this week after being bumped up by two weeks to capitalize on the
nearly out-of-control craze for Martin product that ``Livin'''
sparked.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody should be surprised by this, and it's not necessarily a
bad thing: ``Ricky Martin'' is not a bad CD _ buffed and polished
to within an inch of its life, yes, and full of ballads that sound
suspiciously similar, definitely, but not bad.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, however, is pure pop product, produced and written
by committee: Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman of the Hooters (remember
them?) and hugely successful songwriter Diane Warren _ who penned
Aerosmith's Oscar-nominated ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' _ all
wrote for the CD. As did Cuban-born Latin-pop-semi-star Jon Secada
and pop-hits-to-order songwriter Desmond Child. As did Madonna and
``Ray of Light'' producer William Orbit. Martin did not write one
word that he sings on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   The result is exactly what you'd expect: catchy, glossy, frothy,
tuneful, built for radio play. And also fairly bloodless and
undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs are in English, but there is a second version
of ``Livin''' and the ballad ``Bella (She's All I Ever Had)'' for
his longtime Latin-American fans. All of the above makes ``Ricky
Martin'' just right for capitalizing on the currently exploding
Latin-crossover craze and giving Martin more than enough material
to drive the little girls crazy in concert.
</P>
<P>
   They'll fill the sheds and arenas this summer and fall, dancing
to ``Livin', Spanish Eyes, Shake Your Bon-Bon'' and ``Love You For
a Day,'' and then hold their collective breath as Ricky gets all
sensitive on us with ballads such as ``I Am Made of You'' and
``Maria.'' Lighters will be held aloft. There will be much
swooning. Large amounts of money will be made.
</P>
<P>
   And the reality that Martin's voice is only fair (or maybe even
a notch below that) and his music is cut out of several
well-established molds (Secada, Gloria Estefan) will not matter to
anyone. The point is to make music that sells, and that is what
``Ricky Martin'' is doing and will do. For a good long time.

`ENDURANCE': THE DISNEYFICATION OF A LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Endurance,'' a docu-drama based on the life of the Ethiopian
long-distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, has the lofty goal of
investing rural Ethiopian life with the primal dignity evoked by
Robert Flaherty in his groundbreaking documentary studies of
Eskimos and Polynesians. But its mixture of biographical hype and
social studies quickly curdles.
</P>
<P>
   Among other problems, ``Endurance'' is excruciatingly dull.
Several scenes of Gebrselassie trotting happily through the African
fields are interminable, and so are videotaped sequences of actual
races. The promiscuous application of John Powell's poundingly
bombastic score of East African folk music in ``The Lion King''
mode only makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the movie, Gebrselassie, filmed near his
birthplace in Ethiopia, speaks a few words in broken English. After
that, we never get to know much about him, partly because most of
the dialogue is not subtitled.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Endurance'' is a fictionalized re-creation of the
runner's youth, with a child actor (Yonas Zergaw) playing the
rebellious boy who carries a portable radio into the field to
listen to the broadcast of a race at the 1980 Olympic Games in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Leslie Woodhead, a British documentary
maker, the film has many panoramic shots of the arid Ethiopian
landscape and of villagers laboring in the fields. We observe bread
baking, livestock herding and milking, hay pitching and water being
fetched from the only available source, three miles from the
village.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic scene shows the boy's mother collapsing on her
way back from the spring with a sack of water. Two short scenes
later, she is dead, of undisclosed causes.
</P>
<P>
   Later scenes find Gebrselassie playing himself. In one, he says
goodbye to his father to go live in Addis Ababa and train for the
Olympics. In another, he has an early conversation with his future
wife. Both are painfully stiff, labored re-enactments of events
that surely must have had emotional charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endurance'' undoubtedly means well. But watching it is a
little like leafing through a 1950's National Geographic photo
spread depicting the mores of a ``primitive'' tribe.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted here, with the ersatz ``Lion King'' music behind
them, Gebrselassie and his fellow Ethiopians come awfully close to
fitting a false, condescending stereotype of the noble savage.

`CLEAR SPRINGS': MEMORIES OF HER OLD KENTUCKY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her novels and short stories, Bobbie Ann Mason limned a New
South reeling from the dislocations of modern life, a place where
the old certainties of family and religion are slipping away and
small towns and family farms have been replaced by malls and
subdivisions and fast-food joints. In her new memoir, ``Clear
Springs,'' she returns to the region of western Kentucky she has
depicted so many times before, but she gives us her own memories of
the area, before it was flung so precipitously into the 20th
century by World War II and the incursion of radio and television
and film.
</P>
<P>
   She gives us a portrait of a time when ``farm ways had not
changed much since pioneer times'' as well as a portrait of her own
extended family, whose ancestors first settled in the region nearly
two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Clear Springs'' is powerful in its depiction of the
lives of the author's relatives _ in particular, the lives of her
mother and grandmother _ it quickly becomes clear that Ms. Mason is
not a natural memoirist.
</P>
<P>
   In her stories and novels she has skillfully employed the
present tense and a dispassionate third person voice: a clipped,
uninflected voice, vigorous in its immediacy but not given to
rumination. It is not a voice that lends itself easily to the
introspective form of the memoir, and Ms. Mason's reminiscences
often feel perfunctory and forced. There are listlike recitations
of things and people she remembers, as though she could not be
bothered with dramatizing them or bringing them to life. The
sections of the book dealing with her journeys beyond Kentucky _
namely, her post-college sojourns in New York and New England _
feel especially generic and flat.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mason's fans, the primary interest of this memoir may
lie in its revelation of just how rooted the themes of her fiction
remain in the facts of her own life. The pull felt by so many of
the people in ``Shiloh and Other Stories,'' ``Love Life'' and
``Spence and Lila,'' between home and rootlessness, between what
Ms. Mason calls ``the call of the hearth or the call of the wild,''
appears to have been experienced to acute degree by the young Ms.
Mason herself, while the sense of loss her characters feel, their
regret over missed opportunities and misplaced dreams, seems to
have shadowed her mother's entire life.
</P>
<P>
   As in Ms. Mason's fiction, the women in this memoir are
practiced at the arts of coping; they are more practical, more
inclined toward self-improvement than their menfolk, who tend to be
dreamy, passive, often feckless.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mason's fiction (frequently hailed or dismissed as ``Kmart
realism'') has delineated the alienation and loss of authenticity
that social change has brought to the South. But in this volume she
does not romanticize the vanishing farm life she knew as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mason's family did not have an indoor bathroom until she was
8, and she went to sleep with a pan to catch the water that dripped
from the ceiling above her bed. Vacations were unknown to farmers _
there were always cows to milk, chickens to feed _ and daily life
was defined by a numbing round of chores. In the 1940s and '50s men
still plowed the fields with a team of mules, and women churned
their own butter and made their own clothes. When someone died and
neighbors came to pay their respects, most would bring prepared
dishes from the supermarket. ``Store-bought costs more,'' Ms. Mason
explains, ``so it has higher status.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age Ms. Mason rebelled against the circumscribed
life of the farm. She says she hated the fact that farmers were at
the mercy of nature (dependent on good weather for crops and ever
fearful of tornadoes, fires and droughts), and she learned through
such unlikely books as the Bobbsey Twins adventures that a wider
world existed beyond the Kentucky hills. ``Granny didn't question a
woman's duties, but I did,'' she writes. ``I didn't want to be
hulling beans in a hot kitchen when I was 50 years old. I wanted to
be somebody, maybe an airline stewardess.''
</P>
<P>
   In time Ms. Mason did escape: she went away to college and
graduate school, got a writing job in New York and married a
Yankee. Her mother, who had had similar yearnings for independence,
was never able to act on them. Orphaned at an early age _ her
father left before she was born, her mother died when she was four
_ Christy Lee married Wilburn Arnett Mason when she was 17 and
promptly moved in with him and his parents. For the next four and a
half decades she would live in the shadow of her redoubtable
mother-in-law, Ethel, who made her ``feel worthless, out of
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethel herself was given to serious depressions; over the years
she would undergo a series of shock treatments that would leave her
increasingly debilitated. Ms. Mason later learns that Ethel had
spent her own youth caring for her father, who was dying from
syphilis. The shame of his sin ``must have been stark and heavy,''
Ms. Mason speculates. In Ethel's time, ``a simple human error _
like an unwed pregnancy, or a son who `turned out wild' _ could
cause a trauma that colored a lifetime,'' she writes. ``It was
disgrace, shame, the sense that everything one worked for and
believed in and hoped for was ruined by a single misstep.''
</P>
<P>
   With the death of her grandmother, and later her father, Ms.
Mason realized the future of their family farm looked bleak. Though
her mother refused to sell it, she soon moved to a house in town
and leased the fields to a neighbor. ``I'm aware that something
larger than myself, larger than our family, is ending here,'' Ms.
Mason writes. ``A way of life with a long continuity, tracing back
to the beginnings of this country, is coming to an end.''

   A Quirky Tour By a Poet-Guide &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sort of information one expects from a tour guide,
even in New York City. ``Greenwich Village is one of those rare
districts that occurs once in a while in human history,'' Timothy
(Speed) Levitch says into a microphone from his perch atop a
double-decker bus on the streets of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear, a basic theme in all our lives, constantly afraid along
the streets of Greenwich, under threat of assassination and the
assassins are our dreams triumphant.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are left to make of that what they will in ``The
Cruise,'' Bennett Miller's probing and acclaimed documentary about
a man who could be described, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, as ``a representative New Yorker; there is probably no one
in the world remotely like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitch, 28, has a high nasal voice and scraggly looks
reminiscent of Tiny Tim. In tone he resembles Woody Allen, though
his observations are often oblique and run to streams of
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me he was compelling in a way that I tried not to explain
to myself too much,'' Miller said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists on the buses usually just sit dumbfounded. ``My
attitude at first was `I'm going to kick these people until they
wake up,''' Levitch said in an interview. ``Then I was reading some
Eastern mysticism and it was pointed out that most of the human
population is asleep. Don't wake them. They're asleep for reasons
you're not meant to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller took pains to present someone much deeper than a
smart-mouthed New Yorker who deliberately bewilders his audience.
His film, which is to be released on tape Tuesday by Artisan, gets
Levitch off the bus for extended reflections that remain steeped in
the city but venture into a strange and intriguing psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very obscure personality when I found him, living on
life's margins,'' Miller said. ``What interested me is that he
expresses a very open appreciation of life, love and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the camera, Levitch shows certain exhibitionistic
tendencies, but they ameliorate gradually. ``He emerges as a
thinking, feeling person,'' the director said. ``Otherwise he'd
remain a cartoonish character, a happy-go-lucky, Walt Whitmanish,
Willie Wonka type.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitch occasionally guides walking tours, but he no longer
rides the double-deckers with, as he puts it, the ``international
flesh congregation.'' To him the bus was a structure orbiting in a
circle and facts were pieces of history subject to mood and
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``History would often change according to my emotionalism,'' he
said. ``The height of the Empire State Building would go up or down
according to my mood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film he says that his ideal tour group would be the 11
people who have survived a leap off the Brooklyn Bridge, a
structure he likens to an all-powerful being who doesn't attack us
for our fears and distractions.
</P>
<P>
   For these people, he added, directions and facts wouldn't mean
as much as they would to the average tour taker. ``Those who are
enjoying our lives in the city are healthy associates of chaos,''
he said. &QL;

   Holy Man &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two shopping network executives, Ricky (Jeff Goldblum) and Kate
(Kelly Preston) hit a man with their sports car. Oddly, though, the
victim, a beatifically smiling fellow who calls himself G (Eddie
Murphy, isn't hurt. Because he seems to have no earthly
connections, Ricky takes G under his wing and into his cocktail
parties. Before long, G emerges as a spiritual guru of mysterious
origin and dewy-eyed sincerity who, despite a professed aversion to
all things material, can sell things like crazy on television. That
works out well for Ricky and the network, both of which are
floundering, but the contradiction in values remains a puzzler in a
film that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``hasn't a
prayer making sense of this.'' &QL;

   Very Bad Things &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Acting unwisely during a bachelor party in Las Vegas, five
friends respond to the violent death of a stripper by cutting up
her body and distributing the parts in the desert. From then on,
matters really get out of hand for those most intimately connected
with the impending nuptials of Kyle (Jon Favreau) and Laura
(Cameron Diaz). A boastful loose canon (Christian Slater) takes
charge of the cover-up to the distress of his nervous cohorts
(Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven and Leland Orser), who feel sorry for
themselves and get into other fatal mishaps. Viewers may share the
script's eagerness to see all these witless characters dead, but
the film has so little point of view it's hard to care. ``There's
not even much shock value to the story itself, a kind of
Dockers-clad `Lord of the Flies''' (Maslin). &QL;

<P>
   The Imposters &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two starving actors in the 1930s, Arthur (Stanley Tucci) and
Maurice (Oliver Platt), evoke everyone from Laurel and Hardy to the
Marx Brothers as they race around New York performing melodramatic
skits in public places (like getting into a staged knife fight in a
Central Park cafe). Then they make the mistake of insulting a
famous actor and notorious drunk (Alfred Molina), who picks a fight
of his own and then claims to be seriously injured. In a panic,
Arthur and Maurice stow away on a cruise ship, eventually emerging
as stewards. But who should also be aboard but their enraged
nemesis, touching off a wild dash from stateroom to stateroom in
many disguises. Though Tucci's film crams too many stock '30s movie
caricatures onto a ship of fools, there is such unrestrained glee
that ``it hardly matters if this swirl of cotton candy disappears
even before it touches the tip of your tongue'' (Maslin). &QL;

<P>
   THE NIGHT WATCH (LE TROU). Five convicts try to tunnel their way
out of the big house in Jacques Becker's final film. That may not
sound like the most original screen concept, but Becker worked for
Jean Renoir, inspired the likes of Jean-Luc Godard and Francois
Truffaut, and made movies noted for their detail and character
portrayal. In ``Le Trou,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York
Times, he turned out a ``cliff hanger that throbs with excitement
and suspense and, at the same time, offers some stabbing insights
into the anxieties and energies of imprisoned men.'' 1960. Home
Vision. $29.95. 123 minutes. French with English subtitles. No
rating. Release date: May 18.

<P>
   AS TIME GOES BY. In the BBC romantic comedy, Judi Dench stars as
a widow who rekindles a romance with a retired British Army officer
with whom she had a brief romance 38 years before. (And perhaps her
beautiful, twice-divorced daughter can get fixed up in the
bargain.) 1999. BBC Video/Fox. Two cassettes, $19.98. 85 minutes
each.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIRL GETTERS and THE LEATHER BOYS. Mods and motorcycles get
surprisingly fine treatment in two British films from Kino. In
Michael Winner's ``The Girl Getters'' (1966, 79 minutes), Oliver
Reed stars as a slick, womanizing beach photographer who gets cut
down to size by a fashion model. Generally regarded as one of the
better films about the '60s youth scene, Sidney J. Furie's briskly
paced ``Leather Boys'' (1963, 105 minutes), stars Rita Tushingham
as the dissatisfied wife of a biker-mechanic (Colin Campbell).
$24.95 each. Information: (800) 562-3330.

ANTIQUES: THINGS RARE, BEAUTIFUL AND VERY FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The small, refined world of fine French antiques
dealers here has just shrunk: Tony Victoria has sold his family's
five-floor gallery on East 55th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery, Frederick Victoria &AMP; Son, was established by
Victoria's father in 1941. Tony Victoria went to work there in 1972
and inherited the firm on his father's death in 1980. The gallery
sells an unusual mix of 18th-century French and Continental
furniture, porcelains and objets d'art with a sub-speciality of
items in the chinoiserie style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wanted anything that was run of the mill, only crazy
things,'' Victoria said. ``We always liked things that had
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   As Herve Aaron, another second-generation dealer who works with
his father at Didier Aaron, the renowned Paris and New York
gallery, put it: ``Not only does Tony have the same broad and
eclectic taste as his father, with a vision for design which is out
of the classical, but he also has a real human quality rare in a
dealer. He likes to share his knowledge. If we dealers lose clients
today, it's because we don't know how to interest them enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria said he had sold the gallery because he ``had an offer
for the building that was too tempting to refuse.'' Now he is
selling its contents in two auctions at Christie's in New York in
May: 126 lots in the sale of ``Important French and Continental
Furniture, Ceramics, Tapestries and Carpets,'' to be held May 27 at
Rockefeller Center, and 176 lots in the sale of ``European
Furniture and Decorative Arts,'' to be held on May 26 at Christie's
East, at 219 E. 67th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick P. Victoria &AMP; Son Inc. has been a New York
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its closing makes me sad,'' said Stephanie Stokes, a Manhattan
interior designer who spent two hours in a Christie's basement last
week studying the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the sale offers the opportunity of a lifetime,'' she
said. ``Tony has an unfailing, extraordinary eye. There is simply
nothing ugly there. The painted pieces are particularly strong and
we don't have a lot of good painted furniture in New York. It's a
truly spectacular collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts are echoed in the preface to the sale's catalog,
which was written by Hubert de Givenchy, the Paris couturier who is
now president of Christie's France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always made a point of visiting Freddy and Tony Victoria at
their gallery whenever I was in New York,'' Givenchy wrote. ``I was
constantly struck by the wonderfully eclectic range of treasures on
display there, all chosen with a distinctive eye for striking and
unusual shapes and forms.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing for the sale is good. Christie's sold the French
furniture in the Martin and Pauline Alexander collection April 30
for $10 million above the high estimate, for a total of $27.5
million. Leon Dalva, a proprietor of Dalva Brothers, a fine French
antiques gallery on East 57th Street, said, ``There has been a
steady increase in the demand for French furniture, and Tony's
taste is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-story Victoria gallery resembled a great French country
house, with tall ceilings, creaking wood floors, ceramic stoves and
antique French paneled walls. It was so comfortable, and the
conversation was so good, that people often spent the afternoon in
the shop. Clients included Brooke Astor, Rachel (Bunny) Mellon,
Barbara (Babe) Paley, Grace Kelly and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the gallery sold 18th-century French furniture,
clocks, porcelains, chandeliers, mirrors and paintings to
collectors through legendary designers like Elsie de Wolfe, Sister
Parish of Parish-Hadley, Eleanor Brown, founder of the decorating
firm McMillen Inc.; Billy Baldwin, Mark Hampton and Michael Taylor
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the gallery was a source for designers as varied
as David Anthony Easton, Mario Buatta, Stephen Sills of Huniford
Sills, Bunny Williams, Howard Slatkin, Albert Hadley and Edward
Perrault of Houston, all looking for antiques with style and
personality.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the sale pieces have universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always liked things that were easy to live with, both
visually and in terms of maintenance,'' Victoria said. ``We have a
lot of painted furniture, not a lot of ormolu, and everything is in
its original state.''
</P>
<P>
   The lot pictured on the catalog's cover is my favorite; it's one
of a pair of extraordinary Italian polychrome mirrors in the
Chinese taste. Each has a scene showing Chinese men hauling framed
mirrors up a hill next to a Chinese pavilion and an elaborate
fretwork surround inlaid with mirror, with an exotic canopy at the
top shading a gilded face of a man with a long mustache. The
estimate for the pair is $250,000 to $350,000, but the pieces are
bound to fetch more. They are unique.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 84 will also turn heads. It is a Louis XV chaise longue
known as a ``chaise d'amour.'' It has caned sides, a silk velvet
headrest, palm rests and a long narrow seat. A celebrated French
dealer, Gaston Bensimon, told Victoria in 1984 that its purpose was
``to make love.''
</P>
<P>
   Most charming perhaps are a pair of circa 1770 Italian
papier-mache chinoiserie figures seated crosslegged on cushions.
Brightly painted, each is 18 inches tall and has a lively,
expressive face. The man wears a long droopy mustache, a
pagoda-shaped hat and a flowing gold-decorated green robe over his
pantaloons. The woman wears a bright red jacket and a Mona Lisa
smile. They nod their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinoiserie taste is something I inherited, and it became
second nature,'' Victoria said. ``These two are unusual because
such figures were delicate and didn't survive as well as other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese nodding-head figures were popular in England in the 18th
century, Victoria said. The Boulay 300 magazine says the ones in
the sale are probably Venetian. The estimate is $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some pieces in the sale are very rare. ``In 18th-century
France,'' Victoria said, ``if you had a lot of taste and money you
could commission individual pieces of furniture for specific tasks
like hairdressing, games, even lovemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a Louis XV caned beechwood chair with a
heart-shaped back known as a ``fauteuil a coiffer.'' It once
belonged to Michel David-Weill. Designed as a chair for a woman
having her hair dressed, it is one of only two known in this style;
the other is in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's father once owned that chair, but he donated it to
the museum in memory of his eldest son, Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chair my father always coveted,'' Victoria said.
``When he bought it in 1962, it was the highest-priced chair that
had ever sold, at 90,000 French francs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he bought his chair in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Will the sale be a success? Dalva said: ``Business is good.
Merchandise is hard to find. And the estimates are very
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Your move.

VIOLENT MEDIA TARGETS THE HEARTS OF OUR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- Former Education Secretary William Bennett showed
a Senate hearing clips of ''The Basketball Diaries,'' the film that
inspired a 14-year-old to kill students in a Kentucky school. It
featured teen idol Leonardo DiCaprio blasting classmates with a
shotgun.
 &HT;    Bennett then ran excerpts of ''Scream,'' seen by millions of
teens. In an opening scene, a teen-age girl is forced to watch her
jock boyfriend tortured and then disemboweled by two fellow
students seeking revenge. After his stomach is cut open and he dies
screaming, the killers repeatedly stab Drew Barrymore, torture her,
cut her throat and hang her body from a tree for her parents to see
when they drive home.
 &HT;    ''Had enough?'' Bennett asked. ''That's what a lot of American
parents have had. Enough.''
 &HT;    Denver Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput also told the
committee of being ''completely stunned'' by seeing ''The Matrix.''
In one scene the heroes wear leather trench coats ''in a violent,
elegant, slow-motion bloodbath'' as they ''cut down about a dozen
people with their guns.'' He wondered if Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold had seen the film. ''If so, it certainly didn't deter
them.''
 &HT;    The Catholic prelate noted that people of faith have been
involved in music, art, literature and architecture for thousands
of years ''because we know from experience that these things shape
the soul. And through the soul, they shape behavior. The roots of
violence in our culture are much more complicated than just bad
rock lyrics and brutal screenplays. And it's clear that the
Columbine killings were planned well before ''The Matrix'' ever
opened.
 &HT;    ''But common sense tells us that the violence of our music, our
video games, our films and our television has to go somewhere and
it goes straight into the hearts of our children, to bear fruit in
ways we can't imagine, until something like Littleton happens.''
 &HT;    Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), recalled that many Americans ''were
justifiably outraged when it was discovered that tobacco companies
marketed cigarettes to children. I believe that we should be
equally concerned if we find that violent music and video games are
being marketed to children.''
 &HT;    That's exactly what they are doing. Sen. Sam Brownback,
(R-Kans.), who organized the hearing before the Littleton massacre,
said the ''teen-slasher'' films such as ''Scream'' are rated R (not
recommended for teens under 18). ''But the teen cast and high
school setting indicates that the targeted audience is precisely
the same people who are supposedly discouraged from seeing it:
teens.'' Theaters seldom block underage kids from R films.
 &HT;    More disturbing is the violence in video games, because a game
player takes active part in violence. The higher the body count,
the higher the score in such games as ''Postal,'' which offers the
fun of blowing away innocent bystanders, training children to be
virtual serial killers.
 &HT;    The ads for these games appear in ''Sports Illustrated for
Kids'' and game magazines.
 &HT;    What can be done about it? The CEOs of companies that make these
products, Time-Warner, Seagrams/Universal, Sony, all refused to
testify at the hearing. They did not show up at a White House
meeting on youth violence, either.
 &HT;    Only Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association
came to both meetings. His answer: ''Mother, father, ministers,
rabbis, priests, principals and teachers must construct within the
minds and hearts of children an impenetrable moral shield'' to give
them a clear sense of right and wrong.
 &HT;    He's right, of course, but movies and games should not shoot
armor-piercing bazookas through the shields we parents try to
construct in our kids.
 &HT;    Instead, what is desperately needed are ''comprehensive codes of
conduct adopted by the different entertainment industries
themselves ... much as the broadcasters did from the 1950s to the
1980s with the old National Association of Broadcasters TV code,''
proposed Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), and Sen. John McCain,
(R-Ariz.), in a New York Times column.
 &HT;    The nation's major Internet providers recently pledged such a
step, a filtering tool that is one click away for parents. AOL
already offers it. Problem is, ''with 99 percent of the filters
that are out there, there is an override code or a 12-year-old who
is sharp can figure it out,'' says Rev. Don Wildmon, a United
Methodist pastor and president of the American Family Association
(AFA).
 &HT;    Therefore, AFA offers a better alternative. Buy your Internet
access through AFA for $21.95 a month that offers the same
unlimited access, but with the server filtering out all violent
games, sexually explicit or hate material and chat rooms except a
few that are monitored.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ After more than 10 years tracking the deadly
commerce of street drug crime, Hartford Police Sergeant Christopher
Lyons thought he had seen every exchange imaginable: Drugs for
cash. Drugs for guns. Drugs for jewelry. Drugs for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lyons and others say, Hartford's drug dealers and buyers
have found something new to trade: Cars for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the aftermath of the crack '90s, they have come to be
known in Hartford and other areas of the state as ``half-g'' cars _
cars rented by the hour or day to drug dealers, typically in return
for a half-gram of cocaine. In some cases, strung-out addicts short
on cash loan the cars indefinitely to pay back deep debts to
unforgiving suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the phenomenon drew widespread attention and fueled
community-wide anger in Hartford after a black teenager was shot by
police following a chase. The teen, Aquan Salmon, was riding with
friends in a car later identified as a half-g car, registered to a
white female from an outlying suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tracked the emergence of half-g's in Connecticut
say the trend has mushroomed with deadly potential, arming young
dealers with new mobility and a new sense of power. Once a code
word among street gangs, they say, half-g's have become familiar
shorthand in narcotics units from Hartford to Bridgeport to New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem, and I don't see an end to it,'' said
Lyons, who headed the Hartford Police Department's gang task force
in the early 1990s and watched the trend emerge. ``The people
buying the crack come in with their cars, and they smoke for as
long as they can. And then the kids use the car for all kinds of
other crimes _ drive-bys, delivering drugs to other locations,
robberies, reckless driving, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about how widely the trend has spread
nationally. Police and researchers who track drug and gang activity
in Massachusetts say the phenomenon has not crossed the border.
Even Connecticut law enforcement officials are divided about
whether the trend might be occurring in other cities, and known by
another name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people selling drugs for cars, for weapons, for lots of
things,'' said Bridgeport Police Sergeant Rafael Villegas, who is
assigned to the FBI's gang task force for the city. ``We've even
seen junkies who lease their cars out all the time, going from one
high to the next. It's the enterprise system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, police say it would be nearly impossible to
document or prove every half-g transaction.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons said he knew something was up when he began seeing
street kids _ kids he had always seen walking or riding the buses _
riding in legally registered cars, many of them high-end Hondas,
Acuras, or even Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming across case after case where kids in the city
were driving around in these cars,'' Lyons said. ``These were 14-
and 15 year-olds. We'd stop some of them and ask where they got the
car from, and they'd say, `Oh, it's my friend from Stratford or New
Haven or Berlin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, owners of cars began reporting them stolen
after dealers refused to return them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you have these owners saying their cars were
stolen, then the car turns up with the keys in the engine, and the
ignition isn't even popped,'' said retired Hartford Deputy Police
Chief Gerry Pleasent. ``You look at that and you know something is
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally used in cocaine deals, the phenomenon now involves
trades of almost any drug, in varying amounts, for anywhere from a
few hours to a few days' use of a car.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new-fangled street leases, officials say, is
a symbiosis between suburban addicts and young urban street dealers
who live worlds apart but share a common craving: anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For suburbanites hiding crippling habits, the exchange offers
hours-long binges three or four highway exits from home, without
having to give up hard cash. For the teenage lookouts, runners, and
small-time dealers who make up the core of the industry, a half-g
is a ``clean'' ride, a new opportunity to commit crimes without
being traced.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the whole war on drugs, cars were the weak link for a lot
of these kids,'' said Sergeant Maura Hammick, spokeswoman for the
Hartford Police Department. ``It has a plate that can be traced. It
has a distinction to it. If a kid drove it all the time, neighbors
would know, and if someone witnessed the car in a crime, they could
say `Oh, that's so-and-so's car.'
</P>
<P>
   Following a national push to crack down on street-level drug
dealing by seizing cars involved in drug crimes, Hammick said, ``it
became very appealing to some of these kids to use a complete
stranger's car, because nothing they did could be traced back to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting of Aquan Salmon, community
activists have called for new statutes targeting drug users who
loan cars to urban teenagers in exchange for drugs. While a
polarized community in Hartford waits for state investigators to
conclude their probe into the case, some say the consequences for
buying drugs must be handed down equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in from the suburbs, score their drugs and get on
out of town, and those people who are living here end up getting
all the (jail) time,'' said the Rev. Nora Wyatt, Jr., president of
The Greater Hartford African American Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said the half-g trend preys on young teens who have known
only poverty. Many of them have never seen a Mercedes-Benz or a
Lexus, much less driven one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have laws so that people contributing to kids
committing crimes are held as responsible as the kids themselves,''
he said. ``They're part of the problem.''

Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- Former Education Secretary William Bennett showed
a Senate hearing clips of ''The Basketball Diaries,'' the film that
inspired a 14-year-old to kill students in a Kentucky school. It
featured teen idol Leonardo DiCaprio blasting classmates with a
shotgun.
 &HT;    Bennett then ran excerpts of ''Scream,'' seen by millions of
teens. In an opening scene, a teen-age girl is forced to watch her
jock boyfriend tortured and then disemboweled by two fellow
students seeking revenge. After his stomach is cut open and he dies
screaming, the killers repeatedly stab Drew Barrymore, torture her,
cut her throat and hang her body from a tree for her parents to see
when they drive home.
 &HT;    ''Had enough?'' Bennett asked. ''That's what a lot of American
parents have had. Enough.''
 &HT;    Denver Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput also told the
committee of being ''completely stunned'' by seeing ''The Matrix.''
In one scene the heroes wear leather trench coats ''in a violent,
elegant, slow-motion bloodbath'' as they ''cut down about a dozen
people with their guns.'' He wondered if Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold had seen the film. ''If so, it certainly didn't deter
them.''
 &HT;    The Catholic prelate noted that people of faith have been
involved in music, art, literature and architecture for thousands
of years ''because we know from experience that these things shape
the soul. And through the soul, they shape behavior. The roots of
violence in our culture are much more complicated than just bad
rock lyrics and brutal screenplays. And it's clear that the
Columbine killings were planned well before ''The Matrix'' ever
opened.
 &HT;    ''But common sense tells us that the violence of our music, our
video games, our films and our television has to go somewhere and
it goes straight into the hearts of our children, to bear fruit in
ways we can't imagine, until something like Littleton happens.''
 &HT;    Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), recalled that many Americans ''were
justifiably outraged when it was discovered that tobacco companies
marketed cigarettes to children. I believe that we should be
equally concerned if we find that violent music and video games are
being marketed to children.''
 &HT;    That's exactly what they are doing. Sen. Sam Brownback,
(R-Kans.), who organized the hearing before the Littleton massacre,
said the ''teen-slasher'' films such as ''Scream'' are rated R (not
recommended for teens under 18). ''But the teen cast and high
school setting indicates that the targeted audience is precisely
the same people who are supposedly discouraged from seeing it:
teens.'' Theaters seldom block underage kids from R films.
 &HT;    More disturbing is the violence in video games, because a game
player takes active part in violence. The higher the body count,
the higher the score in such games as ''Postal,'' which offers the
fun of blowing away innocent bystanders, training children to be
virtual serial killers.
 &HT;    The ads for these games appear in ''Sports Illustrated for
Kids'' and game magazines.
 &HT;    What can be done about it? The CEOs of companies that make these
products, Time-Warner, Seagrams/Universal, Sony, all refused to
testify at the hearing. They did not show up at a White House
meeting on youth violence, either.
 &HT;    Only Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association
came to both meetings. His answer: ''Mother, father, ministers,
rabbis, priests, principals and teachers must construct within the
minds and hearts of children an impenetrable moral shield'' to give
them a clear sense of right and wrong.
 &HT;    He's right, of course, but movies and games should not shoot
armor-piercing bazookas through the shields we parents try to
construct in our kids.
 &HT;    Instead, what is desperately needed are ''comprehensive codes of
conduct adopted by the different entertainment industries
themselves ... much as the broadcasters did from the 1950s to the
1980s with the old National Association of Broadcasters TV code,''
proposed Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), and Sen. John McCain,
(R-Ariz.), in a New York Times column.
 &HT;    The nation's major Internet providers recently pledged such a
step, a filtering tool that is one click away for parents. AOL
already offers it. Problem is, ''with 99 percent of the filters
that are out there, there is an override code or a 12-year-old who
is sharp can figure it out,'' says Rev. Don Wildmon, a United
Methodist pastor and president of the American Family Association
(AFA).
 &HT;    Therefore, AFA offers a better alternative. Buy your Internet
access through AFA for $21.95 a month that offers the same
unlimited access, but with the server filtering out all violent
games, sexually explicit or hate material and chat rooms except a
few that are monitored.

<P>
   Can the Fall Be Far Behind?
</P>
<P>
   With next month's Tonys prompting more than a few yawns from
Broadway's cognoscenti, some gazes are already drifting toward the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   There already appears to be a candidate for a musical
blockbuster, ``Saturday Night Fever.'' The musical, based on the
movie, has had brisk sales. Although the cast offers no major stars
thus far, the show sold $1.6 million in single-ticket sales in the
first weeks, and its total advance stands at $6.2 million. It is to
open on Oct. 21 at the Minskoff Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Other entries confirmed include the play ``Voices in the Dark,''
at the Longacre Theater (to open on Aug. 12); ``Kat and the
Kings,'' a musical about a South African singing group at the Cort
(Aug. 19); a drag (as in queen) show, ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour''
at the Booth (Oct. 17) and ``Putting It Together,'' a Sondheim
sampler, at the Barrymore (Oct. 28).
</P>
<P>
   Now, three more fall entries have confirmed dates. ``Epic
Proportions,'' a comedy by Larry Coen and David Crane about the
making of a biblical epic, will open on Sept. 16. Kristin Chenoweth
(``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'') has been mentioned as a
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Swing,'' a musical paean to the retro-dance fad,
which has set a tentative Nov. 18 opening at a Nederlander house.
Lynne-Taylor Corbett (``Titanic'') will direct.
</P>
<P>
   Also confirmed is the revival of Peter Shaffer's ``Amadeus,''
which is to play in Los Angeles before landing at a Shubert house
for a Dec. 16 opening. David Suchet, who starred as the narrator
and villain Salieri, will reprise the role here. Sir Peter Hall
directs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the autumn landscape gets murkier, with producers
still looking to settle such minor details as theaters, dates and
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' looks solid for a November opening, in a
theater to be named later. A member of the production staff said a
midsize Broadway house had already been offered but could not be
identified because a show was currently running there. Casting is
not complete, but Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell are strong
possibilities, the staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vivian Beaumont Theater, at Lincoln Center, has long had
``Marie Christine,'' Michael John LaChiusa's musical with Audra
McDonald, scheduled for November, but look also for the Beaumont's
current resident, ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' to transfer
to a smaller Broadway house if its sales keep up. Another possible
fall entry comes from Matthew Bourne, director of ``Swan Lake.''
Katharine Dore, the producer of Bourne's latest ballet,
``Cinderella,'' which is just completing a run in Los Angeles,
inquired this week about bringing the show to Broadway for a
limited run in the late fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of the possible straight plays, an early autumn entry may be a
revival of ``The Rainmaker'' by N. Richard Nash. The production,
directed by Scott Ellis, drew strong reviews at the Williamstown
Theater Festival last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson has been approached about playing Starbuck, the
male lead, and the Brooks Atkinson is a possible home if the right
cast can be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Another production hunting for the right man is a revival of
Eugene O'Neill's ``Moon for the Misbegotten.'' Cherry Jones has
long been attached to the project, and people connected with it say
Stephen Rea is a candidate to play opposite her.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-December will bring a trip to ``Wrong Mountain,'' a surreal
comedy by David Hirson involving a giant worm, theatrical mind
games and a crazed director. Alan Cumming (``Cabaret'') was
involved in early readings.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel, Superstar
</P>
<P>
   The producers Anita Waxman and Elizabeth P. Williams, an
ambitious new team, said this week they were forming a commercial
production company, Orpheus Productions, devoted to staging the
work of the British director David Leveaux, most recently of
``Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet on people,'' said Ms. Waxman, ``and David seems like a
good bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haimes, the artistic director of both the Roundabout
Theater Company and Livent, will be an adviser to the new company.
Its first production is likely to be Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire
Under the Elms'' next spring, followed by a revival of the musical
``Nine,'' both directed by Leveaux.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most fascinating project is still several years
from fruition: a Kevin Costner musical. Ms. Waxman said Costner had
begun development work on ``My Cuba,'' a musical about the Cuban
revolution and the rise of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Costner would star in the musical and help produce it with
Orpheus. The show may be performed in workshop sometime after 2000.
Representatives at Costner's production company, Tig Productions,
confirmed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Cho's Return
</P>
<P>
   It's been four years since Margaret Cho, then the country's
hottest comedienne, watched as her big break broke down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ms. Cho's sitcom ``All-American Girl'' was canceled by
ABC amid slipping ratings and a controversy surrounding the show's
portrayal of Asian-American life. It was an experience that Ms.
Cho, 30, now variously likens to ``a descent into hell,'' a
``Jacobean tragedy'' or the story of ``the Trojan Margaret.'' More
seriously, Ms. Cho says she, too, was slipping, into alcohol and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't talked about it,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Los Angeles. ``And I certainly haven't been able to
laugh about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting June 22, however, Ms. Cho will be exploring her
Hollywood days _ and daze _ in New York in a one-woman show she has
written. It is her theatrical debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories I have been telling have changed so much and
expanded so much that they became too big to tell in a comedy
club,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is still untitled, is to play at the Westbeth
Theater Center, which has been home to successful one-person acts
by the likes of Eddie Izzard and Sandra Bernhard. Ms. Cho, who is
Korean-American, says that while her days in Hollywood were
``harsh,'' her show is less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say that comedy comes from coping with painful
experiences,'' she said. ``And I've had some practice with that.''

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Museum Lays In Vintage Kellys &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection
continues its rapid growth, some of this country's best-known
artists are choosing to give and sell the museum works from their
own collections. This week the museum announced that it had bought
22 works, paintings, wall reliefs and sculptures, by Ellsworth
Kelly. They have been valued at more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The works range from the artist's student days in Boston, just
after World War II, to his large-scale sculptures of the last 10
years. They are to be exhibited at the museum in the summer of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the artist,'' said David A. Ross, the museum's
director. ``It's part of our overall strategy to tell the complete
story of modern art.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago the museum bought 14 works by Robert
Rauschenberg, many from the artist's own collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to go in depth with the work of certain
artists when warranted,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's trustees match the director and curators as fans of
Kelly. (One, Donald Fisher, founder of the Gap, owns one of the
largest private collections of Kelly's work.) An anonymous group of
trustees paid for the 22 works.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 75, is considered one of the nation's pre-eminent postwar
artists. His relationship with the San Francisco museum dates back
to 1988, when an exhibition of his works on paper was shown there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly later donated a sculpture, ``Diagonal With Curve XI''
(1982), to the museum in memory of John Caldwell, the former chief
curator, who died in 1993. The gift was also timed to coincide with
the opening of the museum's new building in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest of the new acquisitions is ``Self-Portrait
With Thorn,'' a 1947 Picassoesque painting. Another painting,
``Shuan-Shu'' (1948), is an abstract play on Chinese characters.
There are several of Kelly's large-scale sculptures as well as some
of his earlier ``Chance'' compositions. The sculptures include
pieces in steel, aluminum and wood. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unearthed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art in Washington, like its counterpart
in London, has begun producing small, tightly edited exhibitions
that focus on a specific work of art.
</P>
<P>
   From May 30 through June 18, ``The Taking of Christ,'' a 1602
painting by Caravaggio, will hang in a room in the museum's West
Building as the centerpiece of the show ``Caravaggio's `The Taking
of Christ': Saints and Sinners in Baroque Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting had fallen out of the art world's sight for almost
two centuries when it was rediscovered in Ireland in 1990. It was
recognized by scholars in the dining room of the Dublin residence
of the Society of Jesus. The painting was labeled as the work of
Gerard van Honthorst, a Dutch painter who was influenced by
Caravaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painted for Ciriaco Mattei, a Roman nobleman and
remained in the family until 1802, when it was sold to a Scotsman
named William Hamilton Nisbet,'' said Philip Conisbee, senior
curator of European paintings at the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was then that the attribution was changed. In 1921,
Nisbet's family sold it.'' By the end of the 1920s the painting had
been given to the Jesuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, theJesuits invited Sergio Benedetti, the senior
conservator for the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, to see
the painting. He recognized it as the long-lost Caravaggio. Ten
other experts traveled to Dublin and confirmed his discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery's exhibition draws on ``Saints and Sinners:
Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a show in the McMullen Museum
of Art at Boston College through May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we couldn't take the entire exhibition, I thought we
could reinstall the Caravaggio with eight of our own works, some
that have been recently cleaned and others that are recent
acquisitions,'' Conisbee said.
</P>
<P>
   The other works are by artists influenced by Caravaggio.
Included are ``Soldiers Playing Cards and Dice (The Cheats)''
(circa 1620-22) by a French follower, Valentin de Boullogne, and
two restored works, ``St. Jerome and the Angel'' (1625) by Simon
Vouet and ``St. Sebastian'' (circa 1620-30), by Tanzio da Varallo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Manet Reunion &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Frick
Collection in New York are uniting two parts of a large painting by
Manet that was displayed at the 1864 Paris Salon as ``Incident in a
Bullfight.'' The painting became two independent canvases when
Manet cut two sections out of it soon after its return from the
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Art scholars have suggested that Manet was reacting to criticism
that the toreador in the foreground was too large for the figures
in the background or that the artist was seeking to make two
stronger works. He is thought to have discarded the rest of the
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   One work, ``The Dead Toreador,'' is in the permanent collection
of the National Gallery of Art. The other, ``The Bullfight,'' was
acquired by the industrialist Henry Clay Frick in 1914. The two
paintings will be displayed together for the first time from May 25
through Aug. 22 in the Frick's East Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades art historians and conservators have tried to
reconstruct the original work. ``It's been a puzzle to try to see
what the original composition looked like,'' said Susan Grace
Galassi, the Frick Collection's associate curator, who organized
the show. ``Our only record has been three caricatures from
satirical publications of the period and verbal descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, she said, people have studied the works with X-rays
and determined that the artist altered the painting before showing
it at the Salon. Putting together the two works was an obvious
idea, she added. ``Hopefully, this will be the beginning of more
research.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curator at the Modern &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art has announced that Paulo Herkenhoff, an
art historian, critic and director of the Sao Paulo biennial show,
will serve as an adjunct curator in the painting and sculpture
department for three years beginning in September. He will work on
exhibitions and acquisitions, particularly of Latin American and
contemporary art.

<P>
   ``Atomic Train'' was not produced by that amorphous bogeyman
that some people in Washington have blithely named the ``toxic
culture.'' This is a silly two-part mini-series that works
surprisingly well on the level of formulaic action. It is ``Speed''
on a train with Rob Lowe in the Sandra Bullock role, playing a hero
who has to stop a runaway train hurtling toward Denver carrying a
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Happenstance also caused that train to collide with actual news
events. After the shootings at Columbine High School, the Denver
setting acquired an unintended chill. Understandably, NBC did not
change the setting of its film. Would it have been kinder to have
targeted Salt Lake City, which has had shooting sprees of its own?
Just as understandably, the NBC station in Denver has chosen not to
carry the mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``Atomic Train'' was not made by the devil, it is the
very definition of a cheap thrill. Even before the train heads
toward Denver, there is something creepy, callous and
self-defeating about the way the mini-series uses realistic
allusions to lend credence to its inane story. At the last minute,
NBC substituted the words ``hazardous material'' for ``nuclear
waste'' and tacked on a disclaimer saying the mini-series is ``not
based on fact.'' The network denied it was responding to pressure
from the nuclear power industry. Those changes are ludicrously at
odds with the mini-series' tone.
</P>
<P>
   In a prelude to the main plot, the drama begins with lifelike
news reports of fictional railroad accidents. ``As night falls in
Omaha, the rescue teams have nearly completed the grim task of
sifting through the wreckage,'' one newsman says, in a
pitch-perfect imitation of the typical anchor's melodramatic
delivery and overwritten script.
</P>
<P>
   Even more jarring is language that brings to mind the crisis in
Kosovo. As residents begin evacuating Denver, just in case the Rob
Lowe character fails, the president addresses the nation. He is
played by Edward Herrmann as a man who is sincerely concerned but
hasn't a clue what to do. We see him on the Times Square Jumbotron,
the NBC logo prominently displayed, saying, ``I ask that you open
your hearts and your homes to any refugees from Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Some characters are already heading toward what is called ``a
refugee camp on the Kansas border.'' You would think the world has
enough refugees without NBC adding some from Colorado. Instead of
adding realism such language jolts viewers out of the story,
emphasizing the distance between this glib action movie and harsh
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics prevent ``Atomic Train'' from being as purely
escapist as it could and should have been. Most of the time it has
the action formula down. ``We're a rolling Chernobyl,'' the train's
engineer says of the nuclear waste he is hauling (whatever he calls
it), and that is before anyone realizes that an unstable Russian
nuclear bomb has been hidden on board by the corrupt owner of a
waste disposal company hoping to save shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   The train loses its brakes. John Seger (Lowe), an investigator
for the National Transportation Safety Board, happens to be in the
neighborhood. Before long, he is leaping onto a freight train from
a helicopter, jumping from that freight train to the atomic train,
and dangling upside down between cars trying to fix the brakes. So
much for believable action. But then ``Speed'' wasn't exactly a
study in realism. ``Atomic Train'' maintains a swift pace and
enough suspense to carry it over the story's obvious trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe keeps a straight face, though it will be hard for viewers
to do the same when watching what is supposedly the atomic train
speeding along twisty mountain tracks. It is conspicuously a
miniature, with cute little toy cars in front of a tiny fake
mountain. The special effects are more convincing when they get
around to fiery explosions.
</P>
<P>
   As in most action movies, the emotional part of the plot is both
de rigueur and completely dispensable. John Seger is a caring
family man, with a belligerent teen-age daughter, a new wife and a
small stepson. What better way for a family to blend than to face
nuclear holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   ``Atomic Train'' takes an exceptionally dark turn in the second
episode and becomes a different sort of disaster movie. The plot
shouldn't be given away, though anyone with an eye on the clock in
Part One can make a safe guess. The evacuation leads to panic,
looting and general social chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Atomic Train'' will not lead to anything like that,
though it does raise lingering questions about how real tragedies
are put to tacky fictional use.
</P>

<P>
   `ATOMIC TRAIN'
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Sunday and Monday nights at 9 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Channel 4 in New York)
</P>
<P>
   First of a two-part mini-series, written by Dick Lowry and David
Jackson; Dennis Hammer, Armand Speca and Jeff Fazio, executive
producers; Mike Joyce, producer; Barbara Kelly, co-producer.
Produced by Dennis Hammer Productions in association with NBC

<P>
   `DOUBLE PLATINUM'
</P>
<P>
   ABC, Sunday night
</P>
<P>
   (Channel 7, New York, at 9)
</P>
<P>
   The only question raised by ``Double Platinum'' has to do with
money. How many CDs will be sold as a result of this joint
promotion for Diana Ross and Brandy? Disguised as a soap opera, the
film is really a two-hour music video so lacking in style it makes
the dullest VH-1 video seem like cutting-edge art. Ms. Ross plays
Olivia, who leaves her husband and baby daughter, Kayla, to pursue
her dream of becoming a star. Eighteen years later, about 10
minutes in television time, she looks up Kayla (Brandy), and helps
 &UR; her &LR;  pursue her dream of becoming a star.
</P>
<P>
   They fight, they make up, but all of it is an excuse for the mom
and daughter divas to sing in hackneyed poses: onstage in front of
an adoring crowd, in a recording studio. Brandy's songs include
``Almost Doesn't Count'' and Ms. Ross' ``Every Day Is a New Day.''
With the exception of a duet at the end, all are available on their
latest CDs.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a surprising or believable moment anywhere, though
there is talent squandered everywhere. The most conspicuous waste:
Brian Stokes Mitchell plays Kayla's dad. Though his rich voice
provided the most powerful moments in ``Ragtime'' on Broadway, here
he doesn't sing a note.

AT THE MOVIES: GEOFFREY RUSH; SODERBERGH'S LATEST; ICE CUBE IN
`NEXT FRIDAY' 
</HEADLINE>

   Geoffrey Rush: Bouncing Boy Sees Busy Days
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Perhaps the best word to describe the way Geoffrey
Rush chooses his movie roles is ``bouncing.'' He played a painfully
unbalanced piano prodigy in ``Shine,'' a deadly serious Inspector
Javert in ``Les Miserables'' and a hilariously bumbling theater
owner in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   And now more bouncing: he will appear this summer as the wacky
Casanova Frankenstein in ``Mystery Men,'' a delirious comic book
comedy, and as a murderous theme park creator in the earnest horror
film ``House on Haunted Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of bouncing, and Rush, taking stock of those shifts
at home in his native Australia, said in a telephone interview that
more were in store.
</P>
<P>
   This summer he plans to begin shooting ``Quills,'' in which he
will play the aging Marquis de Sade, famous for his literary
descriptions of sexual sadism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just done two American genre pieces, and I thought this
was something I wanted to bounce back toward,'' said Rush, who has
become one of Hollywood's most respected character actors. ``It's a
great argument about libertarianism versus repression. I would
probably describe this as a sophisticated, cerebral event.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be directed for Fox Searchlight by Philip
Kaufman, director of ``Rising Sun,'' ``Henry and June'' and ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' among other films, and it also
stars Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the Marquis de Sade is old and imprisoned, Rush
said, and suffers when a fairly progressive prison warden is
replaced with a stricter and more repressive warden. That is the
platform for a dramatization of the debate over what can be
expressed and what should be repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees himself as an irreverent peddler of pornography,''
Rush said. ``The question is whether someone like this should
remain locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're coming out of this slight puritanical phase now
and it's time to ask if writers can write what they want to write.
This movie is starting to scratch that old wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush said that in a sense the movie was almost like a period
drama depicting a debate like that posed in ``The People vs. Larry
Flynt,'' the Milos Forman film that explored the contemporary
debate over pornography and the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Rush said he was attracted not to the debate but to the script,
which he found extremely powerful.
</P>
<P>
   And next? Another bounce for Rush, who said he was planning to
do a play in Australia called ``The Small Poppies,'' in which he
will play a 5-year-old on his first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh's Newest
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his breakthrough movie, ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,''
in 1989, Steven Soderbergh has tended to make films that explore
nervous characters with an psychologically probing style. From
``Kafka'' in 1992 to ``Out of Sight,'' last year's noirish
thriller, the movies he has directed have gotten under the skin of
their characters, if not the audiences.
</P>
<P>
   His newest movie, ``The Limey,'' a $9 million drama about an
Englishman who gets out of prison only to come to Los Angeles to
try to learn how his daughter died, is a character study. The film
is to play in Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   But in two weeks Soderbergh is to begin work on a film that will
move into a slightly new direction. For starters, the movie, ``Erin
Brockovich,'' has a $55 million budget, the biggest he has worked
with. For another, it stars one of Hollywood's most expensive
actresses, Julia Roberts. The drama, based on real events, involves
a town whose water is poisoned by a local company, which Ms.
Roberts' character successfully sues.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh said he was drawn to the project by how different it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a method to what I do other than being
engaged by the material and wanting an experience different than
the one I just came out of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh acknowledged that Jersey Films had urged him to
consider the project for some time and that he had initially
rejected it because it was so unlike his usual material. But after
he finished shooting ``The Limey,'' he said, he finally read the
script and found it more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``The Limey,'' an impressionistic film whose chronology
jumps around, ``Erin Brockovich'' has a linear plot. ``I said,
`Let's do the opposite for a change,''' Soderbergh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts plays a divorced woman with three small children who
discovers while working as a clerk at a law firm that a company has
been covering up how its contamination of the water supply is
causing serious illnesses. She and her boss, played by Albert
Finney, take on the polluter and win a $400 million suit.
</P>
<P>
   The studio behind the project, Universal Studios, evidently sees
the film as a potential Oscar contender because it hopes to release
the movie just before year's end, when serious dramas tend to get
the most visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The movie may be a potential award vehicle for Ms. Roberts, who
has received two Oscar nominations but no statues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made a movie in which a female character had that
much time on the screen,'' Soderbergh said. ``She's in virtually
every scene in this film.''
</P>
<P>
   What he ultimately found engaging about the movie, he said, was
the struggle faced by Ms. Roberts' character, who is torn between
her strong views and the fact that nearly everyone around her views
the pollution situation differently than she does and feels she is
going off half cocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I liked is that this is a high-wire act for
her,'' Soderbergh said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube in Cult Sequel
</P>
<P>
   The business of building movie franchises has become fairly
clear-cut in Hollywood: take a blockbuster, focus on the lead
character, put him (it's never a her) in new and different
settings, and then start counting your money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's never quite that simple. But even by the basic
rules of this business, ``Next Friday,'' which began shooting in
Hollywood this week with rapper Ice Cube and Michael Epps in the
leading roles, is an unusual kind of sequel. It is the follow-up to
``Friday,'' a so-called urban comedy _ meaning a movie with a
nearly all-black cast _ that was released in 1995 to generally
scathing reviews and earned a fairly meager $28 million or so at
the box office. It starred Ice Cube and Chris Tucker, at the time a
relatively unknown comedian.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Friday'' got a second wind. The video of the movie sold
and sold and then sold some more: it was on the video best-seller
list for about 100 weeks, with more than 600,000 tapes sold to
date. What's more, more than 2.2 million copies of the movie's
hip-hop soundtrack have been sold. And the film cost a fairly
modest $4 million to produce and distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday'' was, in short, a cult hit, and New Line Cinema, which
produced the film and now the sequel, is banking that the success
can be reproduced in ``Next Friday,'' a film that for a while
anyway nobody wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had vowed never to make a sequel to `Friday' because I
thought it was a classic and that we couldn't repeat it,'' Ice Cube
said. ``I didn't want to be one of these guys regurgitating the
same old jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the original movie's remarkable life in video and
the prospect of remaking the film in a different setting _ in this
case, a suburb rather than the inner city _ led him to give it a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The movie will cost $11 million, which is still modest, and New
Line expects to release it in December. The director is Steve Carr,
who will be handling his first feature film. Ice Cube is a producer
as well as the screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a classic franchise, and Ice Cube didn't want to
do it,'' said Michael De Luca, president of production at New Line.
``But there was a real crossover in video that nobody expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube said that for him, the original film's video life
proved one theory about films with largely black casts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of some violent incidents at rap movies, some whites
avoid seeing such films at theaters, but the appeal of black
culture makes them avid viewers of the videos, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few movie theaters in black neighborhoods, he added,
and young blacks often feel uncomfortable going to largely white
neighborhoods to watch movies steeped in their culture. So they
also tend to rent or buy the videos instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I just try to make a movie true to myself and my
culture,'' Ice Cube said. ``White audiences want something that's
authentic, and if you do that, you also attract the black
audience.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School administrator Elfreda Massie and her
husband, Leonard, couldn't make ends meet despite their $180,000
combined annual salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Massies filed for bankruptcy twice in the past 18 years but
they still lived a life style that allowed them to take vacation
trips to Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Massie's most recent bankruptcy _ filed last June _ showed
the couple had amassed more than $140,000 in debt on 23 credit
cards as well as a loan of almost $10,000 from a teachers' credit
union.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their bankruptcy plea, the Massies will be able
to walk away from much of that debt, even though Mrs. Massie, a
deputy school superintendent in Baltimore, earns $108,000 and her
husband earns about $72,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of case we are trying to eliminate,'' said
George Wallace, a member of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform
Coalition, a group of banks, credit unions, retailers and mortgage
companies that are pushing for bankruptcy reform. Wallace also
practices bankruptcy law in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is urging the Senate to approve legislation in the
next two weeks that would require most people earning more than
$50,000 annually to pay a portion of their debts. The House
approved similar legislation earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to tighten the federal bankruptcy law comes as more
and more consumers seek to shed their debts by filing for
bankruptcy. A record 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy last
year, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
Bankruptcy filings have climbed by nearly 20 percent a year since
the early 1990s, prompting creditors to ask Congress for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the need for bankruptcy reform is fairly obvious,''
said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., citing those bankruptcy
figures. Grassley is the author of the Senate bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
   The means test in the legislation would be adjusted on a
regional basis. The Senate bill, unlike the House bill, gives
bankruptcy judges some leeway to stray from using the means-test.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the tax firm, Ernst &AMP; Young, showed that as many
as 10 percent of bankruptcy filers were financially able to pay a
significant portion of their debts, which is what they would be
required to do if they meet the means-test in the pending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace acknowledges that many people who file for bankruptcy
protection aren't abusing the system and got into trouble with the
loss of a job or hit with thousands of dollars of unexpected
medical bills. Indeed, Mrs. Massie told a local newspaper that she
got into financial trouble when she had to pay a portion of nursing
home care for a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and supporters of the reform legislation say that, even
with the changes they want, the bankruptcy law would still give
people a ``fresh start'' when they run into unforeseen financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a family is making $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000, that fresh
start is guaranteed,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., and author of
the House bill. ``But if you are earning $60,000, $80,000, $100,000
or beyond, then that set of circumstances has to be looked at more
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, consumer groups, and a handful of
Republicans say the means-test is too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., complains that the
IRS living standards are not adjusted for regional differences and
could hurt people living in high-cost areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to me a little humanity, a little flexibility, a
little reasonableness in working out the living standards...is
appropriate,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the measure ``is a great bill for the creditors,''
noting the ``awesome'' power of creditor lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was unsuccessful in his attempt to amend the bill to use a
calculation other than the IRS version to determine living
standards, but ultimately voted for the bankruptcy overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the credit industry has pushed for bankruptcy reform,
consumer groups argue that creditors helped contribute to the
increase in bankruptcies by encouraging people to take on more debt
by, for example, sending out millions of credit card solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said many
credit card firms attract people by offering low interest rates but
then raise the rates to as much as 19 percent later on. He said
many people don't understand the impact of high interest rates and
only making a minimum payment on a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it would take a person with a $2,000 credit card
bill more than 10 years to retire the debt only paying the minimum
amount of $10 or $15 a month _ and that's without ever adding to
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was amended to require credit card issuers to
give consumers more information about the effect of only paying the
minimum amount per month and other financial information. The
Senate bill is likely to amended in the same manner as well.

appropriate,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the measure ``is a great bill for the creditors,''
noting the ``awesome'' power of creditor lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was unsuccessful in his attempt to amend the bill to use a
calculation other than the IRS version to determine living
standards, but ultimately voted for the bankruptcy overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the credit industry has pushed for bankruptcy reform,
consumer groups argue that creditors helped contribute to the
increase in bankruptcies by encouraging people to take on more debt
by, for example, sending out millions of credit card solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said many
credit card firms attract people by offering low interest rates but
then raise the rates to as much as 19 percent later on. He said
many people don't understand the impact of high interest rates and
only making a minimum payment on a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it would take a person with a $2,000 credit card
bill more than 10 years to retire the debt only paying the minimum
amount of $10 or $15 a month _ and that's without ever adding to
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was amended to require credit card issuers to
give consumers more information about the effect of only paying the
minimum amount per month and other financial information. The
Senate bill is likely to amended in the same manner as well.

AT THE MET WITH RICHARD TUTTLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Tuttle, who grew up during the 1940s in
Roselle, N.J., remembers first going to the Metropolitan Museum of
Art when he was around 6 and seeing the ancient Assyrian gates that
used to flank the entrance to the south galleries. The gates are
big stone sculptures of winged lions with human heads and five
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can forget how much of an impression works like those make
on you as a child,'' he says. ``I felt fear, I felt power, dread _
actually, a lot of bad feelings. But later when I came back to the
museum I realized I was hungry for those feelings. And since then
I've come to understand how fearfulness is a art of art, a form of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, though in person few artists are less fearsome than
Tuttle. He tends to speak so softly that he is inaudible. Like his
work, he is a concoction of selflessness and deadpan wit. For a
recent catalog to a show called ``Community,'' he included bits of
rubberized gold string and strips of green self-adhesive paper,
which could be tied through 32 die-cut holes he had had made in the
cover, making the design do-it-yourself. It was a typical (for him)
nod toward what he calls the ``horizontalization of our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except during the high-flying 1980s, when his work was out of
sync with the times, he has been a steady presence on the American
art scene since his first show at the Betty Parsons Gallery in
1965. Many younger artists today revere him almost as a shaman.
Much of the work you see in galleries now _ installations of humble
materials, low-key abstractions, spare Zen-like interventions of
one sort or another _ owes a debt to him. ``Art is a very tender
thing that can easily be hurt,'' he has said, which describes what
he makes, and, to an extent, him.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the Met not long ago, he picked out the Assyrian
sculptures by way of mentioning ``Yellow Backdrop,'' a small relief
he made in 1986. It consists partly of an anchor-shaped piece of
black plastic, like a lump of coal, wedged between two brightly
painted plastic wafers, giving the work depth.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle links the wedge to the fifth leg on the Assyrian lions.
The leg was added so that a person passing through the gate would
see two legs in front and all four legs from the side; it
negotiated, perspectively, the viewer's passage from front to side.
Similarly, the black wedge in ``Yellow Backdrop,'' Tuttle says,
negotiates the passage from front and back, front and side.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone even notices that the winged lions have five legs,
but by now Tuttle's knowledge of what is in the museum is nearly
encyclopedic. He and his family split their time between New York
and New Mexico, but when they are here, which is much of the year,
they go to the Met every Friday night. It has become a ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle has his favorite spots. In the American wing he makes a
point of noting John Frederick Kensett, the Luminist, who happens
to be an ancestor on his father's side.
</P>
<P>
   Kensett painted the Eastern shoreline. In the 1840s he was one
of the artists on a committee that helped to create the Met. Tuttle
is proud of this fact, but his interest in Kensett above all
involves qualities of his late seascapes: quietude, stability, a
kind of internal light. Light seems to emanate from inside these
pictures, as if they were generating their own energy. The notion
of self-generated energy is a trait Tuttle describes as
specifically American. He sees it in Pollock's paintings and
Tiffany's windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact I don't think it's wrong to speak of Pollock in terms
of Luminism because his pictures have the kind of energy you find
in Kensett,'' he says. ``The marvel of it is that as time has gone
on, you still feel the energy in these Pollocks as happening in the
present: it establishes itself in contemporary time, which is why I
think Pollock continues to look so radical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing Off of the Storm'' is one of the Met's late Kensetts,
nearly abstract in its spare design: a rectangular band of sea
beneath two bands of sky. A few tiny sailboats interrupt the
horizon line. ``You know Dan Flavin used to collect Kensett's
drawings,'' Tuttle mentions, speaking about the Minimalist who died
a few years ago, an acquaintance of his. ``Dan did a group of his
own drawings of sailboats in the late 70s that have this same
broken line character. I'm sure they look back to Kensett.''
</P>
<P>
   About Pollock, he adds: ``It's like the horizon line I see in
Pollock, which you can choose to see or not. I believe it's there
because it's connected to the nature of his art. When the canvas
was on the floor, Pollock had to paint it from one side, then go
around and paint from the other, and that created a line, visible
or not, across the center of the painting. I think you see this
unconscious line disappear in his later works, which are a decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once doing a bunch of scribbled drawings with a
ballpoint pen,'' he continued, ``just doodling around and around,
to clear my mind while I was traveling. And I realized I'd made a
horizon line, which emerged for no conscious reason. It's an
unconscious thing, a trait of the hand.'' Art in the Here and Now
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle was among the Post-Minimalists who came onto the scene
during the late 60s and 70s, making sculptures of rubber, wire and
cloth piled in a corner, hanging on a wall or lying around the
floor. Gravity mattered. The idea was to make art that was just
what it appeared to be, that existed in the here and now, and,
additionally, that activated the exhibition space and turned into a
kind of performance zone.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle began by making palm-size paper cubes with cut-out
designs and shaped wood reliefs that seemed like a twist on
geometric abstraction. The cubes, among other things, were about
being able to hold a little bit of space in your hand. They had a
purity and formal rigor that came out of Minimalism but eschewed
Minimalism's aggression and imperiousness. Their effect was to
insinuate, rather than insist on, their own virtues, and, in their
delicate, antiauthoritarian, transitory way they helped to signal a
quiet revolution in American art.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, much of the public seemed not to get the
point. Simplicity is never really simple to achieve and is easily
mistaken for simplemindedness. Not counting his books and prints,
the bulk of the art for which Tuttle has become best known consists
of cardboard, wire, bits of wood, light bulbs, dyed cloth.
Sometimes he has arranged these things into reliefs, accompanied by
a few faint pencil marks on the wall. The value of the materials is
meant to be in inverse proportion to the value of the expression
they serve. His art depends, in a sense, on one's will to see it.

 NEW YORK: to see it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other day in his studio, a modest rented room he shares with
another artist above a furniture warehouse in TriBeCa, he fished
through a big cardboard box containing a few dozen smaller, painted
cardboard constructions. They are his latest relief sculptures,
which he says he is not satisfied with yet. Each is the size of a
small shoebox, taped together so that you can still see bits of the
tape through the paint. A few extra pieces of cardboard are stuck
onto several of the constructions, all of them with different,
brightly colored abstract designs.
</P>
<P>
   He hung six of the works on pushpins along a wall, taking pains
to measure precisely the spaces between the constructions. He has
called his art a cross between calligraphy and architecture,
meaning that his main concerns are line and space: specifically,
the works he has made out of wires and ropes are meditations on
line and drawing, partly derived from a longtime fascination with
Chinese calligraphy. He's always alert to how his sculptures and
paintings, if only discreetly, alter the spaces they occupy. ``I
think our response to any image is a response to the space it
inhabits,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tuttle explains at length, the constructions
function as a group without actually being either a series or a
sequence, meaning that they exist equally, in no particular order
and toward no specific end, in opposition to our tendency to
rationalize and prioritize things _ or that seems to be what they
mean to him, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He has a penchant for long, Delphic monologues. Ask him a yes or
no question and the response will take several minutes, at the end
of which you still don't know the answer. His wife, the poet
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, jokes that only 5 percent of what he says is
useful, but it's more to the point to say that he speaks as he
thinks, bouncing among ideas, and being shy, he's wary about
sounding pushy so he tends to be elliptical.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things he says later sink in. In the museum he
remarked how, before giving a speech not long ago, he worried that
he would forget what he meant to say. To calm himself, he rubbed
his palms together. ``And I thought about those early Flemish
painters' portraits of people with their hands like this,'' he
said. ``When we make this gesture, we're brought to a certain
physical consciousness. Art is always about trying to look for
consciousness, to bring about an awareness of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a convoluted way of saying what is obvious:
that the people in the pictures are praying. But then the image of
Tuttle rubbing his hands together, calming himself down, stuck and
grew. There is, in fact, something about what happens to a person
who makes this gesture: it effects a kind of balance, both physical
and psychological; the gesture of praying no doubt evolved because
it was a means of enhancing consciousness and easing the soul.
</P>
<P>
   After that it became nearly impossible to look at those Flemish
portraits without at least thinking about the gesture, which is the
thing about Tuttle and about his art: if you get past resistance to
his materials or language, you're frequently rewarded with some
funny, unforeseen, sometimes even quasi-spiritual nugget.
</P>
<P>
   In the Egyptian galleries, for example, he is fond of the
fragmentary head of a queen, made of yellow jasper, from the reign
of Amenhotep III in the 14th century B.C. The top of the head, down
to the lips, is missing, broken off, a sign of violence that Tuttle
says ``opens her head so that it's as if she can speak, in the
sense that when we speak we reveal what's inside us.''
</P>
<P>
   He contrasts the fluid sweep of the chin with the ragged line
that is made by the break: ``I have a particular passion for long,
long lines (I married a poet who writes the longest lines in
American poetry), and I love to follow the line of those lips and
also the line of her chin.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentions the sculpture apropos of his own ``White Rocker,'' a
small work he made out of quarter-inch plywood during the '70s.
It's an oval split diagonally and folded, the two parts bridged by
a quarter-inch strip (the minutiae of the geometry, like everything
about his art, having for Tuttle a metaphysical value). The oval
curve, he says, echoes the curve of the Egyptian queen's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of `White Rocker' was to create an extended line, to
show a balance between volume and line. It's kind of hokey. But it
turned out that adding the bridge had the unexpected effect of
lengthening the line even further, making it seem longer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Tuttle made some shaped reliefs out of
waferboard, a patterned wood composite, which he painted partly
with lines and forms that also tapered and turned, the results
being jaunty and sweet. One of them, from 1996, he explains, ``is
built around a small flamelike line, and the question is whether
the line is thick or thin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is important, kind of subconsciously, but actually
you take in the work all at once, the same way you do a Chinese
character, which is made up of a sequence of strokes or gestures,
ordered in a particular way,'' he said. ``Those characters are some
of the most profoundly built structures in human history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our writing system, the messier you get the less you
communicate. But if you know Chinese characters'' _ Tuttle has
studied a little Chinese _ ``you know that the writer is
communicating feelings and ideas through the speed of the lines.
Art is about the power to communicate at differing speeds,
otherwise it's all fast and then it just becomes advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle is especially interested in works that function on
different planes of consciousness, the term he used in talking
about the Flemish portraits. For example, the vermilion seals added
to Chinese scrolls to mark ownership are, he says, a second layer
of consciousness: ``You can get a lot of information from the seals
and not even see the characters of the scroll, or vice versa. So
these two levels of consciousness exist simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consciousness can be represented in different ways. Take the
Greek kouros.'' Now he is referring to the Met's sixth century B.C.
sculpture of a striding boy, the stride designating a shift in
Western art toward a naturalization of the figure. ``The boy is
stepping into consciousness, designating a new awareness by his
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on: vermilion has a quality of seeming invisible. You
can see it if you look for it, he says, but it tends to disappear
when you don't, and among Western artists, Courbet exploited this
fact, using vermilion to sign his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courbet found a way to locate his signature between the
visible and invisible. It was an astonishing breakthrough, really,
to identify the position of the artist and by extension of all of
us in this way. He's saying, `I'm an individual not because of how
I dress or who I associate with but because I can locate myself in
this metaphysical sense, in terms of art, between the visible and
invisible.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the revolution of Courbet involved this notion of
self, because if you think back you see that the self of the artist
didn't exist in the same way it did after him,'' Tuttle says.
``Goya, for example, grudgingly gives himself up, making portraits
in which his own identity slips between himself and the sitter. But
with Courbet, the slipping is between the viewer and the artist.
He's in a different relationship to us. And the slipping between
viewer and artist is something that continues all the way to
Pollock, whom you can feel making the drips when you look at his
pictures.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Still on this subject, he cites the Met's van Eyck, a diptych of
the Crucifixion and Last Judgment. ``With van Eyck's works
generally there's another plane of consciousness because of the
words on the frames of the pictures, which mean that the illusion
in his paintings is brought together with another kind of
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Tuttle made ``Monkey's Recovery for a Darkened Room
(Bluebird),'' a wall relief of branches, wire, cloth, string and
wood scraps, which he says formally relates to the Met's diptych.
``The link is in terms of the organization of bottom, middle and
top, the fact that the panels of the van Eyck are divided
horizontally into three parts, and in a sense so is `Monkey's
Recovery' _ and maybe also in terms of having two vertical parts,
the branches of `Monkey's Recovery' being on one side and the wood
on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle cites the art historian Erwin Panofsky, who said that
once you have van Eyck in your eye, Rubens is just another painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to live every day of my life with van Eyck in my
eye,'' Tuttle adds.

WALLACE NOT LETTING SOME BAD LUCK AFFECT HIS PREPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace is perhaps a pit stop, a bad shock and a wreck
away from being a major player in the Winston Cup points
championship, which is not to say he is out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran driver who has won at least one race in each of the
last 14 years, Wallace is noted for his determination and attention
to detail. Right now he's at seventh place in the standings and
he's had one win _ the Food City 500 in Bristol, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Because he understands cars, is often demanding and is never
afraid to express his opinion, Wallace can be a difficult boss.
That can be especially true when he isn't running as well as he
feels he should.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, his competitive edge remains sharp.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he will tell you that, with this season about a third
over, he is disappointed with his overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had three bad problems with finishing below 30th _ that
was at Atlanta and Darlington and Talladega _ so I'm worse off than
I thought I'd be right now,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   If Wallace is behind, it's not because his Ford isn't ready to
race. He strongly believes that the teams that prepare the best do
the best, and he is normally ready to run when he gets to the
track.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things you just can't prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   Like the California 500 two weekends ago in Fontana, where he
got caught in the pits by a caution flag that caused him to fall a
lap behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Or in March in Atlanta, where he felt fairly confident going
into the Cracker Barrel 500 only to have trouble with a bad shock
that dropped him to 35th.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Diehard 500 in April at Talladega, Ala., where while
running third he was taken out by a wreck that was not of his
making. He had expected to do well in the race since he had the
dominant car at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the eighth-place finish in Daytona ... well, you
get the point, even if Wallace hasn't gotten as many as he would
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be the lap leader, but that doesn't win
races,'' said Wallace, who has led more laps than anybody in three
of the 10 races so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to do that, but unforeseen circumstances sometimes
happen, like at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a restrictor-plate wreck in a long, long time,
and it seemed like for a long time there I was involved in every
one of them, and then it happened again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the guy I ended up running into was Jeff
Gordon. I hit him dead in the door at 180 mph and we both walked
away from it, but you can't dwell on that. You've just gotta keep
running,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the points may not show it, when he is right,
Wallace can be about as tough as anyone to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, he has shown strength on the restrictor plate
tracks _ Daytona and Talladega _ and the short tracks, those less
than a mile in length, places where he traditionally runs well.
</P>
<P>
   And if he can avoid the bad luck that befell him at Atlanta,
Darlington and California, he could still be a factor in the points
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like to talk about frustration because there is
a lot of stuff you can't do anything about,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deal at Fontana, I went in there with high hopes of
winning the race and running good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon was running at warp speed again and I made a scheduled
pit stop running fifth. When I left pit road, the caution flag flew
and I'm down a lap. That's bad luck right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna change my feeling on preparation,'' Wallace
said. ``I still feel like we've prepared great and we're gonna stay
that way throughout the year,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is a firm believer that hard work pays off.
</P>
<P>
   His team has worked feverishly to build a new fleet of more
aerodynamic cars, and they are coming on line now.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck, that may enable him to keep some of the
other leaders in line behind him.

BACHARACH IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREG HAYMES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Bacharach is back . . . in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, popmeister Burt Bacharach seems to be bigger than ever,
and that's really saying something considering the way his songs
dominated the pop charts back in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The Bacharach comeback seems to have ignited a couple of years
ago with the show-stopping sing-along of his hit ``I Say a Little
Prayer'' in the film ``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's soundtrack also included everyone from Ani DiFranco
to Mary Chapin Carpenter offering their interpretations of his
classic tunes. Then there was Bacharach's cameo in the film
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, hipsters like the Ben Folds Five, Sheryl Crow and
Chrissie Hynde paid tribute to the songmaster in a New York City
concert that was broadcast on TNT and PBS. And just a few months
ago, Rhino Records gave him the deluxe treatment with a smashing
3-CD box set of his works, ``The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach
Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   But proving that he's not merely living off his considerable
past glories, Bacharach teamed up with Elvis Costello to write and
produce the Grammy-winning album ``Painted From Memory,'' one of
the most sophisticated pop albums of last year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, People magazine named the 70-year-old Bacharach as
one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world, featuring him
alongside folks like Sandra Bullock and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   And Bacharach is back on the road again, including a tour stop
at Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing more touring now than I've ever done in life,''
Bacharach admitted during a telephone interview last week from
Texas, where he was performing with the Houston Symphony Orchestra.
``It's kind of funny, but that's just the way things have turned
out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot, and Bacharach has a busy schedule
leading up to the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be doing a lot of touring for the rest of this
year,'' he says. ``And the new `Austin Powers' movie comes out next
month, and Elvis and I are in that as well as on the soundtrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another upcoming project finds Bacharach reunited with
lyricist Hal David and vocalist Dionne Warwick _ the magic
triumvirate of talent that forged a long string of smash hits back
in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the score for the upcoming Bette Midler movie, `Isn't
She Great,' which is the life story of novelist Jacqueline Susann.
It comes out at the end of the year, I do believe. I wrote two
songs as well as the background score, and both songs were written
with Hal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach and David, a Midas-touched combination, haven't worked
together in more than 25 years. A rift in their long relationship
followed their collaboration on the disastrous '73 film ``Lost
Horizon,'' and bridges weren't mended until they teamed up again
for ``Isn't She Great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the filmmakers just liked the association,'' Bacharach
says matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Hal is a great lyric writer, but right now I'm
really happy just writing with a lot of different people. Of
course, there was the project with Elvis, and I've also just
written a new instrumental with Dave Koz, that he's about to
record. I like working this way. It's like dating, you know?''
Bacharach _ who was previously married to actress Angie Dickinson
and his former songwriting partner, Carole Bayer Sager _ currently
lives in Pacific Palasades, Calif., with his wife, Jane, and their
children, 6-year-old Oliver and 3-year-old Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   While Bacharach once ruled the pop charts, he realizes that
contemporary radio is a whole different ball game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees anymore. It's a very different
youth-driven market today, very singles-oriented. I think it's just
difficult today for Top 40 radio to accept not just me, but Elvis
as well, to a certain extent, so we didn't even try with `Painted
From Memory,''' he explains. ``We tried to market the album in a
different way, rather than promoting it through radio. It was very,
very hard.
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach _ who names Babyface as one of the contemporary
songwriters whose work he admires _ realizes that most of today's
hits are about lust, not love, although he insists that romance
hasn't completely gone out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there room for a romantic song to get on the radio today?
Yes, and I think there always will be,'' he declares. ``I just
think that the opportunities are narrower today. But I really can't
be bothered with that, because it's all out of my control. I just
try to write the best songs that I can write, and go from there.''

A ROYAL ROLE: ACTRESS HAD TO THINK TWICE BEFORE TAKING PART AS
QUEEN AMIDALA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She was offered a role in one of the biggest movies
ever _ and hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to play Queen Amidala, young ruler of the embattled
planet Naboo in ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,''
Natalie Portman wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment was huge,'' Portman, 17, said after a press
screening of the film last weekend. ``I'd be signing not only for
three films, but pretty much 10 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge deal at any age, and when you're that young, it's
really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was concerned about how much the prequel trilogy
``would put the cast in the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out there already, and when it comes out, it's gonna be
even crazier. It obviously takes away from your private life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to mention the Carrie Fisher syndrome. Fisher has
long felt that the first ``Star Wars'' trilogy stunted her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some concern about being identified with a role
forever,'' Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, creator George Lucas gave her time to think. Portman
was one of the first people cast in ``The Phantom Menace,'' and
filming was still a year away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't pressuring me at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After pondering for a few weeks, she finally gave Lucas a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided, `Let's have a fun summer and a great,
memorable experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now the confessed chocoholic is ``really proud of this film.''
</P>
<P>
   As for earlier concerns, she said, ``I think we (the actors) are
all different from the previous stars of ''Star Wars.``
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are known for other works, especially people like
Liam (Neeson), Ewan (McGregor) and Sam (Samuel L. Jackson). I don't
think the (film) industry will recognize us now only for this
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if it does, she said ``I wouldn't be upset to be
remembered most for this role.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's doubtful that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Portman made a big impact with ``The Professional,'' playing a
girl teaming with a hitman after her parents are murdered. She also
received raves for her work in the film ``Beautiful Girls'' and for
the title role of the Broadway play ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Her other film credits include ``Mars Attacks!,'' ``Heat'' and
Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Lucas cast her, Portman never had seen a ``Star Wars''
film. She was born and raised in Israel, ``and I just missed it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   After her family moved to Long Island, she got the acting bug.
But she's not sure she wants to act forever.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Portman is attending college this fall (``I'm not
saying where right now''), and she'll do film work _ including her
second ``Star Wars'' movie in 2000 _ only during summers.
</P>
<P>
   A boyfriend? She's mum on that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did (have a boyfriend), it'd be unfair to him to place
him in a limelight he didn't choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many male fans have written to Portman, whose beauty once
earned her modeling offers, which she declined to pursue acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's because I've been in some guy movies,'' she said
with an easy laugh, referring to ``The Professional'' and ``Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't think ``The Phantom Menace'' is one such film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lot more female-oriented. The costumes, scenery
and images are so beautiful, and there's a strong female character.
Plus, you have the heartthrob value of Ewan McGregor.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman's Amidala is a 14-year-old ruler who, in the later
films, will wed Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader. They'll
then have two kids: the original trilogy's Luke and Leia.
</P>
<P>
   Anakin was played by Jake Lloyd, then 8, in ``The Phantom
Menace.'' His part will be recast with an older actor for ``Episode
II,'' to be shot, like ``Phantom Menace,'' in Tunisia and England,
as well as Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My character will be in her early 20s then, and Anakin will be
about 16,'' Portman said. ``Then, in the third film, we'll be a
little older.''
</P>
<P>
   Amidala must act older to be taken seriously as a young ruler.
So the queen wears elaborate makeup, clothes and wigs and speaks in
a regal voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're some of the most beautiful costumes ever made for a
film,'' Portman said. ``They really helped me with the character,
because you carry yourself differently when you're wearing that
kind of gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair and makeup took 2 to 2 1/2 hours, but the costumes were a
snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were made for snap on, snap off, so if you had to go to
the bathroom you wouldn't ruin a day (of shooting),'' Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't think Amidala's white lipstick with a red stripe
down the middle will start a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks really cool, but it's so difficult to keep up,''
Portman said. ``The white and red soon turn pink. I had people
reapplying it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows some female fans will try it, anyway, but that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great how passionate these people are,'' she
said. ``I haven't met them, but they seem like fun.''

 &HT;    BILL WOULD CUT TAXES FOR SMALL INVESTORS
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of taxpayers who invest would receive tax
relief under a bill introduced Thursday in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Savers Act would raise the threshold on the 15 percent
personal income bracket by $10,000 and make tax-free the first $500
in interest and dividend income for families and $250 for single
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cut taxes by $135 billion over five years and
$345 billion over 10 years. It would provide tax relief to 110
million taxpayers over all. Of these, 30 million low- and
middle-income would be able to invest tax-free, and 10 million low-
and middle-income taxpayers would not have to pay capital gains
tax, Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comfortable with this tax cut because it doesn't touch
Social Security money and it reaches people who don't often get a
break from the federal government,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., who sponsored the bill along with Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.

INTOXICATED BY BUD LIGHT'S GAY-THEMED ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE FORD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gay media activists used to excoriate television
news shows for illustrating gay-themed stories with footage
showing, from behind, two anonymous men holding hands on a city
street.
</P>
<P>
   The activists believed such depersonalizing imagery reduced gay
men to negative component parts: held hands, rear ends,
facelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, similar imagery _ two muscled arms, one man's hand clasping
another's, all shown from behind _ is gracing print advertisements
intended to sell beer to gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The new Anheuser-Busch ad urges gay beer drinkers to ``Be
yourself and make it a Bud Light.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea sounds ground- breaking: Big corporation features
gay men in ads goes against prevailing wisdom that ``queer doesn't
sell.'' Indeed, the ads are controversial. Rev. Jerry Falwell has
called for an Anheuser-Busch boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In the gay community, a flurry of forwarded e-mails the past few
weeks has exhorted gay-friendly folks to phone Anheuser-Busch to
``support'' the ads.
</P>
<P>
   But gays risk looking like chumps. The e-mails hinted the ads
would appear on TV. Wrong. They said the ads would run in
mainstream magazines. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will appear only in the lesbian and gay print press, and
in specific gay pride parade programs (including San Francisco's).
</P>
<P>
   Armed with misinformation and clouded thinking, gays are
unthinkingly supporting a profit-motivated corporation as it seeks
an improved bottom line. These ads signal nothing more than
clear-eyed corporate calculation. Advertising imagery does not
change peoples' minds; it changes peoples' buying habits. That's
exactly what Anheuser-Busch intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net income of $319 million in the first
quarter of 1999, a 20.3 percent increase over the same period last
year. The company further reported that, as the nation's
top-selling light beer, Bud Light showed double-digit 1998 sales
growth for the seventh straight year. Anheuser-Busch long ago
determined that it is ``safe'' _ read: profitable _ to market Bud
Light to gays.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the evaporation of social and fiscal pressures
against including gays in ads, the company is stroking gay men by
portraying us _ or at least our hands. After all, we're a coveted
target demographic, one that repays gay-positive advertising
imagery with fierce fealty.
</P>
<P>
   That's no doubt why Anheuser-Busch is one of the principal
sponsors (more than $75,000 in donations) of this June's gay pride
parade in San Francisco. The company is building on previously
established brand loyalty and, in the process, enjoying community
support generated by ad ``controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   But gays pay a price for such loyalty. In the past decade,
several studies have shown that gay men have a disproportionately
higher rate of drug and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Studies also continue to show a strong correlation between
substance use and HIV infection rates among gay and bisexual men of
all ages and ethnicities. Adherence to HIV therapies can be
affected by substances used as well.
</P>
<P>
   Any company making a profit from alcohol sales in the gay
community _ ``responsible drinking'' exhortations notwithstanding _
is on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, gays are still so starved for positive
representation in the dominant culture that we run the risk of
mistaking consumerist assimilation for respect, advertising imagery
for rights.
</P>
<P>
   We fervently fire off e-mails in support of a consumerist
vehicle designed to vacuum dollars from our community, but where
are we when hot-button gay legislation is up for grabs?
</P>
<P>
   We are taxpaying citizens who can neither marry, serve openly in
the military nor, in some states, legally adopt children. We enjoy
few protections from job and housing discrimination. ``Faggot'' is
still an acceptable epithet on some school playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-themed beer ads running in the gay press are not going to
change that; nor are they going to convince non-gay people to join
us in achieving societal equality.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll save my flag-waving until Anheuser-Busch is willing to
do more than throw a few dollars at a few gay pride parades, and
when company ads show gay men as more than disembodied parts.
</P>
<P>
   When the company finances grassroots gay rights legislative
drives, corporate gays-in-the- workplace seminars and substance
abuse treatment for gay addicts, for example, I'll be impressed.
But as long as the company hijacks gay imagery in the rush to
increase beer sales, it is no more ``progressive'' than any other
multi-billion dollar multinational corporation seeking to enhance
its bottom line. And a gay community that blindly supports the
company implicitly signals that it is willing to settle for second
best.

 &HT;    For Perez, daily grind is a dream
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Braves catcher Eddie Perez has spent the last week
living out his dream of playing every day. Perez has started a
personal high of six consecutive games behind the plate while Javy
Lopez has been home in Puerto Rico because of the death of his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old dream for Perez, one that carried him through nine
years as a backup catcher in the Braves minor league system, when
people around him wondered why he continued to put himself through
the work, only to be disappointed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was never the hitter that Lopez is. He wasn't the
investment that first-round pick Tyler Houston was. But he found
his own reasons to keep going back to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `Why do you keep doing this if they don't give you
the chance?' '' said Perez, who will return to the bench when the
Braves open a three-game series with the Cubs today. ``But I always
had it in my mind I wanted to play every day. I never gave up. I
never thought, `I'm tired of this,' not even when I was having
those bad, bad days.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's first season in Class AA in 1992 he backed up Lopez for
the Greenville Braves team that made the Southern League playoffs.
The next year, Lopez was sent on to AAA Richmond and Perez was back
in AA Greenville. But he had the chance to play every day.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Greenville, however, Perez learned that
Houston was going to do that, and Perez was asked to play first
base. To make matters worse, Houston got hurt, and the Braves put
another catcher behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I was real down,'' Perez said. ``I said, `That's
it.' I talked to my wife, and she said, `Slow down. Think about
it.' I said OK. I took it easy and kept working out like always.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment passed. And Perez started hitting the ball like he
never had. But then more bad news. He broke his tailbone on a play
at the plate and was out for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He picked himself back up again by playing winter ball in his
native Venezuela and was assigned to AAA Richmond in 1994. He spent
two seasons as a backup there before getting his first call to
Atlanta in September 1995. He was put on the postseason roster for
the 1995 World Series team and has been playing for the Braves ever
since as Lopez's backup, primarily as the catcher for Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd make it,'' Perez said. ``I didn't know how. . . .
It was tough. We went through some bad times. But I like the way it
was. In this life, nothing is easy. I don't like to get chances
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is coming off a career-year when he hit .336 although he
started only 39 games. He's hitting .280 this year and continuing
to do the good defensive work he's known for behind the plate. In
the offseason, he signed a two-year $1.2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tell me I need to go somewhere else,'' Perez
said. ``I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking about here and
playing the best I can. I (still) want to play every day. I've got
to wait like I waited to get here. My chance is going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is more grounded in reality lately, given what two of his
closest friends on the team have been through _ Lopez losing his
mother and Andres Galarraga battling cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me realize how important people on this team are, my
life, their lives,'' Perez said. ``I never thought about that.
You'd worry that someone might get traded, but that's nothing like
what we've been through this year. Baseball is not the whole thing.
That's one of the things I really see this year.

 &HT;    Thompson attempts to take team from ARCA to Winston Cup
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only five NASCAR owners _ Bill Davis, Rick Hendrick,
Larry McClure, Butch Mock and Jack Roush _ have won races on both
the Busch Grand National and Winston Cup circuits.
</P>
<P>
   So making the jump to Winston Cup from ARCA racing, a notch
below Busch in NASCAR's pecking order, seems nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Mark Thompson of Cartersville, Ga., who hopes
to debut his Phoenix Air Racing team on June 27 in the Winston Cup
race at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who owns Phoenix Air, a Cartersville company that
specializes in aircraft services, has heard doubts before. In 1992,
the U.S. Navy decided to abandon its naval station on Midway
Islands, two tiny islands about 1,200 miles northwest of Honolulu
and the site of the historic World War II battle.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a test pilot who used the islands' airport to refuel
his planes during military-contract missions, persuaded the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to let his company manage the islands,
which were turned into a wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson spent millions of dollars updating the islands'
infrastructure, restoring the old naval barracks and installing
plumbing and a cellular communications systems. Now, Thompson has
140 full-time employees on the islands, which host no more than 100
tourists at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could run quite a few Winston Cup races with what it costs
to run that island,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   Air Phoenix will run only five Cup races this year. After Sears
Point, the team will attempt to qualify at Pocono in July,
Indianapolis and Watkins Glen in August and Homestead in November.
Thompson hopes to run a full schedule next year.
</P>
<P>
   David Murry, 42, a road-course specialist from Lilburn, was
hired as Air Phoenix's driver. Thompson met Murry in 1988 at the
Skip Barber Racing School at Road Atlanta. Murry was one of the
school's instructors; Thompson was a student.
</P>
<P>
   Murry, who earned his reputation driving Porsches, narrowly
missed the field for the Winston Cup race at Watkins Glen in 1995.
He finished two-thousandths of a second behind Rusty Wallace, who
used a provisional to make the race.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson recently purchased three Ford stock cars driven by
Winston Cup veteran Geoffrey Bodine last year, and two ARCA cars
are being converted. They'll shake down the cars at Road Atlanta on
Tuesday, and then test at Watkins Glen June 15-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be just a road-race driver,'' Murry said. ``I
want to be a full-time Cup driver. Obviously, that also entails
driving on ovals. I've done road-racing for so long, it's going to
be a fresh start and a challenge. I want to be in Winston Cup,
because that's where the competition is and that's the show.''

   Thompson was one of ARCA's top superspeedway drivers before a
crash involving a slower car at Atlanta Motor Speedway in March
1998. He broke an ankle and missed six months of work because of a
head injury. Thompson says owning a team allows him to stay
involved in racing but doesn't put his companies at risk.

 &HT;    Sarazen remembered as 'an icon' for golf
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the golf world mourns Gene Sarazen today after
his death Thursday at age 97 in Naples, Fla., it also celebrates
his life, his accomplishments and the people he touched.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen, who died from complications with pneumonia, was the
first to win golf's professional Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   He hit ``the shot heard 'round the world'' with the double eagle
at the Masters in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   As the host of ``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf'' in the 1960s,
he took golf all over the globe and into living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   He invented the sand wedge in 1932, allowing people an escape
from golf's deepest bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in golf presume he also invented class.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``The Squire'' and always neatly attired in his
traditional cap and knickers, Sarazen had an impact on golf from
age 20, when he became the youngest player to win the U.S. Open in
1922, to last month, when he made his traditional appearance at the
Masters, hitting a ceremonial first shot with Sam Snead and Byron
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   After helping put Augusta, Ga. and the Masters on the map in the
1930s, he brought his stylish personality and historical presence
from his Marco Island, Fla., home to Chateau Elan, north of
Atlanta, as the namesake of the Sarazen World Open, from 1994
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss him,'' said Don Panoz, who founded the
tournament to honor Sarazen. ``The world will miss him. The golf
world will miss him. He was an icon for this game. He was the
transition from the old game, which was reserved for a few, to the
new game. . . . I think anybody whose path has been fortunate to
cross his is always better for the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harrison, N.Y., in 1902, Sarazen won seven major
championships and was the first to win all four Grand Slam
tournaments _ the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open and the
PGA Championship. He was the oldest living Ryder Cup player. When
the PGA Tour inaugurated its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996,
Sarazen was the first recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures. In addition to
being a Hall of Fame player, he was a wonderful ambassador to the
game throughout his life.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sarazen's passing Thursday, his close friend Ken Venturi
called it ``the end of the hickory-shaft era.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most charming Gene Sarazen stories was first heard a
few years ago from Jim Riddle, an Atlanta golf-course developer
whose father met ``The Squire'' in the 1960s during a corporate
outing at Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks after returning home from the trip, Riddle's
father received a postcard from Japan, where Sarazen was playing in
a tournament. Jim remembered the glow on his father's face when
reading the words from the legendary Sarazen, who expressed his
enjoyment of their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sarazen World Open came to Chateau Elan in Braselton in
1994, Jim introduced himself to Sarazen and related his father's
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell your father I said hello,'' Sarazen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Jim told Sarazen that his father had died several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that warm grin and those kind, twinkling eyes, Sarazen,
then 93, said to the son, ``Well, then I'll tell him hello for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen outlived all of his contemporaries and even outlived his
own tournament, which was played for the last time in November.
Despite an attempt by Panoz to continue the event on the European
Tour, the tournament officially completed its run.
</P>
<P>
   At his final Masters appearance on April 8, the crowd around the
first tee at the Augusta National Golf Club was abnormally large,
pushing toward the large oak tree in front of the clubhouse.
Sarazen struck the ball solidly, hitting a drive slightly off to
the right. While hitting the ball often entailed a cortisone shot
to his shoulder two weeks before the Masters, Sarazen never
disappointed the crowd. But, then again, great shots from Sarazen
became expected after the 4-wood that sailed 220 yards into the
hole at Augusta's 15th in 1935 for a double-eagle 2. At age 72,
Sarazen made a hole in one at the 1973 British Open at Royal Troon.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Fellenz, the Sarazen World Open's tournament director,
remembered ``The Squire'' at his happiest in 1994, when he was
riding around in a cart before the first day's play of the
inaugural event. Sarazen had helped design the course with Sam
Snead and Kathy Whitworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a little kid when he saw it the first day, when it
was all set up for the tournament,'' Fellenz said. ``He said,
``Don, you've done all this for me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sarazen World Open brought ``The Squire'' huge
satisfaction in his later years. And the tournament in turn brought
a new generation of golfers a knowledge of Sarazen _ the player and
the man _ that otherwise might have been hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Fellenz recalled introducing the late Jeff ``Squeeky'' Medlen,
Nick Price's caddie who would die of leukemia the next year, to
Sarazen in 1996. It was Medlen's last event. Fellenz also
remembered once sitting upstairs on the porch of the Augusta
National clubhouse with Sarazen and Herbert Warren Wind, the famous
golf author, and hanging on each word of their many stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I contributed nothing to the conversation,''
Fellenz said, ``but I damn sure listened. I had breakfast with him
before he hit the first ball, and then I flew back with him on
Don's plane. I guarantee you, if they put that (experience) in an
auction, it would get a pretty big ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Panoz spoke Wednesday with Sarazen in the hospital, describing
him as ``lucid'' and in ``good color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene knows where he is all the time,'' Panoz said, ``but we
kind of knew the antibiotics weren't working. He told everybody
they were talking too much and that he needed some rest. I figured
it wasn't going to be very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Panoz was returning to Naples on Thursday with Sarazen's
grandson, Geoff, the head professional at Chateau Elan, but they
arrived too late to speak with him again. He died at 9 a.m. at
Naples Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived a full life,'' Panoz said. ``I think in a way we
helped make the last years of his life a lot richer.

 &HT;    Cox Communications inching up cable ladder
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications is signing up 6,000 new customers a
month to one of its three digital services, the company reported at
its annual meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has 67,000 high-speed Internet access
customers, 75,000 for digital TV and 28,000 telephone customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only company doing it all,'' said Cox Communications
President and Chief Executive Jim Robbins. ``Our core business
strategy is to execute this and executive it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications provides these services through its new
digital networks. The company is trying to persuade many of its
current 3.8 million customers to sign on to one or more of its new
digital services.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Atlanta-based cable TV operator reported a banner
year at its annual meeting, held at the company's headquarters in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Cox Communications has added two big new
systems in Las Vegas, Nev. and Tuscon, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   It has announced two other major purchases in the past several
weeks. These purchases will add systems in Northern Virginia and in
Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   When these purchases are concluded, expected some time at the
end of the year, Cox Communications will have 5 million
subscribers. That would make it, at least for the moment, the
fourth largest cable TV operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we felt the need to continue to grow or be left at
the side of the road,'' said Robbins, who has said the company
continues to look for other acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions have helped push up the company's stock, which has
grown in value more than 72 percent in the past fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has a market capitalization of about $24
billion. ``That's a lot bigger than Southern Co. and about three
times that of Delta Air Lines,'' said Cox Communications Chairman
Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has also done well in some of its other
investments in the past several years. For example, the company's
stake in At home, its provider of Internet access, has grown from
an initial value of $365 million in 1997 to $2.3 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Cox Communications directors approved Thursday a
2-for-1 stock split, effective today. Directors also approved an
increase in the number of all its different classes of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Class A common, for example, will grow by 334 million shares. At
present there are 316 million shares of Class A stock.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AFTER LIFE,'' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika
Oda. Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated,
118 minutes). Much of this transcendently compassionate, gently
humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where
courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients.
</P>
<P>
   The place turns out not to be a social service agency but a
metaphysical way station where the newcomers are people of all ages
and types who have just died and have three days to select one
memory to take with them into eternity. Before they depart, those
memories will be filmed. As they tell their stories and make their
choices (those who can't choose remain at the processing center as
caseworkers), the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's
meaning and value and the relationship of movies, memories and
dreams (Stephen Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal,
Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110
minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all
funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an
offer you can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in
Crystal as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal, ``When I got
into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.''
There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comedy
(Janet Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``COOKIE'S FORTUNE,'' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn
Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by
Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet
assurance and guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make
a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the
machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages
her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide.
As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting
nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works
on a single wavelength as Altman makes the most of a well-woven
screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,'' starring Elodie Bouchez and
Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French
with English subtitles).
</P>
<P>
   In this very special French film about two freewheeling young
women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and
economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women
(Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner,
while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms.
Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how
the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A
rare and wrenching drama (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ELECTION,'' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese
Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the
acerbically funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic
satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting.
</P>
<P>
   Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms.
Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from
Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless
good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs
to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's
reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu.
</P>
<P>
   With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay
specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off of what
they actually mean (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ENTRAPMENT,'' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This glossy caper film summons the days when being a thief was
the profession of choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines:
as the great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly
investigating Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones
makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's
enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on
the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side
of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper.
And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``EXISTENZ,'' starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law.
Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). Not for Cronenberg
the sleek futuristic look of other films that play virtual reality
games.
</P>
<P>
   This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other
Cronenberg fever dreams (like ``The Fly,'' ``Crash'' and ``Naked
Lunch''). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a
renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion ( Law)
try to play the most dangerous game she has yet created.
</P>
<P>
   This sci-fi scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own
mind games with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The
title is pronounced ``eggs-is-tense'' (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``GO,'' starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant,
Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by
Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads of
inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction'' but still has some flash and
personality of its own. Liman, who shot the film as well as
directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen
cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   He embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down
the rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys
go to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car
theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than
others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``HIDEOUS KINKY,'' starring Kate Winslet. Directed by
Gillies MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on this offbeat, richly
atmospheric adventure in the wake of ``Titanic.'' The leading role
in MacKinnon's vividly colorful film offers her a field day. She
plays a young hippie mother who brings her reluctant British
daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The film, about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction
and the sheer headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the
striking subgenre in which it is baby-boom adults, not their
children, who most need to come of age (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MATRIX,'' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film
borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a
big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department.
</P>
<P>
   But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special
effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial
arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can
look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive
cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato
epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous
feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual
reality (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MUMMY,'' starring Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent spoof (very
loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror classic), overloaded
with cheesy special effects, suggests an unwieldy hybrid of
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and Costello Meet the
Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt
that carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky wide-eyed
English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother).
</P>
<P>
   It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve
swarming scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful
``Alien''-like things (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (the Oscar winner for best film,
best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and
best comedy score).
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress
winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting
actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THIS IS MY FATHER,'' starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and
James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Made with obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago
schoolteacher ( Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish
forebears (Quinn) involves a third Quinn brother as well. And
Declan Quinn's cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric,
sentimental tale featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea,
Brendan Gleeson, Colm Meaney) in cameo roles.
</P>
<P>
   Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a lonely farmer in love
with a fiery young lass from a prosperous family, does a lot to
help the film override its hackneyed elements and keep it moving
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A WALK ON THE MOON,'' starring Diane Lane, Viggo
Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock
in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome,
itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down.
Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife
and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a torrid
extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With a tenderness that is unusual for a contemporary American
film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE WINSLOW BOY,'' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca
Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G,
110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Terence Rattigan's play, about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that
created a furor in England, has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully lucid and
painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets the
film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SHARPEST GIRL IN TOWN: ANN SOTHERN.'' Long before
``Working Girl,'' Ann Sothern was a feminist icon in the 10 MGM
Maisie films in which she portrayed a working woman getting ahead
in the years of the Depression and World War II. The versatile
actress won wide popularity playing street-smart, wisecracking
characters in musicals, comedies and melodramas.
</P>
<P>
   And now she is being celebrated in a retrospective at the Museum
of Modern Art. At 6 p.m. Friday, she will be seen in one of her
most brilliant dramatic roles, as a career woman, wife and wise
friend in ``A Letter to Three Wives,'' directed by Joseph L.
Mankiewicz, who won an Oscar for his screenplay about three women
who receive a letter from a friend saying she has run off with one
of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell, Kirk Douglas and Thelma Ritter play
leading roles. Continuing through Sunday at the Museum of Modern
Art, in Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $9.50
for adults; $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for
visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on
Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Information and screening times:
(212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

WHY I HATE `SUNSHINE STATE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the final graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of people criticized the Florida Legislature for wasting
taxpayers' money debating whether the mockingbird or the scrub jay
should be the official state bird.
</P>
<P>
   I agree. It would have been much better if the Legislature had
wasted taxpayers' money debating whether ``Sunshine State'' should
continue to be Florida's official nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Sunshine State is not the stupidest nickname
among the 50 states. That distinction would have to go to Rhode
Island, the nickname for which is ``Little Rhody.'' I don't know
who came up with this gem but he or she must have given it all of
three seconds of thought. Presumably, whoever came up with ``Little
Rhody'' found it preferable to ``Insignificant Pip-squeak State
That No One Can Remember'' or ``Lots of Crime for Its Size.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Florida should not be called the
Sunshine State. For one thing, it could be construed as false
advertising. There are lots of times when the sun does not shine in
Florida. Nighttime, for example, and during hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a little bit of sunshine can go a long way, as anyone who
has lived through a Florida summer can testify. Come August, many
Floridians would favor renaming their state the ``Please, God, No
More Sunshine State (And While You're at It, See If You Can Do
Something About the Humidity, Too).''
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine causes sunburn and skin cancer, so if we want to be
truthful, we should probably rename Florida the ``Melanoma State,''
though the Chamber of Commerce would probably argue against it on
the grounds that it is not a positive enough image.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine can also lead to cataracts, so we might consider
renaming Florida the ``Eyeball Disease State,'' though the Chamber
of Commerce probably wouldn't go for this one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine is linked to thunderstorms, hurricanes and tornadoes.
It also promotes the growth of plants like ragweed and crabgrass,
not to mention poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive sunshine forces us inside to air-conditioned rooms,
requiring us to burn precious fossil fuels that contribute to air
pollution and global warming. (As if it weren't hot enough
already.)
</P>
<P>
   I could go on, but I think we've established that sunshine is
evil and not something we should be crowing about on our license
plates.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is selecting an alternative nickname because there
are so many good ones to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   We can rule out the ``Show-Me State'' as Missouri has already
claimed that one. (It has never been made clear to me what it is,
exactly, that people from Missouri want us to show them. The money,
perhaps, or maybe something they can't see from there, like the
ocean.)
</P>
<P>
   Also spoken for is the ``Tarheel State,'' the ``Sooner State''
and the ``Hoosier State,'' which is fine with me. (I'll leave it to
columnists in North Carolina, Oklahoma and Indiana to deal with
these ridiculous nicknames; I've got problems of my own.)
</P>
<P>
   Some states use animals in their nicknames (Oregon is the
``Beaver State,'' Wisconsin is the ``Badger State'' and Utah is the
``Beehive State'') and that is a possibility for Florida, too. We
could be the ``Fire Ant State,'' the ``Cockroach State'' or, my
personal favorite, the ``Lovebug State.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas calls itself the ``Natural State,'' though judging by
Bill Clinton's antics it might want to rename itself the ``Au
Natural State.'' Florida might want to start calling itself the
``Naturally Hot and Humid State,'' then again it might not.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois calls itself the ``Prairie State'' for some reason. We
could be the ``Swampy State'' except during times of drought when
we could rename ourselves the ``Up in Smoke State'' or the ``Do You
Smell Something Burning?'' state.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have the space here to examine all the ways that we can
improve on ``Sunshine State'' as Florida's official nickname.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have any suggestions of your own, feel free to send
them to me by one of the means suggested below and I'll use them in
a future column.

FATE AND CHEMISTRY BRINGS BAD COMPANY TOGETHER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL DEAN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first performance by the original Bad Company in 18 years
came from a sad note but begins on a high one.
</P>
<P>
   A full-blown reunion tour _ which starts Saturday with a
sold-out concert in Clearwater, Fla. _ was the last thing on
members' minds when they assembled two years ago for the funeral of
their old manager, Peter Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange twist of fate, really,'' said guitarist Mick
Ralphs, who formed Bad Company in 1973 with singer Paul Rodgers,
drummer Simon Kirke and bassist Boz Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Peter, who used to manage Led Zeppelin, passed away, we
all went to pay our respects, and then we met up again,'' Ralphs
said in a telephone interview from his home in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we all got back together, I could feel the chemistry
was still there between the four of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That same chemistry was evident from the start in the group's
self-titled, 1974 debut album. ``Bad Company'' sold more than 5
million copies and introduced American audiences to the group's
no-frills hard-rock sound.
</P>
<P>
   Revved by Rodgers' gritty vocals and fueled by Ralph's power
chords, the band scored with singles ``Can't Get Enough'' and
``Movin' On.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's 1975 follow-up, ``Straight Shooter'' also hit big in
the United States, unleashing radio staples ``Feel Like Makin'
Love,'' ``Shooting Star'' and ``Good Lovin' Gone Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Company's straight-ahead rock approach was the group's
answer to the glitter, glam-rock music by such bands as Mott the
Hoople _ the English group Ralphs left to start Bad Company.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a British ``supergroup'' from the start, since Rodgers
and Kirke had been in the popular group Free (``All Right Now''),
and Burrell had played with King Crimson, the original Bad Company
recorded four more albums before breaking up in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodgers formed The Firm with Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy
Page, Ralphs and Kirke joined American vocalist Brian Howe and
others to continue on as revamped ``Bad Company'' through the 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ralphs said the later configurations never captured the magic
like the original. ``It's a strange thing, because I can work with
Simon, I've worked with Boz, like two or three of us at a time, but
when you get all of us together, something just happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even have to be playing. If we're just all in the
same room, I can feel the energy. After all this time, it was still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Grant's funeral, the four continued to meet to discuss
what tracks would be included in an anthology of the original group
that Elektra Records wanted to release.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, there were still no plans to reunite, Ralphs
said. Then Elektra asked if they could find unreleased songs to
include in the two-disc set.
</P>
<P>
   But with members spread across two continents _ Ralphs in
England, Burrell in Scotland, Rodgers in Canada and Kirke in New
York City _ communication would have taken forever, Ralphs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Paul said, `Well, why don't we just record some new
songs? It would be simpler and quicker,' '' Ralphs said.
</P>
<P>
   The four holed up late last year in a small studio in the
village of Ripley, England (Eric Clapton's hometown) to record four
new songs.
</P>
<P>
   Those songs, including the first single ``Hey, Hey,'' and two
previously unreleased songs from the 1970s, have been packaged with
the group's best-known material in ``The Original Bad Company
Anthology,'' released in March.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ralphs said, the record company wanted the
original members to tour to support the album. And that's exactly
what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Paul was initially not sure,'' Ralphs said. ``Then he
agreed to do some dates. And then, it blossomed into what is now a
30-date national tour, all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, I don't know. The whole thing with this group is
that nothing is planned,'' Ralphs said. ``In a way, it's
dangerously exciting, because we never planned to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in a way, it's only fair that we do this, because the
people in America have been so loyal,'' he said. ``It's been
heartwarming.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Very pleasant weather is expected from the Northeast to the
upper Great Lakes. High pressure crested over eastern Ontario will
circulate very dry air into New England on brisk breezes from the
north. A few clouds will linger over northern Maine; otherwise,
abundant sunshine is likely. The leading edge of drier air should
stretch from Delaware to Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will make it a dull day from
Virginia to South Carolina. Low pressure near Myrtle Beach will
direct much cooler air from the Atlantic into the Southeast. An
active sea breeze in coastal Georgia and western Florida will
promote afternoon thunderstorms inland.
</P>
<P>
   A ribbon of moisture will link the East Coast disturbance with a
developing storm over the northwest Plains. Skies will stay mostly
cloudy from West Virginia across the Ohio Valley and into the upper
Mississippi Valley. Sunshine and seasonably warm conditions will
dominate the central Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air streaming northward across Texas will be lifted by a
jet stream disturbance over the Red River Valley. This will trigger
a few strong thunderstorms later in the day. Showers and a few
storms will moisten the Dakotas ahead of a complex cold front. It
will become windy and rather cool in the northern Rockies with some
snow showers.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk onshore winds will direct very cool, moist air into the
Pacific Northwest. Coastal showers are expected with lowering snow
levels in the Cascades. The Southwest will stay sunny and warm, but
some fog will linger at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Status of Stratus
</P>
<P>
   Low stratus clouds dulled the southern California coast Thursday
as Pacific moisture condensed over chilly coastal waters. Water
temperatures average in the 50s and 60s along the California Coast,
even in summer. Coastal waters owe their chill to prevailing winds
from the northwest, which blow around high pressure over the
Pacific. In turn, winds cause coastal waters to initially move
south. Water then gradually turns west out to sea, deflected by the
effects of the rotating earth. To compensate for water flowing
seaward, chilly water from below ``upwells'' to take its place.

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attention must be paid this season to the male
dancers at American Ballet Theater. Rarely has so much talent at
the top come together at one time: like planets converging in the
night sky to symbolize an auspicious future, this cluster of men,
with their virtuosity and diversity of style, has changed the look
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   From Angel Corella, 23, to Julio Bocca, 32, these performers
have given classical dancing, especially in the 19th-century
repertory, a new image. Powerhouse technique has come to the fore
with Bocca, Corella, Ethan Stiefel, 26, Jose Manuel Carreno, 30,
and Joaquin De Luz, 23.
</P>
<P>
   But so has purity of classical style, which receives an extra
dimension from Vladimir Malakhov, 31, whose elegance is echoed by
Maxim Belotserkovsky, 27, and more flamboyantly by Giuseppe Picone,
23. Add the versatility of Keith Roberts, 29, and it all comes down
to sheer dance power.
</P>
<P>
   The effect these days at the Metropolitan Opera House is not
subtle. Multiple pirouettes beyond expectation have become the
norm, frequently topped by the gasp-producing bravura step spliced
suddenly into the air. Academic niceties are nonetheless not
forgotten. The polish and precision that Ballet Theater made its
trademark in the past have been enhanced by this virtuosity. The
new emphasis is on projection, not only in dramatic
characterization but also in movement. Classical technique is
extended, expanded and given its full value.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in progress will find this development as
natural as achieving the once-daunting four-minute mile. But the
course of male dancing in ballet has hardly followed a straight
line. The Paris Opera Ballet, cradle of professional ballet, had so
little use for its men by 1891 that a member of the National
Assembly, in a budget debate, proposed eliminating the entire male
corps. Bus drivers could do the job when needed, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   What a far cry from the beginning of professional dancing at the
same Paris Opera. During its first decade as a ballet company
(1671-1681), men were the only dancers onstage. Women had taken
part in the court ballets favored by Louis XIV. But when ballet was
transferred to the stage and theatricalized with professionals,
women had to bide their time. In the 19th century, the Age of the
Ballerina, they took their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ballet Theater, which made its debut in 1940, was for many
years identified with its ballerinas. For many, Ballet Theater will
always be the company that produced Nora Kaye and Alicia Alonso in
the 1940's when it also presented international stars like Alicia
Markova and assorted guest ballerinas. Diana Adams, Melissa Hayden,
Violette Verdy and Janet Reed were at Ballet Theater before they
became principals at the New York City Ballet and in reverse, a
leading Balanchine dancer like Mary Ellen Moylan joined Ballet
Theater in 1950. Major names like Rosella Hightower and Sono Osato
also found a home there.
</P>
<P>
   To think of Ballet Theater in later years is to think of Carla
Fracci, Natalia Makarova, Toni Lander, Cynthia Gregory, Gelsey
Kirkland and Martine van Hamel, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The company's male classical tradition could look back to Anton
Dolin, Igor Youskevitch, Erik Bruhn, Royes Fernandez and later
Fernando Bujones, Kevin McKenzie and, of course, Mikhail
Baryshnikov. Anthony Dowell danced a few seasons, and Bruce Marks
moved easily between classical and contemporary works in which John
Kriza and Hugh Laing, not strictly classical dancers, had fierce
impact.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Baryshnikov in the current top ranks. A dancer of
his caliber and, especially, consistency is hors concours, and the
20th century has seen very few like him. But when Ballet Theater's
dancers perform the leading male role of ``La Bayadere'' this
weekend through May 20, or in a group in ``Le Corsaire'' (May
24-27), their cumulative artistry and technique are felt to
breathtaking effect.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, the company's artistic director and himself a model of
the noble classical style, has accomplished something unusual. No
other company has as many first-rank male dancers in leading roles
at the same time. ``There are more better men; that has to do with
volume,'' McKenzie has said in the past, explaining that he does
not feel women dance less well than men or that great male dancers
have not existed previously. In 1973, for instance, the paragons of
male classical style in the west were certainly Peter Martins and
Helgi Tomasson of City Ballet as well as Rudolf Nureyev and Dowell
at the Royal Ballet. Baryshnikov, who had appeared in London in
1970, was still with the Kirov Ballet in the Soviet Union; he
defected in 1974 and joined Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, City Ballet has outstanding dancers, and their training
enables them to dance a Balanchine repertory that Ballet Theater
cannot always master stylistically. Nor are the women at Ballet
Theater to be considered slouches. Too many of the works depend
upon a ballerina. Yet even so, much of the company's repertory
today gives equal time, if not more, to the male dancer.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, he can be a seasoned principal like Gil Boggs
(now in his final season), Guillaume Graffin and Robert Hill; at
this stage, their artistry prevails over pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Angel Corella
</P>
<P>
   But the excitement at Ballet Theater is over young dancers like
Corella, the embodiment of bravura used to artistic purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange,'' Corella said, recalling how he began
ballet lessons at 8 in Spain with his older sisters in Colmenar
Viejo, an hour's drive from his native Madrid. ``I had never seen
any kind of dancing, but I knew I wanted to be a dancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw Corella in his first Ballet Theater season in
1995 could see his sensational potential and talent. The technique
was there but raw. Nonetheless, he could already channel his
exuberance into the precision of Balanchine's ``Theme and
Variations.'' More than anyone, he personifies the joy of dance.
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually all the younger stars, he has worked to refine
and polish his style. He and Stiefel, who made a visible and
overwhelming breakthrough in technique shortly after joining Ballet
Theater in 1997, both rein in their explosiveness to offer deeply
Romantic portrayals as Albrecht in ``Giselle'' (May 28-June 2).
This is normal for Corella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think dance is in your head,'' he said. ``You have to
visualize what you will go for and then do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying in Madrid from age 11 to 15 with Victor Ullate, a
former star of Maurice Bejart's company, and joining Ullate's
company, he acquired an understanding of technique. His trademark
multiple turns come from a straight back and strong stomach
muscles. Yet if Ullate ``told me what dancing was like, he did not
let me use it,'' Corella said. The major influence on him at the
Ullate school was Karemia Moreno, a Cuban teacher who had taught
Carreno. ``She gave me freedom,'' Corella said. ``She pushed me and
believed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makarova was on the jury that awarded him the grand prize
and gold medal of the 1994 Paris International Dance Competition.
Corella said she suggested he join Ballet Theater, where he has
since defied conventional thinking about typecasting. Contemporary
choreographers, beginning with Twyla Tharp, have used his dazzling
energy for seemingly superhuman feats, and he has also appeared in
roles that range from the comic to the heroic.
</P>
<P>
   The extra virtuosic dimension comes to him on the moment: ``The
music pushes you up, and when I get that excited I go for it. It's
nice to surprise the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Before performing the very difficult butterfly jumps as a skater
in Frederick Ashton's ``Patineurs,'' he watched skaters on
television. ``I saw that I had to throw the body forward and kick
the legs back afterward. It's a little bit scary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Corella's line is more elegant than when he first arrived,
the credit goes in part to the classes he took for two years with
Stanley Williams and Andrei Kramarevsky at the School of American
Ballet. ``Their classes made me work my legs so that they are more
straight,'' he said. ``I think a lot of it also comes from being at
Ballet Theater. It takes a lot of dancing to become comfortable
onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Corella did a tango with the letter R from a
computer-generated alphabet on ``Sesame Street.'' But at Ballet
Theater he does not feel restricted to one partner or one kind of
role. ``I'm only 23 years old,'' he said. ``If I start seeing
myself in only one way, it's very limiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Stiefel
</P>
<P>
   If most of Ballet Theater's male stars come from abroad (Spain,
Latin America and the former Soviet Union), Stiefel is virtually
the hometown boy who was already too good to make good. He has
become better.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he joined City Ballet, where he became the all-American
prince. He flashed through the air with rocketlike sleekness, his
perfectly pointed feet elongating a taut line. Cool and
steely-eyed, he could also show the winning boyishness that
emanates now with such grace in his own virtuoso display in ``Les
Patineurs'' and the Romeo he showed off last week. Soviet-style
bravura seemed beyond him: that is, until he molded and willed
himself into the extraordinary dancer he is today.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Bocca
</P>
<P>
   Cult worship in dance is not new. Bocca was its natural target
when he stepped into princely roles as a teen-ager upon joining
Ballet Theater as a principal in 1986. That so young a dancer could
understand ``The Sleeping Beauty'' so well was exceptional. But
then this young Argentine had already won the gold medal at the
1985 International Ballet Competition in Moscow and knew how to use
technique not for its own sake but to define every role.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, he has shown this dancing with a difference. In
``The Merry Widow'' two years ago, the sheer force of his first
eruption onstage brought the ballet up to a higher level of comic
artistry. He knows how to suffer with Alessandra Ferri in
``Giselle,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Manuel Carreno
</P>
<P>
   Carreno is, like Stiefel and Corella, a dancer who has
transformed himself. When seen previously with the Royal Ballet, he
seemed more a demicaractere dancer than a danseur noble. Yet noble
is what he has become, especially as the prince to Susan Jaffe's
princess in a variety of 19th-century works. He does not need to
act to convey his sensuality; it comes through his pantherine
quality in ``Le Corsaire'' and the soft landings and fluency of his
muscular and classical style.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov is in a class by himself. No category defines him. What
some might see as eccentricity is a superindividuality.
Shakespeare's Ariel would find him a soul mate, not only because he
has a remarkable gift for staying suspended in space but also
because his mix of purity and mischief leads to surprises. His
amazing classical line and body placement come from the Bolshoi
School in Moscow. He parachuted into Ballet Theater in 1995 and
showed how ``Bayadere'' should be danced. You can see him in it
Saturday afternoon and Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Belotserkovsky
</P>
<P>
   Belotserkovsky, Malakhov's fellow Ukrainian, was trained at the
Kiev Ballet School, a close runner-up to the Bolshoi School.
McKenzie spotted his potential as a first-class classical dancer in
1994. Along the way, Belotserkovsky has surprised us, notably as a
muscular bare-legged dancer in Nacho Duato's contemporary
``Remanso.'' Tall and Byronic, he radiates good breeding and has
recently improved in his virtuosity, as his wonderful ``Don
Quixote'' shows this season.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Picone
</P>
<P>
   Picone needed only to step onstage as the prince in
``Cinderella'' in 1997 to give Ballet Theater its first genuine
heartthrob in years. Trained initially in his native Naples, he
left Italy to dance in France and with the English National Ballet.
Picone knows that a handsome face is not enough. The matinee idol
appeal works best when his classical technique is in top form,
bursting with flair and flourish in ``Le Corsaire.'' He is sexy and
has a sense of humor onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Roberts
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, with Ballet Theater since 1987, is classed as a
contemporary dancer, but like many graduates of the North Carolina
School of the Arts, he excels in a variety of styles. Lar Lubovitch
and Ms. Tharp have used his outstanding fluency, and he moonlighted
as the main swan in Matthew Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' on Broadway. The
angelic looks help the purity and innocence that Roberts brings to
his questing heroes in ballets like ``The Sleeping Beauty'' and
this season's ``Snow Maiden.''
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin De Luz
</P>
<P>
   De Luz is Spanish, short and a dynamo. Since joining the company
in 1997, he has been concentrating on the precise finishes that
will make his powerful solos even more impressive. Technique
reaches new heights in his dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And as none other than Balanchine once said, ``Technique is
art.''

   REFUGEES-RELOCATE _ ATLANTA _ Iranians, Bosnians and now
Kosovars _ refugees from various conflics keep coming to Atlanta in

has a lot of jobs available, moderate living expenses, and offers

that included public officials. About halfway through a 10-minute
stand-up briefing to Longview Partnership representatives in Austin
for a two-day visit, Bush abruptly stopped talking when he saw a
reporter from the Longview News-Journal taking notes. Bush, the
state's top elected public official standing in a public office in
the Texas State Capital on the taxpayer's payroll, said all of his

Personal details such as marital problems, perceived honesty, even

 &HT;      WEXLER WORKS WITH IMPEACHMENT FOE ON TAX CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 13 -- Eager to move beyond the partisan rancor
which defined the impeachment saga, U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., has joined a former foe to sponsor a bipartisan tax-cut
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Graham
was one of the 13 trial managers who prosecuted President Clinton
in his trial before the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., also a member of the House
Judiciary Committee but perhaps the most outspoken critic of the
impeachment process, is Mr. Graham's unlikely partner as lead
advocates for the Small Savers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good signal that we are working together for the
good of the country,'' Mr. Graham said. ``That other stuff is
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Small Savings Act was originally written by U.S. Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., and U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
introduced the bill in the Senate. The bill's goal is to make it
easier for Americans to save money by reducing taxes on savings.
Specifically, it would:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Expand the 15-percent tax bracket to include some people
</P>
<P>
   &UR; currently in the 28- and 31-percent tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exclude up to $500 in dividend and interest income from taxes,
</P>
<P>
   &UR; which would, in effect, make the first $10,000 in a savings
</P>
<P>
   &UR; account tax free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exempt the first $5,000 in long-term capital gains from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Increase the contribution limits on deductible IRA's from
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Simplify the tax-paying process by allowing more taxpayers to
</P>
<P>
   &UR; file using Form 1040EZ.
</P>
<P>
   ``One third of Americans have no savings and another one third
have less than $3,000. With such a low rate of savings, many people
are not equipped to deal with financial trouble or plan for
retirement,'' Mr. Graham said. ``We're cutting taxes to increase
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue the Small Savings Act would do nothing to help
those in the working class, or even the lower-middle class. Only
those who had been in a higher tax bracket and those already with
substantial savings accounts would benefit, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wexler disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Small Savers Act will ensure that 10 million low and
middle class Americans will no longer have to pay capital gains
taxes,'' he said. ``A substantial number of those who will benefit
from this provision are senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a common story from my district: a couple in their
seventies work their whole lives, educate their children, make some
modest investments and then they retire to sunny Florida. After a
few laps in the pool and a couple of games of mahjong, the reality
of life sets in. Now they need the money from their investments for
doctors, prescription drugs and long-term healthcare. Uncle Sam
shouldn't consume the benefit of their modest savings. We're not
talking about millionaires here. We're talking about people to whom
$5,000 means a great deal,'' Mr. Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Coverdell and Mr. Torricelli have gotten support for their
bill from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., making it
likely to pass the Senate this year. Mr. Graham and Mr. Wexler have
not yet lobbied leaders in the House, but they plan to use support
in the Senate for leverage. The White House has not yet been
approached.

STUDY RECOMMENDS NEW BREAST CANCER PROCEDURE

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Women with a localized breast tumor may need
only to have it cut out _ and not also undergo expensive and
potentially harmful radiation treatments _ to keep the cancer from
recurring, according to a study by National Surgical Adjubant
Breast Project.
</P>
<P>
   The results could prompt doctors to rethink the way they treat
so-called duct carcinomas in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive cancer that
is usually curable. The study was published in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnoses of DCIS have grown from fewer than 2 percent of all
breast cancers to nearly 20 percent because of the widespread use
of mammography, which catch the tumors before they become invasive.
Once that happens, radiation and other advanced therapies are
almost always needed.
</P>
<P>
   But prior to that, if surgeons cut away enough of the tumor so
that there is at least a 10 millimeter (two-fifths of an inch)
margin of healthy tissue around it, chances are women won't also
need radiation to keep it from coming back, the study finds. With
smaller margins (between 1 and 9 millimeters), there was only a
slight advantage to radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, standard care is for patients to receive five to six
weeks of radiation treatments, which costs roughly $10,000. A
single course of radiation treatment hasn't been linked to serious
side effects or deaths, but radiation is known to cause some
cancers, and there is concern that exposing women to too much
radiation over their lifetime will harm them. As a result, doctors
will only give a woman one course of radiation therapy; if her
cancer recurs, they switch to other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which followed 469 patients for eight years, just
3 percent of the women whose tumors had a clear margin of at least
10 millimeters had a recurrence _ whether or not they had radiation
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The current standard for treatment is based partly on
government-funded research done by the National Surgical Adjubant
Breast Project, which found that radiation does help patients with
DCIS.
</P>
<P>
   However, Michael Lagios of St. Mary's Medical Center and
co-author of the latest study said the previous work probably
included many tumors that had become invasive. In those cases,
radiation does help give a better outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the project were unavailable for comment. But in
an editorial in the same issue of the Journal, two doctors at
Vanderbilt University wrote that the study will generate excitement
about the possibility of curing the localized tumors with surgery
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The key to knowing when to forgo radiation is to carefully
examine the excised tissue to make sure the margins are clear all
the way around, Lagios said. For women with low-grade cancers that
show fewer mutations, a margin of less than 10 millimeters _ but at
least 1 millimeter _ is usually good enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The process is something like slicing a loaf of bread and
looking for raisins or nuts. By taking more and thinner slices of
the cancer specimen, pathologists can be sure they aren't missing
tiny amounts of invasive cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able with much higher confidence to exclude patients
with invasive carcinoma,'' Lagios said.

NBC, CITING ECONOMICS, CANCELS `HOMICIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC has canceled its critically celebrated police drama
``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' after seven seasons, the show's
creator, Tom Fontana, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which is to announce its new lineup of programs for
next fall Monday, called Fontana with the news Wednesday night.
``They said it came down to the economics,'' Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide,'' never a hit, has slipped further in the ratings
this season, losing about 2 percent of its viewers. It ranked 60th
among all the network shows in prime time this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, among the most critically praised shows of the
past decade, routinely selected as the favorite show by newspaper
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Hollywood executives have said in recent weeks
that ``Homicide'' was a likely target for cancellation because NBC
is enthusiastic about at least four hourlong pilots for shows for
the coming season. The cancellation of ``Homicide'' means at least
one of these shows is likely to inherit its time slot of Friday at
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said he received the call from Scott Sassa and Garth
Ancier, the two top executives in NBC's entertainment division.
``They couldn't have neen nicer.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they pointed out that ``Homicide'' had already completed 122
episodes, more than enough to sell in syndication. ``They weren't
sure how making it 144 would add to its value,'' Fontana said. He
said NBC executives had pointed out that keeping ``Homicide'' going
would cost about $200,000 more per episode than a new drama series.
</P>
<P>
   The show's repeats have already been sold to the Court TV
channel. NBC has an ownership interest in the show, which is
produced by Fontana's company in partnership with Barry Levinson's
Baltimore Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven seasons; that's a respectable run,'' Fontana
said. Still, he said, some of the other staff members on the show
were devastated by the news. ``I've been through cancellation
before, when I worked on `St. Elsewhere.' It's like a death in the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the cancellation would have its greatest
impact on the production crew in Baltimore. It was the only
television show produced there.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said the producers had anticipated the possibility of
cancellation and so he had written a final episode, ``which kind of
ties a lot of things up.'' That will be broadcast Friday, May 21.

AUTO SAFETY: THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE OF DRIVERS' EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning July 1, anyone applying for a license for
the first time in Maryland will have to complete at least 30 hours
of drivers' education in the classroom and 6 hours on the road.
Maryland's drivers' ed requirement currently applies only to 16-
and 17-year-olds _ as do the rules in most states that have
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new Maryland law is also bucking a national trend against
drivers' ed. The number of high schools offering on-the-road
training has fallen by about half since 1975, experts say. The new
law will not restore those programs, but will send more young
people to commercial training schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of the drivers' education through the school systems
are going the way of the dinosaur,'' said Richard Scher, a
spokesman for the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration.
Nationwide, the programs have disappeared because of budget cuts,
rising liability insurance bills and the end of car companies'
onetime practice of giving cars to schools.
</P>
<P>
   In states that require 16- and 17-year-olds to have drivers'
education before they can be licensed, some young people decide to
save the hundreds of dollars that a commercial school costs, and
wait until they are 18 to get a license _ without any certification
at all, if they can pass a road test. (That dodge was cited by
lawmakers when they changed Maryland's law to require drivers' ed
for any applicant who has never had a license, no matter his or her
age.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wane of public drivers' education, there is a
national movement to cut the automotive death rate, the leading
cause of death among teen-agers. One approach would be to require
more than six hours of road time with a professional teacher. But
with courses typically costing $30 or $35 an hour, few legislatures
are willing to impose such financial burdens on taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, however, new drivers will soon face the prospect of
spending several hundred dollars on courses. The Legislature did
not authorize any financial aid for those who might have trouble
coming up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours of road time with a professional teacher clearly is
not enough to train a teen-ager, who is likely also to get informal
lessons from a parent or older relative. So what is the best way to
use the six professional hours? Should it be the first six hours of
a new driver's experience? Should it offer a chance to polish
skills after hours of practice with a parent?
</P>
<P>
   Use it either way, said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va. Whether
lessons from parents or professionals come first ``won't make a bit
of difference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Insurance Institute's position, based on a study in
the Atlanta suburbs 20 years ago, is that lessons from a
professional teacher do not make much difference; young drivers who
took drivers' ed were a bit less accident-prone for the first six
months, the group found, but after that they fared no better than
others their age. What makes a difference, Ms. Rochman said, is
more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are usually the best teachers,'' she said, adding that
professional teachers were ``really good for teaching basic vehicle
handling skills'' needed to pass the exam, including some with a
low safety impact, like parallel parking. But parents ``have the
most at stake in seeing those kids survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts agree that a problem with the professional schools
is that they are geared to help students pass a test, not to drive
safely. Few have advanced equipment or large expanses of
traffic-free pavement for teaching students handling techniques,
critics say, and the teachers get their jobs after only a few hours
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures could set higher standards but are generally not
eager to push up the cost of a mandatory program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, driving is a skill that can be taught by professionals,
some experts insist. ``Driving is the only area of human life where
training as a way to improve behavior is denied,'' said Bob Green
of the Skip Barber Driving School, which is based at the Lime Rock
race track in Lakeville, Conn. ``I really do believe people can
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's biggest impact is probably not as a one-on-one
instructor who specializes in teaching teen-agers, but as a
motivational speaker who lectures in high schools on staying alive.
He went to 35 schools last year, he said, and addressed 4,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   His lectures, different from what a parent is likely to give,
stress that young drivers often crash because of inattention.
``Teen-agers tend to crash on straightaways, like old folks in
Florida,'' he said. ``They just forget they are driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is overconfidence, he said. ``Ninety-one percent
think they have good or excellent control,'' he said. ``I call this
DOA _ delusions of adequacy.'' Nearly all will have accidents at
some point.
</P>
<P>
   Driving at 60 miles an hour, he tells them, means you are
traveling nearly 90 feet per second. He advises students to take an
empty mayonnaise jar and put a bumblebee inside. ``Then shake the
jar,'' he said. ``That's what's going to happen to you with no seat
belts on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kuhn, a former Formula Ford and Indy car race driver who
operated a driving school in northern New Jersey for several years,
and who is now a business manager for professional racers, stresses
in his teaching some advice that novice drivers may not get from
their parents. One example is what to do if the car wanders off the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation, he said, is for the driver to think, ``Dirt is
bad, grass is dangerous, and the road is where safety is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in this instance, it's not true,'' he added. Unless the
car is headed for a tree or another obstacle, if the right wheels
leave the road the safer course is to slow down gently and then get
the car back on the pavement, not to jerk the wheel to the left and
risk flinging the car clear across the road.
</P>
<P>
   The best training involves skid pads where drivers can get a
sense of how a car will behave in a skid, but that is something
``which obviously you're not going to find at Fred's Driving
School.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if commercial schools are imperfect, Scher of the state of
Maryland said education could be more valuable now, because just as
cars are more important to adults than they used to be, they may be
more important to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument can be made that teens today need to accomplish
more chores, to drive around and complete more errands than teens
of 15 or 20 years ago,'' he said. ``A lot of teens today are being
groomed by their parents into being junior moms or dads.'' &QL;

 &HT;      WEXLER WORKS WITH IMPEACHMENT FOE ON TAX CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 13 -- Eager to move beyond the partisan rancor
which defined the impeachment saga, U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., has joined a former foe to sponsor a bipartisan tax-cut
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Graham
was one of the 13 trial managers who prosecuted President Clinton
in his trial before the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., also a member of the House
Judiciary Committee but perhaps the most outspoken critic of the
impeachment process, is Mr. Graham's unlikely partner as lead
advocates for the Small Savers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good signal that we are working together for the
good of the country,'' Mr. Graham said. ``That other stuff is
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Small Savings Act was originally written by U.S. Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., and U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
introduced the bill in the Senate. The bill's goal is to make it
easier for Americans to save money by reducing taxes on savings.
Specifically, it would:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Expand the 15-percent tax bracket to include some people
</P>
<P>
   &UR; currently in the 28- and 31-percent tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exclude up to $500 in dividend and interest income from taxes,
</P>
<P>
   &UR; which would, in effect, make the first $10,000 in a savings
</P>
<P>
   &UR; account tax free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exempt the first $5,000 in long-term capital gains from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Increase the contribution limits on deductible IRA's from
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Simplify the tax-paying process by allowing more taxpayers to
</P>
<P>
   &UR; file using Form 1040EZ.
</P>
<P>
   ``One third of Americans have no savings and another one third
have less than $3,000. With such a low rate of savings, many people
are not equipped to deal with financial trouble or plan for
retirement,'' Mr. Graham said. ``We're cutting taxes to increase
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue the Small Savings Act would do nothing to help
those in the working class, or even the lower-middle class. Only
those who had been in a higher tax bracket and those already with
substantial savings accounts would benefit, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wexler disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Small Savers Act will ensure that 10 million low and
middle class Americans will no longer have to pay capital gains
taxes,'' he said. ``A substantial number of those who will benefit
from this provision are senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a common story from my district: a couple in their
seventies work their whole lives, educate their children, make some
modest investments and then they retire to sunny Florida. After a
few laps in the pool and a couple of games of mahjong, the reality
of life sets in. Now they need the money from their investments for
doctors, prescription drugs and long-term healthcare. Uncle Sam
shouldn't consume the benefit of their modest savings. We're not
talking about millionaires here. We're talking about people to whom
$5,000 means a great deal,'' Mr. Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Coverdell and Mr. Torricelli have gotten support for their
bill from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., making it
likely to pass the Senate this year. Mr. Graham and Mr. Wexler have
not yet lobbied leaders in the House, but they plan to use support
in the Senate for leverage. The White House has not yet been
approached.

WITHOUT A FIGHT, APOLITICAL CANDIDATE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF
ITALY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking consensus and political stability, Italy's
Parliament Thursday chose Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as
the country's new president.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi, 78, a former prime minister, was chosen by secret ballot
on the first round of voting, only the third presidential candidate
elected so quickly since World war II.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi's smooth election was a tribute to his unblemished
reputation as a technocrat and senior statesman. But it also
signaled that Italy, eager to hold its own within the European
Monetary Union and anxious about the war in Kosovo nearby, has lost
some of its appetite for back-room politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply moved,'' said Ciampi (pronounced CHAHM-pee) after
his victory was announced. ``I hope I am worthy of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Italians were mostly relieved. For months, the country had been
immersed in speculation about the political intrigue and
horse-trading leading up to the election. On the eve of the voting,
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema negotiated a consensus candidate in
a flurry of meetings with political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest last-minute lobbying against Ciampi came not from
the opposition but from D'Alema's own governing coalition _ another
reflection of the fragility of Italian governments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, in what is now seen as the last gasp of the old, deeply
corrupt political elite, it took Parliament nearly two weeks of
tactical feints and oblique lobbying to select Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
as president.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, prime ministers, not presidents, make policy. But
presidents do have the power to dissolve parliament or appoint a
new prime minister when a government collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, politicians of every stripe raced before television
cameras to congratulate themselves on their somewhat novel display
of responsibility and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ciampi is the icon of the establishment,'' Giuliano Ferrara,
editor of a maverick conservative newspaper, Il Foglio, explained.
``There was a great desire at this time to not inflict an ugly
battle on the public, but there was also the fact that the
alternative candidates to Ciampi were so unconvincing and small.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi, who served as governor of Italy's Central Bank between
1979 and 1993, earned international respect for his efforts to free
the bank from political control and set its own course on interest
and exchange rate policy. In 1993, Ciampi, who did not belong to
any political party and was untainted by scandal, was pressed to
serve as a caretaker prime minister for eight months. Two
successors recruited him to run Italy's treasury. When Italy
qualified to use the new European currency, the euro, in 1998,
Ciampi was also widely credited with the feat.
</P>
<P>
   His successor at the treasury will be Giuliano Amato, a
respected former prime minister who is now minister of
Institutional Reform.  &QL;

<P>
   Tony Goldwyn swears he was never one of those actors who really
want to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to direct,'' says Goldwyn, who, yes, is one of
the Goldwyns. ``I had always acted in movies and looked at the
director and thought, `Thank God that's not me.' They just always
had that 1,000-yard stare and looked besieged with problems. I
always thought, `I have this fun job of being an actor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his route to the director's chair on the set of ``A Walk
on the Moon,'' was a circuitous one. Goldwyn decided about four
years ago that taking on the role of producer and developing
material for himself _ would boost his acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a moment of leverage _ when a movie's making a
lot of money at the box office _ that's the time to capitalize on
things,'' says Goldwyn, who had one of those moments when he played
the villain in 1990s ``Ghost'' and was determined to have a project
ready to go the next time lightning struck.
</P>
<P>
   While reading through stacks of screenplays, he came across ``A
Walk on the Moon,'' a story about a young housewife in a Catskills'
summer resort who undergoes a sexual awakening in the tumultuous
summer of '69. Goldwyn couldn't really see himself playing either
the betrayed husband or the hippie lover, but the script captivated
him nonetheless, and after meeting its author, Pamela Gray, he
agreed to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   He set Gray to work on rewrites and spent the next six months
looking for a director. ``I got really cold feet about everyone I
met. I was getting a massage one day,'' he says, laughing at
himself, ``laying on the table, and I just went, `Oh, I've got to
do this myself.' Literally, it was like a flash from God or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn may have been a rookie as a director, but he was no babe
in Hollywood. As grandson of both legendary producer Samuel Goldwyn
and screenwriter Sidney Howard, son of art-film producer Samuel
Goldwyn Jr., and brother of Paramount Motion Pictures president
John Goldwyn, Tony Goldwyn knew a thing or two about how to get a
movie made.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, just as Goldwyn had decided not to try to
rush a deal, his agent called to tell him Dustin Hoffman's Punch
Productions wanted to talk. ``And suddenly we were in business,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Hoffman was interested in directing the movie himself
but deferred to Goldwyn. They collaborated on casting, signing
Diane Lane for the lead and Liev Schreiber and Anna Paquin for her
husband and teenage daughter. Goldwyn was intent on having Viggo
Mortensen play Lane's lover, and when the actor pulled out of
another movie, he saw his chance. ``I couldn't really speak in the
meeting because I was so shaken at how right this guy was,''
Goldwyn says.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman watched the dailies, FedExed from location in Canada,
and gave Goldwyn advice by phone. But he stayed away from both the
set and the editing room. ``I had so much respect for the work Tony
did,'' he explains. ``He has certain things you have to have, and
that's intelligence, focus, tremendous energy and real passion. And
humanity doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn relied on the crew for their technical knowledge and
spent a good deal of time just talking to the cast. Hoffman says he
had a natural ability to relate to the actors, helping them deliver
strong performances. About halfway through the shoot, Diane Lane
remembers, she asked Goldwyn how he managed to please everyone and
``never lose his cool once _ never.'' He replied that from his
years of experience as an actor he had imagined his ideal director
and told her, ``That's what I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the filmmaking process proved easier than
Goldwyn's initial efforts to break into acting in the early 80s.
When he first fell in love with acting in high school, he was a
little disappointed in himself: He hadn't wanted to go into the
family business. In a kind of compromise, he moved to New York
after acting school in London. In the theater world, the name
didn't carry much clout, which he says suited him fine, as did
acting on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But after several years as a working actor, if not a prominent
one, Goldwyn returned to L.A and landed frequent TV roles on
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and ``L.A.
Law.'' He had less luck in movies. ``In L.A., I would walk into an
audition], and they'd go, `How's your dad?' or `We had lunch with
your brother the other day,''' Goldwyn says, cringing at the
memory. ``They'd assume you were a dilettante kid who didn't really
know what you wanted to do, so you said, `Oh, I'll be an actor.' I
worked really hard. I felt very frustrated to be dismissed in that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break came with ``Ghost.'' ``I forced my way into an
audition,'' he recalls. The movie was a huge hit worldwide, and
Goldwyn, with his chiseled features, melting blue eyes and serious
actor credentials, seemed poised for stardom. But he says, ``I
always felt like I was wearing someone else's clothes. I had no
instinct for being a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after ``Ghost,'', he's still being typecast as the
good-looking villain. ``It's funny he plays such convincing bad
guys,'' says Diane Lane, ``because he's the most charming, gentle
person.'' Although he is developing three projects to direct,
because of time constraints, Goldwyn says he has no plans to give
up acting entirely. Nor does the 38-year-old intend to leave
suburban Connecticut, where he makes his home away from the
limelight with his wife, production designer Jane Musky, and their
two young daughters, Anna and Tess. Even his mother, when she was
dying of cancer, cautioned that he needed to become more adept at
playing the game. But Goldwyn has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever opportunities I have missed as an actor I'll make up
for in spades in breadth and depth, as opposed to this obsession
with being hot, which you get into in L.A.,'' he says. ``I really
believe you have to decide how you want your life to go, and you
have to be true to that.''  &QL;   &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The Kosovo war has uncapped an eruption of anti-American
sentiments, going far beyond the ideological antagonisms of the
Cold War. It is true, as NATO and U.S. officials keep saying, that
Slobodan Milosevic's villainous treatment of ethnic Albanian
Kosovars has isolated Serbia in much of world opinion. But,
paradoxically, it hasn't made a hero of America.
 &HT;    Conspiracy theories are mushrooming in a bewildering mixture of
supposedly dark American motives, many contradictory, but that
doesn't seem to matter. For some, the United States is supporting
Moslem Kosovars because it wants to destroy Orthodox Christianity
in Europe. And for others, including Middle Easterners, that is
merely a trick to fool Arabs into thinking the United States has no
quarrel with Islam.
 &HT;    Greek Cypriot students attack the U.S. Embassy not only for
bombing Serbia but for having failed to bomb Turkey when its 1974
invasion of northern Cyprus sent Greek-speaking refugees fleeing
south. Not only Chinese students, but people in Belgrade too are
convinced the Chinese embassy was deliberately bombed to show
Beijing how little Washington thought of it.
 &HT;    A French former ambassador, too well-informed for that kind of
coffee-shop nonsense, nonetheless bewailed what he considered the
great new menace of the U.S. ``hyper-power,'' much more dangerous
for the world than the Cold War, he argued, because then the two
giants restrained each other. It is a curious nostalgia for the
frightening nuclear confrontation, imagining that what didn't
happen couldn't have happened whereas now, he said, ``the U.S. can
do anything it wants.''
 &HT;    In Thailand, there are angry demonstrations before the U.S.
embassy, not for Serbia but to show resentment that America prefers
a New Zealander to Supachai Panitchpakdi, the Thai candidate to
take over as director of the World Trade Organization. Many
Russians are convinced that the secret U.S. plan is to take over
the whole world and make satellites of everybody else,
Stalin-style, although elsewhere America's failure to protect human
rights in Africa and Asia shows that it is racist and doesn't care
about others.
 &HT;    Oddly, you don't much hear that, on the contrary, the
protracted, unsuccessful war shows how effective are the limits on
American power, how little the U.S. achieves with its vast means.
Except for some Americans, the assessment of evidence so far is not
what seems obvious incompetence, bad planning, poor judgment and
obsession with high-tech weapons, but proof of rapacious ambition.
 &HT;    There is plenty to criticize, from the peculiar, self-awed
conviction that Milosevic could only be terror-stricken by NATO
threats and therefore cave gracefully as the chorus sang the
finale, to the ridiculous mistake about the perfectly well-known
Belgrade buildings. But leave aside the logic. The illusion, the
perception of power seems to have taken over here.
 &HT;    And it needs to be understood. It isn't so much about the
bombing, the war, the failure to accommodate decently the sudden,
incredible mass of homeless people, as it is a release of feelings,
suspicions, discomforts that were already there.
 &HT;    Partly, the sense of an American threat is an inevitable
reflection of the unique accumulation of strengths at a time of
world transition, when nobody feels sure of their role and their
future. America just looks too overwhelming to be trusted. Every
country uses claws to defend its national interest, but there's a
difference between a pussy cat's scratch and a tiger paw.
 &HT;    Partly, also however, there is an inflated, extravagant fear of
American omnipotence due to the American habit of boasting,
self-promotion, trying to keep up morale with dubious claims of
superiority. ``We are number one,'' was the intoxicating refrain
the late President Ronald Reagan taught Americans to get over the
Vietnam blues. Whether they really believe it or not, others feel
there's a risk that it might prove unpleasantly true.
 &HT;    But the show of force is a charade, destructive but mindless.
B-52 bombers, and even worse $2 billion B-2s, fly 30-hour missions
from the American Midwest with several aerial refuelings to bomb a
Danube bridge or a Belgrade TV station. Washington has forgotten
the B-52s couldn't even stop the bicycle supply train down the Ho
Chi Minh trail. This isn't quite what is needed to keep peace
against thugs.
 &HT;    There will need to be rather some modesty, some willingness to
forego reminding the world of America's might and even a little
extra courtesy if this unpleasant reaction to America is to be
countered. Even American prosperity is something of an insult to
those falling behind. They can't be expected to offer sympathy,
they need it.
 &HT;    Unfair, you say? Well, there is a price for being on top and
trying to make everybody admit it, perhaps worthwhile but still to
be paid.

   WASHINGTON _ This columnist recently wronged the sophisticated
denizens of Beverly Hills by suggesting they might have more money
than brains and therefore fall for a silly stunt proposed by animal
rights extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, common sense and the love of luxe prevailed as the
elite enclave's voters this week overwhelmingly rejected a
so-called truth-in-slaughtering initiative meant to discourage the
purchase of fur coats.
</P>
<P>
   My apologies, beautiful people. You did well. Patricia Nixon may
have scored political points by wearing a cloth coat in the 1950s,
but there's little glory in it these days for anyone who can afford
a nice warm hairy alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have required fur coats to carry tags
describing the murderous methods by which the pelts might have been
violently separated from their original owners. The labels were to
be symbolic and scary rather than informative. They would not have
specified the actual way the animal was killed _ no retailer or
wholesaler is likely to know that _ but merely would have listed
the most grisly possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The splashy Rodeo Drive social set defeated this nutty idea by
63 percent to 36 percent, even though some well-known Hollywood
stars like Jack Lemmon crusaded on its behalf. Despite the fact
that the fur labeling act was the only measure on the ballot, voter
turnout was unusually high, roughly a quarter of the city's 20,473
registered voters.

   It got nearly everybody's attention, all right, inside Beverly

tried to create a national stir in a city renowned for glamour and
wealth that despite its sunny climate is one of the largest fur
retail markets in the country. If Beverly Hills would fall for this
nonsense, maybe other places would.
</P>
<P>
   A new gimmick was needed. The old tactic of throwing paint on
women bundled in fur coats is wearing thin, to say the least. The
models who had posed for advertisements in the nude pledging never
to wear fur are being seen again on the runways in fur-trimmed
outfits. Setting fires in fur salons produced a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tags would have warned: ``This product is made with
fur from animals that may have been killed by electrocution,
gassing, neck breaking, poisoning, clubbing, stomping or drowning
and may have been trapped in steel-jaw leg-hold traps.'' As a guilt
trip, it was powerful. As a helpful label, it was useless.
</P>
<P>
   Furriers insist that minks and other fur-bearing animals raised
on farms for their skins are killed humanely with a lethal dose of
painless sodium pentobarbital. The animal rights crowd refuses to
believe the industry and did not bother to include that method on

</P>
<P>
   There are some unregulated trappers who capture and perhaps
mutilate animals in the wild to sell their pelts. Nobody really
knows how whether they are humane. But if beavers, otters,
raccoons, muskrats, nutria and other wildlife were not hunted, they
might overpopulate, become diseased and starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the animal rights crusaders do not distinguish between
wildlife and farm-raised creatures. The very notion of killing an
animal, any animal, for any reason, is what they are against.
</P>
<P>
   This flies directly in the face of reality. From the beginning
of time, humans have worn fur garments for warmth and comfort,
killed animals for food and tanned their hides for leather for
shoes, water containers and other uses. The animals' survival is
sacrificed for ours. It is the way life is.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible, in Genesis 3:21, records that before casting Adam and
Eve from the Garden of Eden, ``unto Adam and to his wife did the
Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them.'' The fig leaf
wasn't adequate cover for the human body then, and it isn't now.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of banning fur coats (and leather shoes and
belts) are growing demands from these self-appointed purists that
we all stop eating meat and become vegetarians. Their lust for new
gimmicks for this cause is unabated.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA), the largest U.S. animal rights group, has mounted a $1
million-a-year campaign centered on the inventive claim that Jesus
was a vegetarian and that Christians must follow his example. This
pitch has been greeted by hoots from Biblical scholars, who say
there is no evidence that Jesus did not eat lamb, fish and other
mealtime staples just as his contemporaries did.
</P>
<P>
   The PETA claim is outrageous, of course. But there's an old
saying that when you don't have a good case to make, you pound the
table instead.

NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT TEASING; SCHOOLYARD BULLYING TAKES A TOLL (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as there have been schoolyards, there have been
schoolyard bullies.
</P>
<P>
   But excessive teasing can be traumatic for kids, and adults who
brush it off as just ``one of those things'' may be contributing to
the problem, say professionals who work with and study children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids who are teased feel extra helpless, because not
only are they in a humiliating situation, but often the adults they
turn to just roll their eyes and see them as perennial victims,''
says Rebecca Coffey, author of ``Unspeakable Truths and Happy
Endings: Human Cruelty and the New Trauma Therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a whining kid becomes a kid who is difficult to love,''
she adds, ``which leaves a child isolated at a time when he needs
support the most. If he finds a gun, that might make him feel more
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine High
School gunmen, note that the two were harassed repeatedly by
classmates. A long-brewing sense of powerlessness may have
contributed to their vicious outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Colorado killings are an extreme example, the toll
that excessive teasing takes on children every day often goes
unnoticed by adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many as 7 percent of American eighth-graders stay at home
once a month because of bullies at school,'' says Dr. David Welsh,
quoting a recent study.
</P>
<P>
   One of the insidious aspects of teasing is the wider circle of
alienation it creates around the victim, says Welsh, a Fort Worth
child psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is identified as a victim, and now people, the neutral
bystanders, begin to pull back from this victim,'' he suggests.
``They don't want to stand up (to the bully) because they don't
want to be the victim next time.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the problem, kids who are teased often don't want
adults to step in on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned it's not at all helpful when people try to fix
things for (the child being teased),'' says Coffey, who advocates
``supportive listening'' by adults and action by kids who are
neither the victim nor the victimizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent can say, `Wow, that must feel awful,' that's
wonderful,'' she notes. And kids who see an ugly situation should
be encouraged to ``share a kind word later'' with the peer being
abused or talk to a teacher about the situation. ``Know that it's
OK to help an underdog and you don't have to risk much to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are times when adult intervention is necessary,
says Rebecca Edwards, a community educator with the Parenting
Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   When Edwards' daughter was the target of a group of bullies in a
class, she pointed out the conflict to her daughter's teacher. As a
result, the teacher ``was more aware of it and she was able to
intervene and get the pattern stopped,'' Edwards says. She has also
read the Bill Cosby book, ``The Meanest Thing to Say,'' with both
her children.
</P>
<P>
   But kids who are teased aren't the only ones in need of help,
Edwards adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the bullies some help because (that behavior)
doesn't go away. It often escalates,'' she says. ``When we were
growing up, our parents told us to `Just punch them' or `Don't
respond,' and that actually might help your child, but it's not
helping that bully. They're going to go find another child to pick
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh and Coffey both say schools could help by adding social
skills training to the curriculum. ``Childhood is a time of
learning to belong to groups, and some kids don't pick that up,''
Coffey notes. ``We need to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But more important, Welsh says, it's up to parents to raise
compassionate, caring kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we pay very close attention and notice how easily
and carelessly we put people down and make fun of other's
misfortunes,'' he says. ``We need to become more aware of the
example we're setting for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Where to turn for help
</P>
<P>
   Coffey suggests contacting any of these three organizations,
which provide conflict-resolution help to schools and parents:

   KIDS-TEASING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ As long as there have schoolyards, there have been
schoolyard bullies. But excessive teasing can be traumatic for
kids. And adults who brush it off as just ``one of those things''
may be contributing to the problem, say professionals who work with
and study children. By LIZ STEVENS. Story has moved in ``l''

</P>
<P>
   TRIVIA-Q&AMP;A &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   EDITOR-OVERHOLSER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Geneva Overholser, one of the most successful women in
American journalism, knows all too well about the weaknesses of
newspaper reporting, having weathered a bout of headlines herself.
Overholser made her name as an editor by saying society is better
when newspapers report on the private lives of individuals. Then
newspapers reported on her own private life. Her love life. She

   TV-JOAN OF ARC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Joan of Arc'' is a powerful, sensitively made movie
that's as refreshing as it is surprising. Refreshing since heavily
promoted made-for-TV movies are usually hollow cinematic
contraptions. Surprising since it's airing during May ``sweeps''
when such bloated silliness is the rule rather than the exception.

<P>
   RICKY MARTIN-CD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ You will not hear a catchier song than Ricky Martin's
``Livin' La Vida Loca'' _ not this year, not next, not _ maybe _
ever. Relentlessly up-tempo, featuring a smattering of rock guitar
and an insistent chorus, it is the vehicle that former Menudo
member Martin _ he of the pretty face and the boffo appearance on
this year's Grammy awards _ is riding to be the first truly huge
male Latino crossover star. You will listen. You will sing along.
You will, now and in the coming weeks, have no choice. Not that you
want one. By DAVE FERMAN. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DANCEMAKER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Dancemaker,'' the Oscar-nominated documentary about
choreographer Paul Taylor, starts with a camera watching from the
wings as his company bounds onto the stage. As we hear the dancers
sliding across the floor and their footfalls slapping onto the
boards, ``Dancemaker's'' uniqueness is evident. Never before has a
movie on dancers given such a sense of their physcial presence. And
we also get a sense of the man who created the company, and whose
talent and ego have made it such a singular artistic triumph. By
ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-THE CASTLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Some of the hype for the gently satirical comedy ``The
Castle'' is trying to cast director/co-writer Rob Sitch as an
Australian Roberto Benigni. But the comparison is mostly specious:
Sitch's dry, deadpan approach couldn't be more different from
Benigni's manic romanticism. Both styles do have the potential to
divide audiences, but not in the same ways. Like Benigni with
``Life Is Beautiful,'' Sitch uses comedy in an attempt to explore
some serious subjects. And like Benigni, he's concocted a very
likable family with an eccentric patriarch. By ROBERT PHILPOT.

<P>
   FILM-MIDSUMMER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Coming after ``Shakespeare in Love,'' movies using the
Bard now have a huge obstacle to surmount, and ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' isn't up to the race. It feels more like one of
love's labors lost. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED _ The names Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank may not be
familiar to you, but if you're a homeowner, you sure know their
store. I'm talking about the suburbanite's main supplier. The place
new homeowners go and drop a hundred bucks every week for what
seems like years and never think twice. I'm talking about Home
Depot. If you ever wondered how such a great concept developed, or
how much a retailer could influence American life, read ``Built

Nothing to $30 Billion. '' By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has moved in

   JOHNSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Continuing speculation about Jesse Jackson's 2000
intentions could not help but make the possibility of a fourth bid
for the White House more tantalizing for him. The clincher, of
course, is the spurt of favorable publicity he has received from
his free-lance diplomatic coup in Yugoslavia. That almost certainly
elevated the thought of giving it another shot from the tempting to
the irresistible. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story has moved ``k''

<HEADLINE>
BUFFALO: 400 MILES FROM EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ It is the most depressing of highway signs. You
can be in New England, or metropolitan New York. You can be in
Michigan, Ohio, or Pennsylvania. But one of life's certainties is
that no matter where you are in the great Northeast, you will
eventually see a sign that reads . . . BUFFALO _ 400 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo. It is 400 miles from everywhere and when you get there
. . . there's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit, it was easier for a Bostonian to stomach
Wednesday's 3-2 Bruins loss to the Sabres. It was a frustrating and
heartbreaking playoff defeat for the B's, but on the whole, not a
bad thing because the good people of Buffalo deserve a little
happiness in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. When this series is over, Boston fans get to
live in Boston. Sabres fans will still be in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good things to say about Buffalo. It's got
Lake Erie, Niagra Falls, Chippewa Street, and casinos across the
border in Ontario. It's got a beautiful Triple A baseball field,
and $3 parking for Sabres games. It's got Buffalo wings and
hard-working, blue-collar sports fans. Robert Redford shot ``The
Natural'' in Buffalo and Calvin Murphy played his college ball
nearby at Niagra.
</P>
<P>
   You get a lot more for your money in Buffalo (probably that's
why Jeremy Jacobs lives here), but as the Sundance Kid said when he
first set foot in rural Bolivia, ``What could they have here . . .
that you could possibly want to buy?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. When all is said and done, it's still Buffalo, a
frozen tundra, 400 miles from everywhere. This is the heart of
America's snowbelt, the land of midnight boredom.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to say there's nothing to do in Buffalo, but on
Wednesday there was a front-page story in the Buffalo News touting
a free downtown (Lafayette Square) summer concert series that this
year will feature the Flutie Brothers Band. Doug on drums. Darren
on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. The Flutie Brothers get top billing? Whoop-de-doo. With due
respect to Doug and Darren, they'll never be mistaken for the
Allman Brothers, the Doobie Brothers, or the Righteous Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sports rivalries, Boston-Buffalo is not exactly
Boston-New York. It's not even (gulp) Boston-Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   There is no baseball history between our two cities. Boston is
major league and Buffalo is minor league. Once an affiliate for the
Pirates, Buffalo today is a Triple A farm club for the Indians.
Unlike ancient Fenway, the Buffalo park is stunning, comfortable
and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo was not part of hockey's Original Six, but the Sabres
and Bruins have met six times in the playoffs since Buffalo came
into the league. Can anyone remember anything about those series?
Not me. But the book says the B's have won five of them, losing
only a four-game sweep in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, there's some interesting basketball history
involving Boston and Buffalo. The Celtics twice met the Buffalo
Braves in the NBA playoffs, winning both series in six games. The
'74 joust was a beauty because Bob McAdoo was a scoring machine and
Ernie DeGregorio was the new Bob Cousy. The Celts went on to win
the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, in a rather complicated deal, the Buffalo and
Boston NBA entries swapped franchises. No one (with the possible
exception of Will McDonough) ever figured out what it all meant. In
Boston, we know that Red Auerbach stayed, the parquet floor stayed,
and the banners stayed. This is the deal that brought John Y. Brown
to Boston. The Buffalo Braves became the Celtics and the Celtics
became the San Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers. John Y. Brown
brought in Phyllis George who brought in McAdoo, who was used to
bring in Robert Parish and Kevin McHale. Thank you, Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Football offers the best Boston-Buffalo rivalry. The Patriots
and Bills were charter franchises in the AFL and have met twice a
year for four decades. The first-ever AFL event (July 30, 1960) was
a Buffalo-Boston preseason game at Buffalo's old War Memorial
Stadium. The Pats won, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer Bostonians remember the old Bills of Jack Kemp and
Cookie Gilchrist battling Babe Parelli's Patriots at Fenway Park.
On Dec. 20, 1964, 38,021 poured into Fenway and saw the Bills beat
the Pats, 24-14. Buffalo went on to beat San Diego in the AFL
championship game. A few snowballs might have been tossed at those
Patriot-Bills games.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, of course, the Bills got jobbed at
Foxborough &UR;  &LR; last fall when the refs blew a couple of crucial calls
late in the game. This allowed the Patriots to finish 9-7 when they
should have been 8-8. The game was instrumental in the NFL's
decision to bring back replay.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Flutie is the King of Buffalo, but we have to remind
them that he's still Our Doug. Without us, there would be no Flutie
Flakes on all the breakfast tables of greater Buffalo. And let's
not forget that we gave you the best years of Fred Smerlas.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy your little Game 3 victory over the Bruins, you Buffalo
folk. Maybe we'll come back and visit if this series goes six
games. Maybe we'll drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a little over 400 miles, right?

<HEADLINE>
STEINBERG BROUGHT IMMIGRANT'S VIEW OF AMERICA TO CARTOONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg, an immigrant penman whose whimsical, dystopian
view of America helped elevate him to the top echelon of
contemporary artists, drawing comparisons to such giants as
Picasso, Miro, and Klee, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He was 84. The cause of death was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Steinberg once commented that ``the doodle is the brooding
of the hand,'' and among 20th-century artist-illustrators there was
no more gifted, prolific doodler than he. Mr. Steinberg created a
galaxy of surrealistic images _ a wholly original visual
vocabulary, in effect _ that embraced everything from modern
architecture to punctuation marks, Mickey Mouse to metaphysics, in
bridging the supposedly unbridgeable chasm between popular culture
and Serious Art.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Steinberg was closely associated with New York City and The
New Yorker throughout his career. Beginning in 1941, he produced 85
covers and more than 640 illustrations for the weekly magazine that
came to define urban sophistication and intellectual panache.
</P>
<P>
   His most celebrated New Yorker cover, an image that was often
parodied, perverted, or transposed to other venues and other
contexts, appeared in March 1976. It depicted the world from a
terminally provincial Manhattanite's perspective, with 9th Avenue
looming in the foreground, the Hudson River flowing by in mid-range
and the rest of the planet _ stretching from New Jersey to China _
squeezed into a space not much bigger than the magazine's logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked it up and thought, oh, how wonderful _ and how
beautiful and, yes, funny,'' author John Updike, another longtime
New Yorker contributor, recalled Thursday. ``The joke wasn't
overstated, it was just there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Steinberg, said Updike, ``created a niche between the world
of cartooning and the world of high art that did not exist before.
You could see the seriousness of his cartooning, the gravitas
behind it, from the very beginning. He was also lucky to have
William Shawn as (the magazine's) editor, because another editor
might have balked at running work of such intellectual
complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like film director Milos Forman, Mr. Steinberg brought a
foreigner's curiosity and a European's formidable intellect to bear
on a postwar America that sometimes seemed designed for, if not by,
his pen and the satirical genius with which he wielded it. Born in
Romania in 1914, the son of a printer and box maker, Mr. Steinberg
studied at the University of Bucharest before moving to Italy,
where he received a doctoral degree in architecture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Emigrating to the United States in 1942, he gained a
professional foothold at The New Yorker, where his spare, elegantly
linear drawings reflected his deep personal concerns, including
political fascism, overbearing bureaucracy, and brooding questions
of identity. He married in 1943 (Mr. Steinberg is survived by his
wife, the painter Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, from whom he separated
in the 1970s), became a US citizen and joined the Navy during World
War II, where he served in part as an anti-Hitler propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he was included in a show at the Museum of Modern Art,
the first major public recognition of his talent. Among published
collections of Mr. Steinberg's work are ``All in Line'' (1943),
``The Art of Living'' (1949), ``The Passport'' (1954), ``The
Inspector'' (1973), and ``The Discovery of America'' (1993). He
also painted, worked in three-dimensional media, amassed an
impressive collection of works by contemporaries like Picasso, de
Kooning, and Guston, and, in 1973, was himself the subject of a
major Whitney Museum retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   As Mr. Steinberg's cartooning style evolved _ from abstract,
philosophical musings to sendups of government documents and later
to paranoia-fueled snapshots of urban life in which Mickey Mouse
toted an Uzi and hookers wore hot pants cut clear up to their
necklines _ his fame also grew, even if the art world didn't always
know how to categorize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His drawings are, in a sense, anthologies of art history,''
the critic Hilton Kramer once wrote, citing cubism, expressionism,
pointillism, and primitivism as being only some of the more obvious
influences. Mr. Steinberg, Kramer added, ``sees experience itself
as a parody of experience, with `style' the only reliable clue to
its mysterious gyrations.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been no accident that the most famous Steinberg
drawing appeared in 1976, the year of the American bicentennial.
With the country swept up in a yearlong orgy of
self-congratulation, Mr. Steinberg burst forth with some of his
most wickedly on-target commentary about contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that no icon of Americana was immune from his
amusement, from the Easter Bunny to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Updike remembers one New Yorker cover from that era that cast Uncle
Sam as matador and a Thanksgiving turkey as the bull. Not exactly
Norman Rockwell holiday sentiment, but then conventional
sentimentality was seldom Mr. Steinberg's calling card. More
typical is a cartoon showing nine fish swimming in a circle, trying
to swallow one another. The fish are labeled ``Facts,'' ``Time,''
``Space,'' ``Noise,'' ``Truth,'' ``Chauvinism,'' ``Taxes,''
``Ambition,'' and ``Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept up with the times,'' Updike noted in paying tribute to
Mr. Steinberg. ``As the urban scene darkened in the '70s and '80s,
you got those crime-ridden, drug-ridden landscapes with the cop
cars blaring and the preflattened pedestrians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``View of the World from 9th Avenue,'' the New Yorker cover that
launched a thousand imitators, was another product of these fecund
times. By 1984, Mr. Steinberg had grown so weary of the copycats
that he sued Columbia Pictures for using the image in an ad
campaign for the film ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' A federal court
agreed with Mr. Steinberg, but by then it was hard to find a city
with a downtown bigger than four square blocks that did not inspire
some bastardized version of Mr. Steinberg's matchless original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have retired on this painting,'' the artist himself
once mused, sarcastically or painfully it is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saul Steinberg was our Picasso, our great original,'' said
current New Yorker editor David Remnick. ``We'll miss his eye, his
line, his language, his wit, and his friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   William Steig, who lives in Boston, has been a New Yorker
mainstay since 1930. Thursday he recalled a trip to France some 50
years ago, where he met up with Mr. Steinberg, his obliging tour
guide. The two artists who opened up the pages of The New Yorker to
what Updike calls ``meditative, introspective cartooning'' had
their own Parisian fling together. They went out sketching, toured
art galleries and museums, and even gambled in the casinos of Monte
Carlo, recalled Steig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very great artist, tremendously talented. An absolute
original,'' said Steig in a telephone conversation from his Back
Bay apartment. ``Did he influence younger artists? I don't think
so, because Saul is not really imitable. I really can't think of
anyone quite like him.''

EX-BRITISH SPY NAMES AGENTS ON WEB BEFORE SITE IS SHUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An embittered former British spy has used the Internet
to make public the names of a large number of secret agents, but
officials in London said Thursday that the Web site had been shut
down and no duplicates had surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Office said British security and the lives of more
than 100 people were put in jeopardy by the action, which was
attributed to Richard Tomlinson, 35, an agent of the Secret
Intelligence Service, formerly known as MI6, who was let go in 1995
and later served a jail term for violating Britain's Official
Secrets Act.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Office said Thursday afternoon that
the offending Web site, based in the United States, had been taken
off the Internet ``apparently at the initiative of the provider.''
It first appeared Tuesday night, setting off frantic official
efforts to silence it.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Office experts were no longer able to access it
Thursday, the spokesman said, convincing them that it had been
fully removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is feared by intelligence agencies as a
particularly dangerous and untrackable threat to national security
since it is virtually beyond the control of national laws and
authorities. Even with the Tomlinson Web site shut down, British
officials faced the problem that once a page has appeared on the
Internet, it is simple for other users to copy it and repost the
contents on their own Web page _ a process known as ``mirroring.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the list, said to include 116
names, was ``riddled with inaccuracies'' but that ``nevertheless,
the release of any such list, however inaccurate it may be, is a
deeply irresponsible and dangerous act.'' Some were names of people
with no connection to the security services and some were retired
agents. But some were indeed names of current operatives, the
Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Britain succeeded in getting an injunction
in Switzerland to shut down another Web site based there and
operated by Tomlinson, on which he had threatened to publish
intelligence information. Tomlinson currently lives in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, a previously removed Tomlinson site reappeared in
the ``mirror'' form that officials fear might lead to the
resurfacing of the new list. Containing 10 names of government
people asserted to have links to the death in 1997 of Diana, the
Princess of Wales, it had been taken down last week by its
California-based provider, Geocities, after a notice from the
British Treasury called the firm's attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Office is not in contact with Tomlinson, but an
e-mail said to be from the former agent arrived at BBC offices in
London Thursday asserting that British officials were
``overreacting for public effect to stigmatize my efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the former agent, who served six months of a
one-year sentence in 1997 after pleading guilty to trying to
publish a book revealing his knowledge of the agency's activities,
Cook said, ``I regret Tomlinson appears to nurse an irrational,
deep-seated sense of grievance.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been arrested after showing a seven-page synopsis of his
intended book to an Australian publisher. He was charged under
Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act, which forbids any
unauthorized disclosure by a current or former officer of the
security services. His conviction was the first under the act since
1961.
</P>
<P>
   Released from prison last May, he went to France, Spain and then
on to Switzerland. He asserted that British security officials
followed and harassed him on his travels. He repeatedly complained
about the British government's decision in 1995 to bar him from
appealing his dismissal before an industrial tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Cook turned aside those complaints Thursday, saying: ``I can
report that when Tomlinson left the service, he was assisted to
find employment and did himself say it was the job of his dreams.
He did also receive appropriate settlement from the service.
</P>
<P>
   The British press Thursday complied with a Foreign Office
request not to publish the Web site address or name of the American
provider.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on contacts
between British and U.S. officials over the matter, but said that
early apprehension over the difficulty of shutting down a Web site
in the United States compared with the same task in Europe had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the First Amendment and the open freedom of information
there, you would have thought it would be more difficult,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Zealand and educated at Cambridge, Tomlinson joined
MI6 in 1991 and served in Bosnia, Russia and the Middle East. He
has made a number of assertions since his dismissal, including
accusations that MI6 tried to assassinate the Yugoslav leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, in 1992; that British intelligence was involved
in the death of Diana, and that Britain had a highly placed spy in
Germany's central bank who leaked secrets over a 12-year period.
``In the past, he has been very prone to fantasy,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his taunting Web sites carried a partially obscured photo
of himself against the backdrop of the Thames-side MI6
headquarters, whose fanciful architecture has given the building
the nickname ``The Circus.'' The site switched on to the sounds of
the theme music from ``Monty Python's Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   The names on Tomlinson's list reportedly did not compromise the
secret services of any nation other than Britain.

HOW TO CARAMELIZE ONIONS  
 (ADV: WITH SWEETONIONS-FOOD) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Caramelizing onions:
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. &QL; 
2. Line bottom of heavy-duty baking pan with unbleached parchment
paper. This eliminates scorching and the need to grease the pan. If
you don't use parchment paper, be prepared to spend time cleaning
the baking surface. &QL; 
3. Clean onions by cutting off the tops and roots. Cut through the
outer layer of onion skin to get a good clean onion. &QL; 
4. Cut onions into 3/4 - to 1-inch slices. &QL; 
5. Place onions side by side (do not layer) on the parchment. &QL; 
6. Brush slices with 1/4 cup good-quality olive oil. Sprinkle with
freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste. &QL; 
7. Cover pan and bake for 45 minutes. &QL; 
8. Turn onions with a spatula, then repeat steps 6 and 7. Total
baking time should be about 90 minutes. &QL; 
9. For last 30 minutes, remove cover so liquid evaporates. &QL; 
10. Remove and serve immediately, or keep warm at a low temperature
until serving time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTE: Onions may look dark brown or even black. This is
caramelization. &QL; 
To freeze the caramelized onions, deglaze with water. Remove
onions, add a little water on top of the parchment paper to loosen
the residue, and scrape residue from parchment paper into a small
bag to freeze. &QL; 
Put onion slices in freezer bags. &QL; 
To remove fat: Pour deglazing liquid into a separate container and
chill until the oil can be removed. Then freeze remaining liquid. &QL; 
Caramelized onion slices also can be pureed in a blender and
frozen. Use the puree (and any deglazing liquid) in small amounts
to enliven any dish, from chili to soups to omelets to salad
dressings. &QL;

ACCOUNTING BOARD MAY DELAY USE OF NEW DERIVATIVES RULE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's accounting rule makers may delay the date when
companies must begin following a controversial new rule that
requires them to record the value of derivatives in their financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has
received about 70 letters from public companies concerned about the
derivatives rule, said Timothy Lucas, the board's research
director. Many of the letters asked for a delay in the rule's
effective date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies must begin using the rule on July 1, most
businesses must begin applying it on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies said in their letters that they were
concerned about instituting the complex rule, which will require
new computer programs, at the same time that they are working to
insure that their systems will make the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also said that a group created by the accounting
standards board, known as the Derivatives Implementation Group, had
not yet answered some critical questions from companies about how
to apply the new rules to certain types of derivative transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to vote on whether to postpone the rule on
Wednesday, Lucas said. If approved, he said, the delay would most
likely be a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees to the companies' requests, it would be the
second time it has delayed the derivatives rule. Many companies
have lobbied against the rule, saying it is impractical. Some
banking companies even took their concerns about the proposed rules
to Congress, asking lawmakers to take away some of the accounting
standards board's rule-making powers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use derivative contracts to help manage business risks
like changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. The
transactions are known as derivatives because their value is
derived from an underlying asset.
</P>
<P>
   But the transactions are often risky bets on the future. An
example of the hefty losses that can result from investing in the
contracts came in September when Long-Term Capital Management, the
giant hedge fund with big bets in the derivatives market, nearly
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounting rule, which was approved by the accounting
board last June, requires companies to record the market value of
the derivatives on their balance sheets and to include the gains or
losses on those contracts in income.

 &HT;    ---------------------------------------------------
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It still sounds like an unlikely recipe for a bestseller. A
divorced middle-aged college professor and her new companion take
much of their life savings and purchase a crumbing 13-room house in
Italy. The 200-year old Tuscan farmhouse, called ``Bramasole,'' was
``tall, square and apricot-colored with faded green shutters,
ancient tile roof and an iron balcony on the second level'' and
needed a major renovation that is painstakingly detailed. Between
reconstructing stone walls and plumbing systems, there is much talk
of eating, drinking wine and the glories of small-town Tuscan life.
 &HT;    The book, of course, was Frances Mayes' ``Under the Tuscan Sun''
(Broadway, 1997; $14), which has spent over 83 weeks on ``The New
York Times'' paperback bestseller list and has more than a million
copies in print.
 &HT;    ``I thought people would like it because it was about Italy and
food and houses and travel,'' Mayes said in a recent phone
interview from her home in San Francisco. ``But it seems like a
great many people identified with taking a risk in mid-life, with
starting over. I didn't know that it would be picked up so
strongly.''
 &HT;    Mayes, who was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia, still speaks with
the softest of Southern accents, despite living in San Francisco
since the early 1970s. A professor of creative writing at San
Francisco State University, where she has directed the Poetry
Center and chaired the Department of Creative Writing, she has
written five books of poetry and has just published ``Bella
Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy'' (Broadway, 1999; $25). In the
new book, she chronicles a season at Bramasole that a sabbatical
allows her and her now-husband, Ed Kleinschmidt, to enjoy.
 &HT;    ``I'm in a rural part of Tuscany and some people think I
idealize it,'' Mayes says. ``I don't. When I get there, something
heavy slides away. It feels euphoric.''
 &HT;    The major restoration work done, she writes about the rural
pleasures that colored her first book, travels to Sicily and Venice
and Lago Trasimeno, and throws open the doors once again to a
lifestyle that so many readers found enticing. One that seems
worlds away from her urban lifestyle in San Francisco.
 &HT;    ``I think the Italians have done better with the 20th century
than we have,'' Mayes says. ``They have a different sense of time,
even in their urban environments. In Cortona, where we live,
there's a very cohesive population. There's an intense sense of
community. I feel very disassociated from that in my American life.
I think everyone's feeling the want of that. But in Italy, as a
stranger, a foreigner, I get to experience that and it makes me
feel at home.''
 &HT;    It seems like a timeless world where Mayes can devote endless
days to gardening, or marketing or taking long drives in pursuit of
wine from a local grower's collective. But in the nine years since
she has bought Bramasole, Mayes says that she has done more than
simply enjoy her summer days there.
 &HT;    ``I've written two books and restored the house and done lots of
gardening,'' she points out. ''I think the siesta is why the days
seem long. They're nicely balanced. I get up early and work and
then the siesta goes from 1:30 to about 4:30. It's like two days.
It's the best time of day and I get a lot of reading done. And it
feels familiar. I grew up in the south and my parents always faded
after lunch. Down in south Georgia, they still had a big midday
meal.''
 &HT;    Mayes loves reading ''that whole genre of travel narrative. I
love Ann Cornelisen's work and I dedicated my first book to her. I
also love Freya Stark, going into Arabia when no man, let alone
woman, would go there.''
 &HT;    Readers of ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' will not be surprised to
learn that food and its role in daily Italian life feature
prominently in Mayes' new work. In ``Bella Tuscany,'' she
rhapsodizes about artichokes and tomatoes, asparagus and wild
almonds, of meals that last for hours and the pleasures of
discovering an edible plant she'd previously never heard of. She
also recounts a trip through Sicily and gives the impression that
she is traveling through an entirely different country.
 &HT;    ``Italy feels so diverse in so many ways,'' Mayes says. ``The
north of Italy is very different from Tuscany and from Apulia in
the south. It's like different countries everywhere. Remember that
Italy was chopped up into little fiefdoms. Sicily is even more
extreme.''
 &HT;    Mayes has taken a year off from San Francisco State to work on a
novel that's set in Georgia. She says she's about halfway through
it and hopes to finish it by December. She admits that she's had
her share of people writing to her and even dropping by unannounced
at her house in Tuscany, entranced by her story. But she's quick to
add that they ``have not been invasive.''
 &HT;    As for Mayes' Italian, it's getting better, she says, noting
that she and her husband study with a tutor twice a week.
 &HT;    ``But I'm probably murdering the language two-thirds of the
time,`` she confesses.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Colorado's San Juan Skyway is one of six All-American highways
cited for their superior and stunning scenic beauty.
 &HT;    A pair of septuagenarian friends _ Joan Dunlop and Vesta Foster
_ from Fort Collins, Colo., had a hankering to tour the renowned
mountain loop traversing the state's southwestern corner, and
recently did just that.
 &HT;    The preferred months for seniors traveling to this alpine region
are during the cooler months of June, September and October. For
wildflower buffs, July is prime, while June boasts lovely green
aspens which peak golden come September.
 &HT;    Since weather is always iffy in the mountains, Dunlop and Foster
packed clothes for cool nights and hot days, with layers suitable
for any situation short of a sudden _ and highly unlikely _
blizzard. They brought plenty of high-altitude gear: brimmed hats,
sun screen _ SPF No. 30 _ and water bottles to keep well-hydrated
in the dry air. To avoid altitude sickness (headaches are a common
symptom), Dunlop and Foster limited themselves to one glass of wine
with dinner and advise lowlanders to minimize activities for the
first few days to acclimate to the thin air.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROAD AGAIN  
 &HT;    Although both Dunlop and Foster normally drive manual sticks,
they rented an automatic for that extra kick, and were happy with
the results when it came to passing lumbering RVs and trucks on
steep inclines. Lucky for agoraphobic Dunlop, her pal Foster is an
experienced mountain driver who didn't mind navigating narrow,
twisty roads with sheer drop-offs.
 &HT;    
 FINE B &AMP; Bs  
 &HT;    The duo found a number of fine bed-and-breakfast inns along the
Skyway. None with elevators, but if stairs pose a problem, they
suggest asking for a first floor room.
 &HT;    To ensure a nightly room, they referenced ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast
Innkeepers of Colorado'' and ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway.'' After
selecting a mutually satisfying accommodation, they called the
inn's 800 number, bypassing the central reservations number
(800/962-2493), preferring the personal touch of speaking with the
innkeepers directly.
 &HT;    The ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast Innkeepers of Colorado'' can be obtained
by calling 800/636-2242. For ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway,'' call
800/962-2493. For maps or tour books, call the San Juan National
Forest at 970/247-4874 or the Uncompahgre National Forest at
970/874-6600. Or visit the website at http://sanjuanskyway.com.
 &HT;    
 DAY ONE  
 &HT;    Ouray, located in a red-walled canyon, was the first stop. It
was late afternoon, and the pair's home for the night was the China
Clipper (800/315-0561), a new Victorian-style house on a hill. Many
steps led to the house, but they parked in back and entered on
ground level where their room was located.
 &HT;    Morning found them hiking to Box Canyon Falls, on the edge of
town. There, they enjoyed a breath-taking of Ouray and its majestic
surrounding peaks. Later, they took a jeep tour of nearby back
roads.
 &HT;    
 DAY TWO  
 &HT;    The Million Dollar Highway _ a continuation of U.S. 550 on the
Skyway _ led them to Silverton which lies at 9,318 feet in a
caldera of a dormant volcano. This former mining town boasts a
summer-population of 550, and a stalwart winter population of less
than 225. Nearby, Old 100 Mine and Mayflower Gold Mill are
worthwhile tours.
 &HT;    On the National Register of Historic Places, the Wyman Hotel
(800/609-7845) has been lovingly restored. However, Dunlop and
Foster discovered the building's pipes and plumbing were less than
silent and highly recommend ear plugs, unless you like the sound of
people showering at 5 a.m.
 &HT;    To take the historic narrow-gauge train between Silverton and
Durango, Dunlop and Foster rode a 7:30 a.m. bus to Durango, then
hopped the 9 o'clock train back t Silverton, arriving at 12:30. By
buying a ticket well in advance, riders can get a seat in a
restored, enclosed, turn-of-the-century car. But if the weather is
good, consider the open gondolas with their unobstructed views of
the Animas River and the bracing perfume of evergreens dotting the
nearby hills.
 &HT;    The Skyway between the Silverton and Durango offers more alpine
vistas. Red cliffs herald Durango on the edge of mountains, the
largest city in the San Juans, with its intriguing mix of
cosmopolitan and cowboy ambiance. South of town is Lightner Creek
Inn (800/268-9804), the movie City Slickers was filmed nearby.
North is Apple Orchard Inn (800/426-0751), with gardens and trout
ponds, and near Trimble Hot Springs for a relaxing soak.
 &HT;    
 TRIP TO TELLURIDE  
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster elected to visit Mesa Verde en route to
Telluride, taking U.S. 160 to the entrance to the park, where,
rather than worry about parking, they joined a tour of the kivas
and cliff dwellings, lunching at Farview Lodge.
 &HT;    Colorado Route 145 carried them through flat sage lands, slowly
climbing along the Dolores River to the short road into 8,745-foot
high Telluride, another box canyon, with only one way in or out.
Snow peaks rise above the end of Colorado Avenue, the main street.
A sky-blue Victorian, the Alpine Inn (800/707-3344), was their home
that night, where the breakfast sun room looks out on the new
gondola.
 &HT;    The gondola, absolutely free, takes passengers to a corral of
picnic tables and a noontime barbecue, then goes over the mountain
to the posh ski resort, Mountain Village.
 &HT;    On a history tour of town, Dunlop and Foster learned there are
350 miles of mountain tunnels. It was here that Butch Cassidy
robbed his first bank with such successful results, he made bank
robbery his full-time career.
 &HT;    Continuing northwest from Telluride, at Sawpit they tooled up a
steep gravel road to a broad valley for some smashing views of the
San Juan peaks across a meadow of lupines. The road came out onto
CO 62, where they followed the designer fence of Ralph Lauren's
ranch to Ridgway, the site of beautiful Chipeta Sun Lodge, a spa.
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster's adventurous excursion shows just how easy it
is to discover travel treasures _ right in our own backyards.

 &HT;    'Political football' hurdles keep Coke from pushing scrum of
Cadbury-Schweppes buy through
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coca-Cola's $1.85 billion agreement to purchase
Cadbury Schweppes' brands outside the United States is turning into
an unanticipated game of ``political football,'' a high-ranking
Cadbury official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the regulatory hurdles preventing the deal from winning
approval in certain countries have been caused by the intensifying
trade disputes between the United States and Europe, said John
Brock, managing director of global beverages for Cadbury Schweppes.
He spoke to reporters about the issue Thursday at the Beverage
Forum/99 conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola wants to buy Cadbury brands in 120 countries,
excluding the United States, France and South Africa. Those brands
include Dr Pepper and Canada Dry, as well as Schweppes' mixers. But
the initial deal has been rejected by antitrust regulators in
Mexico, Australia and Belgium. The companies have submitted a
revised agreement in Australia and hope to do the same in Mexico
and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   On deck are regulators in Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and
Italy. What's more, the European Union is scrutinizing the deal,
even though Coca-Cola and Cadbury question its jurisdiction in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   While Brock said Cadbury and Coca-Cola expected regulatory
problems, he acknowledged there have been ``more questions than
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is turning into a political football, not just a
regulatory situation,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Randal Donaldson, however, did not agree.
``We would be surprised to know that the Coca-Cola-Cadbury
Schweppes deal is part of any political debate between the European
Union and the U.S. government,'' Donaldson said later in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts attending the conference blamed
Coca-Cola for fumbling its relationships with regulators in some
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the deal, which was announced last December, is
taking longer to consummate than expected. In fact, it could close
in stages, with Coca-Cola acquiring Cadbury brands in some
geographic areas with others to follow later, said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he still expected the deal to ultimately win
regulatory approval. So does Coca-Cola. Five of about 20 nations
that require such approval have given it so far.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, expect the deal to have a rough time in about
10 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement must be approved by regulators in ``key markets''
for the overall deal to be completed, Brock said. He would not
identify those markets. But, for example, out of 600 million cases
sold annually by Cadbury outside the United States, 91 million are
sold in Mexico, Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current obstacles, Brock remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll do a mega-deal with Coke,'' he said. But if the
regulators sink the agreement, ``there are plenty of other deals to
do,'' he said. ``The cash that would come from it isn't necessary
for us to go out and do the transactions down the road we'd like to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock said Cadbury agreed to the deal with Coca-Cola because of
the ``significant premium'' the Atlanta-based company was willing
to pay. The premium amounts to 20 times cash flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brock said, the brands will get increased
exposure because of Coca-Cola's vast distribution network around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal for Coke,'' he said. ``The brands will
certainly fly.''

   HONOLULU _ As the wind rose and the surf boiled and the last
light leached from the wide sky over Waikiki on Wednesday night,
Charlie Lambert, a prince of old Hawaii, went home to the waves he
loved.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, who died last month at 73 after battling emphysema and
a bad heart, made his living as a sales and convention manager for
the big waterfront hotels here. But for six years in the early
1950s _ and spiritually for the rest of his life _ he was a Waikiki
beach boy, among the last of a vanishing, century-old breed of
Hawaiian originals, part Sherpa, part big-game guide, part maitre
d' for the wealthy travelers who discovered these islands before
the age of jet travel and made this slender stretch of sand an
international playground.
</P>
<P>
   Charles David Kanaina Lambert, a rakish rogue who in old
photographs looks like a cross between Peter Lawford and William
Holden, could boogie with the best of them. He gave John Wayne a
surfing lesson and paddled an outrigger canoe for Frank Sinatra and
Ava Gardner on their honeymoon, with Sinatra's friend Sam Giancana
in tow. Like his brother beach boys, he put out towels and chairs
and umbrellas for the swells, often with a yellow plumeria blossom
tucked seductively behind his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that a knot of graying elders, along with some
buffed and tanned successors to the trade, came together at a
slate-gray sunset amid a parade of passing tourists to help
Lambert's family paddle his ashes out to sea _ to the spot the
beach boys call ``first break,'' where the blue Pacific curls up
into foaming white surf in sight of the shore. These funerals are
the most cherished ritual of Waikiki culture and are practiced with
precision, from the long green ti leaves tucked along the gunwales
of the outrigger canoe to the fragrant leis of white ginger
blossoms tossed onto the water with the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was so Hawaii for me,'' his daughter Cindy, who now
lives in Los Angeles, told the group of mourners clustered together
against a sudden shower, her voice catching as she struggled to
control her emotions. ``I said, `Dad, when you die, where do I look
for you?' He said, `Put your feet in the water and I'll kiss your
toes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The beach boys were the crack troops that made Waikiki work in
the lazy days before World War II, when there were just two grand
hotels on the beach (the Moana and the Royal Hawaiian), when the
travelers came by steamship and dispensed $100 tips, and when
``Aloha'' was a gracious way of life and not a commercial slogan.
Beginning at the turn of the century, these watermen revived
surfing and canoe racing, the ancient sports of Hawaiian kings that
had been all but stamped out by Calvinist missionaries, who
complained that such pursuits encouraged nudity and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A true beach boy's life really revolved around the ocean and
his relationship to it,'' said Grady Timmons, a former sportswriter
for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and author of ``Waikiki Beachboy,''
a 1989 coffee table book to which Lambert contributed. ``That is
why the funeral is so significant. You're taking the beach boy back
to the one thing that's a constant. Waikiki has changed a lot over
the years, but the ocean is still there. He's returning to his
friends. Most of them are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's on-shore friends all attested to his qualities of
grace, and he apparently came by them naturally. Of mixed Hawaiian
and ``haole,'' or Caucasian, heritage, he traced his lineage to the
line of King Lunalilo and was a great-grandson of Queen
Lili'uokalani, the islands' last monarch, who was overthrown by the
United States in 1893. He was friends with all the greats of the
beach, including Duke Kahanamoku, the Jazz Age Olympic swimming
champion who was regarded as the father of international surfing
and was godfather to another of Lambert's three daughters, Lisa, an
antiques dealer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie was a gentleman, really special, old school,'' said
Claire Heen Cameron, Miss Hawaii of 1953, who with her friend
Sandra Lee-Song held exquisitely scented gardenia blossoms in
tribute to Lambert's practice of handing them out ``to every lady
he saw,'' in his days as a public relations official for the Royal
Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth in tourism that brought a new kind of
discount traveler to Waikiki took its toll on the old beach boys'
suave style as a new breed of freelance competitors brought an air
of cutthroat hustle. By 1959, the television host Arthur Godfrey, a
Waikiki regular, branded the beach ``a Coney Island with palm
trees,'' and his outburst led to licensing requirements and tests
for lifesaving and water skills that remain in force today.
</P>
<P>
   Waikiki may no longer be the favored retreat of Hollywood stars
and captains of commerce, and beach boys may no longer strum
ukuleles at sunset, but the tradition continues in its way, in a
place where surf boards are lined up outside the Elks Club.
</P>
<P>
   At Lambert's funeral, Harry S. Robello, at 81 perhaps the dean
of the old school, stood at the edge of the crowd, quietly
appraising the proceedings. But his son, Harry D. Robello, 37, the
owner of Aloha Beach Service, the oldest concession on the beach,
was right in the thick of things, supervising the launching of the
funeral canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' the younger Robello said of his life, as his
9-year-old son, Ryan, the next generation in training, scampered
around him on the sand. ``You live day to day. You're never going
to make a great living. But you have a great life.''

 &HT;    Gene Sarazen: 97 years of a wonderful habit
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somehow or another, I guess I'd never thought of the
world without Gene Sarazen in it. But, after 97 years, we're going
to have to try to get used to being without him. He died in a
hospital in Florida yesterday morning, and this old planet is all
the poorer for it. Not that any of us should be surprised at the
loss of a man nearly a century old, but a 97-year habit isn't easy
to break.
</P>
<P>
   This is the column you've dreaded writing. Inevitable, yes, but
there was something about ``The Squire'' that bespoke permanence.
You never felt age when you were around him. His good humor, his
ready smile, his love affair with golf took care of that. He stood
on the first tee at Augusta National on a dampish Thursday morning
last month and took probably his last swing at a golf ball. There
was no surrender in him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the perfect word to describe him, try
``gentleman.'' There was never a more genteel player in the game.
Oh, I'm certain he could turn a fiery phrase or two when he was of
whippersnapper age, but let me tell you, he had a tough row to hoe,
this little Italian kid trying to muscle in on Walter Hagen, Jim
Barnes, Tommy Armour and the big guns of the time. Barnes was the
only player I never heard him speak well of. Barnes had chased him
off the tee in a practice round before the U.S. Open in 1922, a
tournament that Gene would win later that week at the age of 20.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the PGA Championship that year, and again in 1923
and 10 years later. He won the U.S. Open again in 1932, the British
Open the same year, and in 1935 the Masters, first player to win
the four professional majors. It was in the Masters that he struck
what probably is still the most famous golf shot in history, the
double eagle on the 15th hole that forced a playoff he won the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 71, he made his last appearance in competition,
the British Open at Troon, and he still had one more glorious shot
left in his bag. He aced the Postage Stamp hole the first day, the
next day holed out from a bunker for a birdie. That was four
strokes better than Arnold Palmer on the same hole the same two
days.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all history stuff. What Sarazen brought to golf could
not always be measured by the score. As his dear friend Don Panoz
said, ``Sportsmanship, integrity, high standards, strong will and
determination.'' Panoz had just visited his bedside in Florida,
held his hand _ ``his grip was still strong'' _ but he knew the end
was near.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz created the Sarazen World Open to call attention to a man
professional golf seemed to have forgotten. He beat the World Tour
to the draw. He turned The Legends at Chateau Elan into a virtual
shrine to Sarazen. Unfortunately, the PGA Tour didn't share Panoz's
high regard for this pioneer who stood for all the good in golf,
and the Sarazen was wiped out in the new World Tour upheaval. In
February, a letter arrived announcing that the Sarazen World Open
office was officially closed. Within a few months, the tournament
and the man both died.
</P>
<P>
   He was the son of a carpenter named Federico Saraceni, and
changed his name because, he said, ``It sounded more like a
violinist than a golfer.'' He had high times with movie stars,
statesmen, tycoons and mugs, and on the other extreme, found time
to farm and make money at it. And as for the wealth the present-day
professionals enjoy, Sarazen has never uttered an envious word.
</P>
<P>
   He did say a couple of years ago, ``I was checking down the list
of money-winners on the tour last year. The player who ranked 169th
made more than I did in my whole career.'' He never snarled or
sobbed, he laughed. His kind of wealth could not be measured in
money.
</P>
<P>
   No column can properly do justice to Gene Sarazen. Just say
this: The man is dead, but the legend and his legacy shall never
die.

ACCUSTOMED TO TURMOIL, RUSSIANS TAKE LATEST CRISIS IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There was a lot of smoke but little debate Thursday in
the employees lounge at the Master and Margarita Hair Salon on
Moscow's busy Garden Ring Road, as two women hairdressers
reluctantly discussed Moscow's latest political crisis during a
cigarette break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What news?'' said Violetta Alekseyevna, a dark-haired
50-year-old, pausing between puffs to consider her views on the
sudden dismissal of former Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov. ``We
have crises all the time. The government changes all the time. What
leader has ever given me anything, anyway? I live in a village
outside of Moscow, where we don't have gas, or running water.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door in the women's salon, Lena Kovalyova, a 29-year old
client who was having her long blond hair blow dried, shrugged off
talk of a pending vote to impeach President Boris Yeltsin. As far
as she was concerned, none of this week's turbulent events could
hold a handle to the financial collapse of Last August.
</P>
<P>
   Now that, she said, was a real crisis. ``In August, I was upset,
now I'm not,'' she said. ``Then we were all jumping, now we are
not. This doesn't affect common people. If prices go up, it is
unpleasant, but nothing depends on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting used to political crises is now part of the
post-Communist Russian experience. After the attempted coup of
1991, the shelling of the parliament in 1993, the three turnovers
in government in the last 14 months seems tame by comparison. And
Yeltsin's epic battles with his Communist opposition in parliament
have become background noise for many citizens who are still trying
to figure what role they have in Russia's imperfect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an unclear situation for seven years now,''
said Kirill Kaminsky, 24. ``What can I say? I don't think there
will be a big collapse this time, but even if there is one, people
won't go out onto the streets. People don't pay attention to such
things anymore. They go on with their business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last several months, poll after poll have shown Primakov
to be Russia's most trusted politician and most people interviewed
after his dismissal Wednesday, agreed that he was worthy of
respect. ``He was decent,'' said Nadezhda, a 29-year-old
hairdresser at another Moscow hair salon. ``That is why they got
rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been shocked by the situation we have been seeing for
some time,'' noted Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta,
a Moscow daily, interviewed on a radio talk show. ``There is no
confidence in anyone, first of all Yeltsin. Only the government and
Primakov had the people's confidence. Let us wait and see if the
people come out on the streets in support of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Echo Mosky, the same radio station, asked listeners to
call in to say whether they were ready to protest Primakov's
ouster, only 26 percent of 3,4000 callers said they would. ``Not
under any circumstances will I go out on the street,'' said one
elderly woman. ``What's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that people are indifferent, or that they aren't
worried. Several people talked about their uncertainties, even
fears for the future, about their uneasy feeling that this kind of
political instability can not continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that things not get worse, but my opinion is
that something bad will happen,'' said Sveltana Makutdinova, who
sells bread at the Victor Market, a popular neighborhood grocery
store. ``The ruble will go down again, and price will go up. I
think people's patience is almost exhausted. Everyone is on edge.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tatyan Norkina, a 52-year-old employee at the state
Committee for Land Resources, the worst is never knowing what to
expect. ``Whenever a new minister has to be appointed, we don't
work for a time,'' she said. ``Our ministries keep being united,
then divided. First our committee belongs to one ministry, then
another. We move from one building to another. Right now is sowing
season, but we won't be able to work. We don't have the laws in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blame Yeltsin, others blame his advisers. ``I think all
this is the result of Yeltsin's inability to rule the country and
of his fear of competition,'' said Sergei, a 34-year old banker.
``A great deal is done not by him, but by his circle which is
looking for its own dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   All these are disturbing thoughts for people trying to get by on
meager salaries, holding down prices _ a haircut at the Master and
Margarita costs the equivalent of $2.50 _ in order not to lose
customers. ``We don't talk about politics with our clients,'' said
Ms. Alekseyeva. ``We exchange anecdotes or funny situations. People
have so many burdens. They come to the salon to relax, not to solve
global problems.''

 &HT;    Sarazen, Masters had 44-year love affair
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gene Sarazen's ``shot heard 'round the world'' in 1935
put the Masters on the map and ``The Squire'' into the history
books. Sarazen didn't see the ball drop into the hole on his double
eagle at No. 15, but he heard the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The applause continued for the next 44 years each time Sarazen
set foot on Augusta National Golf Course, where he served as an
honorary starter since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen, who died of pneumonia Thursday at age 97, made his
final appearance at the Masters last month, teeing off with fellow
legends Sam Snead and Byron Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene was a pioneer participant in the Masters tournament and
held a special relationship with Augusta National Golf Club,'' club
chairman Hootie Johnson said in a statement. ``We will miss him
very much next year on the first tee. He was a great champion and
ambassador for golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sarazen Bridge, a footbridge across the 15th-hole pond
dedicated in his honor in 1955, serves as a tangible reminder of
the shot Grantland Rice called the greatest in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen staged the first comeback in Augusta history _ it was
only the second year of the tournament, then known simply as an
invitational for Bobby Jones' friends.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen was on the 14th green when Craig Wood birdied 18 to take
a three-shot lead. Jones already had drawn up a winner's check for
Wood. According to golf lore, Sarazen's playing partner, Walter
Hagen, turned to him and said, ``Well, I guess that's it, isn't
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sarazen replied, ``I'm not so sure. Some magic can drop from
anywhere.'' Sarazen hit a 4-wood 220 yards _ and got a 2. The ball
flew over the pond, bounced once, rolled to the pin and disappeared
before about two dozen people, including Jones. Sarazen parred the
final three holes, forcing a 36-hole playoff. On a cold, wet
Monday, he beat Wood by five strokes to earn $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about,''
Sarazen later recalled, ``but I take my greatest pride in having
won the U.S. and British Opens in the same year, 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, 'That's the man who got
the double eagle. Actually, it was just a piece of luck. They
forget the championships I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen became the first golfer to win all four majors. To his
colleagues, he was not only a great champion, but a treasured
friend.
</P>

   Ken Venturi lived near Sarazen on Marco Island, Fla., and they
played golf and socialized together.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Venturi hosted a tournament that was a tribute to
his late wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sarazen said, 'I'll be there,' and he sat on the first tee
under an umbrella for four hours,'' Venturi said. ``He said he
wouldn't leave because he thought the world of my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after the Masters, Sarazen asked Venturi if he was thinking
of holding another tournament. ``I said, 'No, I couldn't make an
encore, I couldn't duplicate it,''' Venturi said. ``And he said,
'Well I probably won't be here next year anyway.'''

   PHOENIX - Have you ever wondered why you never heard of Arizona
sweet onions before there was a festival to promote them? Well,
here's the deal: Arizona sweet onions are not new. Onions grown in
Arizona (begin ital) always (end ital) have been sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural sources say the alkaline soil abundant in Arizona
minimizes production of sulfur, the component that gives rise to
the sting of onions, the reason eyes tear as you chop into onion
cells.
</P>
<P>
   So, how come Arizona onions aren't as famous as their
counterparts from Vidalia, Walla Walla and Maui, to name three
locations whose names are associated with sweet onions?
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Gablin and a large host of volunteer onion enthusiasts
have their way, Grand Canyon Sweet Onions someday may be known as
well as the Texas 1015s and other premium sweet-onion brand names.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Arizona Sweet Onions will be sold in 10-pound bags
for $5 at the 11th annual Sweet Onion Festival at the Rock Springs
Cafe near New River.
</P>
<P>
   Gablin's homemade onion ice cream, made from slowly caramelized
sweet onions and lots of real cream, is a revelation he serves to
curious visitors at his home in Sun City, Ariz. So, how did a
retired entrepreneur get to call himself the King of Sweet Onions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I held my hand up and volunteered one day,'' Gablin said.
</P>
<P>
   An herb enthusiast whose dad's Victory Garden in World War II
was as big as a city block, Gablin had been through the Master
Gardener training at the University of Arizona's Cooperative
Extension Service in Maricopa County. He had worked in the booth at
a sweet-onion festival one year with other master gardeners, who
answered plant and bug questions from the public.
</P>
<P>
   A year and many hours of marketing expertise later, Gablin
became the festival's coordinator and probably the state's premier
expert on the dry-onion crop. The non-profit Grand Canyon Sweet
Onion Corp. was formed to facilitate onion promotion. Gov. Jane Dee
Hull has proclaimed May Grand Canyon Sweet Onion Festival Month.
Like a Johnny Onionseed, Gablin (and the master gardeners) have
given away hundreds of packets of onion seeds and sets at events
and in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants free onion seeds, we'll give them to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most people know what a sweet onion is,'' Gablin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it's an onion sweet enough to bite into like an
apple.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through fields in western Maricopa County planted in
onions, grapes, wheat, corn, roses, artichokes and subdivisions,
Gablin said he envisions a time when onions are grown at all
elevations in the state, so they mature at different times and
extend the spring harvest season of six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is one of the only places you could have sweet onions
from April to October,'' Gablin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dry-onion seeds are planted at desert elevations in October (the
1015 name of Texas sweets refers to their planting date) and
harvested from late April to early June. At higher elevations,
onions are planted as sets and harvested around Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   To get growing, onions are irrigated by sprinklers or
underground tapes in laser-leveled fields. The onion grows in a
curious way: The top of the bulb emerges from the ground as it
swells from the size of a golf ball up to the 4-inch colossal size
sometimes grown for the restaurant blooming onion. When the midline
equator of the onion emerges, the onion is about ready to be
harvested. Irrigation is cut off a couple weeks before harvest
time.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest-crew supervisor Pete Chavez said that when the green
tops of the onions fall over, the onions are ready. Crews flatten
the tops, then flip over the onions, which are left in the field
for five or six days to dry. Chavez supervises 60 to 80 people
clipping onions in a 40-acre field. ``You have to let Mother Nature
take her course,'' Chavez said. ``Take them out too early and
you'll get new growth, and then they'll shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez loves a chopped onion with tomato, cilantro and lemon. He
held up a medium-size union and said, ``This is the best onion for
families. You use it all up in one recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Onions are graded in the field by size, not sweetness. There is
no sugar standard for sweetness in onions as there is for
cantaloupes and melons in Arizona, said Joe Grencevicz, field
supervisor for citrus fruit and vegetable standardization in the
state's Department of Agriculture. His job is to assure the quality
of produce grown here and coming in from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Grencevicz said, ``as far as the state goes, there is no
standard that says, `This is a sweet onion.' But in Arizona, we do
grow a sweet onion. It's just never been marketed as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Grencevicz said he's tasted an Arizona onion next to
a Vidalia onion, ``and you can't tell the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Green onions are grown in Arizona, too, but sweet onions fall
into the category known technically as dry onions. Arizona ranks
fourth nationally in dry spring onion production, after Texas,
California and Georgia, said Lloyd Brown of the state Agriculture
Department Public Information Office.
</P>
<P>
   Grencevicz said, ``Onions always have been a very stable crop in
the state of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers may be going up. In 1997, 2,100 acres of dry
onions were grown here, compared with 1,400 acres in 1993, Brown
said. The crop was worth $9.4 million in 1997, the most recent
statistics available. Like any food crop, the market value each
year can fluctuate due to weather and to yields from other U.S.
onion-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
   From the field, the onions go into 50-pound bags, which for
festival and marketing purposes are broken down into 10-pound bags.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, people come to the onion festival, open their car
trunks, and say ``fill it up,'' Gablin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common festival questions Gablin hears is ``What
am I going to do with 10 pounds of onions?'' His wife, Trula,
points out that if you make only an onion pie and French onion
soup, that'll use up the entire bag. Or you can try the recipes we
offer today.
</P>
<P>
   Dry onions store best in a cool, dry area. The best
untraditional way to store sweet onions is to put them in the legs
of old pantyhose, knotted in between each onion. Hang up the hose
legs when they're full, and cut off one onion at a time to use
them. This lets the air circulate and keeps them fresher longer. &QL;

 &HT;    Retirees protest Sears annual meeting
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For some veterans of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., retirement
has been anything but peaceful. On Thursday, angry retirees came
from across the nation to draw attention to their quarrel with the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a bagpipe player, about 60 Sears retirees waved signs
and marched in front of the Merchandise Mart on Peachtree Street to
protest a cut in life insurance benefits. Afterward, they went
inside to the company's annual meeting and peppered Chairman and
Chief Executive Arthur Martinez with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta protest is part of a nationwide fight by thousands
of retirees who are trying to restore the value of life insurance
policies cut by Sears in 1997. Sears reduced company-paid life
insurance benefits from an average of $17,000 to $5,000 as part of
a cost-cutting effort. The cut, which affected 84,000 retirees, has
spurred hundreds of protests nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears, which has battled consumer
lawsuits and financial trouble in recent years, said the cuts were
needed to keep the company competitive. Sears said it was spending
almost twice as much as other retailers on retiree benefits and has
no plans to back off its decision.
</P>
<P>
   While the continued protests have become an irritant to Sears,
the larger issue of how far a company must go to honor commitments
to retired employees is being watched closely by other businesses.
Sears maintains that when times get tough, commitments to retirees
are subject to cutbacks, just like any other expense. So far, the
courts have tended to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going against retailers like Home Depot, so it was clear
we had to do something,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur
Martinez. ``Home Depot and other young companies are not burdened
financially with a large retiree health care or life insurance
plan, and that enables them to be much more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the impact on retirees, Sears is phasing the
reduction over 10 years and is subsidizing replacement insurance
that doesn't require a physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   The retirees have taken their fight to court. In January, a U.S.
District Court in Illinois granted class-action status to a lawsuit
against Sears filed by a former store manager. At issue in the suit
is whether Sears misled its employees about lifetime benefits.
Sears insists it consistently communicated to employees it had the
right to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Sears isn't the only company to battle angry retirees in recent
years. Many large corporations have changed their retiree health
benefits because of rising costs and changes in accounting rules.
Consequently, federal courts have seen a rash of cases over retiree
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings have been mixed so far. Campbell Soup Co. and Walt
Disney Co. settled cases stemming from retiree benefit cuts. Last
year, General Motors Corp. won a court battle to change its retiree
health care benefits even though it had promised lifetime benefits
to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the court finds in favor of an employer if the
company reserves the right to change benefits,'' said Bruce Palmer,
chairman of the department of risk management and insurance at
Georgia State University. ``The variety of court opinions is a
reflection of each company's contract language. The big issue here
is that employees need to know what their plan documents say.''

   The New York Times plans two pages of stories, photos and

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GERMANY (Bielefeld, Germany) _ In a clear sign of the
strains placed on Germany's governing coalition by the Kosovo
conflict, the environmentalist Green party today broke ranks with
its Social Democratic partners and other Western governments by
calling for a ``limited halt'' to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
The Greens, in a stormy and bitterly divisive one-day congress,
rejected a motion calling for an immediate and unconditional
termination of the NATO bombing, a measure that would probably have
brought down the government of the Social Democratic chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ Acknowledging that Americans were
impatient with the pace of NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia,
President Clinton on Thursday warned against ``refugee fatigue,''

executed, raped and systematically routed from their homes. By

   KOSOVO-CHINA-PRESS (Beijing) _ On the role the Chinese media
played in reaction to embassy bombing. Its language was very
reminiscent of old days and many papers printed identical pages of
coverage. But how well and how long and on what issues can this
control really work in a society with access to the Internet and
other communication tools? For instance, at a Foreign Ministry
briefing today, the first question, from a Chinese reporter, was
why officials never mention Serbian ethnic cleansing. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA (Beijing) _ In an elaborate ceremony at the Great
Hall of the People, China's leaders bestowed the title of
``revolutionary martyr'' today on the three Chinese journalists
killed by NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
week. The ceremony conferring one of the Communist Party's highest
honors on the dead appeared intended to bring an emotional close to
the anti-American activity that took over Beijing in recent days, a
rare dovetailing of public sentiment and official purpose. By Seth
Faison.

   KOSOVO-RIGHTS (Belgrade ) _ Mary Robinson, the U.N. High

&HT;        FOUR KOSOVO REFUGEES SENT TO PENNSYLVANIA JAILS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 13 -- Four Kosovo refugees have wound up in
Pennsylvania jails, after being charged with using fake identities
to gain entry to the United States, immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the four arrived last week at Fort Dix, N.J., immigration
officials realized their names didn't match identification photos
taken in Macedonia, said Carl Rusnok a spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service's Philadelphia regional
office.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, aged 21 and 22 are being held in Carbon County
prison, and a 22-year-old Kosovo woman is in York County prison. A
17-year-old Kosovo girl has been taken to the Berks County youth
center, Rusnok said. Officials will not release their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people claimed to be somebody they weren't,'' Rusnok
said. ``Right now we don't know why they used fake identities. I
can't make comments on whether they had criminal records in their
own country or if they were participating in the atrocities in
Kosovo. That's all part of the investigation. We only know they
made it here under false pretenses and the system worked.''
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting immigration hearings to determine if they can
remain in the country, the four refugees have been sent to
``dormitory portions'' of the jail where they are separated from
the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The four refugees were in the second wave of ethnic Albanians
who arrived at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey on Friday,
immigration officials said. The U.S. has agreed to take in 20,000
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials announced the adoption of a tightened
screening process to keep participants of the atrocities in Kosovo
from being accepted into the country along with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, INS officials received special training on how to
identify criminals who may be living among the refugee population.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for The United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the group may provide legal assistance to the four
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy they made it here, escaped the war and
persecution,'' said Panos Moumtzis, a UNHCR spokesman. ``Then they
end up in jail. They have gone through a terrible time and we would
like to see this resolved. But it has been made quite clear that
they were supposed to provide the most complete and accurate
information about their identities. We are still learning details
of the case.''

empty stomach. Her work might have you taking a bite out of a
T-shirt or a pair of briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Sardi is a fiber artist whose themes revolve around food. Her
current exhibition at the Barlow &AMP; Straker gallery in Phoenix
simulates a marketplace where bundles of fabric slathered in
barbecue sauce resemble a butcher counter, surgical gauze dyed in
ketchup and wine look like chicken parts, and casings of nylon hose
stuffed with cloth suggest strings of sausages and salamis.
</P>
<P>
   Bring along a yen for unconventional art and a bottle of Tums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food, the subject matter, has been treated at all times in
art,'' says Sardi, a native of Caracas, Venezuela, who has just
earned her master's degree in art from Arizona State University in
Tempe. I use food as a metaphor for many things. It works. It's
connected through emotions. It's a very wide subject that can be
explored from many angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardi's master's thesis was an installation titled ``Cravings,''
displayed recently at ASU. The exhibit included the butcher
counter, which sent up waves of barbecue aroma as visitors walked
through the door; Jockey briefs coated with caramelized sugar;
hundreds of rolls of socks dipped in wax to look like bonbons and
cinnamon rolls; the hanging wall of ``sausages''; the chicken
parts; a wall of fabric bundles dipped in caramelized sugar and
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who signed the exhibit's guest book left tasty
comments:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravo!!! Stinky Stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty ripe, but I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensual delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sardi's exhibit has been retitled ``Leftovers'' and is
featured at the new Barlow &AMP; Straker gallery.
</P>
<P>
   To purists who crave a Monet or a Rembrandt, Sardi's works will
not be their cup of tea. But food and art are in the eyes of the
beholder. Sardi believes viewers can relate to artwork that evokes
their last meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food can trigger a dream or a memory,'' she says, calling her
exhibit ``an experience of the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tactile experience . . . I want them to experience
as if they're in a market, a suggestion of something that can bring
up memories because of the smell.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Sardi studied film and theater. Eight years ago,
she took a job at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
working as an assistant to the press counselor and cultural
attache.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Arizona on vacation, she decided to finish her
studies at ASU, impressed with the wide range of the art school's
curriculum, including courses in wood, metal, fibers, photography
and other art media. Sardi initially planned to study photography
and painting. But a class in fiber art taught by Clare Verstegen
persuaded her that textiles were her medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very prone to surfaces and textures,'' Sardi says. ``There
was a place for me to work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining fibers and food seemed a natural: ``I enjoy food. I
love to eat and I love to eat well.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan cuisine includes plenty of meat, rice and beans, and
fruits such as plantains. It has been influenced heavily by
Caribbean foods and such European countries as Spain, Italy and
Germany, Sardi says.
</P>
<P>
   When she and her ASU friends get together for a potluck, she
sometimes contributes Chupe, a chicken soup with vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Food is an integral part of culture, Sardi believes. It
celebrates joyful moments and comforts the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can give you a lot of pleasure,'' she says. ``It not only
fills a biological necessity. It's not just fuel for survival, but
other necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she notes, the act of eating becomes the act of
gluttony. In her artist's statement for the ``Cravings''
exhibition, Sardi says, ``Sugar, creamy, buttery and salty
confections seduce us for immediate pleasure. Sometimes, we cannot
stop devouring until gluttony rises to the level of intoxication.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether her audience sips a little of her exhibit or becomes
intoxicated, Sardi believes her work ``turned out really good.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it's dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a table stacked with blood-red
representations of meat cuts, she acknowledges that the work can
evoke strong feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could attract you or repel you,'' she says. ``It turns out
to be provocative.'' &QL;

 &HT;    ARMY PILOTS IN ALBANIA WALK THIN LINE BETWEEN GALLANTRY AND
DEATH DAILY
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    ATTN EDs: Due to security concerns cited to Cox Newspapers, the
Army would not allow the use of Johnny's last name or military
handle in this story.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWK BASE, Albania _ The urgent warning from ``Woot'' cracked
across the intercom, cutting through the thudding sound of the
helicopter blades that had just lifted the 25,000-pound Chinook and
its cargo, thousands of pounds of gasoline, off the ground:
``Suspected fuel leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny, the pilot, could smell it, too. He ordered his flight
engineer to quickly check the craft's fittings as the Chinook
hovered only a few feet above the ground. ``Woot'' found a puddle
of liquid on the floor of the chopper. It smelled ``like gas,'' he
said, but he couldn't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than abort the mission, Johnny rolled the dice. He lifted
the Chinook and its cargo higher into the air and headed out for a
night-time refueling rendezvous with his brothers in arms, the
pilots of Apache gunships, the ``spear point'' for any NATO ground
assault against Serb forces in embattled Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a training mission Wednesday night, but to have
aborted would have been, in Johnny's words, ``a show stopper,'' a
period of down time that would have denied the Apache pilots some
valuable time practicing for a lethal push into threatening terrain
occupied by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Johnny's Chinook was able to reach its
destination and his crew roll out hoses from its cargo, the ``Fat
Cow'' bladder of gasoline, just seconds before the Apache gunships
descended vampire-like in the night to suck up the precious fluid
for their continued flight.
</P>
<P>
   The incident at takeoff also underscored how dangerous even
training missions are in this area near the Kosovo frontier -- how
thin the line is between duty and getting blown up. And it
illustrated the many and varied sources of inspiration for the
troops involved in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision had to be made -- I played the odds on,'' Johnny
said Thursday after having completed the training exercise without
incident or harm to his aircraft and the several dozen paratroopers
riding shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, his craft could have been leaking fuel, but the puddle of
liquid ``Woot'' found could also have been water, he calculated.
``I knew they had just washed the airplane that day, and so I was
hoping it was water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny told the entire crew to stay on the lookout for any fuel
leak as he rumbled across the Albanian terrain to meet up with the
Apaches. If any of them started feeling ``uncomfortable'' with the
circumstances of the mission, he told them, he wanted to know
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll call the mission there,'' he explained. ``But I don't
want to call it when you cannot give me a definite, 'Hey, I got a
fuel leak; I've got my hand in it.' I know what's going on and this
is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   When soldiers fly with Johnny, ``they have the right to speak
up,'' he explained later. ``That doesn't mean I'm going to listen
to them. That doesn't mean I'm going to take their advice. But if
they are uncomfortable with something, they should damn sure speak
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny -- military censors would only allow the media to use his
first name, say he's in his early 30s and is from Georgia -- has
been flying Chinooks nearly eight years, in Korea and at Hunter
Army Air Field, near Savannah, Ga. He was an instructor pilot with
the ``Big Windy'' Chinook unit in Germany before it was deployed to
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinook, long a U.S. Army fixture, was used for troop
transport in Vietnam, earning the nickname ``Jolly Green.'' But
with NATO reluctant to use ground forces in Kosovo, the Chinook is
helping to keep the Apache gunships flying.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Johnny's job is flying the ``Fat Cow,'' a big heavy metal
bladder that fits in the back of the Chinook. ``If you don't mind
me bragging, it is the biggest, the fastest and the strongest
aircraft the Army has,'' he says of his aircraft. ``And they give
us the mission because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's ``a pride thing going'' in the training exercises here,
Johnny admitted. That's one of the reasons he decided against
scrubbing Wednesday night's mission, even after ``Woot,'' the
nickname of his flight engineer, warned of a possible fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond pride, there is inspiration, something Johnny found
while growing up in Georgia. ``It was probably from those times
when I used to sneak into the University of Georgia stadium to
watch (football All-American) Herschel(CQ) Walker run,'' he said.

 &HT;    ALBANIA'S NEWEST, BIGGEST REFUGEE CAMP IS ALL-AMERICAN
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENA, Albania _ Two weeks ago, Dave Henrickson surveyed this
south Albanian plain and saw untilled farmland as far as he could
see.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, he saw the beginnings of a village _ just in
time.
</P>
<P>
   As Henrickson's crews scrambled to cut holes in the floors of
rough-hewn outhouses and dump gravel on roads alongside the neat
rows of dark green military tents, the buses came rumbling up.
</P>
<P>
   They carried the first residents of Camp Hope, which is being
built under contract from the U.S. military about 70 miles from the
Albanian capital, Tirana. With an ultimate capacity of 20,000
refugees, it is expected to be the biggest camp in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with the refugee crisis continuing, officials are looking
for land nearby to provide for as many as 60,000 Kosovar Albanians.
More than 400,000 refugees are in Albania, Europe's poorest
country, and government officials fear that number could swell to
more than 700,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the last Saturday in April, Henrickson was mowing his grass
at his home near Cape Canaveral, Fla., when his wife interrupted
him with a phone call. The next day, he was on a plane to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force had selected his company, RMS of Panama City, Fla.
-- a subsidiary of Johnson Controls -- to build the camp on short
order. He declined to give the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The site was on 160 acres of farmland far from the airport in
Tirana and the seaport in Durres. The roads to the site are little
more than joined organized potholes: It takes three kidney bruising
hours to drive the 70 miles from Tirana. It has no electricity or
water. But the site has a rare advantage in Albania: Its ownership
is discernible in a former communist
</P>
<P>
   state in which property issues often frustrate relief
organizations' efforts to assemble large parcels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call these things 'challenges' rather than
'problems,''' said Henrickson, sitting on the floor of one of the
empty tents, trying to escape the brilliant sunshine for a few
minutes. ``Some of the challenges have been interesting indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the land is rutted for agriculture. Seeking to make
the best of what the land provided, Henrickson's team decided to
put gravel in the ruts to encourage drainage. Unfortunately, in the
first heavy rain, the tents filled with water. The engineers
started over from scratch, raised the camp's surface and are
waiting anxiously for the next heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   The task was also complicated by the marching order that they
use local workers, contractors and materials. Consequently, RMS
engineers went door to door in the nearby town of Fier seeking
anyone who had a bulldozer, truck or knew anything about
construction. In some cases, they had to explain to local
construction companies such capitalistic concepts as competitive
bidding. More than 200 local workers were hired and between 25 and
30
</P>
<P>
   contracts were issued to local firms.
</P>
<P>
   They worked from dawn until dark. ``You know it's pitch black
out here after dark, and someone would have been hurt,'' he said.
When completed, the camp will offer more than 2,000 tents and a
subsistence living. There is a six-month lease on the site -- which
is renewable.
</P>
<P>
   The camp also will face a severe test at the end of this month.
Each spring for decades, this land has been flooded for irrigation.
This year, the flood is scheduled for May 28, but the engineers
hope to divert the water away from the refugees. Even so,
Henrickson said his team will be watching nervously when the
irrigation starts. ``We want to do this right,'' he said, ``or else
we'll have these people living in a mud hole.''
</P>
<P>
   When the buses arrived Thursday morning, the work pace
accelerated from frantic to frenzied. While Camp Hope still
appeared to be more construction site than village, officials said
it was ready enough, given the realities of life for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ready to the degree that it's better than sleeping on the
ground at Kukes,'' said Bob Kobayashi, the Air Force major
overseeing the project.
</P>
<P>
   By the look of the refugees, Camp Hope was a welcome site. One
man from the town of Pec in Kosovo, said his family had been at
Kukes seven days before coming to Fier where he waited three days
before being permitted to come to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp will accept an initial population of 2,500 refugees,
the limit of the daily water supply that can be provided by truck,
said Chris Sykes of Care International, the camp manager. In the
meantime, the engineers are struggling to find another way to
provide the 100,000 gallons a day the refugees will require.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll figure out something,'' said Henrickson, as he rose from
his shady break to get back to village building.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is concerned that Vice President
Al Gore's campaign to succeed him seems to be floundering,
according to several people close to the president. They say
Clinton has personally coached Gore on how to loosen up and appear
less remote and rigid on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   These people emphasized that Clinton, who views the election of
Gore as affirming his own legacy, is by no means alarmed about the
state of the campaign and, like most of the Democratic
establishment, still expects Gore to win his party's nomination.
For its part, the Gore campaign publicly insists that it is on
track, that is has broken fund-raising records and has nailed down
an impressive roster of endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who spoke with Clinton said he has privately
counseled Gore that he would better connect with voters if he tries
to relax _ and even have fun _ on the trail and does not fret that
he might make a mistake. They said he has also suggested that Gore
take a more informal approach by shedding his blue suit more
frequently, plunging into crowds, staying overnight with supporters
in Iowa and New Hampshire and trying to reduce his cumbersome
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is concerned,'' said one person who has spoken to Clinton
about Gore. ``You do not have the feeling that the Gore campaign is
moving in a positive, forceful, determined way to prepare
themselves. But he'll be the first one to tell you that this has a
long way to go and nobody should overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore came closest to publicly acknowledging the troubles by his
abrupt naming this week of Tony Coelho, the former House Democratic
whip, as his campaign chairman. Gore, who had been making many of
the day-to-day political decisions himself _ from his travel
schedule to topics for his speeches _ has relinquished that role to
Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who spoke directly to Clinton said the president
had urged Gore to turn over control. ``He thinks Gore needs to stop
worrying, he needs to look at the assets he's got, the story he's
got to tell the American people _ and focus on that,'' this person
said. ``He was one of the people who thought he shouldn't be
terribly concerned about who manages the thing on a day-to-day
basis and spend his time instead on what he says to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who discussed Clinton's concerns for this article included
people who are loyal to Gore and others who support his candidacy
but are not as devoted. The reasons they agreed to interviews _
only on condition of anonymity _ may be multi-faceted: to give a
complete picture of the president's position, to show themselves to
be in the know, and perhaps, to send a public message to the vice
president that he needs to make repairs quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The president has hardly been alone in his worries. A consensus
has emerged among prominent Democrats that the Gore campaign has
had a lackluster start for a variety of reasons: the quick and
unexpected rise of former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey as a
challenger; polls showing that Gore's popularity is not
particularly deep, that he may be damaged by Clinton's scandals and
that he would be easily defeated in a general election by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas or Elizabeth Dole; a sense that Gore has
deficient campaigning skills and has fumbled with gaffes such as
taking credit for inventing the Internet; a view that he has not
adequately articulated positions, and that he was trying to run his
campaign single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton monitors Gore's campaign appearances on television and
reads up on the campaign, according to one of the people who spoke
with Clinton. ``He's really into what's going on out there,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He, as well as many
Democrats, is concerned about the polls and that the campaign
seemed to be listless, lacking in enthusiasm. How many times did
you hear people saying there was just no excitement?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton's counsel, James Carville, the strategist
who is close to the president, said, ``I've heard the same thing,
and I think it's good advice.'' Carville added that the president
did not tell him of his conversations with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Gore's aides insist that the campaign is in far better
shape than many people think. They note that Vice President George
Bush had similar problems moving out of President Reagan's shadow
in the 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the front runner you have everybody, from
virtually every angle and every side taking their shots at you,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``But the bottom line is that
today the vice president is extremely strong. Our fund raising has
been immensely successful. To the extent that you believe in polls,
in the primaries we're exceedingly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore advisers concede that the vice president had hoped
to keep a low campaign profile throughout the summer but that the
spate of bad notices had led him to try to demonstrate momentum.
For example, the campaign had planned to put off Gore's formal
announcement of candidacy until toward the end of the year, if at
all. But now, Gore's advisers said, they have moved the date to
June or July.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also pumping resources into an aggressive
behind-the-scenes effort to assure that Gore has a respectable
showing against Bradley in a straw poll being conducted on Saturday
by the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Gore is so mindful of
catering to an important constituency that aides said he overruled
White House and State Department officials and agreed to give an
address to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee on May 23.
Administration officials had warned that it was risky to give the
speech then because the timing would be awkward after the Israeli
election and just before an expected runoff on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Gore advisers said concerns about his campaign also led Gore
to move fast in hiring Coelho. ``I was shocked when he called me,''
Coelho said of his telephone call from Gore last Wednesday. ``It
was totally out of the blue. But I don't sense any panic or
urgency. What people don't understand is that this is a start-up
business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in the vice president's residence on Tuesday, where
Gore introduced Coelho to his top advisers, several participants
said Coelho interrupted the vice president twice and and overruled
him on decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you're in charge,'' participants quoted Gore as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, a top aide to Clinton, said the president
believed that the addition of Coelho ``was a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, a range of Democratic politicians,
strategists and thinkers cautioned that not everything can be fixed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's closest advisers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was hopeful but not certain that Coelho would
force the vice president to stop micromanaging the campaign. ``The
important thing is not Tony,'' he said. ``The important thing is
that this may signal a willingness on his part to divorce himself
from the mechanics. One of the major problems has been that for
quite some time he has spent too much time being not only the
candidate but being the campaign.''

</P>
<P>
   At a closed-door meeting at the Democratic Party headquarters on
Wednesday, Gore's top advisers met with more than 50 House
Democrats to reassure them of the vice president's viability. Craig
Smith, the campaign manager, and others sought to make their case
by distributing polls showing that Gore still holds a sizable lead
over Bradley. But some House members registered a range of
concerns, including their fear that Gore was ignoring key party
constituencies, like minorities and unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we prefer to be 80 points up right now? Of course,''
said Rep. Bart Gordon of Tennessee, who helped organize the
session. ``But people recognize that the election is a year and a
half away and that we're well positioned and that there's going to
be an ugly Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is well known _ and often ridiculed _ for his uncomfortable
campaign style, but several politicians said the president's advice
sounded appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a natural inclination for a lot of Democrats to say,
`Is there anyone else?''' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is
close to Gore. ``And to look for excitement.'' He added, ``Al
Gore's a serious guy, and you've got to show people that you like
what you're doing and you like being out there with them and be
open and have a sense of humor, a sense of proportion. We don't
elect kings in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the president said he did not believe he should
play an active role in plotting campaign strategy, and that he has
resisted entreaties from some of his aides to involve himself more
directly in the Gore operation.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers said Hillary Rodham Clinton was also
worried about the Gore campaign, but not as focused on it as the
president. They noted that if Mrs. Clinton runs for Senate from New
York next year, her effort would suffer if Gore runs poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be happier if Gore were running well ahead of Bush?
The answer is, `Of course I would,''' said Al From, president of
the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group. ``I don't
think it's extraordinarily significant but I do think it's an early
warning sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon expressed confidence that once Democrats become realistic
about their expectations they will become more satisfied with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married last year,'' he said. ``I'm 49 years old, and I
went out with a variety of people. But when you get married, you're
not looking for a rock star. You're looking for, `Who do I want to
spend the rest of my life with?' Sooner or later, he said, ``people
might say, `I'm looking for someone who's dependable, someone who
understands the issues.'''

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ There is no diploma on the wall of Benson
Samay's law office. But there is something better _ photographs in
which he poses with influential government figures, the best
credential in Cambodia's corrupt and politicized judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Samay, 56, said he studied law in the United States but did not
earn a degree. He said he graduated from law school here in 1968,
seven years before the Khmer Rouge took power and destroyed
official records like those of universities.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1996, he lived in France and the United States,
where, he said, he worked as a legal assistant, returning here to
take up the practice of law for the first time just three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now Samay, with his pressed court officer's uniform and shock of
black-dyed hair, has become the most prominent lawyer in Cambodia.
He will defend Ta Mok, the first _ and so far the only _ Khmer
Rouge leader to face trial in the deaths of more than a million
people from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed that I would take this case, nor did I expect
to be involved in a Khmer Rouge trial,'' Samay said in an interview
in his well-appointed office. ``It was not an easy decision to
make. But I had a professional duty to accept the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok's hiring of Samay sight unseen raised eyebrows here, and
the selection remains puzzling to several experts. Samay represents
Hun Sen's governing Cambodian People's Party and has been an
adviser to top officials.
</P>
<P>
   His hiring in April was one of the first steps in a process that
has under fire, even before it began, as highly likely to be
professionally inadequate and politically skewed.
</P>
<P>
   The legal system is only beginning to be rebuilt after the
devastation of the Khmer Rouge years, in which virtually all
lawyers were executed. Legal aid groups describe the system as
corrupt and often unfair.
</P>
<P>
   In one telling statistic, 20 of 135 judges have college degrees,
a Justice Ministry official, Seng Syvutha, said recently. In
another indicator, Seng Syvutha said, judges often earn little more
than $10 a month, making them depend on payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile cases, including recent trials of rivals of Prime
Minister Hun Sen, have been stage managed to produce what legal
experts said were predetermined outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A domestic trial will not be fair, cannot reveal the truth and
does not serve the principles of justice and accountability,''
Amnesty International said in April, supporting a United Nations
call for a trial in an international court.
</P>
<P>
   Even the head of the Cambodian Bar Association, Ang Eng Thong,
commented shortly after Samay's selection, ``A Khmer Rouge trial in
Cambodia cannot be completely impartial, because there is too much
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Samay dismissed the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had any trouble like this,'' he said. ``Cambodia
should not be prejudiced and stereotyped. And, anyway, this trial
will be different. This will be different, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Samay's account of how Ta Mok chose him drew skepticism
recounted to a top official in the judiciary here. The official
said he believed that someone was ``playing games.'' Underscoring
the politicized nature of judicial affairs, the official insisted
on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After the two legal aid groups in the country rejected
government requests to supply a defense, arguing that Ta Mok, who
grew rich as a smuggler, did not need their services, the Bar
Association gave the defendant with a member's name.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok rejected the name, saying the candidate was too young and
asked instead for Samay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he read about me in the newspapers and he saw my
picture,'' Samay explained. ``Mostly I represent big clients. And
when he saw my name on a list of lawyers, he chose me without ever
meeting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Samay said he was in the process of assembling an international
team of lawyers to defend his client, but appeared to have not yet
reached firm arrangements. He also said it was too early to talk
about what kind of defense he would mount.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, who has a reputation for brutality as a regional leader
and a member of the Khmer Rouge Central Committee, has been charged
so far only with violating a 1994 law against membership in the
radical Communist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say new statutes must be enacted to allow him to
be prosecuted in Cambodia for international crimes like genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The Documentation Center for Cambodia, which has been assembling
records from the Khmer Rouge era, has turned over 1,000 pages of
documents on Ta Mok to a military prosecutor and Samay.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the center, Youk Chhang, said that Ta Mok's
signature was on many of the documents but that the prosecution
would need to explain the context and the chain of command in order
for this evidence to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome might depend on the defense lawyer,'' Youk Chhang
said. ``Ta Mok had better think carefully about his defense lawyer,
because his life and death might depend on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Samay, along with most of his generation, is a victim of the
Khmer Rouge movement, in which Ta Mok was a leading figure. While
he was in France, the lawyer said, his wife and 12-year-old
daughter returned to Phnom Penh for a visit and were killed by the
Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he could put the personal tragedy aside. Indeed, he
said, he likes his client. ``He likes me,'' Samay said. ``I like
him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Samay hastened to add: ``I don't like him because he is a
killer. I like the way he tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another issue that gives Samay pause. ``As you know, this
is a very big case, and in the beginning I didn't know how Ta Mok
would pay me,'' the lawyer said. ``This is the problem. This is the
problem. He said, `I will pay you.' OK. But not yet.''

TEXAS CONGRESSMAN WANTS TO SPLIT BORDER PATROL FROM INS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ A congressman who made his name controlling the
border here wants to divorce the U.S. Border Patrol from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and create a Bureau of
Border Enforcement _ an agency on par with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not afford to have such a large agency, receiving
basically a blank check from Congress, that has failed,'' Rep.
Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, said of the INS, which is the parent
agency of the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, who was a Border Patrol sector chief in El Paso and in
McAllen, charged that INS lacks the commitment to continue as
``America's front line of defense'' against drugs, undocumented
immigration and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, legislation will be introduced which would
create the Bureau of Border Affairs, which would report directly to
the Department of Justice, Reyes said in an interview from his
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, the new bureau would include the Border Patrol's
law-enforcement mission plus the INS's law-enforcement work at
ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   INS would be left with an almost exclusively bureaucratic
mission of handling the millions of inquiries a year regarding
citizenship and legal residence in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is a dismal failure,'' said Reyes, whose
criticism of the INS has grown in the wake of a February
announcement that the El Paso border patrol sector would not gain
any new agents this federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came a day after he and other members of Congress
renewed the attack on the Clinton administration for not complying
with a law requiring an increase of at least 1,000 new Border
Patrol agents this year.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by 47 House members and a dozen senators accused
Clinton of surrendering in the fight against drug traffickers and
undocumented immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the INS in Washington, reacted
to Reyes's proposal and comments by saying the agency is committed
to controlling the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many demands from many sides that are constantly
being put on the agency,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of administering our nation's immigration laws
requires there be a constant balance between enforcing the laws and
facilitating legal entry,'' Cardona added.
</P>
<P>
   To help the INS accomplish its mission, Cardona said, the
administration has proposed splitting the INS in two camps, service
and law enforcement, but keeping the border patrol under the INS.
</P>
<P>
   As far as new agents go, Cardona said, the INS is trying to
manage a border patrol that has tripled in size to almost 9,000
agents in the past few years. The problem is finding enough
qualified agents and ensuring not too many rookies are put in the
field at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes and others have said they expect the patrol will need to
be at least 20,000 agents strong to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Reyes launched Operation Hold the Line, an initiative
here which placed hundreds of agents side-by-side for approximately
20 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border east and west El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   While controversial at the time, it was widely viewed as
successful in stemming illegal immigration and became a model for
operations in Southern California and the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 500 new agents are headed to South Texas this year and
will surpass this slice of West Texas as the state's hot spot for
controlling the border.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 500 agents will be spread among Arizona,
California and New Mexico. They came as the latest, and perhaps
last installment on a plan that has boosted the patrol's strength
by 1,000 agents per year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new agents would not mean an increase in strength
because many of the 1,000 would replace those lost to attrition.

QUESTIONS ABOUT YELTSIN COMPETENCY   FUEL IMPEACHMENT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin commands a huge
nuclear arsenal, but sometimes has trouble completing a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He holds sway over the world's largest country, but often
appears confused, childish, and out-of-touch.
</P>
<P>
   He has difficulty walking, but Russia's fate _ as legislators
began an effort to impeach him Thursday _ depends on his next move.
</P>
<P>
   Does Yeltsin know what he is doing?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question on nearly everyone's mind a day after
Yeltsin fired the popular prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov and
replaced him with Sergei Stepashin, a longtime ally who heads of
Russia's police force and interior security army.
</P>
<P>
   The move has outraged lawmakers and set off a government crisis,
sent the ruble plunging and put talks with international lenders on
hold, as well as raising doubts about Moscow's ability to mediate a
settlement between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kremlin, which viewed the shakeup as a boost for
economic reform, almost no one sees anything positive coming from
Yeltsin's move. But Kremlin watchers are split in their assessment
of Yeltsin's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Was Primakov's dismissal a classic power play by a man who
always puts his own political survival above the interests of the
country, a typical move by a president who has repeatedly
undermined his own political and economic reforms with surprise
shakeups, contradictory public statements, and abrupt policy
reversals?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it possible that Yeltsin, an ailing 68 in country where
most men do not live to see 60, may have finally lost it? ``One
theory is that Yeltsin has basically lost touch with reality, and
has begun saying and doing silly things,'' said Alan Rousso, head
of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``There's enough evidence to sustain
that. But to sleep better at night, I prefer to believe the signs
that he is acting rationally.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next will depend on the answer. The State Duma, the
lower house of Parliament which heard opening arguments in
impeachment hearings Thursday, will almost certainly vote to
impeach Yeltsin on one of the five charges he faces, that he
illegally waged the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya that killed an
estimated 80,000 Russian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, that step would deprive Yeltsin of the
right to dissolve the Duma if it rejects his choice to replace
Primakov, as many legislators suggests it will. But the
constitution also says that the president is obliged to disband the
Duma if it rejects his candidate for prime minister three times.
</P>
<P>
   That built-in contradiction raises the possibility of a showdown
outside the law. Russia has a precedent for that _ in 1993, Yeltsin
sent tanks to demolish Parliament after it refused his order to
disband (the Duma Thursday heard arguments over whether to impeach
him for that, too).
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin Thursday said Yeltsin would oppose disbanding the
Duma. But some were unconvinced. If Yeltsin were acting rationally,
why did he not wait for the Duma to vote on impeachment before
sacking Primakov?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous situation, dissolving the Duma would be
deadly for the country, and everything is so unpredictable because
of Yeltsin,'' said Masha Lipman, deputy editor of Itogi magazine,
which recently ran a big expose on the president's poor health.
``It is his health, his body, that is unpredictable. It's not just
that he is an whimsical person _ he never knows when he will be
sick again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks prior to Primakov's dismissal, Yeltsin looked
almost childish during one government meeting when he ordered his
ministers to change seats, an episode that evoked nationwide
ridicule after it was broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   Russian viewers never got to see another incident, when Yeltsin
babbled almost incoherently about Yugoslavia during a recent
Kremlin ceremony: His press aides asked local press not to
rebroadcast the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has frequently made public statements his aides have
later rushed to correct. He has confused Scandinavian countries,
mistakenly referred to Japan's nuclear arsenal (it has none), and,
most recently, threatened NATO by suggesting Russia's nuclear
weapons could be re-aimed at Western targets.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, parliamentary leaders said Yeltsin told them
he was proposing another candidate to replace Primakov before a
letter arrived with Stepashin's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not know what he said 15 minutes ago,'' remarked
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who has led the drive to impeach
Yeltsin that resulted in Thursday's hearing and could lead to a
vote as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is again following with fear the unstable gait of
its president,'' the Moscow newspaper Obschaya Gazeta commented.
``Unfortunately, Yeltsin of late is doing worse in handling the
deficiencies of his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Those deficiencies had not mattered so much after Primakov took
office following last summer's economic collapse. As Yeltsin, who
had a quintuple bypass operation in 1996, convalesced with various
ailments, the doughty premier forged an alliance with Parliament
and calmed Russia's restive regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly by avoiding any rash moves, Primakov cooled a financial
meltdown and brought a feeble stability to the economy. Replacing
Yeltsin as the country's day-to-day leader, he earned popularity
that the widely disliked president has not enjoyed since he was
reelected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also set in motion corruption investigations that were
closing in on Yeltsin's inner circle, including family members.
Proponents of the theory that the president is acting rationally
say his recent moves make sense _ for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rational for the point of view of his vested interest
to preseve power at any price,'' said Yevgeny Volk, head of the
Heritage Foundation's Moscow office. ``He reacts like a cornered
tiger. Unfortunately, he doesn't care about the country, and that's
the tragedy of Russia.''

 GATEWAY BACKS CMGI with $200 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., the Andover, Mass. company that invests in Internet
businesses, has $200 million more to work with, thanks to an
investment from personal computer maker Gateway 2000 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway is buying slightly less than 2 percent of outstanding
CMGI stock as part of a strategic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Gateway isn't simply looking to hitch a ride on
the soaring value of CMGI stock. Gateway will seek to develop new
Internet-based products and services in cooperation with the dozens
of Internet companies in the CMGI stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway is the leading consumer PC manufacturer,'' said CMGI
chairman and CEO David Wetherell. ``The number one reason people
are buying PCs today is to get on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI holds investments in about 40 companies that provide a
variety of Internet services. Gateway plans to work with those
companies to develop new Internet-based offerings that will help
the company sell more PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reflects a new focus at CMGI on coordinating the
activities of its various Internet investments. ``CMGI is becoming
more and more an operating and a systems integration company for
the Internet,'' said Lior Yahalomi, Gateway's vice president of
business development.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, CMGI can work with its various Internet firms to
create customized products that can be of interest to a variety of
businesses. Gateway is interested in CMGI firms that can further
enhance its existing Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway runs its own Internet service provider for use by owners
of Gateway machines. Yahalomi said that CMGI companies can provide
a number of additional enhancements. For instance, CMGI owns 39
percent of Ancestry.com, which runs a Web site devoted to family
issues. Yahalomi said that Gateway and Ancestry.com may create a
family-friendly service specifically for users of Gateway home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI owns a majority stake in Navinet, a company that runs a
nationwide dial-up Internet service. Gateway could partner with
Navinet to provide easier Internet access in communities not
directly served by Gateway's own service, said Yahalomi.
</P>
<P>
   With so many CMGI Internet companies, there are many potential
deals to be done. ``We have formed a committee at the highest level
of the company,'' said Yahalomi. ``We are going to meet on a
continuous basis to explore those specific arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahalomi said the $200 million investment in CMGI will ensure
that Gateway will get first crack at new Internet products and
services developed by CMGI firms.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Mazzucchelli , senior vice president at the investment
firm Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, said it's no surprise that
Gateway is interested in beefing up its on-line capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway specifically has been at the head of the pack at using
the Internet to broaden their product and service offerings,'' he
said. But Mazzucchelli questioned whether the CMGI companies can
actually offer much that would dramatically strengthen Gateway's
position in the market. ``Not a lot of instant solutions leap out
at me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI lost $1 11/16 Thursday and closed at $238 1/16 on the
Nasdaq. Gateway lost $ 9/16 and closed at $67 5/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

FISH OIL MAY HELP CONTROL BIPOLAR DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fish oil pills may help remedy symptoms of bipolar disorder,
sometimes called manic depression, according to a new study by
researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and McLean
Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study results indicate fish oil does possess elements to
stabilize mood,'' said lead author Dr. Andrew Stoll, a psychiatrist
on the staff of both hospitals. Fish oil appears to boost serotonin
levels in the brain, stabilizing mood in a way similar to drugs
such as Prozac or Zoloft, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-month study, 30 outpatients at the Brigham who have
bipolar disorder got pills containing omega-3 fatty acids, which
are abundant in fish oils as well as in canola and flaxseed oil, or
placebo pills with olive oil, while also receiving their regular
treatments or therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of 14 patients getting fish oil derived from menhaden, or
64 percent, reported relief of their symptoms, compared to only 3
of 16 taking placebos, or 19 percent. The results are in the
current Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Many other health benefits have already been identified for
omega-3 fatty acids, including relieving symptoms of arthritis and
heart disease, reducing women's risk of breast cancer, and
preventing the intestinal ailment known as Crohn's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If further research bears out the effects, researchers said,
fish oil might be prescribed as a supplement to antidepressant
drugs or lithium for people with bipolar disorder. Omega-3 fatty
acids could also be shown to have a role treating depression,
schizophrenia, or attention deficit disorder, Stoll said.
</P>
<P>
   But because pharmaceutical companies cannot patent fish oils,
government agencies or foundations will probably need to fund
further tests, Stoll and colleague Dr. Lauren B. Marangell added.

COMMENTARY: THE ACCIDENTAL PEACENIK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in Israel's history, its upcoming election is
about who will control the Interior Ministry, not the Foreign
Ministry. It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more
responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly
advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down
the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to
the peace process. It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal
with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist. It is
no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian
state while Likud rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75
percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a
Palestinian state of some size or other. With that sort of
consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign
Ministry?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall
between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two
sides. He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while
all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters
that he was not abandoning their cause. It may have been that the
only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without
triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying,
blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and ``the
leftists,'' and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up
to his commitments or not. Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to
as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo _ and he accommodated
them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who
delivered it.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought
a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process _ but he
stayed out of it himself. That is, he never wanted to take
ownership of it, and he still doesn't. Bibi struck important deals
that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs
against him in this election. In 1996, Bibi won because a majority
of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and
the blowing up of Israeli buses.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better
Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept
Oslo. In other words, thanks to Bibi's having routinized the peace
process, many Israelis want to get on with it, finish it and look
to the future.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of leading that parade, Netanyahu is shying away
from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past. He
repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up
in Jerusalem. Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process,
he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future. His
campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope, and when you
can't give hope, when you cannot educate, when you cannot
articulate people's aspirations, when you cannot unify, you cannot
lead.
</P>
<P>
   I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded
identical themes, although neither knows the other. One was from a
religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron
Yaacov, Victor Friedman (no relation). Victor wrote: ``Even people
who hate the left, and can't imagine voting for Ehud Barak, are
tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since
Bibi came to power. The lying, trickery, corruption, divisiveness,
incitement _ people don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer, Laura Blumenfeld,
who wrote that Israel today is suffering from ``Multiple Israel
Disorder _ Bibi thought he could hold onto power by dividing
everyone into squabbling tribes. He was wrong. The shot that killed
Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions. But
after three years of bumping and biting each other's necks, people
are tired.''
</P>
<P>
   By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace,
Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never
before. But by doing it in such a divisive fashion, he has also
created a longing for national unity as never before _ a longing
that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy. On Monday we will
find out if Bibi can survive Bibism.

<P>
   The only way to reconcile two terribly contradictory perceptions
about Mexico's current and future prospects circulating today is to
understand how deeply the country has been divided by the process
of change over the past decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The cleavages sundering Mexico have created not only two
countries, but two increasingly alienated societies.
</P>
<P>
   A booming export sector, concentrated in and looking to the
north, has taken off. It is competitive, efficient, dynamic and
outward-looking. Its inputs, credit, output and standards are all
U.S.-based.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Mexico _ where more than 80 percent of the nation's
100 million inhabitants live and work _ finds itself sinking into
political fragmentation, economic stagnation and social
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   The images and assessments arising from these two situations are
both accurate: The aggregate economic numbers, heavily influenced
by the export sector, are improving constantly; the pessimism and
chaos pervading the rest of the country reflect the growing
intractability of Mexico's underlying problems.
</P>
<P>
   The most characteristic and worrisome among them is that it is
virtually impossible for the country to agree on anything. For
decades _ if not for centuries _ Mexico lived under a regime of
consensus: mostly imposed through authoritarian means, on occasion
freely consented. But gridlock, whether it be regional, political
or social impasses, were infrequent, if not totally absent.
Mexicans agreed, or were forced to agree, on most issues facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the Carlos Salinas administration, Mexico carried
out dramatic changes in its development plans and policies without
serious dissent, or in any case without experiencing severe
consequences when silencing dissent through governmental nastiness
or heavy-handedness.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, which for better or for worse allowed the country to
experience half a century of political stability, economic growth
and social modernization, has obviously come to an end. As Mexico
enters the first truly uncertain presidential election in its
history, the country seems singularly devoid of any capacity or
inclination to agree on any conceivable question, important or
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   The examples are countless and revealing, and they range from
the truly substantive to the symbolic. Among the latter, the most
symptomatic are perhaps those related to the Power and Light
privatization project submitted by the government to the Congress a
couple of months ago, and the proposal to charge modest tuition
fees at the National University to those students able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   On both counts the proposals are arguable and reasonable;
sensible people can dislike them or find them beneficial for the
country. But instead of arousing a serious debate and negotiation
from which a long-term national consensus would emerge _ in one
direction or another _ the two initiatives have awakened passions
and fanned the flames of social discontent.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Mayday demonstrations were the most
anti-government, intense and well-attended in years. The
possibility of reaching closure and convergence is more remote than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the inability to decide has affected apparently minor
affairs. One involves time zones in the country, and the absurd
debate that took place in late March as to who would adopt daylight
savings time, and who would not, and why.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, some Mexican states adopted the hour change, and
others did not; some are on U.S. Central Time, some on Rocky
Mountain Time and some on Pacific Time, while the one that used to
go by Eastern Time _ Quintana Roo, where Cancun is located, decided
to go back to Central Time, perhaps because the drug traffickers
found it more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas wisely desisted from
heeding the calls of his rank-and-file and accepted the federal
government's decision to move clocks forward on April 1, it was
touch and go for several days, in the capital and in Guadalajara,
the country's second largest city. The country cannot even agree,
literally, on the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it figure out what to do with the 2 million, or perhaps
even 3 million, imported used cars circulating without valid
license plates, registration cards, insurance or inspection
controls. They were brought in over the years by migrants returning
from the United States, or by border state inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these mostly dilapidated vehicles entered Mexico with
temporary importation permits; they paid no taxes on entry, nor any
property levies like all other cars and trucks pay in Mexico. They
have all outstayed their welcome and their authorization. The local
automobile industry is up in arms over the prospect of regularizing
these imports. The inhabitants of the northern cities where they
are largely concentrated want some sort of amnesty and
after-the-fact legalization.
</P>
<P>
   The government is caught in a vicious cross-fire between
hundreds of thousands of owners who cannot afford the much more
expensive used cars available in Mexico, and others who feel
punished for having purchased their vehicles in Mexico and obeying
the law. The likelihood of any agreement in the near future is
close to nil.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's surprising macro-economic numbers are neither imaginary
nor artificial. But they cannot blot out the collapsing national
consensus on any issue of substance, in a country where, since time
immemorial, centrifugal forces have always threatened Mexican
cohesion. More than lower interest rates, higher exports, or more
foreign investment _ all necessary and desirable, of course _
Mexico today needs to craft the instruments for constructing new
broad agreements on at least basic matters, whether decisive or
inconsequential. Today it disagrees on both.

 &HT;    'Menace' site run by local teacher
 &HT;    By David Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Star Wars is a hobby for some and an
obsession for others. For Robert Beasley, it's both.
</P>
<P>
   The English teacher at Port St. Lucie High School runs Prequel
Watch, a Web site dedicated to listing every scrap of information
related to the newest installment in the cinematic space saga.
</P>
<P>
   Under the JediNet.com home page, Web surfers can find Beasley's
obsession and love. After abandoning his own Web site, Dunesea.com,
because of server difficulties, Beasley was asked by JediNet's
Webmaster John Benson to help with the Prequel Watch page. Months
later, Beasley has found himself in front of CBS news cameras and
mentioned in countless publications. All awash in search of Phantom
Menace information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I update the site 10 times or more a day,'' Beasley
admitted. Prequel Watch has been getting 25,000 hits a day
regularly, something unheard of for a fan-run site. But what
surprised Beasley the most when he began working on the page was
how much information people actually sent him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my students are really into the movie. They bring me
articles from magazines all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   People send faxes, too. ``The coolest fax came in July of 1997,
and we didn't post it until January. It contained a three-page plot
synopsis, character sketches, character bios. It turned out to be a
30-page fax. I just thought it was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley also got faxes from anonymous Hasbro sources about the
line of toys made in conjunction with the movie. The faxes never
had a return number or name. On the flip side, he also gets e-mail
from disgruntled fans unhappy that they learned more than they
wanted to know on his site. (Beasley says his page warns of such
``spoilers.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cloak and dagger antics are finally coming to a close,
though. Since the novelization of the movie was released last week,
there's no possibility for Prequel Watch to reveal anything new
about Phantom Menace before it opens on Wednesday. But Beasley
still has much to do.
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, he and his partners at Prequel Watch begin counting
down to Episode Two, which comes out in 2002. Beasley has already
confirmed some news on the film. He knows that Lucas will direct
the movie and the primary filming will move from London to
Australia. He and his partners will spend the next three years
searching for even more tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   Has all the insider information spoiled the fan? ``I bought the
book and read it that night. Afterward I was kicking myself,''
Beasley lamented. But he brightened when asked about the most
exciting moment since he began working on Prequel Watch. He
remembers the rush of Nov. 11, when the first coming attractions
trailer hit theaters. ``I knew Star Wars was back!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Wednesday, Beasley will be at the theater watching
the full length version of the film. Not clips, not trailers, not
behind-the-scenes footage, but the real deal. ``I'm just going to
watch it, watch it, watch it.''

YELTSIN'S MOVES MAY WORSEN RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his
Cabinet may deepen Russia's economic troubles by jeopardizing a
badly needed loan-refinancing program from the International
Monetary Fund and negotiations with other foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Russia was supposed to repay the IMF about $4 billion
and sovereign lenders and commercial banks about $17 billion. But
after the economy collapsed last summer, Russia effectively
defaulted on much of its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Cabinet of the now-ousted prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, and the IMF had spent the last few months
developing an economic program and tied it to a critical
refinancing agreement, announced in Washington late last month. The
IMF deal, in turn, gave Russia the credibility to renegotiate its
debts with other creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has made the IMF program far more uncertain,'' Roland
Nash, chief economist with MFK Renaissance, a brokerage firm here,
said Thursday. ``It looked like the IMF and Primakov had struck
some sort of deal. Even then, the IMF bent over backward to release
the credits.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has already suspended a $3 billion loan for
Russia that is tied to the IMF agreement. ``We were just about to
try and conclude our arrangements for a $3 billion package,'' the
World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, said in Washington.
``But now we don't have a government to deal with, and, until there
is a new government, clearly there is nothing more we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The political turmoil caused the ruble to fall 3.9 percent
against the dollar in foreign-exchange trading Thursday, its second
consecutive big drop. Russian stock prices rebounded 2.7 percent
after a 16 percent loss on Wednesday, the worst this year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uncertainty comes from a set of conditions the IMF
required before proceeding with the loan refinancing. The fund has
faced accusations that it gave money to Russia in the past even
when Moscow failed to make important economic changes tied to the
lending.
</P>
<P>
   Its recent conditions were meant to prove that Russia is getting
its finances in order, and they included changes to the Russian tax
code to increase budget revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes, however, have to be adopted by the Communist-led
lower house of Parliament, where Primakov has enjoyed strong
support.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house is already in a fighting mood: Thursday was the
first day of a long-planned session to impeach Yeltsin. Even if the
impeachment effort fails, it will hardly ease the tension between
Yeltsin and Parliament or smooth the passage of the IMF-linked
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house must approve Yeltsin's nominee to be the next
prime minister, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin. The process,
even if successful, could take as long as five weeks of political
wrangling, distracting attention from legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a strong chance that the legislators may reject
Stepashin, a presidential loyalist, which would give Yeltsin the
constitutional right to disband Parliament and call for early
elections. Stepashin and the new Cabinet appointees would stay on,
but only as a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
   If Parliament is dissolved, Nash, the economist, said: ``The IMF
would face the prospect of giving money to a country without a
legislature or a government. In every statement the IMF has made,
it said it expects to have a legislative underpinning to the
economic program.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think that dissolving Parliament might not
necessarily hurt the IMF program. Under the constitution, the
President can issue decrees establishing such a program in the
absence of laws.
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that whatever the outcome of the house's vote on
Stepashin, the IMF will have to yield to political pressure to help
Russia from its largest contributors, notably the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason there's an IMF program to begin with isn't because
anyone expects major change,'' said Charles Blitzer, chief
international economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It's
driven by the urgency of the West to remain engaged in Russia.''
And right or wrong, he added, it ``wants to do that through the
IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A way will be found around any problems,'' Blitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the current political and economic conditions, any government
can do very little, economists said. Russia faces elections for
Parliament this winter and presidential elections in mid-2000, and
it is becoming apparent, they said, that no one wants to make
painful choices that would be sure to anger some part of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems in Russia aren't fiscal, but far deeper
structurally,'' Blitzer said. ``No government is going to be brave
enough or strong enough to even begin to deal with those basic
problems.''

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The Brazilian economy defied pessimistic
forecasts of stagnation in the first quarter and actually
registered some growth, the government said Thursday in a report
that showed Brazil's surprising resilience to the effects of the
currency crisis that erupted in January.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic
performance, grew by 1 percent in the first three months of the
year compared with the last quarter of 1998. Agricultural
production rose 18 percent, leading the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, and the
second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. The
weaker currency may have even contributed to the economy's growth
by encouraging farmers to increase output of these and other
products since their prices became more competitive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an immediate reaction throughout the entire chain of
our production following the devaluation,'' said Nathan
Herszkowicz, president of Brazil's coffee industry union. According
to the organization, coffee exports more than doubled in the first
quarter of 1999 compared with the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although higher agricultural output contrasted with weak
industrial production, the government figures released Thursday
suggest that Brazil's economy is recovering more quickly than
thought.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts earlier this year forecast the economy to
shrink as much as 6 percent, most economists are now predicting a
contraction of only 1 percent to 2 percent. Optimism has been
stoked by six interest-rate cuts over the last seven weeks. On
Wednesday, the central bank reduced its main lending rate to 27
percent from 29.5 percent, the lowest level in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates coming down, coupled with controlled inflation,
have had a tremendous impact,'' said Winston Fritsch, president of
the Brazilian unit of the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson. Progress made by the government in reducing the budget
deficit is likely to allow the central bank to continue lowering
rates to below 20 percent by the end of this year, Fritsch added.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian stocks rallied on the growth figures, with the
benchmark Bovespa index here rising 2.56 percent. Increasing
foreign investment in Brazilian equities together with greater
optimism among domestic investors have pushed the index up 83
percent in local-currency terms and 34 percent in dollar terms so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The better-than-expected growth figures and buoyant stock market
contrast sharply with other indicators that show an economy
struggling with its worst crisis since a stabilization program was
carried out in 1994. The plunge in January in the value of the
currency deeply hurt Brazil's financial credibility and borrowing
power abroad, which reverberated through the economy with slumping
sales, bankruptcies and layoffs. Manufacturers and construction
companies were the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the economy's strains was seen this week when
50,000 unemployed workers lined up outside municipal buildings to
compete for 10,000 openings for street cleaning jobs in the city of
Sao Paulo. The salary for the temporary, six-month work is 136
reais a month, or $82, Brazil's official minimum wage. Unemployment
here in Sao Paulo, the country's wealthiest city, is at a record
level of nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian companies have started to shift toward increasing
their exports, partly because domestic demand has remained
stagnant. A large food processor, Perdigao SA, exported 18 percent
more in the first quarter after the devaluation in January. ``In
dollar terms, we have the cheapest chickens in the world right
now,'' said Wang Wei Chang, chief financial officer of Perdigao.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opportunities for companies such as Perdigao to fuel
a stronger recovery are limited since domestic borrowing rates
remain punitively high and foreign credit markets are still largely
shunning Brazilian borrowers. With deeper cuts in interest rates
largely dependent on the government's success in narrowing the
budget deficit, companies are anxiously awaiting fresh evidence of
spending cuts from the capital, Brasilia. ``Now is not the time to
relax, not even a little,'' Wang of Perdigao said. ``We need to see
the government deliver.''

CLINTON COMPARES `ETHNIC CLEANSING' TO HOLOCAUST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton compared the Yugoslav ``ethnic
cleansing'' policy to the Holocaust as he sought Thursday to
justify NATO's continued bombing of the Serbs as a moral duty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made another in a series of speeches on Kosovo as the
allied air campaign, fraught with a series of missteps, including
the mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy, enters its eighth
week. He acknowledged the frustration Americans may be feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we see these pictures of the refugees on television
every night and most people would like another story, but we must
not get refugee fatigue. We must not forget the real victims of
this tragedy,'' Clinton said in an address to the nation's veterans
at the National Defense University.
</P>
<P>
   He said Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic`s Serb troops
have uprooted almost all of the 1.7 million ethnic Albanians living
in the Serb province of Kosovo, sending them fleeing across the
borders or into the mountains. Another 100,000 are missing,
thousands executed and 500 villages burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though his `ethnic cleansing' is not the same as the ethnic
extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related; both vicious,
premeditated, systematic oppression fueled by religious and ethnic
hatred,'' Clinton said. ``This campaign to drive the Kosovars from
their land and to indeed erase their very identity is an affront to
humanity and an attack not only on a people, but on the dignity of
all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Miller, the American Legion's top official, told The
Associated Press that Clinton's remarks failed to make the case for
continued U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committing the sons and daughters of America to armed conflict
overseas requires a clear, compelling statement of the national
interest that hasn't been articulated yet for the Kosovo
operation,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also continued his appeals to Russia to remain
involved in the peace negotiations. Clinton said NATO wants Russian
troops to be a part of the international security force after the
war. He said a Russian presence ``will help to reassure the Serbs
who live in Kosovo and they will need some protection, too, after
all that has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said NATO forces at times have risked their own
lives in a quest to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we regret any casualties that are accidental,
including those at the Chinese Embassy,'' he said, referring to the
attack last week that left three Chinese dead and 20 wounded. ``But
let me be clear again. These are accidents; they are inadvertent
tragedies of conflict. We have worked very hard to avoid them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States remained ``committed to building a
long-term strategic partnership'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   The president again explained to Americans why the United States
and its European allies launched the bombing raids that have
pounded Yugoslavia since March 24.
</P>
<P>
   He recounted the emotional horror stories told by refugees: The
farmer who survived a mass execution when other bodies fell on him,
the Serb police robbing the Kosovars of their passports and money,
the stories of rapes by masked Serbs, the murder of four children
whose family had no money for bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no accident that Mr. Milosevic has not allowed the
international media to see the slaughter and destruction in Kosovo.
There is no picture reflecting the story that one refugee told, of
15 men being tied together and set on fire while they were alive.
No, there are no pictures of that. But we have enough of those
stories to know that there is a systematic effort that has animated
our actions, and we must not forget it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before his address, Clinton said he
believed Americans ``are probably frustrated that it is not already
over. But I said in the beginning, we have to be prepared to pay
the price of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton again reiterated the steps Milosevic must take to
stop the bombing: allow the Kosovar refugees to return, withdraw
Serb forces, allow the Kosovar Albanians self-government and allow
an international security force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Operation Allied Force, fraught with missteps, has come
under criticism from many fronts and its bombing raids had little
impact on Milosevic's routing of Kosovar Albanians. Yugoslav forces
this week declared their operation in Kosovo to be successful and
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also noted Milosevic is being investigated for war
crimes and said the responsibility for the atrocities lies with the
government not the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political leaders do this kind of thing. Do you think the
Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on their own without
Hitler? Was there something in the history of the German race that
made them do this? No. We have got to get straight about this, this
is something political leaders do. And if people make decisions to
do these kinds of things, other people can make decisions to stop
them ... and that is exactly what we intend to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton held out the prospect of economic aid for Serbia,
Yugoslavia's largest republic, should it turn away from the
``ethnic cleansing'' policies. He said the European Union stood
ready to take a lead role in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand ready, therefore, to embrace Serbia as a part of a
new Europe if the people of Serbia are willing to invest and
embrace that kind of future,'' Clinton said.

ARGENTINE CONGRESS RESTORES PRESIDENT'S CUTS TO EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ After a week of student
demonstrations, the Argentine Congress has restored $280 million in
aid to schools and universities that President Carlos Saul Menem
had ordered cut to control a federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming vote in both houses of Congress on Wednesday
night came only two days after Menem had himself partly reversed
the cuts. But the united effort by legislators of both the
government party and opposition underscored the president's waning
influence as his second five-year term winds down.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also came less than a week after a gubernatorial
candidate supported by Menem in Buenos Aires province was trounced
by a nearly 3-to-1 margin in a primary held by the governing
Justicialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Menem made the cut in Education Ministry financing last month as
part of a broad $1 billion package of budget cuts to satisfy
International Monetary Fund targets for Argentina's 1999 deficit,
now projected to reach nearly $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were publicly challenged by Education Minister Susana
Decibe, who resigned last week while endorsing growing student
protests at more than 25 public universities around the country in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand university student blocked major avenues in
Buenos Aires on Monday, causing huge traffic jams. And then on
Tuesday a national school strike paralyzed the public education
system and kept hundreds of thousands of students at home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chancellor of the University of Buenos Aires
threatened to close the school in October, leaving politicians with
the prospect of 185,000 students and their parents angry at the
country's leaders during the final weeks of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the protests, Menem partly reversed the education
cuts on Tuesday, reinstating $150 million of the original $280
million.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional members of the Alianza opposition and
congressional supporters of Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires
province, a bitter political foe of Menem and the leading
Justicialist candidate for president, joined forces on Wednesday
night to erase the entire education cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strong depreciation of executive power by the
Congress,'' said an opposition congresswoman, Graciela Fernandez
Meijide. She criticized Menem for making the cuts by emergency
decree rather than presenting them to Congress for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Justicialist legislators managed to protect most of the
government's budget cuts, while the opposition promised to review
other cuts in health, housing and public pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The growing setbacks to the Menem government has led to rising
speculation in the press that Economy Minister Roque Fernandez will
be forced to resign. In interviews Thursday, however, Fernandez
said that he would remain and that ``we are not going to concede
anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the student demonstrators, he added, ``They can
cause trouble with their street demonstrators, but they will not
affect the nation's fundamental economic equilibrium.''

   If you worked in the  &UR; Pete Wilson &LR;  administration _ ah, remember
those heady days of yesteryear? _ you've probably received a letter

 &HT;    Jobs, support, hospitality mean a warm welcome
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The same qualities that draw people to Atlanta from
the shores of California and the avenues of New York make the metro
area attractive for resettling refugees from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy, moderate living expenses and warm hospitality
are determining factors when resettlement agencies seek a safe
haven for people fleeing war and political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, more than 37,000 refugees have come to Georgia from
Bosnia, Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iraq
and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental goal and premise of resettlement is to give
them a second chance,'' said Susan Somach, executive director of
the Newcomers' Network, which provides services to refugees. ``A
big component of that is to rebuild self-sufficiency. One of the
big fundamentals is employment, and Atlanta has a great job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The metro area's geographic size is another benefit, said Dana
White, professor of urban studies at Atlanta's Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know `sprawl' is a dirty word now, but the spread-out city
works advantageously in that sense,'' he said. ``You can move new
groups in with less danger of putting them up against another
group. In Boston and New York there's tighter space.''
</P>
<P>
   Those factors, taken together, mean that metro Atlanta will soon
become home to several hundred of the 20,000 Kosovar refugees who
will enter the United States in the coming months. Atlanta's first
group is expected to arrive early next week.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 resettlement organizations in America. On
Wednesday, representatives from each of those groups held their
weekly meeting in New York to determine how many cases each agency
could handle, through local affiliates. When local affiliates can
assure the national organizations that they have what they need to
get families off to a good start, the refugees begin arriving in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday afternoon, two local affiliates had received
their initial family allocations. World Relief will assist an
extended family group consisting of 17 people. And Catholic Social
Services notified the national office that it could resettle 20 to
30 families.
</P>
<P>
   There are at most half a dozen Kosovar families in the Atlanta
area, said Peter Herbert, regional director of the International
Rescue Committeee. So the refugees moving to Atlanta will be people
without any ties to the area.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what makes the metro area's hospitality and community
support such crucial factors when national organizations select
their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is extremely supportive here. It's one of the
best I've seen,'' said Herbert, who used to work in IRC's New York
office. ``People here are interested in helping people from other
countries and in their own communities. I'm impressed with how
generous people are.''
</P>
<P>
   The generosity of Atlantans is exemplified by people like Eve
Goldstein and Stephanie Kenney.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein called Jewish Family and Career Services to volunteer
whatever type of assistance a family might need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a docent at the William Bremen Jewish Heritage Museum, and
when I give tours to children, I tell them that during the
Holocaust the major group of people were onlookers,'' Goldstein
said. ``We try to make clear the difference between onlookers and
making the decision to help. You don't want to say this is someone
else's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney volunteered through World Relief, a major resettlement
organization whose affiliate in Atlanta will ultimately help
perhaps 25 to 30 families. She agreed to sponsor a family _ which
means that she has found housing, furniture, sundries and the
support network necessary to help a Kosovar family start a new
life.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her preparations, Kenney tapped resources at the
schools of her three children, got support from her church and
enlisted the help of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person I called said they would do whatever to help,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of hers have provided an apartment for two months at
their house. Others donated items necessary to run a household, and
volunteered to cook dinners and provide transportation for the
family. Kenney's husband, who works in real estate, is trying to
find the refugees a permanent home. ``I thought, `What can I do to
help?' '' Kenney said. ``Because they are coming from a terrible
situation.''

EMBASSY BOMBING INVIGORATES CHINESE PROPAGANDA APPARATUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ever since NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade last Friday, China's state-run media have dished up a
ceaseless stream of banner headlines and jarring photos: of bereft
parents crying over victims' bodies, of President Jiang Zemin in
tears as he greeted families of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television programs have uniformly called the
bombing an intentional ``criminal act'' perpetrated by ``U.S.-led
NATO forces.'' The three dead Chinese have been anointed
``martyrs.'' The NATO forces, ``barbarians,'' or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no mention of the rock-throwing that damaged
the facade of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, nor have the words
``ethnic cleansing'' ever appeared. It took two days for China's
news media to report President Clinton's initial apology, a delay
that fanned the flame of public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled reports have played a crucial link in the cycle
of hatred that has rolled through China this week, reflecting both
genuine public outrage and urging it on with half truths and
inflammatory calls for the ``revenge of blood debts.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's somewhat rusty propaganda apparatus seemed to
spring back to life in response to this extraordinary event.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where newspapers and television programs are
generally quite diverse and distinct, it was startling to watch
China's news media once again speak with one voice. Many Chinese
people were moved by what they heard and saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the news reports and those pictures, I felt furious
about America's actions,'' said Wei Fang, a 24-year-old auditor at
an American accounting firm in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Luo Zhanggong, a 28-year-old independent businessman who spent
the weekend making protest posters for display near his home, said
he ``simply didn't believe'' Western claims that student
demonstrators had trashed the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, it may be hard to conduct an old-style
propaganda campaign in China, where millions of urban Chinese have
access to foreign Web sites, watch television beamed in by
satellite from Hong Kong, and have friends and relatives overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people are much more sophisticated than they were 20
years ago,'' said Minxin Pei, a researcher at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs at least that by week's end the official
version of events was fraying around the edges. At a government
press conference Thursday, a Chinese television reporter boldly
asked the Foreign Ministry spokesman: Why hadn't the government
mentioned Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign?
</P>
<P>
   On the front page of Thursday's Southern Weekend, a popular
weekly with a liberal bent, editors condemned the NATO bombings,
but also warned against developing xenophobia and ``blind,
fanatical, narrow-minded nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese media have become far more lively and diverse in the
last decade, partly because, to survive in the country's new market
economy, television programs must survive on advertising and
newspapers need to attract paying readers.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, dozens of newspapers and television programs have
branched into investigative reporting, run editorials on topics
like legal reforms, and cover stories about unemployment, crime and
domestic violence. Today, more than ever, China's media look more
like journalism and less like propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Readers and viewers are more inclined to expect the truth. As
one university student told his American professor this week: ``The
protestors didn't set fire to an American Consulate _ that's a lie.
If it was true it would have been on China Central Television.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the media's core task is still to protect and promote the
government's point of view, and this week they moved back to
basics. Hours after the bombings, Ding Guangen, the head of the
Communist Party's Propaganda Department, called a meeting of
newspaper editors to order up coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, virtually every newspaper _ from the popular Beijing
Youth Daily to the party's mouthpiece, People's Daily _ has devoted
pages and pages to the bombings, all expressing identical views and
often using the same catch phrases. Even specialty papers like
Farmers Daily and Health News joined in. Enterprising television
programs that normally focus on corruption, has bellowed a similar
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beijing Youth Daily has devoted at least eight
pages to the bombings every day, a dramatic shift from its usual
lively mix.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the newspaper's banner headline ``Shock _ Outrage _
Protest'' was punctuated with tiny targets, the symbol of Serbian
defiance. Another issue featured ``The Bomb Attack Was
Premeditated.'' Virtually all newspapers have offered up columns by
military experts contending that the bombing was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The paper did not run a Western apology on Tuesday, two days
after Western leaders first expressed regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Such manipulations left the Chinese people stewing over the
apparent lack of an apology for an extra 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and smaller countries all over the world are expressing
their condolences, but I haven't seen anything about Western
countries expressing these thoughts,'' said an angry physician who
would give only her surname, Han. ``It doesn't seem like the West
regards all this as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Beijingers point out that the vast propaganda campaign was
principally effective because it dovetailed with the public's
initial fury about the bombings, even if careful management fueled
that rage and channeled it into certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the disparities between the Chinese media and the
Western press, for us there are two simple facts: That NATO bombed
the Chinese Embassy and that three people died,'' said Luo, who
owns a chemical company. ``Now I'm not a party kind of person, but
this is a matter on which the Chinese people, from the lowest
peasant on up, are extremely unified.''
</P>
<P>
   Luo and others dismissed the notion that in 1999 a propaganda
campaign could ever manipulate Chinese people's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days China has become quite open and we get news from a
whole variety of sources,'' said Li Pingwei, a 35-year-old who
works in advertising. ``I get it from TV, newspapers, the Internet
and from speaking to my friends and colleagues who are overseas. I
know what the outside world is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Li said he ``had heard'' that the American
Consulate in Chengdu had been burned. He said he debated with his
Chinese friends working in the West about whether the bombing was
intentional or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely have a different understanding of the events
from Chinese people here,'' Li said. ``But they think the American
media are to some extent also controlled. Our media say it was
deliberate, and theirs say it was a mistake. So our opinions
differ.''
</P>
<P>
   But others had more basic reasons why the media blitz here left
them unmoved. ``Of course everyone's furious, three people were
killed,'' said a man surnamed Wang, a shopkeeper. ``Would I
demonstrate? Of course not! You can't make money demonstrating. And
that's what it's all about now, isn't it?''

FINNERAN, KRAFT APPEAR FRIENDLY AT LUNCHEON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They did not say much publicly, but when House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft
smiled, laughed, shook hands, and got touchy-feely in public
Thursday, it created quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 250 of Boston's highest-profile business pt
the Boston Harbor Hotel, Massachusetts' consummate Odd Couple
looked more like old buddies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they appeared downright convivial.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought a long war over the appropriate level and use of
public finances for a new stadium for the National Football League
team, the two men have largely been considered enemies in the
public eye. And in a state where revenge sometimes seems to be the
most popular participant sport, who would ever have thought that
Finneran's arm would be seen publicly around Kraft's shoulder, or
that Kraft would grasp the speaker's hand well after shaking it?
And what about all of the laughter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable!'' exclaimed the chief executive of one company,
as others literally pointed at the scene and whispered to their
lunch companions in the hotel's Wharf Room.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Finneran sat at the same table for a luncheon speech
by Ted Turner, the Time Warner vice chairman, to the Boston
Colleges Chief Executives Club. Before the speech, Finneran
approached Kraft who was already seated.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft looked up, smiled, and shook hands with Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran crouched slightly, put his arm around Kraft's shoulder
and both began a four-and-a-half minute conversation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Finneran could be heard saying, ``There'll be a
hearing and then a vote Tuesday.'' That is the schedule of action
in the Legislature next week on a bill to spend $70 million in
infrastructure improvements in Foxborough for the proposed new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft nodded a lot, and had a few words of his own for Finneran.
At one point, he laughed and grasped Finneran's forearm, while the
speaker's lips remained at Kraft's ear.
</P>
<P>
   It all was much different from the days when Finneran referred
directly to Kraft as ``a whiny millionaire'' _ before publicly
apologizing for the comment after being taken to task for it by his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hunter, a spokesman for the Boston College group, said
Thursday that seating assignments were made by the college after
consideration was given to who would attend, and their prominence
in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Finneran were at the head table with Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Reverend J. Donald Monan, the chancellor of BC and member of a
group of six civic leaders who put the Patriots' stadium issue back
on the agenda, had nothing to do with bringing the men together,
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Monan was at an adjacent table, his seat less than 15 feet
away. At the same table with Kraft and Finneran was another member
of the group of six, William F. Connell, a developer and
industrialist. Another member of the civic group, Wayne A. Budd,
group president of Bell Atlantic, was at a second adjacent table.
</P>
<P>
   When the luncheon was over, Kraft apologized for having little
to say about his conversation with Finneran, or the buzz it created
in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to say much about it, now,'' Kraft said,
still smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker both thoughtful and magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had one disagreement in all of those years: the proper
use of taxpayers' dollars for a football stadium. And on that
issue, we have agreed to disagree. In the course of such
disagreements, sometimes the wrong things are said.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his prominent, public conversation with Kraft was a bit
of a coming out for both men, Finneran grinned broadly and said,
``It was nice to see him.''

BU PROFESSOR LEADER IN BRITISH POET LAUREATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a battle pitting a literary tradition that goes back
three centuries and Britain's evolving post-imperial identity,
Boston University professor and Nobel poetry prize recipient Derek
Walcott has emerged as the front-runner to become the nation's poet
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott, who was born a British subject on the Caribbean island
of St. Lucia in 1930, would replace Ted Hughes, who died six months
ago. He would be the nation's 19th poet laureate, filling a
lifetime post once held by figures such as Tennyson and Wordsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday said the
new laureate would be named by the end of the month, but declined
to say whether Walcott is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In literary circles here, however, Walcott is said to have the
inside track. Walcott, who has just wrapped up teaching the spring
semester at BU, was in Boston Thursday but through BU spokesman
Kevin Carleton declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is aware that he is under consideration,'' said Carleton.
</P>
<P>
   The British government had expected to have named a replacement
by now for Hughes, who Thursday was remembered by many of Britain's
top writers during a memorial service at Westminster Abbey. It had
been hoped that his successor could be at the service.
</P>
<P>
   But filling a job that dates back to the 17th century and which
Hughes had held for nearly two decades has proved to be an
unexpectedly daunting task, mainly because of a tug of war between
those who want the job to stay within its traditional parameters
and those who want it to reflect modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While Walcott would be the first black laureate, and would
appeal to Blair's desire to celebrate Britain's diversity, he is
being pushed by some of the staunchest traditionalists because they
see him as a literary heavyweight and because they fear the job may
go to a more populist poet. Among Walcott's supporters is Hughes's
widow Carol, who recently wrote to Blair urging him not to
modernize the post.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much debate within Blair's ``Cool Britannia''
government about making poetry more accessible by installing a less
highbrow ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists, however, have howled at the prospect of
changing a job that since 1692 has offered a yearly stipend of 100
pounds, which was good money 307 years ago but is a considerably
less impressive honorarium today.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the poet laureate's prime responsibility has been
to pen verse to commemorate state events, such as royal weddings.
There is some pressure to have the new laureate in place for next
month's wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   While Queen Elizabeth II will name the new laureate, she will
effectively be announcing Blair's selection. Under British
parliamentary law, one of the powers specifically invested in the
prime minister is forwarding the laureate's name to the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney was initially a
government favorite, especially given Blair's efforts to bring
about peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. But Heaney took
himself out of the running because while he was born in
British-controlled Northern Ireland, he carries an Irish passport
and could not swear loyalty to a monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office has floated ideas about giving the
laureate's post a limited term, a change that traditionalists have
also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to The Daily Telegraph, the voice of the
British establishment that has campaigned against changing the
laureate's job description, Alan Howarth, the British arts
minister, dismissed suggestions that the government was determined
to create a ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can see no advantage in anything that would
impair the Poet Laureate's traditional resonance or the respect and
regard in which the office is held by the public,'' said Howarth.
``It is inconceivable that we would wish anything to undermine this
precious literary legacy.''

to aid war refugees in Kosovo and victims of the recent Midwest
tornadoes. But that's only on the face of it. In fact, the spending
bill has become bogged down by a numbing series of attempts by

   ATLANTA _ Fleeing warfare or political persecution, more than
37,000 refugees from around the world have found sanctuary in
Georgia since 1981. As metro Atlanta prepares to take in refugees
from the conflict in Kosovo, Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff
writers Lillian Lee Kim and Jeffry Scott talked to five recent
refugee families to see how they're adjusting to their new lives
here.
</P>
<P>
   From Bosnia:
</P>
<P>
   The Cvijetinovic family
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Now living in: Clarkston, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, Slavica Cvijetinovic learned to live
with numbing fear and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Then she came to Atlanta and learned true heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Four months pregnant when she arrived in December 1996, she
miscarried shortly afterward. A year later, her husband, Srdan, was
diagnosed with a rare form of throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And her lack of English rendered her mute at a time when she
most desperately needed to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can fight with life,'' says the 39-year-old former engineer.
``But it's very hard when you can't speak. You want to say
something, but you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned English. She learned how to open a bank account. She
learned how to navigate mega-grocery stores and medical insurance
forms.
</P>
<P>
   She learned how to say ``tonsil'' and ``salivary gland'' and
``radiation therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   She is still Bosnian. But she knows her son is not.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan, 3, was born in Bosnia, but he is now as American as
Play-doh and Pez candy.
</P>
<P>
   Slavica's younger brother, Franjo, laughs at something Ivan says
in Bosnian. She explains that Ivan speaks Bosnian with a terrible
American accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son will grow up to love the United States. He will not
love Bosnia,'' Slavica says, wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' she continues, as though she is
trying to convince herself. ``He loves everything American. He
should be American.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan and Franjo stroll across the street for candy, and return
with a whole cache: Runts, Nerds, Now &AMP; Laters. Slavica sifts
through the pile, muttering, ``Unhealthy, unhealthy,'' but she lets
Ivan eat what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, she recalls, she didn't know if there would be
food the next day. She didn't know if her husband or brothers, all
soldiers in the Bosnian army, would come home.
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows. Srdan's cancer is in remission; the former
graphic designer works in a factory, where he makes enough to
support the family. She is on leave from her job as a translator at
World Relief, a refugee resettlement agency.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there is a brand-new U.S. citizen in the
Cvijetinovic household: 4-week-old Ana, who sleeps peacefully in
the crib beside her parents' bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are my angel,'' Slavica coos to Ana _ in English.
</P>
<P>
   From Somalia:
</P>
<P>
   The Warsame family
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Now living in: Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Ali Mohamed was crushed that he couldn't start school
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His four older siblings went, but his mother, Markabo, hadn't
been able to get his documents in order by then, explained the
family's caseworker, Mimi Mahmood. So the 10-year-old had to wait
until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to his mother, `You are a bad mother! You are a bad
mother!' '' Mahmood recalls, to the enormous amusement of the rest
of the family. Even Mohamed grins.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of grinning goes on in this tidy two-bedroom apartment,
where Ali Mohamed Warsame, 43, his wife, Markabo, 42, and their
seven children have lived since arriving in the United States a
month and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Shukri earns laughter when she parades into the
living room wearing an ``abbya,'' the traditional head covering
that Somali women wear. She usually doen't wear it, her mother
says, but lately she has become something of a fashion plate, all 4
feet of her.
</P>
<P>
   You would never guess, from their joyous faces, that the Warsame
family had suffered since fleeing their native Somalia in November
1992. These faces reveal nothing of the seven years they spent in a
succession of Kenyan refugee camps, dodging marauders, scratching
out a living, waiting to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Warsame explains that the family no longer has anything to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I came here, I'm very happy, I'm content,'' he says in
Somalian. ``I left all my worries behind.''
</P>
<P>
   They left behind almost everything they owned, except for some
clothes. Catholic Social Services, the agency that handled the
family's resettlement, provided new mattresses, bedclothes and
donated furniture. A volunteer secured a TV and VCR, so the
children could begin to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the little, loving touches that have turned this
shabby apartment into a warm home: the fringed shawl draped over an
end table, the dishes carefully arranged in a glass-fronted
bookcase, the incense scenting the air.
</P>
<P>
   From Cuba: The Feliciano family
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Now living in: Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Like so many refugees, Israel Feliciano, 39, had to make a
terrible choice.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba was no longer safe for his family. He and his wife, Isidra
Fleites, 43, both political activists, had been jailed for speaking
out against Fidel Castro. Even his 8-year-old daughter, Eileen, had
been forced to spend two days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to leave. Then he learned that he would not be
able to take his son, Eldisney, with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eldisney was just months shy of 16, the age at which Cuban boys
are pressed into military service. He wouldn't be allowed to leave
the country with the rest of his family.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Feliciano started procedures for getting his son
released from his military obligation. The process is long; no one
knows how long.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Feliciano arrived in Atlanta. Eight days ago,
Fleites and Eileen joined him. They pray Eldisney will not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when he can come,'' Fleites says softly.
</P>
<P>
   Vu family
</P>
<P>
   Country of origin: Vietnam
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Now living in: Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   The nightmares still visit Thang Vu.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines himself back in Vietnam's ``reeducation'' camps,
where he spent seven hellish years as a political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I wake up, I recognize that now I am in U.S.,'' the
49-year-old Vu says.
</P>
<P>
   He avoids thinking about the past, he says. Instead, all his
energy is focused on building a new life in Atlanta, where Vu, his
wife and two sons arrived in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the future of my family,'' Vu
repeats again and again. His 18-year-old son, Khoa, nods.
</P>
<P>
   Khoa has plans. Right now he's stuck in the ninth grade, because
all refugee kids at South Atlanta High between 14 and 18
automatically start as freshmen, no matter what their education
level.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his family's caseworker, however, Khoa has
found a ticket to a better job without fully repeating high school.
He's taking GED classes downtown so he can get his high-school
equivalency diploma and enroll at Atlanta Tech, where he wants to
study computer programming. Six months in the United States, and he
already knows where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he practices English every chance he gets, by
chatting up other neighborhood kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing for me is English,'' Khoa says,
haltingly but intelligibly. ``Nobody understands me.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he's already mastered the American teenager look:
untucked Tommy Hilfiger shirt over baggy khaki pants sized for a
walrus.
</P>
<P>
   Phung Quang Chieu
</P>
<P>
   Country of origin: Vietnam
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Now lives in: Doraville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Phung Quang Chieu, 63, tell his story, you see the
universal image of political refugees:
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for help, the help often eluding the grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the people who tried to climb the wall of the
U.S. Embassy the day that Saigon fell, trying to get on the
helicopters that were evacuating the embassy, '' says Chieu, who
worked as a translator for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   North Vietnamese forces were shooting at the Embassy, he says.
``So I climbed back down. People were lying dead all over the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   It was April 30, 1975, and for the next 4 1/2 years Chieu served
time in a Vietnamese concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, three times he tried and failed to escape
Vietnam by boat to join his wife and three children, who had fled
just before the fall of Saigon, in America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Chieu was accepted as a political refugee by Italy, and
in 1983 emigrated to the United States for a short-lived reunion
with his family. Has was divorced in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta and lived for a year with an old friend from Vietnam,
Pham The Truyen, while working in the restaurant cooking, cleaning
and washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, his background and fluency in English got him a job at
the International Rescue Committee, where he's now deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   He's become the conduit for many Vietnamese resettling in
Atlanta, having helped 600 refugee families find homes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing is the language,'' he says. ``Then
it's finding work, transportation, and understanding the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everybody from South Vietnam wants to get out of Vietnam,
not because of the economy. They cannot live under the communist
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Still single, Chieu bought a home two months ago, after 10 years
of saving for the downpayment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do that on one income,'' he says. ``But it makes
me feel like I've settled in Atlanta at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Veledar family
</P>
<P>
   Country of origin: Bosnia-Herzegovina
</P>
<P>
   Arrived in Georgia: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Now live in: Gwinnett County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Emir Veledar, 45, remembers the things he wishes to forget, none
more horrifying than a fellow college professor forced at gunpoint
by Croatian soldiers to walk naked into the streets of Mostar,
Bosnia, where he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``His body lay in the streets for days because his friends and
family were afraid if they moved it, they would be shot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As he and wife, Mila, 44, recall life in Bosnia as Muslims, an
ethnic group targeted for eradication, Veledar shakes his head and
looks flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about something else,'' he says, running a hand
through his hair. ``Let's talk about how much I love this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Veledars arrived in Atlanta in March 1994, with their
daughters Sanja and Jasna, with the sponsorship of St. John Neumann
Catholic Church in suburban Atlanta, which paid their first two
months apartment rent.
</P>
<P>
   Both are college-educated. He taught college math. She worked as
a mechanical engineer. But the language barrier limited them to
lower-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   She shampooed hair at a beauty shop. He drove a delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years I was stuck in the cycle,'' says Mila. ``I
couldn't get a skilled job because of my English, and I couldn't
get a low-level job because I was too educated. But I did learn a
lot of English in the beauty parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   Emir's delivery job had its own frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these people in Atlanta really need,'' he says, laughing,
``is more imagination in naming streets. Peachtree Street,
Peachtree Road, Peachtree Industrial, New Peachtree Road. Very
confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   After living three years in Cherokee Court Apartments _ where
almost all the residents were Bosnian refugees _ two years ago the
Veledars bought a two-story three bedroom home near the suburban
town.
</P>
<P>
   She got a job soldering wireless phones at EMS Technology, and
has since been promoted to quality control.
</P>
<P>
   He works at the Emory University medical school doing
statistical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now a three-car family,'' says Emir.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Emir visited relatives in Bosnia. But he and his
family have no wish to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's home, but it's a different one,'' he says. ``There was so
much destruction that people who live in Bosnia know that during
the rest of their life it will never be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   Their daughters both are honor students. Sanja, a junior in high
school, is talking about attending Georgia Tech. Emir and Mila
marvel at how the family has adjusted and been embraced by the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have one unpleasant experience in America,''
says Emir. ``Of course, when you go to buy a car they try to trick
you. But that's not personal.''

GENE SARAZEN, THE FIRST TO WIN ALL FOUR MAJOR GOLF TOURNAMENTS,
DIES AT 97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla.)   By LARRY DORMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Sarazen, whose stylish, effective swing and dogged demeanor
made him one of the finest golfers of the 1920s and '30s, died
Thursday in Naples, Fla. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen died at Naples Community Hospital from complications of
pneumonia, said his lawyer, John Cardillo.
</P>
<P>
   His health had been failing in recent years, limiting his access
to the game he loved so much. But he returned each spring to
Augusta National Golf Club for the Masters, where he served as the
honorary tournament starter along with Byron Nelson and Sam Snead
every year since 1981, hitting the opening shot of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Masters in 1935 that Sarazen hit the shot that
most experts believe is the single most famous stroke of golf ever
played. Dubbed ``the shot heard 'round the world,'' Sarazen's shot
with a 4-wood at the 15th hole of the last round of the tournament
went into the hole from 235 yards away for a double eagle. It
helped him earn a tie with Craig Wood, who had finished his round,
and Sarazen then won the 36-hole playoff the next day for his only
Masters title.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an immigrant Italian carpenter, Sarazen was born
Eugene Saraceni in Harrison, N.Y. He began to work as a caddie at
the age of 8 and entered his first professional tournament at 17,
an unlikely candidate for a career as a golfer. ``In those days,
only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he once told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   But he displayed a gift for the game from the beginning. He won
the first of his two U.S. Open championships at the age of 20 in
1922, making him the second-youngest winner in the history of that
event, and he was the first of just four men to win all four of
golf's major professional championships _ the United States and
British Opens, the Masters and the PGA Championship _ during his
career. The others were Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Gary Player.
He won 38 tournaments on the PGA Tour, including 7 majors.
</P>
<P>
   An inquisitive and inventive man, Sarazen _ dubbed the Squire of
Germantown from his days as a farm owner in Germantown, N.Y., and
for his trademark knickers _ was much more than just a golfer. As a
young man, he farmed 375 acres of apple orchards in the small
community of Germantown, not far from Hyde Park. He was the
inventor of the sand wedge, introducing it at the British Open in
1932, and, after he retired from active competition, was a
television commentator on ``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf.''
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant shotmaker who could ``do just about anything he
wanted to do with a golf ball,'' according to the Masters founder
Bob Jones, Sarazen even toured Europe and South America with the
trick shot artist Joe Kirkwood. During the '30s, he dominated golf,
winning 22 of his 38 PGA Tour titles. But, for all his
accomplishments in the game, Sarazen will be remembered best for
the single shot that helped turn the Masters from a small, clubby
gathering into the enormous event it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1976 book on the Masters, the Atlanta sports columnist
Furman Bisher asked Sarazen to describe the shot, and his reply
remains the single most vivid recollection of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute I hit the ball there was a feeling in my
system that it was going to be close,'' Sarazen recalled. ``The
ball went straight for the hole, about 235 yards away. It didn't
carry the green. It carried short and rolled about 15 feet to the
cup and in. There wasn't that steep incline in front of the green
that's there now. If I hit the same shot today, it would roll back
in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I could tell if it dropped or not, those 20
people around the green all jumped up and yelled like hell, and one
of them was Bob Jones. He had walked back down from the clubhouse
to see (Walter) Hagen and me finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of seeing that stroke hit at the tournament he
founded _ then in its second year and known as the Augusta National
Invitation Tournament _ was one that Jones always cherished. He
referred to it often, and the most eloquent of his recollections
was published in the forward to Sarazen's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing on a mound about 50 yards away,'' Jones wrote.
``His swing into the ball was so perfect and so free, one knew
immediately that it was a gorgeous shot. I saw the ball strike the
tongue of the green, bound slightly to the left, directly towards
the hole, and then the whole gallery began dancing and shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were emotions frequently elicited by Sarazen, who had what
Jones called an ``unconcealed and undiminished zest for the game,
and for competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, Sarazen was a competitor. Galleries were drawn
to the dapper little man striding swiftly about the course, who
stood just 5 feet 5 inches but who played much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen had an unquenchable desire to win. That was never more
apparent than in 1932 when he came from nine strokes behind with 28
holes to play to victory, shooting an inward 32 in the third round
and following that with a 66 for a three-stroke victory over Phil
Perkins and Bobby Cruickshank at Fresh Meadows Country Club in
Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   His longevity in the game was another hallmark of Sarazen's
career. He was 61 when he made his final cut at the Masters, a feat
eclipsed only by Snead, who made it at the age of 62. When he was
71 and playing in his last tournament, Sarazen astonished the
golfing world by scoring an ace on the eighth hole during the first
round of the British Open. In 1996 he was the first recipient of
the PGA Tour's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen lived the last years of his life in Marco Island, Fla.
His wife of 62 years, Mary Catherine, died in 1986. He is survived
by a daughter, Mary Ann Sarazen, of Marco Island; a son, Gene
Sarazen Jr., of Del Ray Beach, Fla.; seven grandchildren, and six
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he entered his 90s, Sarazen was still able to swing the
golf club. At the age of 91, Sarazen swatted his tee shot down the
middle of the first fairway at Augusta, a drive that carried more
than 150 yards, and finished his swing with a flourish and a wave
to the crowd, a huge throng, that cheered his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day he was sitting in the old manor clubhouse,
reflecting on the many things he had seen and done in his career,
when the subject of the shot in 1935 was brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here now and I can remember it almost like it was
yesterday,'' Sarazen said, looking out the window down toward the
hollow where the 15th hole lay. ``It was quite a thing for me, and
for golf, too.''

 &HT;    Welfare success story's unhappy twist
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lost in the much-heralded success of the nation's
welfare reform law is the less well-known story of the number of
former recipients who have lost their health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A study published Thursday by Families USA provides the first
statistical glimpse of how many people may have been affected by
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based health advocacy group found that 675,000
former welfare recipients and their families have lost their
government-funded health insurance as an unintended consequence of
leaving the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   That means one out of every five people leaving the welfare
system end up among the nation's 43.5 million people who are
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reward many are receiving for coming off welfare is the
loss of health care coverage,'' said Ron Pollack, executive
director of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg. We are only beginning to
see the impact of the welfare reform law,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Congress ordered the overhaul of the
welfare system in 1996, requiring most welfare recipients to work
as a condition of getting financial aid. The new law also imposed a
five-year limit on the benefits, among other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law took effect, the number of people on welfare
across the country has declined by 4.6 million people, or 38
percent. In Georgia, the rolls have dropped by nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   But the welfare law also required state officials to inform
former welfare recipients of their right to receive Medicaid for up
to one year after leaving the system. And that, say advocates, is
not happening as it should.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on data compiled from the U.S. Census Bureau
and the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the
government-funded Medicaid program that insures welfare recipients
and low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   While federal officials agree that more should be done to inform
former welfare recipients of their right to stay on Medicaid, they
disagree with the group's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the mathematical model that the group used, said
Melissa Skolfield, assistant secretary for public affairs at the
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not take into consideration that the Medicaid
rolls could have dropped as a result of the robust economy,
Skolfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack says the economy was taken into account, and he noted
that the computations were done by a reputable outside company.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state officials are concerned that the message is
not getting out to former welfare recipients that they have the
right to remain on Medicaid for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that they (former welfare recipients)
know they can stay on Medicaid,'' said Joyce Goldberg, a
spokeswoman for the Department of Family and Children Services,
which administers welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, child care and transportation are the three services
that help those who leave welfare, Goldberg said. Her department is
training caseworkers to tell former recipients about the services
available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lowe, a Georgia-based consumer health advocate, said the
study confirms what advocates for welfare recipients long have
feared: There's been too little attention focused on informing
families that they can get Medicaid as they make the transition
into the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, particularly adults, have been lost in the
system,'' Lowe said.

 &HT;    The rose: A beauty full of contradictions
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 16.
 &HT;    By Lee May

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In some ways, the rose is like the pansy. Each grows a
gardenful of contradictions; each teaches a lifetime of lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Here in mid-May, pansies still grow strong despite their
reputation as flowers of the cool and cold. Routinely, they'll
perform until midsummer. Pansy is one of the toughest bloomers in
the garden _ even though the word usually disparages; there's
nothing weak about the pansy, known to brightly lift its face out
of snowdrifts that keep supposedly tougher plants on their knees.
With a happy face, the pansy shucks off labels and rises above low
expectations, excelling beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of life lesson you can't learn in school _
especially in these baffling times when concerns about security and
safety threaten to turn teachers and schools into soldiers and
fortresses.
</P>
<P>
   The rose, that deeply loved, highly prized queen of the garden,
has its own contradictions, lessons. It is at once elegant and
prickly, silky and rough, inviting and repelling, bringing those
qualities together like no other flower (prickly pear, with its
fine yellow flower rising from pin-cushion pads, combines similar
characteristics but without the respect the rose enjoys).
</P>
<P>
   Growing, cutting, handling, gazing upon a perfect rose blossom,
surrounded by forbidding thorns, teaches appreciation for life's
myriad contrasts, its sometimes mysterious contradictions. This
royal shrub produces its own kind of yin and yang, a harmony
accentuating both the soft elegance of the bloom and the hard-edged
prickliness of the stem.
</P>
<P>
   Such harmony can be seen in many places. I have appreciated it,
for example, in the ruggedly lovely Rosa rugosa along Atlantic Road
in Gloucester, Mass. This crinkly-leafed shrub with the fragrant
flower and tomatolike hips reflects the mesmerizing beauty of the
ocean, as well as the craggy rocks jutting from the water. During
walks along the road, these three natural wonders _ the sea, the
stony shoreline and the rose _ arrest me every time.
</P>
<P>
   And, in my own less-dramatic space, I grow roses here and there,
integrating them with other plants. Most are nameless. I propagated
my first many Decembers ago by taking several 6-inch cuttings from
a neighbor's bush and pushing them into soft dirt up to the two
sets of leaves I left on.
</P>
<P>
   One cutting made it through the winter and still grows happily.
(Isn't that often the way with propagation _ no matter how many
cuttings you take, one takes.)
</P>
<P>
   I bought two other nameless roses near Meridian, Miss., several
years ago, assured by the nursery people that ``these are the kind
Grandma grew.'' In fact, they said, grandmothers were prominent
sources for their plants. Somehow, it seemed fitting that Big
Mommas, such important figures in so many of our lives, would share
floral joy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I always loved the rose as the symbol for Mother's Day.
I don't see as many people wearing them as I used to, but years
ago, red roses were worn in great numbers by people whose mothers
were alive, while white roses were for those whose mothers had gone
on. So long ago, when practically everyone I knew wore red.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what color they are, my roses must be
self-sufficient; needy roses have no place in my garden. Which is
why I choose those that have thrived on neglect.
</P>
<P>
   One grows near a little juniper and a short pine, its
red-and-yellow blooms softly contrasting with the conifer needles,
while the rose thorns complement those same sharp needles.
</P>
<P>
   Another, orangy-red, twines along through the wrought-iron
fence, its delicate, fleeting blossoms softening the fence's
permanently rigid lines _ mortality and immortality co-existing, as
they do in our heads when we reconcile our youthful belief that
life is forever with our aging knowledge that it has limits.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of aging, I do love roses more than when I was younger
(just as I more appreciate gardening in general), showing again
that years sometimes bring wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The years also have brought me roses I did not plant. Two have
sprouted from the ground during the last couple of years _ one
burgundy, one pink, neither close to an established plant. Maybe
there's some scientific reason for these appearances, but I like to
believe roses come because of my growing appreciation. My
understanding of how beauty and charm can thrive in the thorniest
places. How we can be tough and tender at the same time.

PRICING

 By STEPHEN LABATON with LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government accused American Airlines
Thursday of driving smaller competitors out of its important
Dallas-Fort Worth market by illegally slashing ticket prices below
their cost and increasing flights.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust case is the first predatory pricing action brought
by the government against an airline since the industry was
deregulated 21 years ago. It is part of a broader 18-month
examination by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division of the
steps that may have been taken by major airlines, including Delta,
Northwest and United, to discourage lower-priced competition in
cities where they are the main carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Following deregulation in 1978, the largest airlines have moved
to strengthen the control of their markets, establishing hubs,
locking up gates and expanding frequent flyer programs. While
antitrust cases among the airlines are not uncommon _ indeed,
American once sued United unsuccessfully for predatory pricing _
the government has rarely intervened beyond threats of fines.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer complaints about rising fares and declining service
have led lawmakers to introduce measures in Congress to force the
airlines to disclose more about fares and delays, and offer
compensation for inconveniences. In addition, the Transportation
Department proposed a new enforcement policy last year that would
punish airlines that tried to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at the Justice Department said the American
case was particularly compelling because company documents showed
that American, the nation's second-largest airline, had
deliberately sold tickets below cost and incurred significant
short-term financial losses in recent years in order to drive out
three low-cost competitors _ Vanguard, Sun Jet International and
Western Pacific _ from the Dallas market.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lawyers at American replied that that the airline
had not violated any antitrust laws but simply matched the fares of
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once the competing airlines left the Dallas-Fort Worth
market, government lawyers said, American raised its fares,
sometimes by more than 50 percent, and sharply cut service to
cities in California, Colorado, Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``American quickly realized that these new carriers could be a
significant competitive threat, estimating that as much as a
billion and a half dollars of its annual revenues were at risk if
they were to succeed,'' said Joel Klein, the assistant attorney
general in charge of the Antitrust Division. ``To make sure that
this didn't happen, American adopted a predatory responsive
strategy, saturating the market in which the start-up carriers had
begun service with as much new, low-fare service of its own as was
necessary to drive out the start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``American knew that this strategy would be costly and
pursued it only in order to drive out the new carriers, so that
American could go back to its old way of monopoly pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said American ``invested in
short-term capacity increases and fare reductions in order to
maintain its monopoly _ an investment it was able to recover many
times over once its smaller rivals had been driven away.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines disputed the accusations by the Justice
Department that it had priced its fares below cost or flooded the
market, and said the lawsuit was little more than sour-grapes by
smaller up-starts which, unable to compete, had persuaded antitrust
regulators to bring the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the Justice Department's lawsuit, this action
today is very potentially anti-consumer,'' said Chris Chiames, a
spokesman for the AMR Corp., the parent company of American. ``It
would have a chilling effect on the marketplace if companies felt
they could not match prices of competitors. We simply matched the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department complaint, filed in federal court in
Wichita, Kan., seeks an injunction barring American from cutting
ticket prices below cost and increasing flights as part of any
effort to stifle competition. The case is being brought under
Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said federal antitrust law does not
permit them to seek any fines or monetary awards, but that smaller
airlines who were harmed by American's conduct could file their own
civil antitrust lawsuits for money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The complaint quoted from company papers describing its
``Dallas-Ft. Worth Low Cost Carriers Strategy.'' The government
said the strategy recognized that ``it could prove unprofitable in
the short run.'' But, according to a company document quoted in the
complaint, the strategy concluded: ``The short term cost, or impact
on revenue can be viewed as the investment necessary to achieve the
desired effect on market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of recouping short term losses through
strengthening American's monopoly, the Justice Department charged,
reflected the views of Robert L. Crandall, then the airline's
chairman and chief executive, who the government said had once
commented about low-cost carriers, ``If you are not going to get
them out then no point to diminish profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also quoted from internal American Airlines
papers that suggested that the carrier intended to add flights to
Kansas City, Mo., to drive Vanguard from the market and that
American decided to get Western Pacific out of the Dallas-Colorado
Springs route before Western Pacific increased its service to that
market.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives declined to answer questions about the
American Airlines documents that the government has called
incriminating but defended them in general terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong or illegal with tough talk about
competition,'' Chiames said.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Nicoud, a senior lawyer at American, said, ``Looking at
aggressive conversations in board rooms is very misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the smaller rivals portrayed as victims by the
Justice Department praised the lawsuit. Of the three airlines,
Vanguard has since returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth market, Sun
Jet no longer serves that airport, and Western Pacific filed for
bankruptcy protection from its creditors and stopped flying in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the actions that American Airlines took to
eliminate Vanguard Airlines from the Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace
were unlawful and violated the antitrust laws,'' said Robert J.
Spane, chief executive of Vanguard Airlines. ``We are delighted
that the Justice Department has agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vanguard is also quick to trumpet its success in the past
year, which appears to bely the government's claim that American
was unlawfully preying on the carrier. Vanguard posted an operating
profit of $1.5 million for the first time last year compared with
an operating loss of $25.4 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition,
which lobbies on behalf of several large corporations seeking more
airline competition, said the most significant outcome of the
Justice Department lawsuit would be to increase investors'
confidence in start-up airlines. ``It is going to be a huge shot in
the arm in terms of investing in low fare competitors,'' he said.

 &HT;    Way beyond gray: Men take to color as fashion statement
 &HT;    EDs: Embaroged for Sunday May 16.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gentlemen still prefer blondes. They also like
dabbling with redheads and brunettes.
</P>
<P>
   Hair dye has become the latest fashion accessory for
style-conscious men who like changing their look as often as some
fellows buy a new pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Neuroth, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student and part-time
bartender at Mumbo Jumbo, recently had his hair dyed Rocket Fire
Red just for the heck of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do lots of different hairstyles, so I like trying different
colors,'' explained Neuroth, whose hair used to be brown.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their older brothers, guys today aren't dyeing just to
cover gray. They're dyeing for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Major hair care manufacturers are catering to the trend by
developing colors with masculine sounding names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a very subtle look to a very bold look and
everything in between,'' said Clancey Callaway, head colorist for
Vidal Sassoon in Lenox Square (Atlanta), who's been in the business
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The color craze among males prompted L'Oreal to put men on the
boxes of its Feria brand home coloring kits. Feria's new colors for
men are Bleach Blonding, a light, sun-kissed yellow; Cherry Cola, a
deep burgandy; Camel, a golden blond; and Gothic, black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit the shelves in late April,'' said Carlene Pruitt,
spokeswoman for L'Oreal in New York. ``It seemed very natural to
put men on the boxes. More men are coloring their hair, not only to
cover gray but to make a statement. We choose those shades very
strategically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clairol also has developed a new men's line, called Natural
Instincts for Men, that's scheduled to be on grocery and drugstore
shelves this summer. The 10 new colors will replace Clairol's Men's
Choice, which has been out since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed the new products after research showed
that the use of hair coloring by men between ages 30 and 54 had
grown 8 percent per year for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although cost is a factor _ a salon will charge at least $60 for
a coloring job, compared with a home kit for as little as $3.99 _
men tend to color their hair more often than women because they
wear it shorter and cut it more frequently. A man typically needs
his dye retouched once a month, whereas women can go for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   While some men prefer subtle shades that merely hide gray or
enhance their natural color, bolder souls go for the bleach.
Platinum and bleached blond shades are the most sought-after colors
this season. Bill Cook is so smitten with his platinum-white hair
that he's had it dyed every four weeks for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very '30s, silver-screen, movie-star look,''
said Cook, who's a natural ash blond. ``It goes real well with my
skin tone, and it's dramatic. People remember you when you have
platinum hair.''

BU PROFESSOR LEADER IN BRITISH POET LAUREATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a battle pitting a literary tradition that goes back
three centuries and Britain's evolving post-imperial identity,
Boston University professor and Nobel poetry prize recipient Derek
Walcott has emerged as the front-runner to become the nation's poet
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott, who was born a British subject on the Caribbean island
of St. Lucia in 1930, would replace Ted Hughes, who died six months
ago. He would be the nation's 19th poet laureate, filling a
lifetime post once held by figures such as Tennyson and Wordsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday said the
new laureate would be named by the end of the month, but declined
to say whether Walcott is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In literary circles here, however, Walcott is said to have the
inside track. Walcott, who has just wrapped up teaching the spring
semester at BU, was in Boston Thursday but through BU spokesman
Kevin Carleton declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is aware that he is under consideration,'' said Carleton.
</P>
<P>
   The British government had expected to have named a replacement
by now for Hughes, who Thursday was remembered by many of Britain's
top writers during a memorial service at Westminster Abbey. It had
been hoped that his successor could be at the service.
</P>
<P>
   But filling a job that dates back to the 17th century and which
Hughes had held for nearly two decades has proved to be an
unexpectedly daunting task, mainly because of a tug of war between
those who want the job to stay within its traditional parameters
and those who want it to reflect modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While Walcott would be the first black laureate, and would
appeal to Blair's desire to celebrate Britain's diversity, he is
being pushed by some of the staunchest traditionalists because they
see him as a literary heavyweight and because they fear the job may
go to a more populist poet. Among Walcott's supporters is Hughes's
widow Carol, who recently wrote to Blair urging him not to
modernize the post.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much debate within Blair's ``Cool Britannia''
government about making poetry more accessible by installing a less
highbrow ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists, however, have howled at the prospect of
changing a job that since 1692 has offered a yearly stipend of 100
pounds, which was good money 307 years ago but is a considerably
less impressive honorarium today.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the poet laureate's prime responsibility has been
to pen verse to commemorate state events, such as royal weddings.
There is some pressure to have the new laureate in place for next
month's wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   While Queen Elizabeth II will name the new laureate, she will
effectively be announcing Blair's selection. Under British
parliamentary law, one of the powers specifically invested in the
prime minister is forwarding the laureate's name to the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney was initially a
government favorite, especially given Blair's efforts to bring
about peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. But Heaney took
himself out of the running because while he was born in
British-controlled Northern Ireland, he carries an Irish passport
and could not swear loyalty to a monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office has floated ideas about giving the
laureate's post a limited term, a change that traditionalists have
also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to The Daily Telegraph, the voice of the
British establishment that has campaigned against changing the
laureate's job description, Alan Howarth, the British arts
minister, dismissed suggestions that the government was determined
to create a ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can see no advantage in anything that would
impair the Poet Laureate's traditional resonance or the respect and
regard in which the office is held by the public,'' said Howarth.
``It is inconceivable that we would wish anything to undermine this
precious literary legacy.''

<P>
   HONOLULU _ As the wind rose and the surf boiled and the last
light leached from the wide sky over Waikiki on Wednesday night,
Charlie Lambert, a prince of old Hawaii, went home to the waves he
loved.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, who died last month at 73 after battling emphysema and
a bad heart, made his living as a sales and convention manager for
the big waterfront hotels here. But for six years in the early
1950s _ and spiritually for the rest of his life _ he was a Waikiki
beach boy, among the last of a vanishing, century-old breed of
Hawaiian originals, part Sherpa, part big-game guide, part maitre
d' for the wealthy travelers who discovered these islands before
the age of jet travel and made this slender stretch of sand an
international playground.
</P>
<P>
   Charles David Kanaina Lambert, a rakish rogue who in old
photographs looks like a cross between Peter Lawford and William
Holden, could boogie with the best of them. He gave John Wayne a
surfing lesson and paddled an outrigger canoe for Frank Sinatra and
Ava Gardner on their honeymoon, with Sinatra's friend Sam Giancana
in tow. Like his brother beach boys, he put out towels and chairs
and umbrellas for the swells, often with a yellow plumeria blossom
tucked seductively behind his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that a knot of graying elders, along with some
buffed and tanned successors to the trade, came together at a
slate-gray sunset amid a parade of passing tourists to help
Lambert's family paddle his ashes out to sea _ to the spot the
beach boys call ``first break,'' where the blue Pacific curls up
into foaming white surf in sight of the shore. These funerals are
the most cherished ritual of Waikiki culture and are practiced with
precision, from the long green ti leaves tucked along the gunwales
of the outrigger canoe to the fragrant leis of white ginger
blossoms tossed onto the water with the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was so Hawaii for me,'' his daughter Cindy, who now
lives in Los Angeles, told the group of mourners clustered together
against a sudden shower, her voice catching as she struggled to
control her emotions. ``I said, `Dad, when you die, where do I look
for you?' He said, `Put your feet in the water and I'll kiss your
toes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The beach boys were the crack troops that made Waikiki work in
the lazy days before World War II, when there were just two grand
hotels on the beach (the Moana and the Royal Hawaiian), when the
travelers came by steamship and dispensed $100 tips, and when
``Aloha'' was a gracious way of life and not a commercial slogan.
Beginning at the turn of the century, these watermen revived
surfing and canoe racing, the ancient sports of Hawaiian kings that
had been all but stamped out by Calvinist missionaries, who
complained that such pursuits encouraged nudity and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A true beach boy's life really revolved around the ocean and
his relationship to it,'' said Grady Timmons, a former sportswriter
for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and author of ``Waikiki Beachboy,''
a 1989 coffee table book to which Lambert contributed. ``That is
why the funeral is so significant. You're taking the beach boy back
to the one thing that's a constant. Waikiki has changed a lot over
the years, but the ocean is still there. He's returning to his
friends. Most of them are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's on-shore friends all attested to his qualities of
grace, and he apparently came by them naturally. Of mixed Hawaiian
and ``haole,'' or Caucasian, heritage, he traced his lineage to the
line of King Lunalilo and was a great-grandson of Queen
Lili'uokalani, the islands' last monarch, who was overthrown by the
United States in 1893. He was friends with all the greats of the
beach, including Duke Kahanamoku, the Jazz Age Olympic swimming
champion who was regarded as the father of international surfing
and was godfather to another of Lambert's three daughters, Lisa, an
antiques dealer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie was a gentleman, really special, old school,'' said
Claire Heen Cameron, Miss Hawaii of 1953, who with her friend
Sandra Lee-Song held exquisitely scented gardenia blossoms in
tribute to Lambert's practice of handing them out ``to every lady
he saw,'' in his days as a public relations official for the Royal
Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth in tourism that brought a new kind of
discount traveler to Waikiki took its toll on the old beach boys'
suave style as a new breed of freelance competitors brought an air
of cutthroat hustle. By 1959, the television host Arthur Godfrey, a
Waikiki regular, branded the beach ``a Coney Island with palm
trees,'' and his outburst led to licensing requirements and tests
for lifesaving and water skills that remain in force today.
</P>
<P>
   Waikiki may no longer be the favored retreat of Hollywood stars
and captains of commerce, and beach boys may no longer strum
ukuleles at sunset, but the tradition continues in its way, in a
place where surf boards are lined up outside the Elks Club.
</P>
<P>
   At Lambert's funeral, Harry S. Robello, at 81 perhaps the dean
of the old school, stood at the edge of the crowd, quietly
appraising the proceedings. But his son, Harry D. Robello, 37, the
owner of Aloha Beach Service, the oldest concession on the beach,
was right in the thick of things, supervising the launching of the
funeral canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' the younger Robello said of his life, as his
9-year-old son, Ryan, the next generation in training, scampered
around him on the sand. ``You live day to day. You're never going
to make a great living. But you have a great life.''

FINNERAN, KRAFT APPEAR FRIENDLY AT LUNCHEON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They did not say much publicly, but when House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft
smiled, laughed, shook hands, and got touchy-feely in public
Thursday, it created quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 250 of Boston's highest-profile business people at
the Boston Harbor Hotel, Massachusetts' consummate Odd Couple
looked more like old buddies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they appeared downright convivial.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought a long war over the appropriate level and use of
public finances for a new stadium for the National Football League
team, the two men have largely been considered enemies in the
public eye. And in a state where revenge sometimes seems to be the
most popular participant sport, who would ever have thought that
Finneran's arm would be seen publicly around Kraft's shoulder, or
that Kraft would grasp the speaker's hand well after shaking it?
And what about all of the laughter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable!'' exclaimed the chief executive of one company,
as others literally pointed at the scene and whispered to their
lunch companions in the hotel's Wharf Room.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Finneran sat at the same table for a luncheon speech
by Ted Turner, the Time Warner vice chairman, to the Boston
Colleges Chief Executives Club. Before the speech, Finneran
approached Kraft who was already seated.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft looked up, smiled, and shook hands with Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran crouched slightly, put his arm around Kraft's shoulder
and both began a four-and-a-half minute conversation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Finneran could be heard saying, ``There'll be a
hearing and then a vote Tuesday.'' That is the schedule of action
in the Legislature next week on a bill to spend $70 million in
infrastructure improvements in Foxborough for the proposed new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft nodded a lot, and had a few words of his own for Finneran.
At one point, he laughed and grasped Finneran's forearm, while the
speaker's lips remained at Kraft's ear.
</P>
<P>
   It all was much different from the days when Finneran referred
directly to Kraft as ``a whiny millionaire'' _ before publicly
apologizing for the comment after being taken to task for it by his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hunter, a spokesman for the Boston College group, said
Thursday that seating assignments were made by the college after
consideration was given to who would attend, and their prominence
in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Finneran were at the head table with Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Reverend J. Donald Monan, the chancellor of BC and member of a
group of six civic leaders who put the Patriots' stadium issue back
on the agenda, had nothing to do with bringing the men together,
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Monan was at an adjacent table, his seat less than 15 feet
away. At the same table with Kraft and Finneran was another member
of the group of six, William F. Connell, a developer and
industrialist. Another member of the civic group, Wayne A. Budd,
group president of Bell Atlantic, was at a second adjacent table.
</P>
<P>
   When the luncheon was over, Kraft apologized for having little
to say about his conversation with Finneran, or the buzz it created
in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to say much about it, now,'' Kraft said,
still smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker both thoughtful and magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had one disagreement in all of those years: the proper
use of taxpayers' dollars for a football stadium. And on that
issue, we have agreed to disagree. In the course of such
disagreements, sometimes the wrong things are said.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his prominent, public conversation with Kraft was a bit
of a coming out for both men, Finneran grinned broadly and said,
``It was nice to see him.''

 &HT;    IOC papers turn focus to member dossiers
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The release Tuesday of personal notes compiled on his
peers by an embattled International Olympic Committee member from
Australia has focused attention on confidential dossiers produced
by Olympic bid groups.
</P>
<P>
   The practice dates back at least to the late 1980s, when Atlanta
bidders assembled files on the IOC voters, their families and their
preferences among the candidate cities for the 1996 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The notes made public in Sydney by Michael Knight, the city's
Olympic committee president, include details such as IOC members'
marital problems, personalities, moods and smoking and eating
habits. They were compiled by Phil Coles, who faces possible
expulsion from the IOC for accepting favors from Salt Lake
officials. Coles is suspected of passing the files on to the
successful Salt Lake bid team for the 2002 Winter Games. Coles, a
member of the Sydney group that won the 2000 Summer Olympics,
denied sharing the information with Salt Lake and accused Knight of
trying to run him off. The files were co-authored by Coles'
partner, Patricia Rosenbrock.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bid team's approach apparently dealt with IOC
members' interests, their children and gifts that would appeal to
them, according to documents contained in the first nine boxes of
Olympic records unsealed at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   On one ``IOC Update,'' dated Nov. 29, 1989, it was noted that
the daughter of IOC member Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye from the Ivory
Coast was getting married and that ``Mayor (Andrew) Young should
give gift.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was noted that Guirandou-N'Diaye ``has recently been in
the hospital while visiting Melbourne.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes on David Sibandze from Swaziland included these:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``His son is interested in attending Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We sent him two Bill Cosby books _ did he receive them?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Billy Payne should ask him about returning to Atlanta in May
after he visits Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze's son ended up at the University of Utah, where he
received tuition assistance from Salt Lake officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta dossiers illustrated a strategy of heavy courtship
and multiple invitations to visit the city. One on Jean-Claude
Ganga of the Republic of Congo suggested to ``ask if Danielle &AMP;
Vicki would like to come to Atlanta for another visit, as they are
in school in Canada and cannot go home often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ganga notes also issued a reminder: ``Need to update him on
equipment that he requested for the School Games to be held Easter
1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Maynard Jackson presented crates of sports equipment and
clothing to Ganga, the Congolese minister of sports, apparently for
use at the National Interscholastic Games in March 1990. Jackson
also presented an electronic stadium scoreboard, which was funded
by the Coca-Cola Co., according to a U.S. state department
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze and Ganga are among several members mentioned in the
Atlanta files who either have been expelled by the IOC or resigned
after being accused of taking improper gifts, favors or direct cash
payments from the Salt Lake City bid committee. Guirandou-N'Diaye
received a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Notes on some members were missing from the ``IOC update''
document, which was contained in the files of Nancy Newton, a bid
team member in charge of international relations.
</P>
<P>
   The documents unveiled Tuesday in Sydney portrayed a different
approach. For example, Rosenbrock labeled Greek IOC member Lambis
Nikolaou as being ``very temperamental _ emphasis on mental.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Lamine Kieta of Mali, who has been expelled, was
``more than prepared to take advantage of any expense allowance.
Not to be trusted I believe _ but said he supports Salt Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles has been reprimanded for benefiting from excessive
hospitality from the Salt Lake bid and is under investigation for
claims he received expensive jewelry from Athens' failed bid for
the 1996 Summer Games.

CLINTON ENVISIONS KOSOVO REBUILDING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed a postwar rebuilding
effort in Kosovo and other parts of southeastern Europe Thursday
that would be comparable, he suggested, to the Marshall Plan.
Efforts to negotiate an end to the war, meanwhile, continued slowly
on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials distributed a videotape of 150 soldiers who
had reportedly left Kosovo, attempting to show a partial pullout
was under way. But NATO spokesman Jamie Shea in Brussels said the
event was staged and meaningless. Some 40,000 Yugoslav troops
remain in Kosovo, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech to veterans in Washington, again laid out
the rationale for the air raids, comparing President Slobodan
Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Albanians in Kosovo to the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic
extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related _ both vicious,
premeditated, systematic oppression, fueled by religious and ethnic
hatred,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the US deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, met
with Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy to the Balkans. After the
meeting, Chernomyrdin said, ``We have moved closer to a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to gauge the state of the negotiations because
Russia is in turmoil over the impeachment proceedings against
President Boris N. Yeltsin and his firing of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said there had been no breakthrough in
the talks, and Russia's UN ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, said no
resolution on a Kosovo peace plan can pass the Security Council
until the bombing has stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for a second day in a row, threatened to withdraw
Russia from diplomatic efforts to find a political settlement if
NATO continues to bomb Yugoslavia over Moscow's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made the remarks at a meeting Thursday with visiting
French President Jacques Chirac, who later said that ``nothing
would be worse than if Russia left this negotiating process.''
Chirac added, however, that he saw no indications that Russia was
actually planning to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials, still angry over last week's accidental
bombing of their embassy in Belgrade, remained adamant that the
bombing of Yugoslavia should stop before they will back a truce
plan. But NATO warplanes continued to hit targets throughout the
region, shelling a number of sites in Kosovo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Without providing any specifics, Clinton called for a massive
rebuilding program in Kosovo and neighboring areas affected by the
war, suggesting that the effort would be comparable to the Marshall
Plan following World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southeastern Europe after the Cold War was free but poor. As
long as they are poor, they will offer a less compelling
counterweight to the kind of ethnic exclusivity and oppression that
Mr. Milosevic preaches,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believed the Marshall Plan worked, then we have to work
with our European allies to rebuild southeastern Europe and give
them an economic future that will pull them together,'' the
president told 200 members of Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   In light of prior statements by Clinton that NATO is not trying
to replace Milosevic, Clinton's proposal for a postwar aid program
prompted questions about whether Milosevic might benefit from the
plan. White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart declined to rule out
the possibility that Milosevic's government would get the aid, but
he cast doubt on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine that as we look into the future, that the
rest of Europe would be looking to work cooperatively with an
autocratic regime that could perpetrate the kind of atrocities that
have been done over the last several years,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that Kosovo should be an autonomous region but
remain part of Yugoslavia, while the Kosovo Liberation Army wants a
separate state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech, aimed at shoring up public support for the
NATO attacks, came a day after the White House hired a new public
relations consultant, Leslie Dach, for the temporary job of
improving the administration's communications about Kosovo. Dach,
vice chairman of Edelman Worldwide, is a well-known figure in
Washington who once was communications director for Michael S.
Dukakis's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled Friday to visit the Brazda
refugee camp near Skopje, Macedonia, that has 18,700 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mary Robinson, UN high commissioner for human rights,
was denied her request to meet with Milosevic in Belgrade. Robinson
said she had collected evidence that ``people in uniform'' had
driven many ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of the cases, I asked, `Was it the bombing?' and I was
told `No, it was not.' I have to conclude that there must be some
reason why President Milosevic did not wish to meet me. I certainly
wanted to meet him,'' said Robinson, who also expressed concern
about civilian casualties caused by NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his speech, detailed stories of killings in Kosovo.
He also opposed the view the United States has no business
intervening in ethnic conflicts in the Balkans that have been
raging for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, myself, have been guilty of saying that on an occasion or
two, and I regret it now more than I can say,'' Clinton said. ``The
truth is that for centuries these people have lived together in the
Balkans and southeastern Europe with greater or lesser degree of
tensions, but often without anything approaching the intolerable
conditions or conflicts that exist today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the conflict has occurred because ``people with
organized political and military power decide it is in their
interest'' to foster hatred among ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   --Delegates at a meeting of Germany's Greens Party voted 444-318
in support of the NATO bombing. But in a bow to pacifists, the
motion also urged NATO to temporarily halt bombing and push for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   --A group of 47 ethnic Albanians crossed the border into
Macedonia Thursday and said that hundreds of others were stranded
at railway stations, prevented from leaving Kosovo by the Serbian
military. The refugees said that homes are being torched by the
Serbs and that some ethnic Albanians are hiding in their basements.
</P>
<P>
   --A Yugoslav official disputed UN reports that nearly 1 million
refugees have fled Kosovo. ``There are not more than 300,000 of
them, including those in Macedonia, Albania and Yugoslavia,'' said
the official, Ivica Dacic, of the Socialist Party.

 &HT;    Modern styles snatch second looks at High Point furniture market
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ As with fame, most things about Hollywood are
fleeting. Stars rise and fall. Marriages, like hair colors, come
and go.
</P>
<P>
   But remnants of Tinseltown's golden age of glamour endure in
furnishings made popular in the '20s, '30s and '40s _ art deco and
Art Moderne styles that graced silver screens around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the understated elegance of pieces with clean, sleek
lines and more graceful curves than Rita Hayworth have remained so
popular that designers are paying tribute to the period with more
retro-influenced furnishings than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Leather was among a half-dozen manufacturers showing new
interpretations of the era last month at the spring International
Home Furnishings Market in High Point, N.C. Cinema giant
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer licensed the company, which last year
introduced its Titanic collection, to create a line that captures
the glamour, romance and excitement of old Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about taking people into a world of Hollywood that wasn't
superficial but would last,'' said Linda Berman, manager of MGM's
consumer products division. ``Furniture was a serious player in
that world.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's a serious player as retro rages and furniture
makers close their sketchbooks on a century of design. For fans of
modern, first popularized with elegant French art deco designs at
the 1925 Paris Exposition, its endurance lies in sharp curves,
simple lines and rectilinear shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retro refers to the most beautiful modern things that we've
done in the past,'' fashion-turned-furniture designer Bob Mackie
said during a panel discussion on trends.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are banking on consumers wanting to cull the best of
modern design for homes they will decorate in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   When MGM approached Classic Leather about designing a line
inspired by Hollywood, ``It was a no-brainer,'' said Ron Freeman,
business development director for the leather manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Zenie, a former fashion designer, tapped into the
moviemaker's extensive archive of 5,100 films produced over 75
years to design the 32-piece Classic Collection, including a bed,
sofa, dining room table and chairs, upholstered chairs and coffee
tables. But instead of re-creating pieces from particular films,
Zenie went for the overall mood of the period with clean lines and
understated style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to put myself in the shoes of a designer of the
period,'' said Zenie. ``I didn't want it to look all art deco.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft, luxurious fabrics, including velvet, mohair, leather and
Ultrasuede, envelope sofas and chairs in plush elegance, while
maple and black-lacquered finishes make the line versatile enough
to be dressed up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are practical for today's lifestyles. Zenie designed
a coffee table, for example, in six cubes, each of which can be
pulled out and used as an accent table or stool. End tables feature
shelves. ``I'm obsessed with having space,'' the designer said.
</P>
<P>
   A companion Hollywood collection, On Location, includes 21
pieces designed after furnishings featured in MGM movies filmed in
Africa. Light eucalyptus wood and rustic rattan give the line a
feel of the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices are expected to range from $250 for a campaign
folding chair in the On Location line to $2,500 for a Manhattan
cocktail table in the Classic Collection.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in furniture knows glamour, it's Larry Laslo. The
flamboyant New York interior designer, whose creations several
years ago for Directional included pieces named for Marilyn Monroe
and Jean Harlow, introduced a retro line at last fall's market for
Bexley Heath by John Widdicomb. At this market, he expanded the
Moderne Collection to include a dining table and chairs and a
mahogany-based sofa, club chair and ottoman.
</P>
<P>
   Art deco-style woven Jacquard covers the dining chairs, and the
feet on others are boxy, with an Oriental flavor. Subtle fabric
patterns and bleached sycamore give the line a fresh, modern look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all simple, cleaned up and pared down,'' said Laslo, who
never misses an opportunity to toss a little drama into his sofas
and chairs in the form of a fake fur.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Wolf also expanded his designs of modern-style
furnishings for Carson's. Wolf, one of the country's most published
designers, introduced his 20th Century Collection last year. His
newest pieces include a sectional sofa, which has found a new
following not only because of the retro revolution but because
family rooms have grown. Wolf's sofa is sold in a range of fabrics,
including velvet, chenille and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Designer John Mascheroni unveiled a kidney-shaped sofa, nearly
10 feet long, for Swaim, while Thayer Coggin introduced Jake, a new
lounge chair by Ransom Culler.
</P>
<P>
   Carson's also was ready to ride into the future. In addition to
the Wolf line, the company was showing Harley, a squatty armchair
with bulky arms designed to resemble a bike. Upholstered in a
two-tone suede, the chair is pitched so that it swallows its
occupant in cozy comfort. Talk about a throwback.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like furniture designs are moving backward instead
of forward as the millennium nears, look at it this way: ``We're
still going to be looking backward, but it's really more a
re-examination of the century, an attempt to put an exclamation
mark on it,'' designer Jena Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of those designs will continue into the next
century.''

 &HT;    Century-end furniture designs draw on simpler French, Asian
influences
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ If you're wondering where furnishings, like
fashions, are headed as the calendar turns to a new century, think
east _ as in France and beyond to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Not French as in ornate, heavily gilded pieces, or Oriental as
in highly lacquered, exotic ones. Think a casual French cottage,
influenced by the garden; and a softer, cleaner and simpler Asian
that carries a contemporary flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're traveling, remember the curvy modern lines of
the 1920s, '30s and '40s, when the glamour of art deco was
prevalent in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of casual elegance in what's happening, in
that we're turning back to the classic lines of the modern
period,'' designer Vladimir Kagan said during last month's
International Home Furnishings Market.
</P>
<P>
   French casual, modern Asian and retro influences were three of
the major directions furnishings seem to be taking at the world's
largest wholesale trade expo.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz on the streets of High Point, where more than 75,000
manufacturers, retailers, designers and media flock twice a year to
see what's headed to stores, was so thick with French you'd expect
to hear bonjour.
</P>
<P>
   The French they were describing was still elegant but more
relaxed, with the casual look of the provincial countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Among about a dozen manufacturers introducing French-inspired
designs was Highland House, which unveiled its Rue de Provence
collection. The 35 pieces are inspired by regional Provencal
antiques and colorful fabrics of the Mediterranean region. Buyers
could almost smell the rosemary and lavender as they touched the
multilayered stripes, florals and prints of bright red, blue and
yellow toile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a really fun, colorful feel,'' said Robin Tucker, a
company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Woods sported the aged whitewashed and rust finishes that have
become so popular among garden-inspired pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finishes are what's really attracting people to this
look,'' said Suzanne Pruitt, a spokeswoman for Toccoa-based
Habersham, which introduced its Cottage Collection.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-painted pieces draw on the country look, with crackled
and weathered finishes or colorful garden-inspired motifs. Many are
large amoires that make quite a statement as accent pieces that can
be mixed with a variety of other styles.

   Bairstow Designs honed in on country French with its new Colors
of Provence collection of hand-painted tables and chairs with woven
grass seats and 10 finishes. ``It's barefoot elegance,'' said Mary
Bairstow, president of the Atlanta company. ``Americans are
learning from Europeans that mixing pieces brings a casualness to
formal furnishings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even major manufacturers such as Stanley and Stickley jumped on
the Provence-bound bandwagon. Stanley showed its Mirabeau bedroom
and dining room line in relaxed warm brown finishes, while Stickley
launched its Directoire Collection of solid cherry and
walnut-accented pieces, featuring clean, simple lines.
</P>
<P>
   That simplicity was present in Asian-inspired furnishings as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Stressed-out Americans are paying homage to Zen principles,
simplifying their surroundings and creating spaces for meditation.
That atmosphere calls for scaled-down, simple designs that make for
a contemporary look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tranquil, Asian look with exotic Burmese, Indonesian
designs that tie in with the whole globetrotting and collecting
movement going on these days,'' said Mark McMenamin, merchandising
and business editor for the trade journal Home Accents Today.
``It's not difficult to take these designs and make them more
contemporary, so you end up with a more modern Asian flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most contemporary looks, Asian pieces can be mixed with
other styles to create an eclectic interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian has really evolved,'' said Paige Smith of PierceMartin,
an Atlanta manufacturer of wicker, rattan and iron furnishings and
importer of antiques from Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia.
``We're taking everyday things from Asian life and combining them
with other furnishings.''
</P>
<P>
   Elephant saddles that double as coffee tables. Old tribal drums
refinished as accessories. Lamps made from old pots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying more individual pieces rather than entire
collections, as they do in fashion with sportswear,'' said Jena
Hall, among the designers at the market asked to forecast trends.
</P>
<P>
   And as the millennium approaches, they're turning to the best of
all styles of design, collecting pieces that carry nostalgic
sentiments of special times in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Retro influences were larger than ever at High Point _ and
should grow even larger, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really more a re-examination of the century, an attempt
to put a punctuation on it,'' she said. ``The best of these pieces
will continue into the next century.''

 &HT;    Pond makes the back yard a cool splash of relaxation
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    Photos by Jean Shefrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Creating a pond for your yard is as simple as buying a
fiberglass shell and filling it with water.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it also requires a little digging and a vision of
what you want the finished pond to look like. So all the necessary
landscaping materials should be purchased ahead of time. Perhaps
the most difficult part of the job is finding family or friends to
help with the labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a minimum of two people. The more, the merrier,''
said Dan Wooley, assistant manager at Lowe's Home Improvement
Warehouse in Woodstock (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A preformed plastic or fiberglass shell
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A two-by-four
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A level
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A pond filter and fountain kit in size appropriate for pond
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An extension cord for outdoor use
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A water hose that can extend from water socket to the pond
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sand (enough to pack underneath and around pond)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tools (shovels, rakes, gloves and other digging tools )
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pond decor (rocks, plants, fish, flowers, etc., to landscape
around pond)
</P>
<P>
   Step 1:
</P>
<P>
   1. Place preformed pond shell on the ground, right side up. In
the ground, mark the circumference of the pond shell bottom and, if
the shape of the pond shell angles out, the circumference of its
top. Dig a hole that mimics the silhouette of the shell, angling
out from the inside marks to the outside marks and allowing for 2
inches of fill to be added later around the shell. Dig the hole the
approximate depth of the shell. Using a level, make sure the hole
is flat.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2:
</P>
<P>
   2. When bottom is even, add a 2-inch layer of damp sand. Spread
sand evenly along bottom. Sand will help pond shell fit snugly in
the hole and protect the fiberglass shell.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3:
</P>
<P>
   3. Carefully lower the shell into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4:
</P>
<P>
   4. Lay a two-by-four on its edge across the shell and use a
level to recheck that it lies flat.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5:
</P>
<P>
   5. Slowly fill pond with water. Meanwhile, backfill around the
pond with remaining sand and dirt. Add 4 inches of sand and soil
around the shell, then 4 inches of water to the pond. Check shell
to make sure it is still level. If so, continue to backfill. If
not, remove or add backfill. Check level periodically until water
reaches top. It's important to make sure pond stays level until it
is full.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6:
</P>
<P>
   6. When pond is almost full, plug pond filter into a power
source. Place filter and fountain in the middle of the pond. Turn
on so filter can circulate water.
</P>
<P>
   Step 7:
</P>
<P>
   7. Place rocks, plants, flowers and other landscaping material
around border of the pond to give it a finished look.
</P>
<P>
   Step 8:
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the finished pond.

 &HT;    WebMD shifts gears, cancels plan for IPO
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD, one of the hottest Internet plays in Atlanta,
has for the second time pulled back from the brink of an initial
public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, which hopes to become the leading
site for health care information on the Net, filed a formal request
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw its
much-ballyhooed IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This request is made because the company has decided to pursue
a strategy that does not involve the offer and sale of its shares
to the public,'' wrote Jeffrey Arnold, WebMD chairman and chief
executive, in the SEC document, which was dated May 12.
``Therefore, the company has decided not to engage in an initial
public offering at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   An IPO had originally been slated for early May, then was
delayed before being shelved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was not available after filing the statement. Other
company officials, who have said nothing this week, said there
would be no comment beyond the written statement to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors about the company have been swirling for weeks, and
the retreat from a lucrative IPO can only feed still more frantic
speculation. A similar, if less well-publicized, IPO filing last
summer was withdrawn when the market turned suddenly chilly. But
since then, the climate has reversed, and numerous Net-related
companies have soared in sometimes-delirious trading.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WebMD launched its Internet business and chalked up a
series of deals with large players. WebMD registered for an IPO in
February, hoping to raise up to $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the launch seems to have been canceled _ or at least
postponed _ not for lack of likely investment but the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft had committed
to paying $300 million in exchange for 27 percent of WebMD. That
report was never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, CNBC's David Faber reported Microsoft had
failed to strike a deal, but that continued talks indicated the
market value for the young company was climbing past the $2.5
billion mark.
</P>
<P>
   And where Microsoft is sniffing, other investors may not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   An IPO is typically a way for a young and unproven company to
trade control for cash, raising money that can bankroll operations
and expansion until its budding business takes off. An IPO also
lets early investors and executives turn at least some of their
shares into hefty checks.
</P>
<P>
   But WebMD, whose business by most accounts is not near
profitability, has already turned its promise into some cash. Most
impressively, the company announced a five-year, $220 million
investment by DuPont, which will hold two seats on the WebMD board.
</P>
<P>
   And if WebMD is poised for an injection anywhere in the
neighborhood north of $300 million, an IPO right now seems
unneeded. The early investors can surely get whatever payoff they
need, while the company grows. Assuming WebMD succeeds, it can bide
its time for a still more lucrative IPO in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As for the chances of success, there's no guarantee. But what
better indicators than an aggressive business plan, piles of cash
and the imprimatur of Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   WebMD at first conceived a two-pronged strategy, going after
consumers to be sure, but expecting to make its money serving
doctors and other professionals who would be charged for various
services and special professionals-only information.
</P>
<P>
   But over the months, that strategy seems to have morphed until
the emphasis has seemingly come to rest on consumers who will
access the free side of the site. That shift to the consumers
expecting free access means advertising is key, and that means that
brand recognition matters.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has deals with Lycos and CNN, as well as various providers
of health care information. Each deal adds content to the WebMD
site, each adding reasons that a Net surfer would visit
www.WebMD.com. And the more visits and the more eyes that ``drill
down'' into the site, the more WebMD can charge advertisers for
space.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is not entering an empty field. Scores of entrepreneurs
have noticed that health care, which accounts for 14 percent of the
nation's $6 trillion-a-year economy, could be a monstrous market on
the Net as well. Hundreds of sites have emerged as competitors for
that market, but thus far, none is dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Among a slew of rivals are Atlanta companies like ADAM.com and
Medcast.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders have some brand recognition of their own,
including sites of the Mayo Clinic and former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.

 &HT;    Tuscan sun is still burning bright for author
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances Mayes had a hunch her book ``Under the Tuscan Sun''
would do well. But she didn't realize her epicurean travelogue
about restoring a 200-year-old Italian villa would sell 900,000
copies and become a darling of book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was a real mania for Italy,'' says Mayes, a South
Georgia native who lives in San Francisco but spends her summers in
Tuscany. ``More than 600,000 Americans go to Tuscany every year.
That's one reason the book sold. But readers also tell me they like
the fact that I took a risk in midlife and did something like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayes admits that buying the run-down stone farmhouse in 1985
could have been a disaster. The building was picturesque, but the
wiring and plumbing and almost everything else needed replacing.
Ignoring her friends' advice, Mayes and her partner, San Francisco
poet Ed Kleinschmidt, bought the house and began tearing out walls,
replacing pipes and sweeping out hordes of scorpions and spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the house and writing the book were just the therapy
she needed, says Mayes, who had just gone through a nasty divorce.
``Part of this whole thing was a quest to re-establish a new
identity. When you change a house, you're changing your own image
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mayes has moved to a new home in San Francisco _ one that
needs renovating _ and written ``Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in
Italy'' (Broadway, $25), a continuation of her first book. Filled
with recipes from Italy and reminiscences about her childhood in
Fitzgerald, ``Bella Tuscany'' is a celebration of the Italian
people and the ``voluptuousness'' of Italian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the first time I was able to live there during
the spring,'' says Mayes, who is on leave for a year from her
teaching post at San Francisco State University to write a novel
set in South Georgia. ``I discovered new tastes for my spring
kitchen such as the fresh fava beans and artichokes. There's a big
emphasis on food in Cortona. That's one thing that reminds me of my
hometown. If we weren't cooking food, we were talking about what we
were going to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayes will sign her book at 7 tonight at Chapter 11 in Peachtree
Battle Shopping Center, 2345-A Peachtree Road N.E., 404-237-7199.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW LIST: We've had the 100 greatest novels and 100 greatest
nonfiction books of the century. Now the Publishing Triangle has
assembled a team of 14 judges, including award-winning author
Dorothy Allison, to select the 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels.
This will not be just another list, says Charles Flowers, chairman
of the Publishing Triangle, an association of lesbians and gay men
in publishing. ``We hope this list will provoke debate about how to
define a `gay book' and the implications of such a category.
Consider the recent success of Michael Cunningham's `The Hours,' a
wonderful book which some readers are considering `gay' while
others are considering `crossover.' Where does the line between gay
and straight fall?''
</P>
<P>
   The list will be announced the first week of June, and readers
will be invited to respond to the selections on the Web site www
</P>
<P>
   .publishingtriangle.org to create a readers' choice list.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND OPERA: In 1920, Enrico Caruso was performing in the opera
``Aida'' when a bomb explosion rocked the Teatro Nacional in
Havana. A dazed Caruso was seen wandering the streets after the
incident, and then he disappeared for several days. Drawing on this
mystery, Cuban-born Mayra Montero has written ``The Messenger''
(HarperCollins, $24), a novel that blends African santeria and
Chinese magic with the few known facts to explain the great tenor's
disappearance. In Montero's fictional version of the events, a
beautiful Chinese woman named Aida Cheng rescues Caruso and briefly
becomes his lover, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Aida's
godfather, an Afro-Cuban santero named Jose de Calazan.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a television writer and actor, Montero, 47, is a
former journalist who was a visiting lecturer at Emory University
last semester. She will sign her book at 7 p.m. Tuesday at
Wordsworth Booksellers in Decatur, 2112 N. Decatur Road,
404-633-4275.
</P>
<P>
   HEALING THE WOUNDS: For 45 years, not even neighbors in Phenix
City, Ala., would discuss the night that Alabama Attorney
General-elect Albert Patterson was assassinated. ``That time is
like an open wound,'' says Phenix City Mayor Peggy Martin, who was
a young girl when criminal elements controlled the town and
prostitution and gambling were rampant. Now, Martin says, the wound
is beginning to heal because of Margaret Anne Barnes' book ``The
Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama'' (Mercer
University Press, $24.95). Barnes' account of the town's struggle
to rid itself of corruption has sparked a needed dialogue, the
mayor says. In honor of the book, the Decatur writer will be given
a key to the city in a 2 p.m. ceremony Sunday at the Buchanan
House, 1040 Broad St.

 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 16.

 &HT;    Author's latest novel explores lost chance for racial
reconciliation following Civil War
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 16.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Cold Mountain'' began rising to the top of best-seller
lists in 1997, Charles Price got a sinking feeling. The North
Carolina author, who has written one critically acclaimed novel
about the Civil War, was nearly finished with his second when
Charles Frazier's book rolled into stores like a Union juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crestfallen,'' says Price, 60, who lives in a mountain
cabin north of Asheville. ``I thought my book would get
overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Price has no illusions that his ``Freedom's Altar''
(John F. Blair, $19.95) will be the phenomenon that ``Cold
Mountain'' was, early reviews have been laudatory.
</P>
<P>
   In Publishers Weekly, the national trade magazine for
booksellers, a critic wrote that Price's novel ``eloquently
addresses questions of race and class and morality, poignantly
exploring whether hope and loyalty can exist in a world where war
has damaged lives irrevocably.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hodges, a literary columnist for the Durham, N.C.,
Herald-Sun, was equally impressed. ``It was extremely well
written,'' Durham says. ``It was a tighter, shorter `Cold
Mountain.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Frazier's novel chronicles the odysseys of two lovers
separated by the war, Price's book focuses on the aftermath of the
conflict, when former slaves and masters attempt to get along.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, Union Army soldier and former slave Daniel
McFee has returned home to propose a sharecropping venture with his
former master, Judge Madison Curtis. The judge is surprised that
the man he once owned seems to regard him now with less friendship
and respect. Meanwhile, a madman called Nahum Bellamy the Pilot
rides roughshod through the country, whipping freed slaves into a
frenzy and seeking revenge on former Rebel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Price, whose first novel, ``Hiwassee'' (Academy Chicago
Publishers, $20), dealt with the war itself, decided to examine the
moral question of slavery in this sequel. ``In particular I wanted
to explore what seemed to me a lost opportunity for racial
reconciliation in the South immediately after the war,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of Reconstruction, Price says, they think of
the period after 1867 when Congress imposed Radical Reconstruction.
But immediately after the war, he says, the South could have chosen
its own course in regard to the races.
</P>
<P>
   Both novels are loosely based on Price's family. In the first,
he traces the careers of his great-great-grandfather Oliver Price
and three of his great-great uncles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in there is verified by my research,'' he says. ``I
tried to imagine what it was like on the home front. I did research
on what was happening in North Carolina and North Georgia. I also
wanted to explore the ethical and moral questions of folks who
owned no slaves at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some other Southerners, Price's great-great grandfather was
opposed to slavery but still felt duty-bound to fight for the
Confederacy. In ``Freedom's Altar,'' Oliver Price represents the
poor white man who is seeking a place in the newly emancipated
society.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Methodist minister, Price worked as a journalist,
urban planner and lobbyist before retiring to write fiction.
Divorced and childless, he quit his job as a lobbyist about four
years ago and began writing full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided I was going to do it, although sometimes I wake
up in the middle of the night with cold sweat on my brow.''

 &HT;    Magic is missing from this `Dream'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sexy cast, a classic play, the sensuous Tuscan countryside.
How could ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' misfire? Blame it on
director Michael Hoffman, whose picturesque but pedestrian approach
dims the sparkle of William Shakespeare's script.
</P>
<P>
   The movie changes the play's ancient Athens to
turn-of-the-century Italy. In this predecessor of screwball comedy,
Christian Bale, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel and Dominic West are
the mismatched lovers who, on a long night in the woods, get
romantically mixed and matched by fairy king Oberon (Rupert
Everett) and his goaty henchman Puck (Stanley Tucci). Meanwhile, a
hammy actor named Bottom (Kevin Kline) becomes the donkey-headed
love object of the fairy queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), herself
a victim of Puck's spells.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kenneth Branagh's updatings of ``Hamlet'' and ``Much Ado
About Nothing,'' the transplants here don't make much organic
sense, starting with the setting of Mount Athens, Italy, to justify
the script's Athenian references. Bicycles play supporting roles,
though there's no big payoff. Hoffman's choices seem arbitrary, an
excuse to doll his mortal actors up in nice Edwardian duds. While
the director's ``Restoration'' was a visual feast, his enchanted
forest is strictly of the kitschy, glitter-and-greasepaint variety.
We get Hammer Horror sets, not-so-special effects and a fairy court
that moons around like an out-of-work circus troupe.
</P>
<P>
   As if some strange spell has been cast on the film itself,
everything seems slightly off kilter. The ``Dream'' of the title
seems too literal; the lines are well-spoken, but there's a sense
of sleepwalking vagueness to the story. The ever-actory Kline is a
perfect choice for the role of that uber-ham, Bottom, but even he
seems subdued in places. And though Hoffman tries to juice things
up with some scenic nudity, the movie isn't especially sexy or
funny. You know you're not dealing with a nuances comic director
when the cat fight between Helena and Hermia climaxes with a round
of mud-wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the end does the movie find a rare grace note, during
the comic coda featuring Bottom and his fellow actors staging a
wonderfully awful version of ``Pyramus and Thisbe.'' Sam Rockwell,
as the sketch's doomed heroine, expertly switches from his
vaudeville drag turn into a performance of unexpected poignancy.
The moment reminds us that even the silliest-seeming love affair
can, in an instant, become heartbreakingly powerful. It's a bit of
acting sleight of hand that delivers ``Dream'' one of its rare bits
of true magic.

   Too little, too late. Too bad.

 &HT;    `Trippin' ' stumbles over mixed message
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a student who parties every night but still expects to make
the honor roll, ``Trippin' '' is a movie that wants to have it both
ways. It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed message.
</P>
<P>
   Deon Richmond plays Greg, aka ``G,'' a high school senior whose
plans for college keep getting waylaid by his fantasies of living
the phat life, surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life
is to show him their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   G's parents try to snap him out of it, sliding college
applications under his nose. But he's too busy hanging with his
pals June (Donald Adeosun Faison) and Fish (Guy Torry) to think
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then he falls for Cinny (Maia Campbell), a smart, curvaceous
classmate. She already has a boyfriend, but G starts to win her
over. Their growing romance is something the movie makes us take on
faith; it's hard to buy Cinny falling for G, who's just an
overgrown kid. The idea, of course, is that G learns to grow up
through love, responsibility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice thought. So is the movie's stress on the importance
of education. But the message gets muddied by the nonstop fantasy
parade of T&AMP;A. ``Trippin' '' has genuine flashes of charm and
heart, but they're undermined by the filmmakers' pandering to the
basic instincts of its target teen audience. One dream scene
features a recruiter from a college called ``Morehoward,'' known as
``Mo Ho'' for short. And we get the spectacle of June turning a
naked woman into a banana split, via whipped cream and chocolate
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   When June calls a woman a ``bitch,'' the movie lets her punch
him out. He also gets his comeuppance from the many girls he's lied
to. Still, it doesn't compensate for the ways ``Trippin' ''
presents most of its women as playthings. Even Cinny never gets to
be more than an idealized dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's subplots has June getting pressed into service
by the neighborhood drug dealer. The plot seems to be an excuse to
trot out a ``Termin-ator''-style fantasy for G, an ammo-heavy
revenge scenario that's difficult to enjoy so soon after the
Littleton, Colo., slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for the record, this is another of the countless recent
teen flicks that climax at a prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin'''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Deon Richmond and Donald Adeosun Faison. Rated R
</P>
<P>
   for sexuality and language. At
</P>
<P>
   metro theaters. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Trips up on its awkward mix of positive message and
sleazy pandering.

 &HT;    David Mamet does `Winslow Boy' right
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Mamet, purveyor of conniving con artists and foul-mouthed
real estate salesmen, hardly seems anyone's ideal choice as the man
to film ``The Winslow Boy,'' a 1946 play by refined British
playwright Terence Rattigan.
</P>
<P>
   But, ever the trickster, Mamet turns out to be a perfect match
for the material. Much as in Mamet's own work _ this is his sixth
movie as a director but the first based on someone else's writing _
almost everything in ``The Winslow Boy'' happens off-screen. What's
on-screen is a superbly well-observed character study in which
events in themselves are secondary to their impact on the various
members of the Winslow family.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan's play, previously filmed in 1948 with Robert Donat and
Margaret Leighton, is loosely based on the true story of an
upper-middle-class Edwardian patriarch's fight to clear his
13-year-old son's name.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens _ the year is 1912 _ everything is as it
should be in Arthur Winslow's (Nigel Hawthorne) quietly prosperous
London home. Perhaps his older son, Dickie (Matthew Pidgeon), might
be more settled _ say, at the bank, like his father _ but he's
suitably enrolled at Oxford. And perhaps his only daughter,
Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon), might be less of an outspoken
feminist, but at least she's about to announce her engagement to an
acceptable young man.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the news: Young Ronnie (Guy Edwards) has been
expelled from Osbourne Naval College for stealing a five-shilling
postal note (American translation: pocket change).
</P>
<P>
   The boy says he's innocent. The father believes him. So much so
that he's willing to sacrifice everything _ his wealth, his
standing in the community, his family's happiness _ to see the
expulsion overturned in court.
</P>
<P>
   When the case is taken by Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam), a
barrister as flamboyant as he is famous, it becomes a national
cause. The Winslows are ridiculed, pilloried, even supported, but
in any event, they become virtual public property.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful thing about both the play and the film is that
Ronnie's true guilt or innocence is less the point than a subtle
yet poignantly relentless examination of the cost of seeking what
one feels is just. At what point does a fight for principle become
a kind of personal arrogance? It's made clear that the boy has
happily enrolled at another school. His past would be just that _
past _ if, as Mrs. Winslow (Gemma Jones) points out, her husband
could let things go. ``No one needed to know (of Ronnie's
expulsion) if you hadn't shouted it out loud,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much shouting out loud in ``The Winslow Boy.'' But
there's a hushed, well-bred urgency in almost every scene. Mamet
has handled what could've come off as an old chestnut astonishingly
well _ with care and thoughtfulness and a certain theatrical spark.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that his cast _ from Hawthorne's sadly brave Arthur to
Northam's surprisingly moral Morton _ is so good. The sole
exception is Rebecca Pidgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Married to Mamet in real life (she's also the sister of cast
member Matthew Pidgeon), she's appeared _ with varying degrees of
success _ in her husband's ``Homicide'' and ``The Spanish
Prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not terrible, but Catherine is such a plum role that one
longs for the ardent appeal of, say, a young Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Mamet's shortcomings aren't enough to ruin this
otherwise smart and oddly daring movie. ``Let Right Be Done''
becomes the national catch phrase for the boy's cause. In this
case, it has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy Northam. Directed by David
Mamet. Rated G. At Tara. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A winner.

 &HT;    `Double' divas make film that's easy on the ears
 &HT;    By Lyle Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The term ``diva'' has been hijacked by every bratty one-hit
wonder with a good agent and bad publicity, but Diana Ross puts
most of them to shame.
</P>
<P>
   After famously dumping the Supremes during Motown's heyday, Ross
has rarely shared a marquee, or her prodigious talent, with other
female vocalists. So it's a surprise to see her co-starring with
teeny-bop sensation Brandy Norwood in the ABC movie, ``Double
Platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Norwood has a new solo album, and although Ross hasn't had a hit
in years, this movie (which she executive produced) coincides with
the release of her latest album.
</P>
<P>
   Together, their music covers the 18-to-49 demographic TV
networks die for: Ross has a lock on baby boomers who have a copy
of ``Ain't No Mountain High Enough'' on vinyl, while Norwood
appeals to a younger set who grew up watching her UPN sitcom
``Moesha'' and buying her Grammy-winning CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Platinum'' is the improbable story of struggling
Atlanta nightclub singer Olivia Harris (Ross) who abandons her
infant daughter Kayla (Norwood) and perpetually ticked-off husband
to land a record deal in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 18 years later and Ross is star with millions of
fans, including the all grown up, but still unsuspecting Kayla who
(surprise!) wants to be a singer.
</P>
<P>
   They are re-united by a series of embarrassing plot
contrivances, and mom promises to help Kayla get in the recording
business. Kayla's career takes off and she falls for her adorable
handler Ric (Allen Payne), even as her resentment toward Olivia
simmers.
</P>
<P>
   To reveal more would spoil what little ``Double Platinum''
offers. The message is clear enough though: show biz is full of
slimy characters but your mama knows best _ even if she's one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure Ross and Norwood can act, but it's not a requirement for
what amounts to a two-hour music video with some annoying dialogue
thrown in. It's when Ross and Norwood sing that the movie briefly
soars.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' voice is as commanding and supple as ever. The rest of her
ain't too shabby either, and as proof there's a gratuitous shot of
her prancing around in her delicate undergarments.
</P>
<P>
   Less flattering aspects of Ross's persona are also intact
including the toothy-but-joyless grin, the unfortunate hairweave,
and the patented move in which she raises her arms triumphantly
after each song, giving us an unobstructed view of her
neatly-manicured pits.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood sings several hits from her own album, and her breathy
alto meshes perfectly with Ross' sexy, slippery soprano during a
closing duet ``Love is All that Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   As a movie, ``Double Platinum'' is not much to look at. But
listening to a bona fide diva like Ross, and a diva-in-the-making
like Norwood makes this one of the better TV movies we've heard in
a long time.
</P>

BUSH STEERING TEXAS MEDIA FOCUS AWAY FROM PRESIDENTIAL BID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has been trying to
lower state news media attention on his presidential bid,
threatened to walk out of a meeting with Longview civic leaders
this week because a local reporter was there taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really strange behavior,'' Longview News-Journal
Publisher Glenn McCutchen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCutchen said Bush was talking about his possible run for the
Republican presidential nomination when he spotted reporter Mike
Elswick. He said Bush demanded three times that Elswick stop taking
notes or the meeting with Longview leaders would be over.
</P>
<P>
   McCutchen was among about 25 Longview civic leaders who met Bush
at the Capitol on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's outburst with the Longview delegation fits a recent
pattern by Bush's staff to keep public focus on his job as governor
rather than his presidential exploratory bid as the state
Legislature enters its final weeks in session.
</P>
<P>
   Many events are being left off Bush's public schedule,
particularly if they have a political tone.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bush spoke of his presidential aspirations two
weeks ago to about 1,000 members of the Texas Federation of
Republican Women during a luncheon at the Austin Convention Center.
The meeting was open to the public, but no news media covered the
speech because it was not on the governor's public schedule so
reporters didn't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, his public schedule did not reflect the fund-raising
event Bush hosted last Saturday in Austin for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Nor did the schedule list the governor's
receipt of an award Wednesday before students, faculty and parents
of Austin High.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's schedule for this Saturday lists his commencement speech
at Southern Methodist University. However, it doesn't mention
Bush's featured role later that same day at a Texas Right to Life
Committee, $5,000-a-plate fund-raiser at The Mansion on Turtle
Creek. The fund-raiser has been closed to the news media at the
request of his presidential exploratory committee, event organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the schedule only reflects
the fact that Bush has some events that are public and some that
are considered private.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put public events on the governor's public schedule, and
some events are private events,'' Hughes said. ``We have tried to
make sure he remains accessible to the media at least once a week,
and we have done so all (this legislative) session.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes noted that Bush was available for news media questions
Tuesday and Thursday this week.
</P>
<P>
   She said the confrontation between Bush and the Longview
reporter occurred because the event was a photo-opportunity, not a
news conference. ``We make it very clear that these are photo
sessions only for pictures with the governor. These are not media
events. These are not news conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCutchen said Bush's staff was given a list of 25 people
who would be meeting with the governor Wednesday, including the
name of the Longview reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're naive in Longview, but it seems odd that you could
go off the record in public,'' McCutchen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can be off the record with a group of 25 people, that's
an interesting proposition,'' the publisher said. ``It's like he's
saying, `I'm standing before you and my lips are moving, but
nothing is coming out.'''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as Bush met Wednesday with members of the
Longview Chamber of Commerce and Convention and Visitors Bureau in
the Governor's reception room at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The News-Journal reported Thursday that Bush shot Elswick ``a
laser beam look'' and said the meeting was ``off the record.'' The
governor warned that if Elswick did not stop taking notes, Bush
would leave the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McCutchen said that even after Elswick complied with Bush's
request, Bush twice questioned the reporter about whether his tape
recorder was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that a third time, as if the reporter was a dishonest
person,'' McCutchen said.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, Bush responded to a story in
Wednesday's Houston Chronicle that questioned whether he has been
less involved in this Legislature because of his presidential bid.
The Chronicle story was based on a review of Bush's office
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's not on the calendar, it doesn't mean I'm not
spending a lot of time meeting with members of the House and the
Senate,'' Bush said. ``It still feels like I'm spending as much
time with members of the House and Senate as I have in previous
sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported Wednesday that Bush's calendars showed
his scheduled meetings with civic leaders and legislators during
the 1999 session are about half the number he had during the 1997
session.
</P>
<P>
   The records also indicated Bush had spent twice as many hours on
presidential campaign meetings as he had in scheduled meetings with
lawmakers.

RILEY, MIAMI TAKING THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley's practices can be tests of will, stamina,
and purpose. Thursday's also was something else: a chance for the
game's eminent coaching mind to remind his bruised forces that it
might be their last get-together for quite awhile. Even the players
don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Heat face elimination Friday at the hands of the
dreaded Knicks, a team Riley likes even less than the Celtics. The
teams have played three games and Miami has been bludgeoned in two
of them. One more slip and the Heat become the first Eastern
Conference No. 1 seed to lose in the first round since the 16-team
format was adopted in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they were the first _ and only _ Eastern Conference
team to lose as a No. 2 seed in the first round. That happened last
year. The opponent? The Knicks. Only one Eastern Conference team
has ever lost twice in the first round: Atlanta in 1994. Its
opponent? The Heat.
</P>
<P>
   This is obviously not the situation Riley envisioned as the Heat
entered the first Jordan-less postseason in four years with their
eye on the prize. But the Knicks know them and are not fazed by
them; only six games separated the teams in the regular season.
There's a lot of history and enmity at work here. Riley, once
revered in New York, is now the target of numerous ``Riley bleeps''
chants from the enlightened crowd at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of Miami's top offensive weapons, Tim Hardaway,
is playing like tim hardaway and one of its best defensive players,
Dan Majerle, has a right shoulder with more breaks than a 60-footer
at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the team that got me here and will get me over the
top,'' Riley said Thursday. ``Or else, we'll all go down
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway is the main concern. He has a sore right knee and
resembles only in name the Miami point guard who delighted in
torching the Knicks in years past. In three games, Hardaway has
made 6 of 32 shots. In Game 3, a 24-point Miami loss, he made one
basket _ a layup.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of scoring is only a small part of the problem.
Hardaway isn't breaking down the defenses. He's not dishing and
penetrating. The crossover dribble is almost nonexistent. This was
one position the Heat felt they had a big advantage, but he's
getting outplayed by Charlie Ward and Chris Childs. He was so
ineffective and frustrated in Game 3 that he earned himself an
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hardaway hurting to the point where he won't be the same
Hardaway until next season? He wasn't talking Thursday, but Riley
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask him,'' the coach said. ``I put five names
on the card. I expect them to play. He took a hit two months ago
(against Detroit) but for the last six weeks, the doctors say he's
OK and he says he's OK. He doesn't want to hear it. That's the way
it is in this league. It's just like Patrick's Achilles'. We don't
want to hear it. He doesn't want to hear it. We have to move
forward as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   This being a time when men are men, no one is cutting anyone any
slack. Ewing is day to day with his Achilles'. Majerle's situation
is a joke. He has bone spurs on his collarbone. There are fractures
in those spurs. He played 18 invisible minutes in Game 3 and has
made two baskets in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Riley hinted he may employ Voshon Lenard more. At least Lenard
can shoot. His problem: he was out all year and he's seen as a
defensive liability. Riley tends to constrict his roster at playoff
time. Lenard and Mark Strickland, an active body, are the
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those options, Riley interrupted to say, ``the
options are execution and execution.''
</P>
<P>
   We trust he meant running the plays correctly on the floor.

IN ABRUPT REVERSAL, REPUBLICANS CALL FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Skedded earlier as JUVENILE-CRIME)  
 (See also: CONGRESS-GUNS-ASSESS)  
(rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Senate Republicans defeated a
Democratic proposal to require background checks on buyers at gun
shows, they turned around Thursday and advocated a measure of their
own to do precisely that, a startling reversal that reflected their
skittishness about being portrayed as soft on guns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a sizeable majority of senators voted Thursday
night not only for a Republican gun control measure to prohibit the
sale of semi-automatic assault weapons to children under 18, but
also for a Democratic proposal to ban the importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips for those weapons. That Democratic
proposal had been defeated in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, a stark contrast to the Senate action on
Wednesday, showed that Republicans were indeed concerned that the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo., last month had altered public
opinion and created fresh outrage among many Americans about gun
violence and the availability of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to stand on the floor of the United States Senate
and proclaim myself a defender of the Second Amendment,'' said Sen.
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., referring to the right to bear arms, which
Republicans frequently invoke to explain their opposition to more
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But, Smith added, ``I think it's possible to defend this
constitutional right and also defend the kids in the school
cafeteria.'' He said he would support tighter restrictions on gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of about a half dozen Republicans who, after
voting with the Republican majority on Wednesday to oppose such
restrictions, later expressed concern to Republican leaders about a
measure advocating voluntary background checks at guns shows that
they had helped to pass.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, created
and financed a system that would allow _ but not oblige _
unlicensed sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks on
buyers. Under current law, only licensed dealers, who represent
about 60 percent of vendors at gun shows, have the ability and
obligation to perform that task.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising turn of events, Craig Thursday introduced a
measure to make those backgrounds checks mandatory, as the
Democratic proposal would have. He said it had been his intention
all along, and that his first measure was merely a necessary
prelude to the second.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that after Wednesday's votes, some of his
Republican colleagues had received angry calls from constituents
and had indicated some alarm about that. Democrats said that
Republicans realized they had misjudged the political climate, an
assessment that some Republicans privately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, there was some reflection taking part in the
Republican conference last night, some second thoughts induced by
an inner conscience or perhaps even newspaper comments and
editorials,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who had sponsored
the Democratic measure on gun shows that was narrowly defeated
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the second day in a row that a debate over gun
control took center stage in the Senate's consideration of a
broader juvenile justice bill whose fate has yet to be decided. The
House has not yet taken up a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control measures were being offered as amendments to
that bill, which would create $1 billion in federal grants to
toughen prosecution and punishment of juvenile crime and, to a
lesser extent, enhance programs to help troubled and violent
children.
</P>
<P>
   None of the measures represented monumental changes in public
policy. But the full airing they were getting, and the Senate's
approval of a few of them, would probably not have occurred a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats charged that much of what Republicans were
doing was mere posturing and said that Craig's new gun show
amendment, on which votes were expected on Friday, was not all that
much improved.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., noted that it did not require
unlicensed dealers to maintain any record of their sales and said
that would make it impossible for anyone ever to monitor whether
these vendors had conducting the requisite checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loophole you could drive a Mack truck through,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said that his amendment would mandate the presence at
gun shows of a ``special registrant,'' licensed by the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, to oversee the process.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that most, if not all, Republicans would vote
for Craig's new gun show amendment, even though all but six
Republicans had voted against Lautenberg's similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they had been uncomfortable with a provision
that was present in Lautenberg's amendment _ but is absent from
Craig's _ to keeps lists of all gun purchases at gun shows.

 &HT;    Judge gives plantiffs in Coke race suit free reign; CEO Ivester
not chastised
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal Judge Richard Story said he will give broad
freedom to African-American plaintiffs to talk with Coca-Cola
employees who may want to join a racial discrimination suit against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Story did not chastise Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer M. Douglas Ivester for discussing the merits of
the suit in e-mails to employees, and said he will not order
Ivester to withdraw his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in U.S. District Court in Atlanta focused mostly on
the rights of the company and plaintiffs to communicate with
Coca-Cola employees about the case. But the judge also outlined
plans to speed up the process for determining if the issues can go
to trial on a class-action basis.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Story conducted the hearing informally, but said he will
issue a formal order within days, outlining the rules governing
what company officials and attorneys for the plaintiffs can say to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a judge who generally stands against any prior restraint
to communication,'' Story said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, raised several probing questions for Cyrus
Mehri, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, about an Internet site
(www.essential.org/action/spotlight/coke/complaint.html) that
carries the full text of the complaint against Coca-Cola. He
appeared concerned that the site gave an advantage to plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will consider some proposed alterations to that site,'' he
said, though Mehri indicated he did not control the Web site. The
attorney acknowledged that he had made the lawsuit available to the
site, which is run by a Ralph Nader affiliate called The Essential
Information.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, John Richard of the Nader group said
the site was a forum for various interest groups without the means
to publish their own information, including groups against
Microsoft, a boycott Shell organization and groups against the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Richard suggested that the judge, who is newly appointed the
federal bench, could run afoul of free speech rights if he
attempted to restrict the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long has this judge been in office,'' Richard asked. ``Has
he gotten down to the amendments to the Constitution yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Story also repeatedly expressed considerable discomfort with
lawyers talking to the press about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to see more talk between the lawyers to get
this case along, and less talk in the media,'' he said. But the
judge stopped short of suggesting a gag order on comments.
</P>
<P>
   Communication policy aside, there had been some speculation that
certification of a class could take years, but Story clearly leaned
toward a decision within months.
</P>
<P>
   He outlined steps for the lawyers that could expedite the
all-important first phase of determining if a class of plaintiffs
exists. The company would be required to open its employee
database, including statistics on pay, promotions and other
potential evidence of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the form of the information supplied by Coca-Cola-Cola
might be a problem, Mehri said, ``as long as it is readable and
workable, we can make use of it.'' He said he would report to the
court if there were problems with the company data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Coca-Cola said they would make a motion
soon to dismiss the case as not being a valid class action
complaint embracing misconduct by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a broad hint, Story indicated it would be hard for him
to dismiss the case before the full process of determining the
class had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company, and for the plaintiffs, took some
satisfaction from Story's comments during the Thursday hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very pleased that the judge approved of our broad
right to communicate,'' said Elizabeth Finn Johnson, a company
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mehri, ``we were pleased and impressed with the judge's
diligence.''

BRUINS NEED TO GET BACK TO THEIR GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ It's a sales job now. Make 'em believe. Make 'em
want. Make 'em buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning process,'' said coach Pat Burns, hoping his
club can pull even in Game 4 of its playoff series here Friday
against the Sabres. ``Some of that is unteachable, but it is
livable _ and they are living it.''
</P>
<P>
   Life's lessons Wednesday night had the Bruins living and
learning the bad. They entered the third period with a 2-1 lead on
the scoreboard, needing only to survive 20 more minutes to take a
more important 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, they were 3-2 losers, their game plan not
coming so much unglued as much as it was eroded by a persistent,
tenacious third-period attack by the Sabres. The Bruins veered
slightly off course with their game plan, lost sight of how to
pressure the puck and how to deploy their defensive coverages, and
the win they thought they had in hand quickly was handed over to
the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat can only do so much,'' said Boston netminder Byron Dafoe.
``At this point, really, it comes down to us. It's a matter of who
wants it more. Who will put it all on the line? No more talking.
Now we all have to get it together and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have come this far this season, to Round 2 of the
Stanley Cup playoffs, because of youth. They are now in trouble, in
part, for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   On top of those pockets of immaturity, injuries are now
beginning to take serious bites out of their depth. Don Sweeney
(back injury) won't play. Sergei Samsonov (back spasms) was a
scratch for Game 3. Tim Taylor is a walking voodoo doll, taking
three needles before every game to cope with pain in his shoulder
and ribs. On one hand Burns is trying to coax along a lineup that,
in key places, has yet to prove itself in the postseason. On the
other hand, aches and pains are taking the shoot and pass right out
of his club's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's physical out there,'' said Burns. ``Everyone has to
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the injuries, the Bruins can get back in this series,
but they'll have to rely heavily on the lines centered by Joe
Thornton and Jason Allison. This is nothing new. Headed into this
series, they knew the Allison line _ then with Samsonov and Dmitri
Khristich as wingers _ would have to play much better than in the
previous round against Carolina. Thornton's line, with Steve Heinze
and Anson Carter as the shooters _ would have to carry over its
momentum from Round 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not once in this series, however, have the two lines played well
in the same game. In Game 2, both combinations played poorly, part
of a team-wide letdown. In Game 3, Thornton's line was much
improved _ Burns called Thornton a ``force'' and a ``horse of a
man'' _ but the Allison line again was a huge disappointment. The
talented pivot had Landon Wilson on the left side, filling in for
Samsonov, and Khristich on the right. Wilson showed some of the
flashes that made him look like a budding power forward in the
series vs. the 'Canes. Khristich, once more, looked overwhelmingly
disinterested.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested here after Game 2 that the Bruins need one of
their young forwards to step up in this series and take charge of
the offense, in the spirit of a Bryan Trottier or Mark Messier.
Thornton, the youngest and perhaps most talented of the bunch, took
a stride toward doing that in Game 4. Even with his learning curve
angled sharply upward of late, he alone can't carry this team.
</P>
<P>
   It very well could be that the Allison-Michael Peca matchup
determines whether the Bruins make a series out of this. Peca has
been the inside-the-shirt and down-the-pants pest that everyone
knew he would be in this series. Allison has been unable to shake
him, in part because neither of his linemates have posed any kind
of surrounding threat.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely are these matchups simply one-on-one,
center-vs.-center affairs. Let's say Allison can outplay Peca,
either by finesse or brute force. Will his wingers make anything
out of his head-to-head victories? Thus far that hasn't been the
case. Allison can get more physical and more confrontational with
Peca _ in fact, if he doesn't the show is over _ but he'll need
much better efforts from his wingers. Don't be surprised if Burns
slaps Ken Belanger on one of those wings, in hopes of implementing
a better forechecking game and getting some improved work in the
corners. The coach keeps sticking with Khristich, in hopes that
he'll start playing one day this spring, but eventually he'll have
no choice but to abandon that goodwill effort.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman in Burns now must keep after the likes of Allison,
Carter, and Thornton on the offense, Hal Gill and even Kyle McLaren
on defense. They are the ones young enough and impressionable
enough to listen, to try, to improve. They still have upsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to blame our youth and our lack of
experience,'' said captain Ray Bourque. ``But we all went through
the last series and we were down in that, 2-1. That wasn't easy,
either, but we responded well. Yeah, sure, we've got a lot of young
guys, but they're young guys who've played well for us, and we
expect they'll do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no options now. Burns must keep coaxing his kids, keep
after those who ultimately must carry the team. He made a point
Thursday after saying that he didn't tell his team anything after
the disappointing loss in Game 3. He held a brief team meeting
Thursday before a light on-ice workout and emphasised how much they
had done correctly. He is dwelling on the positive. This is no time
for a bad cop. He is the good cop, carrying a salesman's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all maturity,'' said Burns, knowing full well that age is
measured not so much in years as in games played, ``that's all it
is.''

FERNANDO TATIS GIVES THE CARDINALS, AND HIMSELF, MUCH TO SMILE
ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Fernando Tatis smiles a lot these days.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals third baseman smiles when he's on the
field, bantering with shortstop Edgar Renteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always making jokes,'' Tatis said. ``I'm the funny guy.
He's kind of serious, and I always say just relax. Be like me.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles in the clubhouse before the game. He smiles about the
day he set a major-league record by hitting two grand slams in one
inning, and about the fact that he _ not record-setting slugger
Mark McGwire _ leads the team in homers and RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy,'' said Tatis, 24. ``I'm having fun right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles even wider when he thinks about becoming the next
Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis probably never will have a season like Sosa did last year,
when he hit 66 homers and drove in 158 runs. But, like Sosa, he can
be good enough to make the Rangers regret trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a mistake,'' Tatis said.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis wasn't smiling last July 31, when the Rangers dealt him to
the Cardinals. He came up through the Texas farm system, touted as
a top prospect, and was in just his second full season in the
majors. He planned on a long, successful career in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' he said. ``A lot of things went
through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew why he Darren Oliver and minor-league outfielder Mark
Little were traded for Royce Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre. The
Rangers were trying to win the American League West title. Clayton
provided an upgrade at shortstop, and Stottlemyre improved the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' short-term prospects were more important than
Tatis' long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to be in the playoffs,'' he said. ``They needed
Stottlemyre, so that's why they traded me. But they made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin has said he would make the
trade again. The team won the West, although they were knocked out
by the New York Yankees in the first round of the playoffs. That's
something that didn't happen when the club traded Sosa and Wilson
Alvarez for Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also made the trade knowing they might be
second-guessed if Tatis matured into the front-line player they
thought he could be. They didn't necessarily think it would happen
this soon, however.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday's games Tatis was tied for third in the National
League with 11 homers _ four more than McGwire _ and was second in
the league with 34 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He only had 11 homers all of last season, three in 95 games (330
at-bats) with the Rangers and eight in 55 games (202 at-bats) with
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great stroke,'' Cardinals hitting coach Mike Easler
said. ``And he's learning what pitchers are doing to him. You've
got to know No. 1, what you're doing mechanically, and No. 2, what
the pitchers are trying to do to you. He's starting to figure these
things out. He's a good student.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis showed power potential in the minor leagues. He hit 24
homers at Double-A Tulsa in 1997, and added eight more after being
promoted to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, expected him to be among the top sluggers in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   While Tatis' power is helping the Cardinals stay competitive in
the NL Central, McGwire warns his teammate about wanting to be like
Mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting home runs, but you can't call him a home-run
hitter,'' McGwire said. ``He's a doubles hitter who's just hitting
home runs. I told him, `That would be the worst thing the media can
do, is start driving into your head that you're a home-run hitter,
because you're not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked very, very hard on his swing. He's getting pitches
to hit, and he's driving them out of the ballpark. But it's easy to
fall into that trap. That's why I'm trying to discourage it. Labels
are not good, unless you're an older player and you have a track
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Tatis has worn the label of ``good hitter'' every
since the trade. He batted .287 with eight homers and 26 runs
batted in during the final two months with the Cardinals last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing a lot better,'' he said. ``I started having a
lot of fun over here. There wasn't a lot of pressure, like there
was in Texas. I played a lot more relaxed over here.''
</P>
<P>
   The smiles don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun,'' he said.

BU PROFESSOR LEADER IN BRITISH POET LAUREATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a battle pitting a literary tradition that goes back
three centuries and Britain's evolving post-imperial identity,
Boston University professor and Nobel poetry prize recipient Derek
Walcott has emerged as the front-runner to become the nation's poet
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott, who was born a British subject on the Caribbean island
of St. Lucia in 1930, would replace Ted Hughes, who died six months
ago. He would be the nation's 19th poet laureate, filling a
lifetime post once held by figures such as Tennyson and Wordsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday said the
new laureate would be named by the end of the month, but declined
to say whether Walcott is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In literary circles here, however, Walcott is said to have the
inside track. Walcott, who has just wrapped up teaching the spring
semester at BU, was in Boston Thursday but through BU spokesman
Kevin Carleton declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is aware that he is under consideration,'' said Carleton.
</P>
<P>
   The British government had expected to have named a replacement
by now for Hughes, who Thursday was remembered by many of Britain's
top writers during a memorial service at Westminster Abbey. It had
been hoped that his successor could be at the service.
</P>
<P>
   But filling a job that dates back to the 17th century and which
Hughes had held for nearly two decades has proved to be an
unexpectedly daunting task, mainly because of a tug of war between
those who want the job to stay within its traditional parameters
and those who want it to reflect modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While Walcott would be the first black laureate, and would
appeal to Blair's desire to celebrate Britain's diversity, he is
being pushed by some of the staunchest traditionalists because they
see him as a literary heavyweight and because they fear the job may
go to a more populist poet. Among Walcott's supporters is Hughes's
widow Carol, who recently wrote to Blair urging him not to
modernize the post.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much debate within Blair's ``Cool Britannia''
government about making poetry more accessible by installing a less
highbrow ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists, however, have howled at the prospect of
changing a job that since 1692 has offered a yearly stipend of 100
pounds, which was good money 307 years ago but is a considerably
less impressive honorarium today.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the poet laureate's prime responsibility has been
to pen verse to commemorate state events, such as royal weddings.
There is some pressure to have the new laureate in place for next
month's wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   While Queen Elizabeth II will name the new laureate, she will
effectively be announcing Blair's selection. Under British
parliamentary law, one of the powers specifically invested in the
prime minister is forwarding the laureate's name to the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney was initially a
government favorite, especially given Blair's efforts to bring
about peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. But Heaney took
himself out of the running because while he was born in
British-controlled Northern Ireland, he carries an Irish passport
and could not swear loyalty to a monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office has floated ideas about giving the
laureate's post a limited term, a change that traditionalists have
also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to The Daily Telegraph, the voice of the
British establishment that has campaigned against changing the
laureate's job description, Alan Howarth, the British arts
minister, dismissed suggestions that the government was determined
to create a ``people's poet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can see no advantage in anything that would
impair the Poet Laureate's traditional resonance or the respect and
regard in which the office is held by the public,'' said Howarth.
``It is inconceivable that we would wish anything to undermine this
precious literary legacy.''

 &HT;    Nascar notebook: Keller grabs pole position
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richmond, Va. _ Jason Keller hopes to have his No. 57 Chevrolet
headed in the right direction in tonight's Hardee's 250 Busch race.
He'll be starting out in good shape, on the pole, after Thursday's
record-busting qualifying lap.
</P>
<P>
   Keller whipped around the resurfaced three-quarter-mile asphalt
track at Richmond International Speedway in a track-record 124.907
mph (21.616 seconds) to steal the pole from Winston Cup veteran
Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had broken the track record nearly an hour earlier
Thursday but lost the prime spot to Keller, the 54th of 57 drivers
attempting to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who has two poles, one win and five top 10s in 11 Busch
races, said life is wonderful if you have a fast car. He is having
a good year after placing in the top five just twice in 31 races
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't forget how to drive last year and then just wake up
and remember how to do this over the winter,'' Keller said. ``It's
a lot easier to drive fast cars than it is slow cars.''
</P>
<P>
   This is his second pole since 1994 at Richmond and his second
track record. But he hasn't won here yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come across the checkered flag sideways, backwards and
wrecked,'' Keller said. ``I think if I do that, I'm not going to
win. If I come across the checkered flag straight, I'm going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was one of seven Winston Cup drivers to make the top 25
Thursday. Twelve tried to win a spot in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Little E hits the wall
</P>
<P>
   Busch points leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. went to a backup car and
qualified fourth Thursday after putting his car into the wall
during practice. The wreck happened between turns three and four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track's real slick, I don't know why it happened,''
Earnhardt said. ``I don't know anything about sealers and asphalt,
good or bad. I saw a couple of cars that were loose. We were loose
and maybe we should have come in and tried to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt crashed with 10 laps to go in last week's Busch race
in New Hampshire when another got into the back of his after his
No. 3 Chevrolet lost the rear end. He finished 34th. He finished
second and first in two races at Richmond last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart is engaged
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Tony Stewart's engagement was announced
Thursday by a public relations firm in Harrisburg, N.C. The release
said: ``Dr. Daniel and Phylis (cq) Dwyer of Rockville, Ind., are
pleased to announce the engagement of their daughter, Krista, to
Tony Stewart, son of Mrs. Pam Boas of Dayton, Ind., and Nelson
Stewart of Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   The bride-to-be is the marketing and recruiting director of an
Indianpolis medical firm. The groom-to-be drives the No. 20
Pontiac. Cup teams arrive here Friday.

WARD'S IN THE ZONE AT PLAYOFF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Each shift is a personnel evaluation, each game
a potential pink slip. For players who inhabit the NHL fringes,
such as Sabres winger Dixon Ward, insecurity is such a staple that
it becomes almost a comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Ward seems to flourish in hockey's ultimate
crucible, the Stanley Cup playoffs. While his more entrenched
colleagues can find the sudden pressure of postseason survival
suffocating, it's almost a breather to Ward, whose future always
has been on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting for my life every time I step out there,'' he
said. ``I'm fighting for my job. I'm fighting for respect. I'm not
the most skilled player in the world. I have to bring something
else to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   What he brings is grit, a relentless determination that
compensates for subpar skating and doesn't acknowledge nerves.
</P>
<P>
   That was epitomized Wednesday night at Marine Midland Arena. In
dire straits after two desultory periods, Buffalo was staring at a
2-1 deficit in the game _ and potentially in the best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinals against the Bruins. Ward, who with
Michael Peca and Vaclav Varada had formed the Sabres' only
facsimile of a cohesive line in the first 40 minutes, took them off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:38, a little less than three minutes after Rhett Warrener
tied the game, the 30-year-old Ward exploited a couple of Boston
defensive breakdowns and was in perfect position to take a Varada
feed from the goal line and bang home the goal that gave Buffalo a
3-2 victory and the series advantage. It was his third goal of the
playoffs and second game-winner, forming a bookend to his score
that triggered Buffalo's 3-0 win over Ottawa in Game 3 of a
first-round sweep. Coupled with his empty-netter that iced Sunday's
3-1 win in Boston, it gave him a genuine scoring streak and
cemented his reputation for responding imperturably to crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put the word `desperation' under his name,'' said
coach Lindy Ruff, ``because that's the way he plays in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because he has become intimately, if unwillingly,
acquainted with the term during a textbook journeyman's career that
has taken him from Vancouver to Los Angeles to Toronto to the
minors and finally _ he hopes _ to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   He began to get the message that he would never be a fixture
when he came out of the University of North Dakota, scored 22 goals
as a rookie with the Canucks in 1992-93 _ and was dealt to the
Kings midway through his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by that,'' he said. ``I figured after
the rookie year I'd had . . . I think at that stage, Vancouver was
looking for a certain type of player for the lineup, a more
offensive player. I was very tradeable after my rookie year, and I
think (general manager) Pat Quinn wanted to see if he could
resurrect Jimmy Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn couldn't as Carson, the former 50-goal scorer he obtained
from the Kings, proved a flop in Vancouver. But LA was no paradise
for Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization was in turmoil,'' he said. ``I couldn't see
myself staying there. In training camp the next year, I requested a
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was on to Toronto, where he received his rudest awakening.
Joining the Maple Leafs the day before the NHL lockout in 1994,
Ward was a stranger in the lineup when play resumed following the
new year. Used sparingly during the truncated season, he was
released afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns, who was coaching the Maple Leafs at the time and
watched from behind the Boston bench as Ward beat him Wednesday,
insists that the move wasn't his doing and that he likes Ward,
always has. For his part, Ward says now, ``I never once had bad
words for Pat Burns,'' and credits his former coach for teaching
him how to be emotionally ready for every game.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, Burns did see some room for improvement. ``The
Dixon Ward of five years ago is not the Dixon Ward of today,'' he
said. ``He (itals)knows(unitals) now. He gets the job done. It's a
matter of maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbling, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the low point in my career,'' said Ward. ``I figured I
had to do something to make myself important.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a second chance in Buffalo, he immediately became the most
important player in the league. The American Hockey League. He
spent the bulk of the 1995-96 season with Rochester, tallying 38
goals and 94 points, then being named playoff MVP as he led the
Americans to the Calder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the best thing that happened to me,'' he said,
``going down and proving I belonged up here.''
</P>
<P>
   He can afford to be philosophical now. He's been a full-time
Sabre for the past three seasons, establishing himself as a willing
grinder and this year getting back to the 20-goal plateau. Having
experienced the descent, he's all the more appreciative of the
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a short time to lose respect and a long time to get
it back,'' he said. ``Sometimes you have to go through tough times.
Looking back, I learned something from every experience. A little
bit of every place I've been, every coach I've played for, has
stayed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for reminiscence. Players of Ward's pedigree must focus
on the present, in this case Friday's game here, when the Sabres
can effectively end the series or the Bruins can get right back in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next one,'' said Ward, ``is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like all the others he plays.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ There is a famous Israeli photograph from early in
Benjamin Netanyahu's tenure as prime minister. It shows him on the
beach with his family, trying to relax within a tight circle of
secret service agents, their backs to him, their guns pointed
outward.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, in the Haaretz newspaper, a cartoon
mimicked the photo, but depicted Netanyahu and family encircled by
new bodyguards: ultra-Orthodox men in black hats with Uzis.
</P>
<P>
   As Netanyahu fights for his political survival in elections on
Monday, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community stands nearly
unanimously by his side, with rabbis and religious parties issuing
enthusiastic last-minute endorsements of his ailing candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu's struggling candidacy is bleeding support from
other core constituencies: Sephardic Jews, secular right-wingers
and Russian immigrants. And many believe that his behavior is
panicky, as though he is on the ropes. In recent appearances, he
has lashed out defensively at the left, the elite, the media and
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, Netanyahu explained
to the crowd why he thought his opponents were ``mobilizing''
against him ``beyond all bounds'' of reason. He started a slow
chant that the crowd picked up, their voices filling the hall:
``They are a-fraid, they are a-fraid, they are a-fraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is trailing his main opponent, Ehud Barak, by a solid
8 points in the latest polls. For the first time, some conservative
analysts are suggesting that Barak, the Labor Party leader, could
win a clear majority in the Monday vote, obviating the need for an
anticipated runoff on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like Natan Sharanksy, the trade minister under
Netanyahu, are already talking end-game coalition politics, under
the implicit assumption that the prime minister will be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   As Election Day nears, Netanyahu has lost not only voters but
also some Likud Party mayors and workers who feel neglected. A
leading party official said in an interview that there was no money
to pay party activists now, and that some have threatened a
walk-out if the elections proceed to a runoff without financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu sacrificed the party and its ideology to his own
political interests,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a conservative
political scientist at Bar-Ilan University. ``The party is going to
take a terrible drubbing in these elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Likud leaders, many of whom have feuded with Netanyahu privately
about the campaign, are reported to be planning a post-election
putsch even as they ostensibly work for Netanyahu's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, this election has been a referendum on
Netanyahu's character, not his policies: ``To Bibi or not to
Bibi,'' pollster Hanoch Smith called it on Thursday, using the
prime minister's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Netanyahu turned that around, attacking his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of the media, though not everyone, is mobilizing
now,'' Netanyahu said on the radio. ``They are setting aside all
professional ethics _ a simple absolute mobilization for the
victory of Barak and the left. The things reported about me are
usually the opposite of the truth. The things reported about Barak
are generally slick and flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   A tape of the rally's call-and-response of ``They're a-fraid''
was played on Israel Radio all day Thursday. Asked to comment, Ehud
Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem and the top contender for the Likud
Party leadership, distanced himself from Netanyahu's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the media are afraid of anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If not afraid, though, the media are almost unanimously hostile
to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who like many Israelis is skeptical of election
predictions, says the polls will prove to be inaccurate. He says
immigrants and the ultra-Orthodox lie to the polls, so the polls
cannot be trusted. He also reminds his supporters that Shimon
Peres, who lost to him by 30,000 votes in 1996, was forecast as the
winner even on election night.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last race, unlike now, Netanyahu's popularity had
been steadily rising in the weeks before the ballots were cast.
</P>
<P>
   Likud strategists say now that their goal is to survive the
first round, assuming that Netanyahu will fare better in a
one-on-one runoff. If a solid center-left majority wins control of
the Parliament on Monday, it could galvanize swing voters to return
to Netanyahu. And the prime minister is presumed to be the master
of focused political combat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thus far many of his punches have been off.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say his biggest misstep was in trying to force a
confrontation with the Palestinians over Orient House _ the
Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Jerusalem _
against the advice first of his security minister and then of
Olmert.
</P>
<P>
   Orient House is not supposed to house any offices of the
Palestinian government, under international agreement. Asserting
that Palestinian government work was being conducted there,
Netanyahu moved to close it down last week.
</P>
<P>
   While he said it was government business, a simple clampdown on
an illegality, critics even within his party saw it as blatant
theatrics. They said he wanted to generate photographs of Israeli
police storming a Palestinian stronghold in Jerusalem on the eve of
elections. His security minister said there would be bloodshed. It
took a high-court injunction to hold back the police.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Margalit, a columnist for Haaretz, on Thursday urged Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Center Party candidate, to pull out of the race _ as
did the paper's editorial. Polls suggest that would give Barak a
full majority and victory on Monday, eliminating the need for a
runoff on June 1. However, should the election go to a second
round, no one expects Netanyahu to go down without a fierce fight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Another 14 days with a prime minister who is fighting for his
political life like an injured lion?'' Margalit said, adding ``who
knows'' what Netanyahu will be tempted to do so secure a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the themes that worked in 1996, Netanyahu's campaign,
under the guidance of Arthur Finkelstein, a Republican political
consultant from New York, has tried to push the same buttons: The
left will divide Jerusalem, the left will allow terrorism, the left
is elite and does not represent the people. But it is difficult for
a sitting prime minister to represent himself as an outsider. And
it is hard to portray Barak, a highly decorated former general, as
a softie. On the issue of Jerusalem, for instance, Barak's campaign
was able to respond quickly with a film clip of Likud's Olmert
saying that Barak would not consider dividing the city.
</P>
<P>
   To remind voters that terrorism raged under the previous Labor
government, Netanyahu used commercials showing old footage of
terrorist bus bombings, just as he did last time. After the use of
those ads provoked criticism within Likud and from the relatives of
victims of terror, they were re-evaluated _ and then repeated.
</P>
<P>
   During the last election, Rabbi Joseph Gutnik, a wealthy and
ultra-Orthodox Australian, initiated a wildly successful ``Bibi is
good for the Jews'' campaign days before the elections. On Friday,
he, too, is expected to try to work his magic again, but on a
limited scale. He is expected to publish large ads in religious
newspapers, calling on readers to support Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of the soul,'' the ads say, according to
Israeli newspapers. ``We are facing, heaven forbid, the grave and
awful peril of the establishment of a leftist government. It is
clear to everyone that such a government will wreak catastrophic
havoc on the most fundamental Jewish issues, on our holy land, and
on the security of all the Jews living in the land of Israel.''

 &HT;    Barr wants 'level playing field' for disabled students caught
with weapons
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) is shocked that two disabled
Cobb County, Ga. middle school students were not expelled earlier
this year when they brought a semi-automatic gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   If the students had not been protected by the federal
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act they would have been
automatically expelled from the school, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   So Barr introduced legislation in March that would ``level the
playing field'' by giving local school boards the authority to
expel disabled students who bring firearms to school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the local school board would not be responsible for
the cost of educating that child at home as it is now required to
do if a student is removed from the school for disciplinary
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is get the authority back where it ought to
be--away from some federal bureaucrat and in the hands of the local
school board,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone ought to be treated equally,'' Barr said. ``If a
disabled student brings a gun to school they should be treated the
same as other students who bring guns to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the disabled are less than pleased with Barr's
proposal. They point out that when Congress reauthorized the
Disabilities Education Act in 1997, it added a provision that
allowed the removal of a disabled student from school for up to 45
days for bringing a weapon to school.
</P>
<P>
   That suspension can be extended for another 45-day cycle,
indefinitely, said Myrna Mamdlawitz, director of government
relations for the Washington-based National Association of State
Directors of Special Education.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little sense to expell students to solve violent
tendencies, Mamdlawitz said, since kids who are prone to violence
are the kids who need special attention, not more isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Her organization believes if a child is expelled that child
should be educated at home whether or not he or she is disabled.
``Expelling kids to the street is like sending them to a graduate
school of criminology,'' Mamdlawitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Gordon O'Neill, a member of the Cobb County Board
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The federal law) in its effort to support special education
children has gone beyond common sense,'' O'Neill said. ``There is
no reason why we should not have the authority to expel a child for
putting another child at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia activists for the disabled vow to fight Barr's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr's bill does not take into consideration the disabled
community,'' said Linda Shepard, executive director of Parents
Educating Parents and Professionals,Inc., a non-profit group
charged with representing the rights of the disabled in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's legislation ``makes no sense,'' Shepard said. The law
already makes it clear that disabled students can be removed from
school for bringing a gun to school. ``We will fight against
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) was just leaving his post as the
president of the Georgia state board of education when the
controversy over the two students arose.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, who has not read Barr's bill, said that he agrees with
Barr that the first priority should be protecting students from
students who are prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my child were in that Cobb County classroom, I would want
the law equally applied,'' said Isakson, referring to the whether
the gun toters were disabled or not. ``Given the tragedies that we
have experienced all over the country, I think schools must have
the authority to remove students who bring weapons to school.''

LAWMAKERS MOVE CLOSER TO WRAPPING UP KOSOVO SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate negotiations over emergency
funding for the Kosovo war operation degenerated into some serious
name-calling Thursday, as members from both chambers accused each
other of trying to ``pork-up'' the bill with unrelated spending and
provisions to appease special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, negotiators hoped to wrap up a final compromise bill late
Thursday that could be sent to President Clinton for his signature
by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The name-calling started in earnest in the House, where a
bipartisan group of lawmakers passed a resolution instructing its
negotiators to reject all ``pork items'' that senators want to add
to the bill, including provisions that would protect tobacco
settlement money for the states and a $1 billion loan guarantee
program for financially-strapped U.S. steel and other industries
hard-hit by foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed 381-46 after a number of lawmakers rose to
speak out against what Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H., called ``the
porkfest ... going on in the Senate,'' where members ``are trying
to load up ... a military emergency spending bill with their pet
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of House Democrats agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the arrogance of power,'' remarked Rep. Peter
Deutsch, R-Fla., calling the move by both Republican and Democratic
senators to add more spending and other amendments ``absolutely
beyond the pale.''
</P>
<P>
   But senators took a shot of their own at House members, calling
their complaints about added pork ``the height of hypocrisy'' after
the House voted to more than double President Clinton's original
$6.05 billion emergency Kosovo request to $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used this bill as a pack mule for every kind of military
spending. I mean give me a break, it strains credibility,'' an
angry Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to dozens of defense-related construction and
other nonessential spending measures that were added to the House
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to complain about the Senate, I think that is the
height of irresponsibility and hypocrisy,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Both Daschle and Dorgan have been trying to attach a number of
measures to the Senate version of the Kosovo bill, including a $5.3
billion price support and loan program to help financially
depressed farmers recover from low prices and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts were rejected by House and Senate negotiators. But
the bargainers representing the two chambers did accept dozens of
other amendments, including one offered by Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, that waives the federal government's claim to a
portion of the $246 billion tobacco settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would not require states to spend any of the money
gained from settling lawsuits with the tobacco industry on tobacco-
or health-related programs, as the Clinton administration wants
them to do. But Hutchison was offering to change the wording of her
provision to encourage states to spend the settlement money only on
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto the emergency bill if it reaches
his desk with the tobacco provision attached. But he sounded less
confrontational Wednesday when he told reporters that he thought
House and Senate negotiators were ``actually making progress'' on
reaching an agreement that would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some effort to trim down the bill some and to
get it in a position where I can sign it,'' Clinton said, adding
that he is ``pretty encouraged'' that some extraneous amendments
have been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kosovo bill has ballooned to about $15 billion as
lawmakers have tried to turn it into what one House member
described as ``a Christmas tree'' of presents for special interests
with ``emergencies of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., ``the so-called
(Kosovo) emergency spending bill is somewhat of a disaster itself''
for the American taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   By the time House and Senate negotiators are through, the bill
could contain such items as a $26 million loan program for Alaska
fishermen and a provision that would block Interior Department
efforts aimed at preventing the Houston-based Battle Mountain
Company's Crown Jewel Gold Mine from dumping mine tailings in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent millions fighting a law that governs how
tailings and other wastes are disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   It could also include a bailout program for steel companies that
could be worth as much as $1 billion. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
who is trying to help a financially strapped steel company in his
home state avoid layoffs, has threatened to filibuster if his
bailout provision is axed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains an amendment pushed by Hutchison that
would extend the current prohibition on increasing federal
royalties on oil and gas through at least Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who will lead a seven-senator delegation on a
fact-finding trip to the Balkans this weekend, also hoped to
convince negotiators to attach another amendment she wants that
would provide loan guarantees to small, struggling oil and gas
producers in Texas and other oil patch states.
</P>
<P>
   But while negotiators saw fit to help some favored interests,
they rejected others. American farmers, for example, didn't fare as
well as they had hoped even though they got some $566 million in
loan guarantees. The negotiators also denied additional education
money for hiring more school counselors to help head off the kind
of violence that occurred in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders still hoped to reach a compromise on
the emergency bill late Thursday and get it to the president for
his signature by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $11.7 billion for the Kosovo operation and other
military-related items, the final bill is expected to include
nearly $1 billion in relief aid to Central American countries hit
by Hurricane Mitch last fall and as much as $900 million in
disaster aid to the victims of the monster tornadoes that ripped
through Oklahoma and Kansas two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But even if negotiators reach a compromise, there is still no
guarantee that the House and Senate will vote to accept it because
of objections primarily over Byrd's steel provision.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., worked Thursday to get negotiators to take
Byrd's amendment out of the final bill and threatened to hold up a
vote on it if it stays in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard-headedness and caginess don't get you much if you don't
have a bill to deal with,'' Lott warned.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was able to get two Republicans on the negotiating
conference to reverse themselves and vote against Byrd's amendment.
But it was still unclear late Thursday whether it would remain in
the final bill.

UNDER CHILE'S VOLCANOES, A BLURRING OF BOUNDARIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO MONTT, Chile _ It used to be easy to draw a political map
of Chile and readily identify the friends and foes of American
corporations: When President Salvador Allende seized copper mines
from Kennecott and Anaconda, the Nixon administration worked to
undermine him.
</P>
<P>
   After he was overthrown in 1973 by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the
latter's free-market policies became the toast of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so easy anymore. The fight over a $150 million
industrial project proposed by Boise Cascade, the American
forest-products giant, is blurring the old political fault lines
and helping to draw new ones that thread their way more subtly
among the competing pressures of economic development,
environmental protection, international trade and global
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the old, predictable split between left and right,
have and have-not, the dispute over the proposed plant pits
powerful economic interests against one another and has created
some unlikely alliances.
</P>
<P>
   On the shore of a shimmering Patagonian bay beneath snow-capped
volcanoes, Boise Cascade wants to build a factory to process lumber
chips into wood panels used in construction in much the same way as
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the project would create 200 well-paying jobs
and include a port that hundreds of local landowners could use to
deliver wood chips to the plant by boat. Cheering the plan are
local officials allied with the center-left Chilean government,
labor leaders and organizers of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal has run into determined opposition _ not just
from environmentalists and their political allies but also from two
important local industries that contend the plant and the
stepped-up logging it would promote threaten their survival.
Opponents have thrown legal hurdles in the project's path: An
approval won from a local environmental commission by Boise Cascade
and its Chilean partner, Maderas Condor, has been blocked by a
court injunction pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tactics have delayed or killed other forest-related
projects in southern Chile, including a $1.3 billion pulp mill
proposed by a Chilean concern part-owned by International Paper and
a $200 million lumber project planned by Trillium.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has run radio and television advertising campaigns and
sponsored marches to help build local political support and to
influence the three major candidates running for president of
Chile. For some, ``No more chips!'' has replaced ``Yankee go
home!'' as the rallying cry of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rationalize the use of the forest, and that's a
dilemma,'' said Jaime Sanz Bahamonde, president of the Puerto Montt
Chamber of Construction, who sees the project as a way to make this
impoverished region the wood processing center for the Southern
Cone of South America and fears losing the development to a rival
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to stop Boise Cascade from crossing the border and
putting its chip plant in Argentina?'' he said, calling opponents
shortsighted. ``This isn't about politics, but about distinct
visions of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking change in the political landscape was visible in
May Day celebrations here in Puerto Montt, the political and
economic center of Chile's lake region. Members of a leftist union
federation that supported Allende to the end carried banners in
favor of Boise Cascade's project, as leaders of the local
construction industry applauded.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, joining Chile's increasingly influential
environmental activists were the salmon industry, hoteliers and the
Green Caucus, an informal grouping of members of Congress ranging
from socialists to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The twist in the traditional class struggle is seen in Rene
Barriga, a logger and one of Boise Cascade's staunchest local
supporters. ``Those who oppose the project are the people who have
big houses and four or five cars,'' said Barriga, who lives with
his family in Ilque, the town where the plant would be built, in a
small shack that has no water, electricity or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On equally unaccustomed political ground are opponents like
Joachim Wessel Vinz, manager of Patagonia Salmon Farming, which
operates a salmon farm in Ilque Bay. Salmon farms often draw
environmental criticism because of the way the caged fish cover bay
bottoms with excrement and sometimes breed disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Vinz is making common cause with environmentalists in
opposing Boise Cascade's plant. ``Native forests are a filter to
keep our waters clean,'' Vinz said. ``That's what makes Chile the
second-largest producer of salmon in the world, after Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   Boise Cascade and its local partner say the only way to halt the
steady destruction of the Patagonian forest is to give loggers like
Barriga, who now chop down trees for firewood and to clear grazing
land, more incentive to protect and replant the woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no doubt there will be more trees in the years to come
than there are now,'' said Douglas Bartels, a spokesman for Boise
Cascade, who added that the two companies plan to distribute tree
seedlings at cost to local landowners and to teach them
conservation techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including environmentalists in the United States,
say the project is designed to sidestep Chile's weak environmental
laws and will speed the destruction of native forests. The
environmental impact statement filed for the project covers only
the plant and port, the critics say, and takes no account of what
the landowners who will supply the plant with wood chips will do to
their land.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of plant and animal species are unique to the area,
including the alerce tree, which can live 4,000 years, and the
pudu, the world's smallest deer, at 15 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Local environmental groups also dispute assertions that the
project will bring economic progress, arguing that the salmon and
tourism industries that have boomed over the last 10 years still
have great potential for growth and could employ many more people
than the wood panel plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism uses the lakes and forests without consuming them,''
said Sara Larrain, director of the Sustainable Chile Program, an
activist group. ``But once you cut the forest, you have consumed
our natural capital.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking is music to the ears of Felix Oyarzo
Grimm, a local hotel owner with strong right-wing views who was an
engineer in Pinochet's air force.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to offer is our waterfalls and crystal lakes,''
said Grimm, who has joined with the mostly left-leaning
environmentalists against Boise Cascade. ``I'm very capitalist.
More than that, I'm a Pinochetista. I know that a lot of
environmentalists resent my ideas. But ecology has nothing to do
with politics. We all want the people to unite.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dismissing a small Serb troop withdrawal from
Kosovo as more propaganda than pullback, NATO pressed its most
intensive attacks to date against Yugoslavia, flying some 760
combat sorties late Thursday and early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On an equally furious diplomatic offensive, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met Thursday night in Geneva with
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to discuss the search
for an end to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting followed a day-long session in Moscow between
Talbott and Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
separate meetings between Talbott and Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov. Talks centered on how to craft a U.N. Security Council
resolution aimed at placing Kosovo under international control
policed by a military peacekeeping force with NATO and Russian
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was scheduled to brief NATO officials on the diplomatic
front at alliance headquarters in Brussels on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomacy needs some time to ripen before we can discuss the
substance,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said in
Washington. ``We're trying to get greater and greater agreement
between NATO's elaborated conditions and the Russian views.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged the country to look beyond a week of
diplomatic and political setbacks and focus instead on the core
reason for NATO's air campaign: the bloody Serb repression
targeting ethnic Albanians in the embattled Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not get refugee fatigue,'' Clinton said. ``We must not
forget the real victims of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Escalating his rhetorical attacks against Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, Clinton likened the repression
in Kosovo -- a campaign of alleged executions, rapes and terror
that has driven an estimated 1.5 million ethnic Albanians from
their homes -- to the Holocaust half a century before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic
extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related,'' Clinton said
in a speech to U.S. military veterans. ``Both vicious,
premeditated, systematic oppression fueled by religious and ethnic
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a pointed warning to Milosevic, Clinton laid out more
clearly than ever the direct link between the Serb leader and the
alleged war crimes committed by forces under his command in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, Mr. Milosevic is being investigated by the
International War Crimes Tribunal for alleged war crimes, including
mass killing and ethnic cleansing,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine of every 10 Kosovar Albanians now has been driven from
their homes, thousands murdered, at least 100,000 missing, many
young men led away in front of their families; over 500 cities,
towns and villages torched,'' Clinton said, adding that it could
not have happened without direct orders from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not have systematic slaughter in an effort to eradicate
the religion, the culture, the heritage, the very record of
presence of a people in any area unless some politician thinks it
is in his interest to foment that sort of hatred. That is how these
things happen,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political leaders do this kind of thing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust
on their own without Hitler? Was there something in the history of
the German race that made them do this? No,'' Clinton said. ``We've
got to get straight about this: this is something political leaders
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, state-run media showed footage of 120 smiling
soldiers leaving Kosovo, evidence, Yugoslav officials said, of a
broader pullback from the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials ignored the gesture and pressed forward with an
escalating bombing campaign. U.S. and allied pilots struck at more
than four dozen military targets late Wednesday and early Thursday,
ranging from troop barracks and command and control bunkers to
individual tanks, artillery pieces and troop staging areas arrayed
across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon contends that there are some 40,000 Serb troops and
police in the war-torn province and that they continued, as
recently as Wednesday, to shell and otherwise attack ethnic
Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no signs of legitimate withdrawal,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking out a couple of hundred soldiers here and a couple
hundred soldiers there is not what we consider to be withdrawal,''
Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon. ``We consider that to be
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air campaign rolled into its eighth week on Thursday,
clear weather and a growing arsenal of warplanes and support craft
helped bolster the sortie rate to its highest levels to date, said
Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was scheduled to fly more than 900 sorties -- 760
of which were to involved armed combat planes -- from late Thursday
through early Friday, Wald said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, Wald said, there were 645 U.S. aircraft --
including 272 fighter/bombers plus refueling tankers and
reconnaissance planes -- and 277 planes from other NATO nations
employed in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States plans to add 337 fresh planes ``over the next
few weeks,'' said Wald, bringing the U.S. total to 982 and the NATO
total to nearly 1,300 planes.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO air corps expands, Yugoslavia's continues to shrink.
With another half-dozen of its fighter jets destroyed in attacks
late Wednesday and early Thursday, Milosevic has now lost roughly
100 aircraft since the U.S. and allied strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll end up with nothing at the end of this,'' said Wald,
``if he doesn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said NATO is reviewing the contours of a possible
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, with an eye toward expanding that
contingent beyond the 28,000 troops -- 4,000 of them Americans --
envisioned earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody now believes that that force is probably too small
and that a larger force will be required to go in as a peacekeeping
force,'' Bacon said. ``We don't know whether it will be twice as
large or three times as large, or 50 percent as large as we
initially planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said news reports of a new plan that would involve up to
16,000 U.S. Marines were premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are far away from that decision right now,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may end up sending all Army people, all Marines, some
combination of the two,'' said Bacon. ``We may end up sending more
than 16,000, less than 16,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by the United States, NATO launched air strikes to counter a
mounting Serb military and police offensive targeting ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic. Belgrade claimed, however, that the offensive
was necessitated by Kosovar Albanian rebels who were committing
terrorist acts against Kosovo's Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials insist the campaign will continue until
Milosevic agrees to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  end the repression;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  withdraw all Serb troops and police from Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  permit a peacekeeping force with NATO at its core to police
the peace in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  guarantee for the safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and permit political autonomy for ethnic Albanians, who made
up 90 percent of Kosovo's pre-conflict population.

TAKING PORTFOLIO CUES FROM A MAGAZINE'S LIST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you get rich investing in the companies that created the
wealth of the Forbes 400? Or in those that Fortune magazine lists
as America's most admired? You may soon be invited to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on the popularity of unit investment trusts, which
are similar to mutual funds but hold an unmanaged portfolio of
securities for a set period, John Nuveen &AMP; Co. has bundled into a
UIT the stocks on Fortune's annual list of the 10 most admired
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Prudential Securities expects by this summer
to begin selling a UIT composed of the 40 publicly traded stocks
that are the largest equity holdings of people on Forbes magazine's
list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Like many broker-sold UITs, these don't come cheap. The
Nuveen-Fortune America's Most Admired Companies Portfolio has an
up-front sales charge of 1 percent; investors who hold it for its
full two-year duration will have an additional 3.5 percent deducted
over that time as a deferred sales charge, plus annual operating
expenses of 29.25 cents for each $100 invested.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the Forbes 40 Index Trust will pay 1 percent up
front and an additional 1.75 percent deferred sales charge over the
one-year term; those who renew at the end of the year will not have
to pay another up-front fee, but the 1.75 percent will be deducted
every year.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an annual trustee's fee of 19 cents for every
$100, according to Kenneth Swankie, a Prudential senior vice
president. (Sales charges for both trusts are reduced somewhat for
purchases over $50,000; the minimum investment is $1,000 for the
Nuveen-Fortune trust and $250 for Prudential's Forbes UIT.)
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the average United States diversified stock
mutual fund charges 1.42 percent of assets for annual expenses,
excluding sales charges, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund
researchers in Chicago. Fees for unmanaged portfolios, like index
funds, tend to be far lower.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trusts' fees go to brokers and underwriters, but the
magazines will also get a portion for the use of their names.
Fortune, owned by Time Warner, will receive 10 cents a year for
every $100 invested in the Nuveen trust, said Bill Adams, an
executive vice president at Nuveen. Forbes Inc. said its cut from
Prudential had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the fees, Adams said UITs are ``a fairly economical
way of being able to purchase a basket of securities that pursue a
particular strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuveen does not offer any back-tested data of the Fortune
portfolio in its prospectus. The Forbes UIT prospectus, however,
says that a hypothetical portfolio of its stocks _ the Forbes 40
index _ would have had an annual average return of 22.5 percent
from January 1989 to December 1998, versus a total return of 19.2
percent for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the two magazines said they saw no problem with
such use of their proprietary lists, noting out publishers like Dow
Jones have licensed the use of their names with similar investment
products.
</P>
<P>
   Both trusts include many large-cap highfliers, like Wal-Mart
Stores, Microsoft and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., the research firm,
said such stocks could be among the most susceptible to a broad
market downdraft. But he added that the Forbes trust ``directs
investment into the more entrepreneurial companies, and over a
sustained period that's probably a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune UIT, he said, is a ``much more difficult call.''
After all, he said, ``most stocks at their peak are admired by
somebody.''

REGULATING RELIGIOUS LIFE IN THE OFFICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``If you've studied history, religious wars are the longest,
nastiest and bloodiest.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation comes from Dr. Charles E. Corry, 60, a Buddhist
and former Marine who has sued the Analysts International Corp.,
contending religious discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Corry's case is part of a growing number of such complaints
reaching the courts or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
_ nearly 1,800 last year, up 15 percent from the year before. But
his is no garden-variety case, and it casts a telling light on the
difficult ethical terrain surrounding religion in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Corry, a data base consultant, was not turned down for hiring or
promotion because of his faith, which is what ``religious
discrimination'' conjures up for most people. And he wasn't
involved in a dispute over proselytizing, which is the most common
religion-related problem at work.
</P>
<P>
   This more ambiguous case stems from events in the fall of 1995.
As Corry tells it, when a particularly devout Christian co-worker
complained about his use of language that included epithets laced
with references to God, an Analysts International manager told him
to conduct himself in accordance with the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `I don't think I'm going to do that. I'm not a
Christian. I've been a Buddhist since about 1958 or '59,''' Corry
said in an interview. Technically, Corry was a contract employee
working for Quest Database Consulting on a project for US West in
Denver; Analysts International had been hired to supervise contract
employees like him.
</P>
<P>
   So, after the incident, Corry wrote a letter of complaint to
Quest. Before the week was out, he said, he was told by Quest that
the Analysts International manager had terminated his contract.
</P>
<P>
   He then filed his religious discrimination claim with the EEOC,
arguing that he had been let go for objecting to being told to
follow the tenets of a religion not his own. Analysts International
countered that Corry's language was offensive to his co-workers'
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments were brought up solely to illustrate why
someone might take offense, the company's lawyer, Charles E. Jones,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that light, Corry's case isn't about discrimination so much
as balancing competing rights and sensibilities that, more and more
often, are clashing head-on in the workplace. Where does an ethical
compass point when respecting one person's religious beliefs
involves offending another's?
</P>
<P>
   Corry thinks the compass should point out the door. Religion in
the workplace ``is messy and ought to be kept completely out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not in the cards, practically speaking. ``The
workplace has taken the place of neighborhoods, families and
churches,'' said Gil Stricklin, president of Marketplace Ministries
of Dallas, which provides corporate chaplains to 170 companies.
``That's where your support, friends, and relationships come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   But defining appropriate religious behavior at work can be
tricky. Companies are usually on safe ground accommodating workers'
desires for, say, Bible study groups at lunchtime, if participation
doesn't become a de facto condition for employment or advancement.
</P>
<P>
   But courts have found that seemingly well-meant gestures like
mailing out Bible verses with paychecks constitute harassment,
because they impose religious messages with the force of the
company's voice on all workers, including those who don't want to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   In Corry's case, the jury did nothing to clarify matters. It
found simply that Analysts wrongly interfered with Corry's contract
with Quest, and awarded him damages of $34,160.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed victory. The company's lawyer said the jury
found no discrimination or retaliation. Mark Bove, Corry's lawyer,
said the jury had really found that Analysts wasn't technically
Corry's employer and so had no liability under federal law. Both
sides are appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the manager could have spared everyone a lot of
trouble by reprimanding Corry over the language and leaving the Ten
Commandments out of it. That might have kept the dispute out of the
courts. But it would have left unaddressed the ethical problem of
whose beliefs to accommodate in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you don't tie your problems in a neat little package
and leave them outside the gate at the plant,'' Stricklin said,
``you don't leave your faith out there either.'' &QL;

HOW PUZZLE MAY PLAY OUT IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's last constitutional crisis ended badly, with a
violent mutiny led by parliamentary leaders that was put down by
the president with the help of army tanks.
</P>
<P>
   That was in October 1993. By December that year, Russia had a
new constitution, tailor-made to suit President Boris Yeltsin. Six
years later, as Yeltsin heads toward another collision with another
parliament, his constitution turns out to be not much help at all.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in brief, is the predicament caused by the crisis set in
motion Wednesday by Yeltsin's decision to remove Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, on the day before the parliament began to debate
his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the lower house votes to impeach the president, it
automatically triggers a clause in the constitution that forbids
the president from disbanding that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the same chamber votes three times to reject Sergei
V. Stepashin, the president's nominee to replace Primakov, the
constitution requires Yeltsin to disband the parliament, and call
early elections.
</P>
<P>
   This open-ended contradiction is now the source of much
puzzlement in Moscow, as the Kremlin and the parliament each look
for ways to score a political victory without a repeat of the 1993
confrontation, which cost more than 140 lives.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the two sides choose to avoid violence, that does
not mean they can avoid deadlock. From the Kremlin's point of view,
a deadlock is not necessarily a bad thing, since it would allow
Yeltsin to keep the Prime Minister of his choice, in an acting
capacity, with or without the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deadlock scenario, the parliament's lower chamber, the
Duma, votes to impeach the president, probably on the charge that
accuses him of waging an illegal war in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya from 1994 to 1996. Within five days, the impeachment is
referred both to the Supreme Court, which must rule on the legal
content of the charges, and to the Constitutional Court, which
judges the constitutionality of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Only then does the impeachment move to the floor of the upper
house, the Council of Federation, where a two-thirds majority is
required to remove a president from office. If the Council has not
acted on the impeachment measure within three months of its
approval by the Duma, then the measure is considered to have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few expect an impeachment charge involving the Chechen
war to reach the Council of Federation. It will probably die an
early death in the Supreme Court, which is unlikely to overturn a
1995 ruling by the Constitutional Court that upheld the legality of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the lower house must cast its first vote on the
Stepashin nomination on Wednesday, May 19. If on a third try (after
a process that could stretch out a month), the nomination is
rejected, Yeltsin can simply carry on with his acting prime
minister, and his acting government, for as long as he wants. If
the impeachment process is still going on, he cannot disband the
Duma. If it is over, he must.
</P>
<P>
   With regularly scheduled parliamentary elections just six months
away, either scenario is fine by the Kremlin, according to a top
Yeltsin lieutenant interviewed Thursday by the Russian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Vladimir Putin, chief of the Russian Federal
Security Service, even suggested that the preferred option would be
an acting government, together with a sitting lower house, which he
said would give the government greater legitimacy both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There are more options. The impeachment vote could have strong
support but fall short of the required 300 votes in the 450-seat
Duma, delivering Yeltsin a blow that would be painful, but not
crippling. And the parliament could approve Stepashin on its first
vote. ``He just might suit quite a few people of various political
views,'' said Putin.

IMPERSONATING THE INSIDERS: YES, ITS PAYS

insider buying activity is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do they or don't they? Do corporate insiders _ like company
directors and officers _ know so much more than we do about their
company's prospects that we can beat the market simply by imitating
their purchases and sales?
</P>
<P>
   Opinion varies widely on this question, partly because
researchers themselves have changed their minds. The initial
answers came more than 30 years ago, in several academic studies
that found that investors could beat the market simply by buying
the stocks that insiders were buying.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly compelling was the fact that unlike some other
strategies, this one was so easy to practice. The Securities and
Exchange Commission requires insiders to report their purchases and
sales, and several investment newsletters translate that data into
investor-friendly formats.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was the conventional wisdom for many years. But
serious doubts were raised in the 1980s, when researchers found
that the insiders of small-capitalization companies were more
likely to buy their companies' shares than were the insiders of
larger companies. And they found that insiders of value-oriented
companies _ defined as those trading at the lowest price-to-book
ratios _ were more likely to buy than those of growth-oriented
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That research placed the earlier studies in a very different
light. It meant that those landmark studies from the 1960s might
have discovered little more than the long-term tendency for
small-cap stocks to outperform large-cap stocks, and for value
stocks to outperform growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of the newer research was that if your portfolio was
already concentrated in small-cap value stocks, you gained no
advantage from paying attention to insiders.
</P>
<P>
   That new consensus also lasted for some years. But it, too, has
come under fire, as a number of researchers have looked into
whether the patterns have endured.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they have found several wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   One study, circulating as a working paper, was conducted by
Leslie Jeng, an associate professor of finance and economics at
Boston University, and Andrew Metrick and Richard Zeckhauser, an
associate professor of economics and a professor of political
economy, respectively, at Harvard. In effect, they have found that
the studies from the 1960s were on to something after all. Though
the impact of insider buying and selling is strongest among
small-cap value stocks, they found, it nonetheless exists among
large-cap growth stocks, too.
</P>
<P>
   The professors reached their conclusion by examining every stock
insiders bought from 1975 to 1996. A hypothetical portfolio that
held each of these stocks for one year, and in the amounts bought
by the insiders, would have outperformed the market by 7.4
percentage points annually, before transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that only one-third of this outperformance could
be explained by the disproportionate propensity of insiders at
small-cap and value-oriented companies to buy their companies'
stocks. That means that even investors in large-cap growth stocks
can bolster returns by following the insiders' lead, though not as
much as with small-cap value stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you don't even have to react immediately upon
learning of an insider's buying. True, such a stock most likely
will have already risen by the time the insider's purchase is
reported publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But the professors, looking at the amount by which such a stock
beat the market over the next year, found that two-thirds of the
outperformance came after the first month. In other words, you
needn't be a day trader to benefit from the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the professors found that stocks sold by insiders
performed no better or worse, on average, than the overall market.
That makes sense, because insiders have many reasons for raising
cash. But there is just one primary reason insiders buy their
company's stock: They think it will go up.
</P>
<P>
   More companies have been lending money to insiders to buy their
shares, prompting suggestions that the insider-imitation strategy
could become less profitable. But these loan programs have gained
steam only in the last two years, after the period in the study, so
their effect is not yet known. &QL;

LEWIS DOCTOR ADMITS SUSPICION OF SERIOUS HEART PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Even though he announced at a press conference six
years ago that Celtics star Reggie Lewis did not have a
life-threatening heart condition, Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr.
acknowledged Thursday that he believed he might.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the first time in the malpractice trial stemming
from Lewis's death, Mudge also acknowledged that he ignored the
advice of a colleague who disagreed with his diagnosis and wanted
more testing.
</P>
<P>
   And he testified that Lewis's heart was electrically monitored
only twice -- for one 23-hour period and one 17-minute period -- in
the 11 weeks prior to his death on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed and died of a heart attack while casually
shooting baskets at Brandeis University. He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor, your contention is that you had not reached a
definitive diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (the benign
fainting disorder that Mudge announced Lewis had),is that
correct?'' asked Robert Harley, who represents Lewis's widow, Donna
Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct,'' said Mudge, who took over Lewis's care
after he left New England Baptist Hospital against medical advice
and transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital in early May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your contention is that you were still considering the
life-threatening arrhythmia, is that correct?'' asked Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were considering the arrhythmia as a potential cause,
yes,'' Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled by Harley, Mudge insisted that he had not said anything
inaccurate at the press conference, ``but what I did say was very
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mudge, ``We had two diagnoses, two potential diagnoses.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, during a televised press conference on May 10, 1993 --
which was replayed for jurors Thursday -- Mudge announced without
hesitation a single, apparently definitive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said that Lewis had nothing more than a ``poorly
understood'' neurological disorder that caused him to faint during
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``After extensive testing, evaluation and review of all data, I
believe that Mr. Lewis has a normal athlete's heart with normal
functions. Our testing showed no evidence of cardiomyopathy or
abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias. ...I am optimistic that
under medical supervision Mr. Reggie Lewis will be able to return
to professional basketball without limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's testimony, which came on the ninth day of a trial
estimated to last four to six weeks, echoed testimony earlier this
week from Dr. Peter L. Friedman, a Brigham cardiologist also named
in the medical malpractice lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During a full day of direct examination Thursday by Harley,
Mudge was alternately passive and feisty.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Harley about a team of four cardiologists in
California who evaluated Lewis to provide a third medical opinion,
Mudge acknowledged that one of the doctors was under consideration
for a job at the Brigham at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That doctor, William Stevenson, who backed Mudge's findings, is
now co-director, with Friedman, of Brigham's electrophysiology
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had been on not only local, but national, television with
your diagnosis,'' noted Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, to ask a doctor who plans to come to your institution that
all that stuff or some of that stuff on television is wrong is
asking a lot, do you agree with me?'' asked Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with you at all,'' said Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Harley suggested that the lure of the limelight had influenced
Mudge's medical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this press conference, you were going to be able to stand
up before Boston and the world and say that all these doctors at
the Baptist were wrong and Reggie Lewis will be able to play
basketball again,'' said Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyers objected to the question and Mudge was not
allowed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that he told Brigham nurses Lewis had to be
monitored if he engaged in ``any form of vigorous physical
exercise,'' but conceded that Lewis's discharge form indicated no
restrictions on his physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that he had not spoken with the Lewises
about an anti-arrhythmia drug on the couple's first day at the
hospital, contradicting a statement he'd given during a deposition
in which he said he'd spoken with them about the drug ``in detail''
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge acknowledged that he did not act on suggestions from Dr.
Roman W. DeSanctis -- who consulted on Lewis's case both during his
hospitalization at the Baptist and at the Brigham -- that
additional tests be performed. DeSanctis, director emeritus of
clinical cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, testified
last week that he had a letter hand-delivered to Mudge outlining
his misgivings about Mudge's diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing with Harley's suggestion that it would have been
desirable to monitor Lewis as much as possible, given that he had
not ruled out a heart condition, Mudge conceded that he
discontinued electrical monitoring of Lewis's heart two days he
left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before court recessed for the day, jurors were shown a
videotape of the May 1993 press conference at which Mudge said
Lewis suffered from neurocardiogenic syncope, a condition that
causes heart rate to fall during physical exertion.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, after Mudge announced his diagnosis, Lewis took the
microphone and said, in part, ``I'm just glad it's finally come to
an end, but with the help of Dr. Mudge, we'll still be taking
things slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched from the seat in the front row, Harris-Lewis
wept. Mudge often averted his eyes from the television monitor as
the tape was played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is not a precise science,'' he said on the videotape.
``In the end, it is a judgment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just five years ago, if you wanted a cruiser motorcycle you
bought a Harley. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before cruisers became an American phenomenon. Come
summer, highways and parking lots from coast to coast will be
buzzing with these machines designed for relaxed long-distance
travel and characterized by their roomy saddles and upright,
relaxed riding positions.
</P>
<P>
   Cruisers now represent 55 percent of the American motorcycle
market, according to Don Brown of DJB Associates, a consulting firm
in Irvine, Calif., up from 10 percent in 1991. He estimates that
cruiser sales grew 17 percent last year, to 154,000. Next year, he
expects sales to top 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cruiser motorcycles offer their buyers _ many of them baby
boomers _ freedom from their cars along with individuality,
adventure and fellowship with other riders. Beneficiaries of
increased disposable income in a booming economy, cruisers offer an
alternative to adult toys like sports cars or boats. They are more
maneuverable than heavy touring bikes and more comfortable than
agile sport bikes.
</P>
<P>
   There are more cruisers for sale this spring than ever before.
Not only is Harley-Davidson working on new models _ it already has
24 on the market _ but all four Japanese manufacturers have
invested heavily in cruisers and the Europeans aren't far behind.
There are also two new American manufacturers, Excelsior-Henderson
and Polaris.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson's share of the American cruiser market may have
slipped _ to about 55 percent from 100 percent in half a decade _
but it still sets the tone for all cruisers. Harleys have an
imposing presence _ visually and aurally _ with their big V-twin
engines, big torque, big fenders, big tanks, big saddles for two,
small mufflers (the better to keep the noise level high), low seat
height (accommodating male or female riders), lustrous paint and
chrome and lots of accessories for customization.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson may have had this market to itself for decades,
but its tremendous success _ customers routinely have to wait six
months for delivery _ convinced other motorcycle companies to jump
into the cruiser segment. Here are eight of the leading cruisers on
the market this summer: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW R1200C The giant German auto and motorcycle maker introduced
its first cruiser last year after going 75 years without one, and
it quickly became the company's best-selling motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   The R1200C uses BMW's traditional horizontally opposed
1,170-cubic-centimeter fuel-injected engine _ the company's
largest, most powerful ever. The smallest engine in the senior
cruiser group, it produces more than 70 foot-pounds of torque with
a five-speed transmission and BMW's time-tested shaft-drive system.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is unlike most cruisers', with the company's
patented Telelever front and Monolever rear suspension instead of
conventional forks and swing arms. The R1200C is the most
radical-looking cruiser, with its pulled-back handlebars _ nearly
chopper style _ a solo saddle with a pillion pad behind it, a
simple bar-mounted gauge cluster and more chrome than you'll find
on any other BMW. Options include saddle bags, a tank bag and _
unique among cruisers _ anti-lock brakes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: The flashiest cruiser. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXCELSIOR-HENDERSON SUPER X A combination of two classic
American motorcycle brands that went out of production decades ago,
the Excelsior-Henderson is built by the Hanlon family and their
staff in a new factory in Belle Plaine, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The Super X has a 1,386cc 50-degree V-twin engine with overhead
cams, four valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection. There
is an exposed coil spring leading-link front suspension; the forks
go right through the fenders, just like those on the 1931
Excelsior. The fenders are fully valanced _ they cover the tread,
and much of the sidewall, of the tires _ another nostalgic touch.
The Super X has quiet belt drive instead of chain or shaft drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Super X is pricey _ $18,000 for solid black, more for
two-tone versions.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Lots of power and excellent brakes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HARLEY-DAVIDSON ROAD KING Of Harley's 24 models, the Road King
is the prototypical cruiser. This year, it features the all-new
Twin Cam 88, a 45-degree V-twin engine of 88 cubic inches that
produces 82 foot-pounds of torque. The engine is mounted indirectly
to minimize vibration and is linked to a five-speed transmission
and a quiet, reinforced rubber-belt drive system.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Harleys, the Road King makes few concessions to weight
reduction; while the Japanese and German bikes are using aluminum,
the Harley packs a lot of iron and steel under its paint. The
result is a weight of 699 pounds on a short 63.5-inch wheelbase.
</P>
<P>
   The Road King can be dressed out with hundreds of
Harley-Davidson accessories from windshields and extra driving
lamps to saddle bags and chrome dress-up items. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: The best all-round Harley. &QL;

 &HT;    Sobieski hitching her star to a saint
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's one of Hollywood's It Kids: a 16-year-old actress whose
star is on the rise. Her fair, entrancingly plain looks have
prompted comparisons to a young Helen Hunt, but Leelee Sobieski
already is carving out her own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski stars as the teenage saint in ``Joan of Arc,'' CBS's
$25 million miniseries that airs at 9 p.m. Sunday and Tuesday.
She's also in the upcoming ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the much-anticipated
movie directed by the late Stanley Kubrick and starring Nicole
Kidman and Tom Cruise. Other credits: The current Drew Barrymore
comedy, ``Never Been Kissed,'' and TV movies ``Reunion'' and ``A
Horse for Danny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski calls her acting career ``an accident.'' She was found
by a casting agent in her New York private school cafeteria. When
not working, she still goes to high school there, living at home
with her father (a painter), mother (a writer) and brother (a
10-year-old).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no clue what acting was,'' she says. ``I was horrible.
Then I thought, `Maybe I should figure out how to play this game.'
Things started happening. My parents said, `As long as you stay
grounded, we'll support you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what else Sobieski had to say before the ``Joan'' debut:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On being an actress and a high school sophomore: When I'm
working, I have one life, and when I go back to school, I have a
whole other life. I call my friends for the local gossip, figure
out what's going on. Things like, ``I sort of have a boyfriend
now,'' or ``I don't want any boyfriends,'' or ``I'm mad at her
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On people thinking she resembles a young Helen Hunt: I think
it's a nice thing. She's a very nice actress. But I don't see any
resemblance at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On strong roles for teenage girls: For a while (Hollywood)
thought only young men or teenage boys could lead a film. Now there
are a lot of female teenage roles _ though often they're played by
24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On not letting fame go to her head: I'm very close to my
family, and my mother, father and little brother keep me grounded.
I tell my parents everything _ they're my best friends in the
world. They know me better than I know myself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On religion: I'm not sure of my religion. I was taught when I
was little I could go to any religious ceremony I wanted to. It was
left up to me. I always celebrated Christmas _ all little kids love
presents. But I haven't decided yet if there's a religion I'd like
to have. I like the idea of a religion, it's great guidance. But I
don't feel I have to seek that guidence (right now). My parents are
behind me 100 percent, so I'm not seeking that yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On experiencing the power of Joan of Arc: Charging (on a
horse) in front of an army with 200 people behind you, charging
toward this fortress, you do feel powerful. You do feel a lot of
the things she was going through. Then they yell, ``Cut!'' and none
of the men are following you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On watching previous film portrayals of Joan of Arc, by Ingrid
Bergman (1948) and Jean Seberg (1957): In the Seberg
virgin,version, I didn't see any spark in her. She seemed so
monotone. In the Bergman version, she was actually sleeping with
the director at the time, so I was wondering how she portrayed a
virgin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On what surprised her in researching this role: I don't know
if it's a fact or not, but when (Joan) was burned at the stake, her
heart didn't burn, which I think is so cool.

<P>
   HONDA VALKYRIE Instead of a V-twin engine, Honda uses the
``flat,'' or horizontally opposed, 1,520cc six-cylinder engine from
the huge Gold Wing touring bike, only with more power and torque.
The Valkyrie is the quickest and fastest cruiser you can buy.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Honda offers the basic Valkyrie, the dressed-up
Valkyrie Tourer and the full-dress Valkyrie Interstate, all using
the flat six with six carburetors and more than 100 horsepower.
They all have five-speed transmissions, shaft drive and triple-disk
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The dry, or unloaded, weight is 682 pounds. The 66.5-inch
wheelbase and a relatively tall seat height of 29.1 inches. The
Valkyrie family runs from $12,799 to $15,999, depending on the
model and paint. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Tops in power. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KAWASAKI DRIFTER 1500 The new Drifter is a cruiser designed to
look like the venerable Indian Chief last produced in 1953. Its
designers chose black paint instead of chrome for its frame, forks,
headlamp housing, fender braces and bag mounts _ a decidedly retro
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Drifter's 1500cc V-twin engine has four valves and two spark
plugs per cylinder and uses digital electronic fuel injection.
There is a counterbalancing shaft and rubber engine mounts for
smoothness. The five-speed transmission automatically helps the
rider to find neutral and uses shaft drive to transmit power to the
rear wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The Drifter weighs 668 pounds, rides on a 65.2-inch wheelbase
and has a 29.1-inch seat height. Prices start at $11,499; a lot of
accessories are available, including two saddles, a tank trim panel
and accessory headlamps. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Long on torque and nostalgia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   POLARIS VICTORY V92C This is the first motorcycle from Polaris,
a company famous for its snowmobiles and personal watercraft. Built
along very traditional but very clean lines, the deep-fendered
Victory uses a 1,507cc V-twin engine with the cylinders splayed at
a 50-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   It is a single-overhead-cam engine with oil cooling, four valves
per cylinder and electronic fuel injection that produces a lot of
torque. The Victory uses a five-speed transmission and belt drive,
as well as cast aluminum wheels. Unlike most cruisers, the
Victory's engine is used as a part of the frame to give the chassis
added strength.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: An excellent first effort. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI VL1500 INTRUDER Suzuki builds V-twin cruisers with the
most radical designs, featuring very tall engine cylinders with a
narrow V-angle, chopper-style gas tanks and alloy front and rear
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The VL1500 Intruder has a 45-degree V-twin engine like the
Harley, liquid-cooled and tuned for peak torque at very low engine
speeds. The engine uses dual-downdraft 36-millimeter carburetors
and hydraulic valve adjusters for minimal maintenance. There is
also a digital electronic ignition system, a five-speed
transmission and maintenenace-free shaft drive. The suggested
retail price is $9,899. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: The four-digit pricing is attractive. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YAMAHA ROAD STAR This is the most Harley-like of all the
Japanese cruisers, and its mechanical formula is simplicity itself.
It uses a 1,602cc 48-degree overhead-valve V-twin engine, the
largest in the industry. It has one cam, four valves and two spark
plugs per cylinder, and the most torque _ 99 foot-pounds. The
single-carburetor engine puts power through a five-speed
transmission and Yamaha's first belt-drive system.
</P>
<P>
   The Road Star features a retro instrument cluster with Art Deco
graphics, lots of chrome trim and more than 100 accessories from
lights to luggage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Awesome torque, Harley looks. &QL;

 &HT;    Ohio Senator heads to Balkans on fact-finding mission
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. George Voinovich, who has been critical of the
air war against Yugoslavia, expects to leave today for a three-day
trip through the Balkans ``to add to my understanding,'' of the
situation, he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While talking with reporters about the trip, the Republican from
Cleveland, Ohio remained opposed to the NATO bombing policy and
spoke again of the need to find an immediate diplomatic solution to
the fight over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to my statements,'' Voinovich said, ``what I
expected to happen is what has happened. The longer we go the more
unglued the situation becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich is of Serbian and Slovenian ancestry and early in the
conflict he drew upon his sense of history about the region to warn
that bombs alone wouldn't deter Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic from reclaiming Kosovo. He also said that Yugoslavians,
who have not been supportive of Milosevic's presidency, were likely
to rally behind him when Belgrade came under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich plans to travel with seven other senators to make a
diplomatic and fact-finding visit to the region. First they plan to
meet with officials in Hungary and then Bulgaria, two countries
that border Yugoslavia, to plumb their views of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they hope to visit a refugee camp in Albania before being
briefed at the Aviano Air Base in Italy and the NATO Headquarters
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to try to add to my understanding... ``
Voinovich said, ``by getting into what the actual facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trip could be postponed for a looming vote on the $11.9
billion emergency spending bill written to cover costs of the
Kosovo operation. The final bill, still being fine-tuned by House
and Senate negotiators late last night, nearly doubled the amount
of money President Clinton had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said Thursday he hadn't decided how he'd vote on the
spending bill because it contained a variety of provisions and he
had not yet seen it.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``If we're there, we've got to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cost of fighting over Kosovo is another factor that
drives Voinovich to want peace as quickly as possible. He doesn't
think NATO or the U.S. realizes how difficult and costly it would
be to expel Serbian military forces from Kosovo if the bombing
campaign never brings about a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some real budgetary decisions to be made on this by
congress,'' Voinovich said. ``Nobody's going to want to cut
domestic spending to pay for this, and nobody's going to want to
use the surplus and nobody's going to want to raise taxes. But
those are the choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very serious stuff.''

 &HT;    New `Joan' has historical sweep, plenty of heart
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leelee Sobieski glows. Even when she's not being burned at the
stake as Joan of Arc, even in the midst of a battle scene bogged
down in mud, the 16-year-old actress (who strongly resembles a
young Helen Hunt) is so radiant, so utterly convinced and
convincing, that you'll want to follow her into battle just like
legions of mud-spattered Frenchmen do repeatedly in ``Joan of
Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Joan unified a divided and dispirited France in the 15th
century, Sobieski is the charismatic center that holds this
four-hour miniseries together. Despite a rocky start and too many
slo-mo war scenes, ``Joan'' ultimately is a pretty dang good stab
at finding the human being in the saint and legend.
</P>
<P>
   And compared with the other historical biggies of May sweeps _
NBC's laughable ``Noah's Ark'' and ABC's upcoming cheeseball
``Cleopatra'' _ ``Joan'' shines like polished armor.
</P>
<P>
   Most American viewers are probably familiar only with the
broadest outline of who Joan was and what she did, despite frequent
retellings of her legend, including George Bernard Shaw's famous
play ``Saint Joan.'' CBS' version, premiering on the anniversary of
Joan's canonization by the Roman Catholic Church as a saint (May
16, 1920), gets a lot of the history right without ever forgetting
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Born to peasants (Powers Boothe, Jacqueline Bisset) in Domremy,
France, in 1412, Jeanne begins to see visions and hear the voices
of saints speaking to her as a young girl. At 16, she leaves her
family on a mission to unify France, which is in the middle of the
Hundred Years' War, fighting both the English and the Burgundians
(now part of France).
</P>
<P>
   Her first stop is the palace of Charles the Dauphin (Neil
Patrick Harris), a weak prince who's supposed to be king but can't
get his royal act together. She inspires Charles, perhaps a little
too much; in Part 2, finally a king, he'll turn on her and prove to
be as manipulative as he once was weak. She also has her first
run-in with Bishop Cauchon (Peter O'Toole), a composite character
who signifies how the church of the day first used Joan, then
turned against her.
</P>
<P>
   Believing her to be a warrior of legend, the Maid of Lorraine,
the French rally to Joan and win a series of battles. But she's no
match for the plotting of Charles and Cauchon and is eventually
tried for heresy, both for claiming to hear directly from saints
and for wearing men's clothing. She was burned at the stake in 1431
at the age of 19, although the verdict against her was soon
annulled _ just not soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski, who starred in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries''
and had a generic teen-girl role in ``Deep Impact,'' has a
career-making role here, while O'Toole has a career-capping one. As
Cauchon accuses Joan, his words are harsh and unequivocal, but his
face is filled with ambivalence and even envy for this illiterate
child. Her faith is so pure, and his so complicated. ``Joan of
Arc'' is both _ pure and complicated.

THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., S.C.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can be as romantic as you please about love,'' George
Bernard Shaw wrote, ``but you mustn't be romantic about money.'' He
wasn't wrong. Money _ the making of it and the spending of it _ is
the No. 1 source of argument for couples.
</P>
<P>
   During courtship, however, the discussion of money can be a
major taboo. After just two drinks, many people are more than happy
to spill their sexual beans. But ask about their net worth and _
boom! _ you're branded as rude, or, worse, as a gold digger.
</P>
<P>
   The direct approach _ ``What's your salary?'' _ is socially
unacceptable. Even the slightly more subtle ``So, did the IRS hit
you hard this year?'' can seem too prying. Sure, you can make
intelligent assessments by considering where a person lives, or the
kind of car she drives. But what if you're from Manhattan, where
few people own cars and the size of one's apartment doesn't
necessarily reflect your bank account?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, gauging a potential partner's financial status was
easy: Your parents did it for you. Your beloved would be invited to
meet the folks, who would engage in polite, if serious, grilling.
All parties knew this was more of a job interview than friendly
chitchat over chicken Marsala; they were digging for a Future, or
the size of a dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the task of talking about money is generally left to the
couple. And many couples don't know how to approach it, or when.
``On a first date it's completely inappropriate to talk about
money,'' said Randall Lane, editor of P.O.V., a men's magazine.
``On the 2nd or 10th it is, too. No one wants to feel like they're
going to be a meal ticket; they want to be loved for who they are.
Eventually, in a long-term relationship, finances will come out,
but in the nascent days it's bad form, a big red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Fishman, 25, a publicist with JP Communications in New
York, would agree. Ms. Fishman and her boyfriend for three years,
Randy Weinberger, didn't have the Conversation until they had been
dating for eight months and were starting to get serious. ``My
expectations are high and I wanted to know where he was going with
his career,'' Ms. Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   So they sat down and discussed their futures and what they
wanted from their life together. Ms. Fishman explained that she
wasn't looking for, say, a Bill Gates, but that she did have
certain needs and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him there are things I want my kids to have, and if in
five years he's making his current salary, we won't even be able to
have kids,'' she said. ``I've seen too many of my friends' parents
split up because of money problems, and I want to pre-empt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger, also 25, has similar concerns, though he
acknowledged that the discussion was not the most pleasant.
``Initially, I felt she was being superficial, but as we went on I
saw things more her way,'' said Weinberger, vice president of
operations at Sakon, a company in North Bergen, N.J., that provides
international telecommunications and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to think you can go through life with money
issues and be happy,'' he said. ``It breaks down to, `Do I want to
spend my life with you, and do I want to struggle all my life?' She
said that to me, and at first it makes you question yourself. But
when you think about it, it makes sense. It's something that should
be directly discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   What can happen when it's not discussed early on? One woman, a
hospital administrator in South Carolina in her late 20s, says she
never talked about money with her husband until after they were
married. ``I thought love was enough,'' she said. But eventually,
she saw that her financial ambitions were much higher than his.
</P>
<P>
   They are now separated, with money differences a major reason.
``I can't be with someone who isn't driven,'' the woman explained.
``I don't need to be with an oil baron, or a guy with excessive
tastes, but I want to be with someone who can hold his own and also
has similar values.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she discuss money with prospective boyfriends? ``I
hint,'' she said with a laugh. ``I talk about the lottery and how
I'd like to open a children's center if I win. Or I say: `Oh, I'd
like to make six figures one day. What are your dreams?'''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's a good tactic for females to use to determine
the net worth of a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A practical view _ and a Shavian one, if not particularly
romantic. &QL;

HOW TO CATCH A RISING STAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Q. (italics)I own a small ad agency. We operate on an extremely
tight budget and can't afford to pay the salaries our larger
competitors do. As a result, we have difficulty hiring and holding
on to qualified support staff. We are about to start yet another
search for a business manager, and I'm desperate for tips on how to
woo, win and keep a good person.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Forget the money. If you can't compete with the big boys on
salary, you need to advertise the benefits of working for an
up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies offer a number of advantages, said Kevin
Klinvex, co-founder of Select International, a Pittsburgh-based
firm that helps corporations with their hiring practices. ``People
are generally given more responsibility faster'' at a smaller firm,
he said. ``They absolutely have to wear more hats. They have access
to decision makers. They can make an impact more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   You also need to telegraph the benefits of your workplace, said
Lou Adler, author of ``Hire With Your Head'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons,
1998). Even the classified ads you place should focus on where a
candidate can go, rather than on where she's been. ``Most ads say,
`Must have four years of this, two years of this, five years of
this.''' Adler said. But you need to give people a sense of the new
skills they can gain with your firm. People are generally willing
to earn a little less for a chance to grow, he added.
</P>
<P>
   You may also need to redefine your target audience. Don't go
after people already earning $60,000 a year, Adler advised;
instead, ``take someone just out of school or someone from a junior
college who's a little older.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on alma maters and years of experience,
list the core competencies you need _ teamwork, for example, or
organizational or communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Then get creative in your search. Where do potential candidates
hang out? What organizations do they join? Try professional groups
at area colleges, Adler suggested.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates arrive for interviews, remember your dual goals:
to hire (italics)and(end italics) keep a good employee. ``Make sure
you spend time asking what their needs are and what they're looking
for in a job,'' Klinvex said.
</P>
<P>
   When you find a winner, move fast. ``Star performers are on the
market for about a day,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And once that dream employee comes aboard, keep the work
challenging. ``That doesn't mean every task has to be exciting,''
Klinvex said, but people need to feel they're working together
toward a shared vision. If your new employee thinks she's only
pushing papers in pursuit of a paycheck, you can't expect her to
stay when the chance for a bigger paycheck comes along.

KOSOVO AND TORNADO RELIEF COMES AT A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK with TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the face of it, the seven-year battle over a mining
company's petition to blow a 900-foot hole in a mountain in
northern Washington state and extract the gold inside would seem to
have nothing to do with an emergency bill in Congress to aid war
refugees in Kosovo and victims of the recent Midwest tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only on the face of it. In fact, negotiations on the
spending bill, which lurched slowly toward conclusion on Thursday
night, were bogged down by the efforts of lawmakers to add pet
projects, anti-environmental riders and other provisions that were
driving the cost of the measure to $14.6 billion, more than twice
the amount President Clinton had sought for war and disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Buckhorn Mountain, in the Okanogan Highlands of
north-central Washington, comes in. So far, Washington's senior
senator, Slade Gorton, a Republican who is running for re-election
next year, has attached language to the spending bill that
effectively overturns a Clinton administration decision to deny a
permit for the mine. The administration says that mining would
leave far too much cyanide-treated waste rock on federal land at
the mountain, near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-mining measure, or rider, is just one that members of
Congress from all over the nation are trying to attach to the
spending bill. Also being hashed over are hundreds of millions of
dollars in farm aid, loan programs for the steel, oil and gas
industries and a host of other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has been fighting for language to
force the White House to keep the Alabama sturgeon off the
endangered species amendment. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, has added
$3 million for commercial reindeer herders.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation, of course, is often made in ways that are not
pretty, and riders have been around almost since the dawn of the
Republic. But many involved in the fight in the Capitol say they
find something particularly distasteful about the way that this
bill, also intended to provide help for victims of last year's
Central American hurricanes, has been sidetracked by matters
affecting so many other people whose interests are, to say the
least, less urgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is about as low as it goes,'' said Marty Haden,
director of policy and legislation for the Earthjustice Legal
Defense Fund, an environmental group that opposes the Buckhorn
Mountain mining project. ``The supporters of these efforts are
cynically taking advantage of a very real human tragedy, by
including this provision and others like it in a bill meant to aid
victims of natural disaster and war.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the provisions are equally resentful. Gorton,
for instance, who was huddling with a mining lobbyist late
Wednesday night outside a Capitol basement conference room
reviewing proposed language, said that including the rider in a
bill that is unlikely to be vetoed was a perfectly acceptable way
of overturning the administration's decision to block the mine.
</P>
<P>
   The mining company, Battle Mountain Gold of Houston, and a
partner, Crown Resources Corp. of Denver, have spent years and
estimated $80 million on the permit process, and have obtained
permits from lower agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just immoral,'' Gorton said of the recent decision,
which was made by the Interior Department and is part of a debate
over a century-old mining law that has allowed companies to extract
billions of dollars of minerals from federal land and pay no
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The senator added, ``This is not how an honest government deals
with its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill was described as a mess early on Thursday by
Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, and negotiators were meeting in the
Capitol again on Thursday evening to try to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the president is pressing for speedy passage of any
package that will allow the United States and its NATO allies to
fight the war in Yugoslavia and aid refugees, a White House
spokeswoman held out the possibility of a veto and blamed Congress
for ``trying to take advantage of emergency needs in Kosovo and
Central America by loading up this bill with everybody's pet
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has strongly defended the project as an economic boon for
a depressed area of Washington, Okanogan County, which has an
unemployment rate of about 11 percent, more than twice the state
average.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the area are enthusiastic about Gorton's
support of the mine project, which could employ 140 people for
about 10 years and yield as much as half a billion dollars of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several bad years in a row in the apples market; the
timber industry is down,'' said Jimmie Dale Walker, the mayor of
Oroville, a town of 1,500 people near Buckhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian
Reservation, whose members live near five streams with headwaters
on Buckhorn Mountain, are bitterly opposed. Many of the critics say
the mine threatens the spectacular qualities that have made tourism
an important part of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have this kind of star in their eyes that they're
going to get rich on the gold mine, instead of looking at the
natural beauty all around them and working with that,'' said Dave
Kliegman, executive director of the Okanogan Highlands Alliance, a
local environment group.

A MELLOWER JOHN MELLENCAMP MUSES ABOUT MUSIC TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ John Mellencamp, the feisty Indiana rocker who gave us
hits like ``Hurts So Bad,'' ``Pink Houses'' and ``Jack and Diane,''
knows rock 'n' roll isn't the cultural force it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to realize that what a lot of us grew up
listening to is just another music form today,'' Mellencamp, 47,
said recently in a phone interview from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to look at the situation today in the same way
that Frank Sinatra looked at things when Elvis Presley and the
Beatles showed up. It's like, `Hey, who are these guys? We kind of
had it our own way for a while. Why are they messin' up our gig?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it isn't rock that dominates the record charts, but
hip-hop, R&AMP;B, Latin and mainstream pop. (Mellencamp recently
authorized rewrites of his 1981 hit, ``Jack and Diane,'' by rappers
Jay-Z and Puff Daddy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you listen to the radio, it'll tell you that,''
Mellencamp said. ``And when you turn on MTV, it'll tell you that
rock music is not the most important music anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As he nears 50, Mellencamp has mixed feelings about rock's
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened by it in one sense and encouraged in another,''
he said. ``It's sad when the soundtrack of your life starts to fade
into the background. But people my age don't need music to tell us
who we are _ or to express our feelings for us. We're capable of
doing that on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who began his recording career in the '70s as Johnny
Cougar, realized that popular music was changing when he saw rapper
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the cover of Time magazine a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like the Rolling Stones,'' Mellencamp said. ``It was
the same kind of rebellion for a new generation that the Rolling
Stones were for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp is on tour right now, with a stop in Washington
state's The Gorge on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp's new album, ``John Mellencamp,'' is one of the most
reflective of his career. It's filled with songs of struggle and
growth, such as ``Your Life Is Now,'' written with longtime
collaborator George Green, and ``I'm Not Running Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who suffered a heart attack in 1994 at age 42,
describes ``Your Life Is Now'' as ``a kind of Post-It note'' to
Green about living for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 30s, I was too busy worrying about what was going to
happen next to enjoy the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the early '90s, I was getting terribly bitter about my job
and my career.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been doing it for 20 years, and for 15 years I'd been on the
road every day, day in and day out. I just got tired of it. I only
did it because I had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I decided that I was really wasting an opportunity
and that I needed to refocus my life. My wife had a lot to do with
changing my outlook. It was like when somebody looks at you and
they say, `You know, you're an idiot for thinking like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Not Running Anymore'' is an upbeat song about fatherhood
and faded youth. One of the verses is about Mellencamp's sons _
Hud, 6, and Speck, 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them acting like Johnny Cougar _ always in a hurry,
spittin' and cussin' _ I tell them, `Hey, guys, slow down a little
bit. We don't have to do it this way.' And that's how that verse
came about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who is now with Columbia Records after 20 years with
Mercury Records, recorded his new album with his longtime band.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a vast wealth of experience,'' Mellencamp said. ``So
before we started making the record, I said, `Look, we've been
doing this for a long time. Let's pool all our knowledge and all
our experience and all our musical ability.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp also encouraged them to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Music has changed quite a bit, so it doesn't
matter what kind of record we make. It's probably not going to be
on the radio like our records used to be. It's probably not going
to sell like our records used to. So really all we have to do is
entertain ourselves and make a record that people are going to
love.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who still lives in his hometown of Belmont, Ind.,
named his current ``Rural Electrification Tour'' after a U.S.
government program in the 1930s that brought electricity to rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to this journalist friend of mine and we were
talking about what a concert is supposed to do for people. And he
said that it should give them power over the evening, power over
their day-to-day lives,'' Mellencamp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what rural electrification did during the Depression.
It gave people in the country power over the evening. And I mean
power in terms of light and music and eventually television. It
gave them a way to communicate with the cities and it gave them the
music of Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams.''

SILVERBULLETDAY OUT OF PREAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE - Silverbulletday, the sensational filly listed as the
7-2 second choice, was withdrawn Thursday from Saturday's Preakness
at Pimlico. Vicar was all but removed from the race, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The connections of both horses were deeply disappointed that
they wound up with the two outside posts for the Preakness,
Silverbulletday in No. 14, and Vicar in No. 13, leading to the
defection of one, and near defection of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out,'' said Silverbulletday's owner, Mike Pegram.
``Silverbulletday will run (Friday) in the Black-Eyed Susan. We
came up here intending to run in the Preakness, we didn't even know
how long the Black-Eyed Susan was until we looked it up in the book
(Thursday) morning. The Belmont (June 5) is not in the plans. We'll
go in the Black-Eyed Susan, and see what fate has to deal us from
there. It hurts, but it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, a colt, is listed at 30-1 for the Preakness, but he was
only 8-1 in the May 1 Kentucky Derby, and is still considered a
threat. However, owner James Tafel and trainer Carl Nafzger were so
horrified by Vicar's six-wide trip in the Derby, which led to an
18th place finish, that they almost didn't bring Vicar to Pimlico.
At Friday's draw, their worst fear was realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not run from No. 13,'' said Nafzger Thursday. ``I have
enough sense not to predict an unpredictable game, so we will wait
until (Saturday) morning. But we will not run out of 13, for sure.
After that, if there is a scratch, Mr. Tafel and I will make a
management decision. But I'm not saying we'll run from No. 12,
either. In racing, you don't guess it, you just go with it. I'm
definitely not scratching until the parties are over. I'm not
wishing anybody bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nafzger scratches Vicar, winner of the Fountain of Youth and
Florida Derby, it will be because he doesn't have enough confidence
that his charge, whose style is to press the early pace, can win
from the outside. But nobody lacks confidence in Silverbulletday,
winner of 10 of 11 starts and over $2 million in purses. It's just
that Pegram and trainer Bob Baffert don't want her beaten up by
bigger, stronger males in a roughly run race.
</P>
<P>
   Only four fillies have won the Preakness in 123 runnings, the
last being Nellie Morse in 1924. The others were: Flocarline in
1903; Whimsical, '06, and and Rhine Maiden, '15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a filly in a large field, you have to be careful,
especailly if you have a filly with a future,'' said Baffert, who
trains Silverbulletday and another outstanding filly, the more
robust Excellent Meeting, who ran fifth in the Derby and will run
in the Preakness as the 5-1 third pick in the morning line. ``It
takes an exceptional filly to run with colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent Meeting showed in the Derby that she can do it. She
was beaten just a little over two lengths, and she easily lost
seven or eight lengths to trouble. She could easily have won the
Derby. Excellent Meeting is a great filly, and she came out of the
Derby great. Both of my fillies are seasoned, they've got the
credentials. But, even in the Black-Eyed Susan, Sillvebulletday is
going to need luck. This game is all about racing luck. She's got
them over a barrel, but you need the trip in any race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take care of Silverbulletday. This was a hard
decision. If this had happened to Excellent Meeting, we wouldn't
have run her, either. In this game, you expect the worst and hope
for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three fillies have won the Derby in 125 runnings, and D.
Wayne Lukas, Baffert's main rival, trained one of them, Winning
Colors in 1988 (the others were: Regret in 1915, and Genuine Risk,
'80). Winning Colors, who went wire-to-wire in the Derby, was
belted around in the Preakness, finshing third; then finished a
badly beaten sixth in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing with fillies, and this is me talking, not
Baffert, is that when your training horses, time is your ally, and
the Derby to the Preakness is the shortest time between races,''
said Lukas. ``Bob knows his fillies. The question is: Can they come
back to their form or not? We all agree that they're good enough. I
don't know how Excellent Meeting will come out of the Derby. When
Winning Colors won the Derby, she had a relatively easy race. But,
the way the Preakness was run, she could not win. Our whole concern
with Winning Colors was getting her energy back up after the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any trainer who rolls the dice with a filly in the Derby,
well, that's their problem. It's awfully tough to come back to the
Preakness and do it again with a filly. Excellent Meeting had a
very tough trip in the Derby. That would compromise any horse's
chances in the Preakness, let alone a filly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen head here at Pimlico are as bad as 20 at Churchill. I
hope a traffic jam doesn't happen. I hope everybody gets a clean
trip, but when you run 14 horses, the race is not going to be
trouble free.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Silverbulletday, and, most likely, Vicar, won't
contest the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immediate beneficiary of the withdrawal of Silvebulletday
was trainer Nick Zito, who obtained the considerable services of
jockey Gary Stevens aboard Stephen Got Even for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, the regular rider of Stephen Got Even, injured
his foot while working a horse at Hollywood Park Monday morning,
but Zito was patient, realizing that Baffert had cross-entered both
of his fillies in the Black-Eyed Susan, and the Silvebulletday
situation worked out in Zito's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this colt is very deserving,'' said Zito. ``He's a
wonderful horse. He had a big excuse in the Derby (wiped out on the
first turn). We'll find out Saturday. I'm very grateful that we
were able to get Gary. I'll buy Mr. Pegram anything he'd like. Do
you think he'd like a new suit?''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the regular rider of Silverbulletday, will ride her in
the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan, in which she will break from post
No. 1 against eight rivals. Excellent Meeting will be scratched
from the Black-Eyed Susan, and will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux in
the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Elliott Walden schooled 5-2 Preakness favorite Menifee
in the area of the Pimlico turf course where the horses will be
saddled for the Preaknes. Menifee was established the choice off a
fast-closing second to Derby winner Charismatic, who is trained by
Lukas and is 6-1. ``I think he'll probably be up closer than he was
in the Derby,'' said Walden. ``He got shuffled back early, but we
got a good draw for this race (No. 5), and Pat (Day) should be able
to place him where he wants. He's an extremely good horse. He ran a
great race to get past all those horses in the Derby. It does seem
like this group is void of true speed. Everybody wants to be a
stalker. The field did not spread out well in Kentucky.'' . . . Tom
Albertrani, assistant trainer for the Godolphin Stable of Dubai,
expects a better race out of Worldly Manner, who faded to seventh
in the Derby after running a strong nine furlongs in the 10-furlong
event. ``He ran a credible race,'' said Albertrani. ``He was
pulling a little bit too much for his own good, and it wore him
out. He'll be a little more relaxed for the Preakness. He came out
of the Derby in great shape, and we're pretty confident. The Derby
tunned him up, but we have no regrets about the way we handled him
(Worldly Manner did not have an official prep race.) Maybe, next
time, we'll take a different approach. He will improve from the
Derby to the Preakness, more mentally than physically.''

SAPOLU REFLECTS ON FRIEND TUINEI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Sapolu is on the line from Hawaii, and he is reflecting on
the death of his longtime friend, Mark Tuinei.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in a state of shock ... absolutely stunned,'' said
Sapolu, who attended Tuinei's funeral Thursday afternoon at Central
Union Church in Honolulu. ``To be honest you, I've taken this even
harder than when my mom passed away six months ago. At least my mom
lived a long and full life, and I expected it. But what happened to
Mark is just so stunning. He had so much more life to live. I still
don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drugs including heroin have been determined as the cause of
Tuinei's death that has sent shock waves through the athletic
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea that Mark was doing any of that stuff,'' said
Sapolu. ``I don't know, maybe Mark needed another challenge to
replace the high of playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really understands what a football player goes through
after retirement. It's a terrible adjustment. It's a complete
cultural shock. I remember last July was the first time since 1983
I wasn't at an NFL training camp, and there were some days when my
body started to sweat even though I wasn't practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to suddenly put down your weapon when you've
been playing football for so much of your life. You have to find
other things to do, and you have to stay away from the team. I
heard Mark still worked out at the Dallas Cowboy training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapolu and Tuinei played together at the University of Hawaii
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just two kids from Hawaii who didn't draw much
interest from the NFL,'' said Sapolu, who now lives in the Park
Estates area of Long Beach with wife Lisa and four children. ``I
was an 11th round pick from the San Francisco 49ers and Mark signed
as a free agent with the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   But both offensive linemen would wind up flourishing in the NFL
for 15 years with the same team, with Sapolu appearing on four
victorious 49er Super Bowl teams and Tuinei on three victorious
ones with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Saleamua (NFL defensive lineman) and I were playing golf
the last time I talked to Mark Tuinei,'' related Sapolu. ``He
called me on my cell phone and kidded me about how bad a golf
player I was. That was on a Saturday. The following Thursday I was
up in San Francisco doing some business when a friend of mine from
Hawaii told me he had just heard of Mark's death on ESPN radio. I
thought it was some kind of joke. But, sadly, it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapolu these days serves as the Hawaiian coordinator for Pre
Paid Legal Services Inc., flying once a month to his native state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it a point to keep myself busy,'' he said. ``You
just have to. You can't sit around, and think about football
because that's gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still can't believe that Mark is gone forever. He kept
in good shape. And he was a great guy, one of my best friends. I
think back to all the great times we had together, and it has to
end like this. It's just all so sad and tragic'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State will announce today that its longtime men's
volleyball coach, Ray Ratelle, will retire after next season and
will be replaced by Alan Knipe, his assistant the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Knipe, a former 49er All American who played on Ratelle's 1991
NCAA team, also will have a new title next season associate head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Ratelle, whose 49ers will return all six starters from the team
that lost to BYU in the NCAA title game Saturday, has been a
popular and successful fixture at Long Beach State for the past 18
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to remain involved with the program on an
emeritus basis for at least two years after Knipe assumes control.

$807 MILLION MORE AVAILABLE TO TEXAS LAWMAKERS, SAYS COMPTOLLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just when lawmakers appeared to be gridlocked
over fiscal issues, state revenue estimators Thursday said there
will be $807 million more than expected for the next two years,
increasing the likelihood of significant teacher pay raises and
widespread tax cuts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and key lawmakers said the rosy income
projection from Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander should make it
easier for the Legislature to reach agreements on tax relief and
spending issues before the biennial session ends in 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we can meet the basic priorities of Texas, fully
fund our schools and have a meaningful tax cut,'' Bush said,
defining that as ``a tax cut people can feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be property tax cuts, sales tax cuts and there will
be business tax cuts. I'm in the process of discussing that with
the appropriate people right now,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers negotiating the budget and tax relief bills said they
have a long way to go in deciding how to allot the new sum among
many competing needs. And with the official confirmation that there
is more money available to spend, some discarded proposals were
suddenly back in play _ including suggestions to eliminate taxes on
Internet access and to give businesses a tax credit for research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   Even a sales tax rate cut is being discussed, Bush said. ``This
money makes it easier to do all.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Rylander predicted the state would have $5.6 billion
more available than in the two-year budget cycle for 1998-1999. She
upped the figure to $6.4 billion, giving lawmakers the largest
available surplus in state history, though some of the amount was
earmarked to pay for natural growth of schools and state programs
that serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   With lawmakers bound by the Texas Constitution to pay as they go
_ meaning no deficit spending _ they have anxiously awaited
Rylander's announcement to see how much they could devote to Bush's
tax-relief proposals along with other big-ticket items such as the
teacher pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half our leading economic indicators have turned up,''
Rylander said Thursday. ``The oil industry has not completely
recovered but prices have rebounded. The state's economy will
remain robust, but we may not see the extraordinary growth of the
last two years when the economy expanded at an unusually high
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposed two-year budget of $97 billion is nearly complete and
in the hands of a House-Senate negotiating committee that plans to
issue a final document next week. The negotiators set aside $3
billion. In recent weeks, the House and Senate have approved
tax-relief packages of about $500 million _ a total that could rise
in coming days. But no agreement has been reached on how to
implement the property tax cuts that Bush promised in his 1998
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the property tax cut is ... there is nothing
more difficult to do ... because it's assessed by the local school
board,'' said House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics of how that's going to be done is something we
worked a whole session on (in 1997),'' he said. ``It has not worked
out because we can't control those local school districts from
turning around and raising taxes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties had been saying Bush's goal of $2
billion in tax relief was unattainable, and so far they have not
agreed whether all or some teachers should get a raise. Also in
dispute is whether all or some state employees would get more pay.
Now, all options are being re-evaluated, according to key
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful that this new revenue estimate will help us reach
agreements on the major fiscal issues that remain in this
session,'' said House Speaker Pete Laney.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rene Oliveira,
D-Brownsville, said a top priority will be to arrange a $3,000
annual pay raise for every teacher, which would cost up to $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident the state employees will get a pay raise also,''
Oliveira added, emphasizing that teacher pay is the top objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we will see what's left, if any, for tax cuts,'' he said.
``This certainly gives us an opportunity to look at the governor's
whole tax package. Whether we can accomplish it or not, we don't
know yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who presides over the Senate, said
``the new revenue estimate means we can have record increases in
public school funding, significant teacher pay raises and historic
tax cuts. We can now get to $2 billion in tax cuts this session.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry's political party, the GOP, wants the bulk of the
surplus devoted to tax cuts, its leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional funds ... should go directly toward tax cuts,''
said Republican Party chairman Susan Weddington. ``The people of
Texas recognize the fact that a budget surplus means that state
government has too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   But a nonpartisan group that analyzes state budgets discouraged
that plan. Center for Public Policy Priorities director Dianne
Stewart said ``massive tax cuts ... will drain state coffers,
divert funding from crucial state services, jeopardize the state's
future fiscal soundness and yet hardly be felt by the average
household.''

LEWIS DOCTOR ADMITS SUSPICION OF SERIOUS HEART PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Even though he announced at a press conference six
years ago that Celtics star Reggie Lewis did not have a
life-threatening heart condition, Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr.
acknowledged Thursday that he believed he might.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the first time in the malpractice trial stemming
from Lewis's death, Mudge also acknowledged that he ignored the
advice of a colleague who disagreed with his diagnosis and wanted
more testing.
</P>
<P>
   And he testified that Lewis's heart was electrically monitored
only twice -- for one 23-hour period and one 17-minute period -- in
the 11 weeks prior to his death on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed and died of a heart attack while casually
shooting baskets at Brandeis University. He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor, your contention is that you had not reached a
definitive diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (the benign
fainting disorder that Mudge announced Lewis had),is that
correct?'' asked Robert Harley, who represents Lewis's widow, Donna
Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct,'' said Mudge, who took over Lewis's care
after he left New England Baptist Hospital against medical advice
and transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital in early May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your contention is that you were still considering the
life-threatening arrhythmia, is that correct?'' asked Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were considering the arrhythmia as a potential cause,
yes,'' Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled by Harley, Mudge insisted that he had not said anything
inaccurate at the press conference, ``but what I did say was very
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mudge, ``We had two diagnoses, two potential diagnoses.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, during a televised press conference on May 10, 1993 --
which was replayed for jurors Thursday -- Mudge announced without
hesitation a single, apparently definitive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said that Lewis had nothing more than a ``poorly
understood'' neurological disorder that caused him to faint during
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``After extensive testing, evaluation and review of all data, I
believe that Mr. Lewis has a normal athlete's heart with normal
functions. Our testing showed no evidence of cardiomyopathy or
abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias. ...I am optimistic that
under medical supervision Mr. Reggie Lewis will be able to return
to professional basketball without limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's testimony, which came on the ninth day of a trial
estimated to last four to six weeks, echoed testimony earlier this
week from Dr. Peter L. Friedman, a Brigham cardiologist also named
in the medical malpractice lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During a full day of direct examination Thursday by Harley,
Mudge was alternately passive and feisty.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Harley about a team of four cardiologists in
California who evaluated Lewis to provide a third medical opinion,
Mudge acknowledged that one of the doctors was under consideration
for a job at the Brigham at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That doctor, William Stevenson, who backed Mudge's findings, is
now co-director, with Friedman, of Brigham's electrophysiology
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had been on not only local, but national, television with
your diagnosis,'' noted Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, to ask a doctor who plans to come to your institution that
all that stuff or some of that stuff on television is wrong is
asking a lot, do you agree with me?'' asked Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with you at all,'' said Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Harley suggested that the lure of the limelight had influenced
Mudge's medical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this press conference, you were going to be able to stand
up before Boston and the world and say that all these doctors at
the Baptist were wrong and Reggie Lewis will be able to play
basketball again,'' said Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyers objected to the question and Mudge was not
allowed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that he told Brigham nurses Lewis had to be
monitored if he engaged in ``any form of vigorous physical
exercise,'' but conceded that Lewis's discharge form indicated no
restrictions on his physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that he had not spoken with the Lewises
about an anti-arrhythmia drug on the couple's first day at the
hospital, contradicting a statement he'd given during a deposition
in which he said he'd spoken with them about the drug ``in detail''
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge acknowledged that he did not act on suggestions from Dr.
Roman W. DeSanctis -- who consulted on Lewis's case both during his
hospitalization at the Baptist and at the Brigham -- that
additional tests be performed. DeSanctis, director emeritus of
clinical cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, testified
last week that he had a letter hand-delivered to Mudge outlining
his misgivings about Mudge's diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing with Harley's suggestion that it would have been
desirable to monitor Lewis as much as possible, given that he had
not ruled out a heart condition, Mudge conceded that he
discontinued electrical monitoring of Lewis's heart two days he
left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before court recessed for the day, jurors were shown a
videotape of the May 1993 press conference at which Mudge said
Lewis suffered from neurocardiogenic syncope, a condition that
causes heart rate to fall during physical exertion.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, after Mudge announced his diagnosis, Lewis took the
microphone and said, in part, ``I'm just glad it's finally come to
an end, but with the help of Dr. Mudge, we'll still be taking
things slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched from the seat in the front row, Harris-Lewis
wept. Mudge often averted his eyes from the television monitor as
the tape was played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is not a precise science,'' he said on the videotape.
``In the end, it is a judgment.''

MEG GREENFIELD, WHO SHAPED WASHINGTON POST'S EDITORIAL PAGE, DIES
AT 68 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mass.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial
page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit
to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and
politicians, died Thursday morning at her home in Washington. She
was 68.
</P>
<P>
   She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham.
The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the
last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence
her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on
March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said Thursday, ``When
it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring
against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and
turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly
influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield
provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the
public perception of six presidential administrations and scores of
policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights
to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf War. In 1978,
when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was
awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the
last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25
years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the
passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex
architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone
of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed
the best of her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured
into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at
U.S. News &AMP; World Report. ``She set the tone of debate early,
before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so
many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes
irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about
any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some
moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she
considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   A hands-on manager of both the editorial and Op-Ed pages of The
Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual
talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will,
Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Krauthammer credit
Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and confidants were legion, including Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the
Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a
fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived
near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest
friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive
committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post
and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who
is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as
The Post's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard
work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement Thursday. ``She was both
brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She
will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent
thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of
the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ``Her
mark was her obliqueness,'' Will said. ``Most columnists are
Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance,
indirection. It lasts better.''
</P>
<P>
   Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began
to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980s and
1990s, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues,
from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University
offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her
colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.
</P>
<P>
   She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact
and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's
reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns,
``Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of
Clinton's supporters toward Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy,
retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the
Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the
Constitution,'' she wrote. ``To be rude about it, as they were,
they dismissed him as a bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own
studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or evento a
degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for
what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that
would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd
became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman
statesman, a man beyond reproach _ a living, walking, breathing
toga.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Greenfield _ she derived Meg from her initials _ was
born on Dec. 27, 1930 in Seattle, where her father, Lewis
Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude
from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature,
then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in
England, specializing in William Blake's works.
</P>
<P>
   After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on
journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis
and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in
the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon
and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to
attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote.
``But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a
debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon
apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is
not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him
until they have been pitted against something else _ an extreme
danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack
from some sinister quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in
1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter
shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by
Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The
Washington Post. One of Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post
away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its
departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   As Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a
courtesy call on Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed Cold
Warrior said to his dovish successor: ``My boy, you're making the
mistake of your life. She's on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   A year after she arrived at The Post, Geyelin made Miss
Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even
though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that
saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a
studied distance from it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and
sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited
an Op-Ed article from Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and
policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which
is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's
journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks.
``It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because
people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote
about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the
outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while
ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After
the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron
dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in
the 1970s so she could read more classic works. She was also a
perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary
degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University,
Williams College and Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield
returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the
Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see
her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her
only remaining relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of
her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing
mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ``More Mush
From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a
speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the
street, it was replaced with the headline ``All Must Share the
Burden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ``All
Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ``Just put us in the
presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start
automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with
it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless
acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the
biggest losers of all will be _ are you ready? _ well, of course,
the nation's children.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``When the end of the world finally comes about and
editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the
headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No,
it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so
nicely under the headline ``All Must Share the Burden'' for which
we will, collectively, fry.''

LEELEE SOBIESKI BRINGS TO `JOAN OF ARC' A DIGNITY, QUIET
INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Unifying a country is never easy, especially when the
country is France in the early 15th century. Several decades into
the Hundred Years War, the English control Paris, a good chunk of
France would rather be English, and the heir to the French throne
is afraid to wear the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Into this roiling ratatouille rides Jeanne la Pucelle _ Joan the
Maid _ and out of it CBS ladles a tasty four-hour miniseries that
respects the material and its audience. What luck! Had it been an
NBC production in the manner of the recent ``Noah's Ark at the
Improv,'' Meg Ryan would be starring in something called ``You've
Got Chain Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS hews as close to the revered story of St. Joan as a TV
dramatization allows. And Leelee Sobieski, if not the next Natalie
Portman then certainly the former Helen Hunt (they could be
sisters), brings to Joan a dignity and quiet intensity that may
have millions of American males scouring their garages for
trash-can armor and pledging loyalty to la belle France.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen playing a teen, the 16-year-old Sobieski (``A
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' ``Deep Impact'') is startlingly
appropriate in the role. (Ingrid Bergman was in her 30s when she
played Joan in the 1948 Victor Fleming film; Milla Jovovich,
starring in a Luc Besson theatrical release due this fall, is 23;
Mira Sorvino, linked to another possible ``Joan'' project, is 30.)
None can match the open honesty in Sobieski's unlined, youthful
face. Her Joan is naive and unsure, but at the same time plucky and
brave.
</P>
<P>
   It is an understated performance that will disappoint anyone
looking for a passionate zealot leading men into sword-clanging
battle. But Sobieski's approach, under the guidance of director
Christian Duguay, makes perfect sense. How many men would risk
death behind a ranting 16-year-old girl rushing the battlements?
Instead, Sobieski's calm and clever Joan demonstrates a rational
progression from an uncertain adolescent to a gifted woman who
slowly gains the realization that she's a born leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski gets plenty of help in this two-night epic from two
guys named Peter, neither of them saints. As the not-so-venerable
Bishop Cauchon, Joan's one-time supporter but eventual inquisitor,
the venerable Peter O'Toole is imperious, bombastic and tormented.
As a seasoned army captain named La Hire, miniseries veteran Peter
Strauss is a courageous mercenary leery of taking orders from a
girl who dresses as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Like any high-profile sweeps-month project, ``Joan of Arc'' has
enough celebrities to screw in a light bulb on the overtaxed
marquee. Powers Boothe and Jacqueline Bisset blandly play Joan's
peasant parents _ with remarkably good teeth _ in the colorless
village of Domremy. Robert Loggia nods compassionately as a country
priest in shaved-dome tonsure. Shirley MacLaine is an extraneous
Burgundian noblewoman bidding Joan to fight for the other side. And
Olympia Dukakis gamely keeps Joan company as a kind nun drawn to
the maid's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Each role could have gone to lesser-known players, but the
loading up on big names isn't the distraction it might have been.
Even Neil Patrick Harris, as Joan's duplicitous benefactor, Charles
VII, is amusing and slippery, even if one can't help but think of
him as King Doogie, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful scenery (courtesy of the Czech Republic), beautiful
photography (by Pierre Gill) and beautiful costuming (by John Hay)
complement the appealing lushness of ``Joan of Arc.'' One could
quibble with the film's confusing presentation of historical
material. And, since everyone is speaking theatrical English, it's
sometimes hard to tell the good Frenchmen from the bad Frenchmen,
let alone the Englishmen. Still, Sobieski's portrayal of a simple
farm girl who hears the voices of the saints makes this ``Joan'' a
graceful survey of devotion and deceit, inspiration and intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The film, airing Sunday and Tuesday nights, is violent in
places, but Joan's many battles in the cause of awakening a French
national conscience are condensed to a handful of scenes.
Blood-spilling is minimal, and even Joan's unhappy demise at the
hands of the British is not a tasteless special-effects pyro-orgy,
proving that sad tales aren't bad tales when they're told this
well.
</P>
<P>
   Joan of Arc. Four-hour miniseries about the teenager who helped
unite France in the 15th century. Starring Leelee Sobieski, Peter
O'Toole, Neil Patrick Harris and Peter Strauss. Sunday and Tuesday

 &HT;    Texas regents approve $90M in new projects
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas officials got the go-ahead
Thursday to pursue a hotel/conference center and won approval for
nearly $90 million in building projects, including its first
dormitory in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   UT System regents, meeting at UT-Pan American in Edinburg, also
agreed to let UT-Austin increase room charges for students living
at Jester Center by $100 a year. The increase will cover $6 million
in fire and safety improvements, also approved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin campus is in the midst of a building boom, with these
new projects coming on top of $167 million in construction already
under way. The previously approved projects include a track and
soccer stadium; academic buildings; and a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, these projects do not involve state-appropriated
money,'' said Charles Franklin, UT's vice president for business
affairs. ``They are primarily financed with revenue bonds that will
be paid back by the users,'' those who park in the garage, live in
a dorm or use a particular building.
</P>
<P>
   Donations also help finance various projects, Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   UT President Larry Faulkner asked the Board of Regents to
endorse the hotel/conference center to bring more people to campus
and provide accommodations to executives and others who attend UT's
short courses or professional development classes.
</P>
<P>
   With the board's blessing, UT will commission a study to see
whether the project is attractive to investors. If the feedback is
favorable, UT will seek bids, possibly in the fall, for a private
company to build and operate the 250-room hotel and conference
center, said UT Vice President Patricia Ohlendorf. The facility
would be on the Thompson Conference Center parking lot at Dean
Keeton and Red River streets.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder would build a garage to replace the parking
lot and would assume all costs associated with the project. The
contractor would get all of the profits but would pay UT for a
long-term lease.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, UT considered remodeling the campus-area Villa
Capri motel, but ``it would have cost more to renovate than it
would to build a whole new facility and you still wouldn't have
what you wanted,'' said Tom Hatfield, director of the Thompson
center and dean of continuing education and extension. UT bought
the land, tore down the Villa Capri and installed athletic practice
fields instead.
</P>
<P>
   If UT solicits bids for the new project, it probably would be
another two years before it would open, Ohlendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   The new projects are:
</P>
<P>
   _ $52.4 million for a dormitory that would add 850 badly needed
beds to the 5,300 beds on campus. About half of the beds are
expected to be ready when the dorm is scheduled to open, by fall
2000, said Sheila Ochner, associate director of the Division of
Housing and Food Service. A committee of the Texas High Education
Coordinating Board is expected to give final approval to the dorm
today.
</P>
<P>
   _ $21.6 million for a parking garage and office building near
the intersection of 27th Street and Speedway. The office building
would sit between two parking garages _ one of which already is
under construction.
</P>
<P>
   _ $6 million in fire safety improvements at the 30-year-old
Jester Center dorm. The cost of a standard double room, which is
$2,243 this year, will rise to $2,521 next fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ $3.1 million to expand laboratory space at the Pickle Research
Campus, 10000 Burnet Road.
</P>
<P>
   _ $6 million for scientific and computational engineering
equipment at a main campus building being expanded by Dallas donor
Peter O'Donnell.

 &HT;    Logan's run: New label, big changes
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Never accuse the music business of anything
approaching logic. Jack Logan won't, and he's a happier man for it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Winder-based songwriter seemed poised to move
to the next level in his unusual career. Though virtually unknown
outside Athens _ where he was part of a laid-back local scene that
included inspired, offbeat personalities such as Vic Chesnutt and
various indefatigable garage-rock bands _ Logan had built a strong
critical reputation with two solo albums. ``Bulk'' (1994) and
``Mood Elevator'' (1996) were stuffed with shambling, lo-fi
vignettes and skewed character studies, recorded on the cheap and
released by the independent Restless label. The songs had the feel
of short, Southern Gothic fictions, pumped up by musicians who came
of age chugging beers to the Rolling Stones and Neil Young.
</P>
<P>
   Because Logan also was a mechanic who had penned some 600 tunes
years before releasing any of them, he also made great copy.
Unfortunately, by the time he finished recording his third album in
1997, his label had lost interest. And ``Buzz Me In,''
paradoxically Logan's effort to make a slicker recording, sat in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a mess of changes,'' says Logan, 40, who can finally
celebrate Saturday with a show at Smith's Olde Bar. Atlanta-based
Capricorn Records, which recently signed Logan to a two-album deal,
releases ``Buzz Me In'' on Tuesday, making it the prolific
songwriter's third album in a year. (Ill content to sit around
waiting for someone to notice him, Logan completed ``Little Private
Angel,'' a collaboration with songwriter pal Bob Kimball, and
``Tinker,'' on his home-grown Backburner label.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have told me it would have worked out like this
two years ago, I would have felt a lot better about the whole
thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's period of transition included his departure from
Doraville Electric Motor Service and the dissolution of his backing
band, the Liquor Cabinet. His brief promotional tour will feature
Kimball and members of the Athens (Ga.) rock band the
Possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll always be guitars and beating on boxes for me,'' says
Logan, who nonetheless presents a more polished version of himself
on ``Buzz Me In.'' Produced by former Clash associate Kosmo Vinyl
at Clay Harper's Casino Studios in Little Five Points, the album
flaunts a surprising palette of instrumental hues. ``It's
Technicolor as opposed to painted cels,'' says Logan, who is also a
gifted cartoonist. ``Clay knew everybody in town, so if you needed
a sitar, he'd run to an Indian restaurant and bring back some guy
with a sitar.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta guitarist Jeff Calder, who visited some of the sessions,
recalls: ``The way Kosmo and (engineer) Phil Hadaway went about it
was in contrast to Jack's more insouciant nature. I remember Jack
was a smoker, and I think they got him to stop. They wanted to get
good vocals on Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan admits that all the knob-twiddling made him nervous, but
he enjoyed the opportunity to break from his home-recording
aesthetic. ``If you have a chance to step up and do something a
little more exotic, you need to gather yourself up and go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   If the focused production trades off some immediacy, it also
emphasizes the casual soulfulness of Logan's voice and helps to
buoy a jukebox classic or two. The mellowed-out, honky-tonk lament
``Melancholy Girl'' is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the strings, the vibes, the bongos. Logan is no
sonic visionary. He just likes to play guitar with his friends and
tell these odd, and oddly touching, little stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those guys trying to capture the sound in his
head. That's not my deal. I ain't Brian Wilson,'' he says. ``That's
one of those statements they come up with halfway into those VH1
specials, right before the guy overdoses on heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Logan
</P>
<P>
   With Beth Wood and the Possibilities. 8 p.m. Saturday. $8
advance; $10 at the door. Smith's Olde Bar, 1580 Piedmont Ave. N.E.

GERMAN GREENS BACK `LIMITED HALT' IN KOSOVO AIRSTRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIELEFELD, Germany _ In a clear sign of the strains placed on
Germany's government by the Kosovo conflict, the environmentalist
Green party Thursday broke ranks with its coalition partners and
other Western governments by calling for a ``limited halt'' to the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, in a stormy and bitterly divisive one-day party
congress, rejected a motion calling for an immediate and
unconditional termination of the NATO bombing. That measure would
probably have brought down the government of the Social Democratic
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, which was built on a fragile
alliance with the Green party.
</P>
<P>
   But the motion that was adopted by 444 votes to 318 still marked
the growing unease of the once pacifist Green party with the NATO
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to strengthen the chances of diplomacy,'' it said,
``NATO should declare a limited halt to the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, a breach in the unity that NATO has been at pains to
preserve, illustrated how the airstrikes are putting growing
pressure on some European governments. Just how long the policy of
bombing Yugoslavia until NATO's demands are met can continue
without precipitating a full political crisis in Germany is now
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer appeared relieved at the
outcome, embracing fellow Green party ministers. Earlier Thursday,
he had come close to putting his job _ and the government's future
_ on the line by saying that the motion rejecting NATO policies
outright, which ultimately was defeated, would have made his
position as minister untenable.
</P>
<P>
   His day was tumultuous, beginning in the worst way when a
protester hurled a bag of red paint at his face from point-blank
range. As Foreign Ministry security guards wrestled the assailant
to the floor, Fischer stood stunned on the podium, his right cheek
and gray jacket covered in paint.
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders, also sprayed in red, held their heads in their
hands, dismayed that the congress of a party still viscerally
opposed to force had descended so quickly into violence.
</P>
<P>
   The grim ministry security guards wearing suits and standing
next to the casually dressed delegates seemed to sum up the party's
uneasy adaptation to the responsibilities of power.
</P>
<P>
   As Fischer moved to the microphone to speak about half-an-hour
later, chants of ``Warmonger! Warmonger! Warmonger!'' rose from the
crowd. Referring to the Yugoslav president, Fischer shot back,
``Yes, I'm a warmonger, and I suppose Slobodan Milosevic should be
awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to make an impassioned speech, recounting his
unstinting efforts to find a settlement before the bombing began,
asking how the party could oppose neo-Nazism in Germany while
turning a blind eye to fascism elsewhere in Europe, listing the
more than 70 U.N. resolutions that have failed to bring peace to
the Balkans, and placing blame for the violence squarely with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead with you to help me and give me your support _ and not
cut me off at the knees _ so I can emerge from this congress
strengthened and can continue our policy!'' Fischer shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a thinly veiled threat to resign if the motion calling
for an immediate and final end to the bombing passed, he said, ``If
we send the wrong signal to Milosevic today, I will not be able to
carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Fischer was taken to a hospital to have his
right ear examined, apparently because it was filled with paint.
But he returned in time to see the motion that averted an immediate
government crisis pass with a 58 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a vociferous and large minority revealed how deep the
party's divisions have grown by voting in favor of a proposal put
forward by a leading Green party member, Christian Strobele, that
called for ``an immediate end to the NATO bombing that alone would
make negotiations possible.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an speech almost as impassioned as that of the foreign
minister, Strobele argued that the NATO campaign had been a
disaster. ``We have achieved the opposite of our avowed aim, which
is the protection of human rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, born in the late 1970s as a pacifist movement that
rejected the stifling rigidity of the immediate postwar generation,
have suffered the extraordinary fate of finding themselves in
government for the first time and then, just a few months later,
backing Germany's return to war as part of the NATO forces bombing
Yugoslavia today.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear Thursday that this series of events has torn the
party's always fragile unity to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted suddenly by two opposing but strongly espoused
principles _ ``Never again war'' and ``Never again Auschwitz'' _ it
has narrowly chosen to support the use of military force in the
face of what many of its members see as policies of ethnic,
religious and racial persecution in Yugoslavia that recall the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In his defeated motion, Strobele warned against such parallels.
``We are against drawing comparisons between the murderous
Milosevic regime and the Holocaust,'' he said. ``Doing so would
mean an unacceptable diminishment of the horror of Nazi fascism and
the genocide against European Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ludger Volmer, a deputy foreign minister and ally of
Fischer, drew rousing applause as he described Milosevic's planning
and execution of a policy of destruction of the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo and declared, ``My friends, there is only word
for this, and that word is fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements, and a clear desire to preserve the life of the
country's first ``Red-Green'' coalition, ultimately carried the
day. But the message to Schroeder was unmistakable: a resolution of
the conflict must be urgently found if the coalition is not to risk
irreparable damage.
</P>
<P>
   The motion passed did not say how long the ``limited halt'' to
the NATO bombing should last, but said it should enable Milosevic
to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. If this happened, and the
expulsion of ethnic Albanians stopped, then ``the cease-fire could
be extended.''
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals for what would amount to a unilateral pause in
the NATO bombing marked a clear break from the German government's
peace plan advanced last month and an even clearer break from the
position of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer proposed on April 14 that if Yugoslavia began a troop
withdrawal, NATO should suspend airstrikes for 24 hours. But the
Clinton administration did not endorse the idea and has insisted
that five conditions _ including a withdrawal of Yugoslav forces
and acceptance of the deployment an international NATO-dominated
force in Kosovo _ be fully met by Milosevic before there is any
stop to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a highly emotional day, several Green delegates
appeared shattered by the outcome, betrayed by the party's
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens are nothing if they are not a party of peace,''
said Bertram Schneeweiss, a 34-year-old doctor from Bavaria.
``NATO's actions have only made things worse, and Fischer has not
represented the party from which he came.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a student leader known for his anti-war
activities in 1968 and now a Green Party member close to Fischer,
said: ``We have to be coherent. We cannot say we are still against
war and remain in this government.''

<P>
   During the Israeli election campaign now nearing decision time,
the leader who showed the most political daring and skill, vastly
outclassed his opponents in collecting international support and
gave his followers his clear vision of the Israel-Palestine future
has been Yasser Arafat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly he has told Palestinians that whoever is elected
Israel's prime minister and whatever ``final settlement'' may be
signed between Israelis and Palestinians, not to worry _ it will
not be final at all, and neither is Oslo or any other agreement
that helped create the Palestinian state. He outlined a new
strategy in the old Palestinian plan for dealing with Israel by
slicing at its territory and strength, phase by phase.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top two Israelis running for prime minister did almost
nothing to raise an alert to their country. They had a terrific
excuse _ alerts might hurt their campaigns.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's renewed message to Palestinians is that their goal
remains to push Israel back at least to the land the Jews held
before Israel became a state. Israel would be amputated to
indefensibility with the loss of at least three cities, militarily
critical roads, water supplies, chunks of the Galilee and the Negev
desert the Jews so enriched, and without legal control of any part
of Jerusalem.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is an unconcealed variation of the 1974 Palestinian phase
plan _ reduce Israel to impotence by a succession of interlocked
diplomatic and military stages so that one day the final settlement
could be Israel's defeat or desiccation of its national will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arafat path to that end is now the 1947 partition resolution
(No. 181) of the U.N. General Assembly. It was rejected by the
Arabs, who began the half-century war against Israel. They lost
territory to Israelis that the Jews claimed but were willing to
give up then, to create Israel. Now Arafat wants it all back. That
would suffocate Israel's security viability _ as a starting point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arafat got a formal statement from the entire European Union
that no part of Jerusalem was legally under Israeli control. The
U.N. Human Rights Commission, as it is called, went further: All
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations must be based on the lethal 181.
</P>
<P>
   From the U.S. came no rebuke of Arafat for returning to 1947.
Why should Washington take him on when the incumbent prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, and Ehud Barak of Labor did
nothing to denounce the new Arafat line except say a few private
words to foreign diplomats that they really did not agree with his
logic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the Israeli and American press matched them in
aloofness. I get my documentation mostly by phone and fax _ from
furious Israeli insiders, and monitoring organizations like the
Middle East Media and Research Institute, which is hugely valuable
for translations of Arab-language material (www.memri.org).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I asked Labor people close to Barak: Was he silent because he
did not want to remind Israelis that Labor had promised that a
recognized Palestine would abandon any more claims to Israeli land?
Good thinking, I was told. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I asked Likud people close to Netanyahu: Was he so silent
because his campaign was fouled up by focus on political
personalities, where he is not a dream boy, instead of the survival
issues where he is strong in public acceptance? Good thinking, I
was told.
</P>
<P>
   What is Arafat up to? He certainly does not think Barak or
Netanyahu would sacrifice Israel to the dead 1947 partition plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is up to convincing Palestinians that in the end all will be
theirs. He knows Israel is strong enough militarily to fend off
another Arab attack. But it is reasonable for him to hope that one
day that will change _ say when Iraqi and Iranian nuclear weapons
power coincide with a hostile U.S. presidency.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the United Nations may decide that the Arab League is a
regional defense group just like NATO, which attacked before being
attacked.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most important duty for Netanyahu and Barak before and after
the election outcome is to inform Arafat, publicly, that unless he
immediately renounces his dangerous switch from Oslo to 181, Israel
will no longer honor the concessions it made to create the
Palestine over which he now presides. He will keep dreaming, but
not for a while.

CHINESE NUCLEAR WARHEAD USES STOLEN U.S. TECHNOLOGY, INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, China is close to deploying a
nuclear missile with a warhead whose design draws on stolen
American secrets, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   A long-range Chinese missile that has already been
flight-tested, known as the Dong Feng-31, is being equipped with a
small nuclear warhead whose design uses secret U.S. technology. The
technology is believed to have been stolen from a government
weapons laboratory, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. The
missile is expected to be deployed within three or four years,
according to the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Since the furor over Chinese atomic espionage began, the Clinton
administration has argued that there is no evidence that Beijing
has actually applied stolen American secrets to modernize its
nuclear forces. U.S. officials believe, for example, that China
stole design information from America's most advanced warhead, the
W-88, between 1984-1988. Yet they stress that while China has
tested a warhead with a similar design, it has not actually
produced such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with the warhead soon to be deployed on
China's DF-31 inter-continental ballistic missile, U.S. officials
believe. They say that this stolen U.S. warhead technology will
help China achieve its goal of building a modern nuclear arsenal
that relies on mobility to survive attacks. The DF-31 will be a
truck-based mobile missile that can be moved and thus will be hard
to detect and destroy.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear arsenal today is still much smaller and less
technically advanced than that of the United States. Yet the DF-31
and its new warhead represent a step forward in China's efforts to
present a more formidable nuclear presence. It also means that
China may soon be using stolen U.S. nuclear secrets on weapons
capable of hitting a wide range of countries, including those in
Europe, Asia and even the western United States. U.S. intelligence
estimates say that the DF-31 will have a range of approximately
5,000 miles. It is expected to be ready for deployment as soon as
2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DF-31 ICBM will give China a major strike capability that
will be difficult to counter-attack at any stage of its
operation,'' a 1996 Air Force intelligence report on the DF-31
stated. ``It will be a significant threat not only to U.S. forces
deployed in the Pacific theater, but to portions of the continental
United States and to many of our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that the new Chinese weapon will use
design technology from the American W-70 warhead, a small bomb
designed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   China stole secret design information about the W-70 from
Lawrence Livermore in the late 1970s or early 1980s, government
investigators believe. A scientist was fired from Lawrence
Livermore in 1981 in connection with the investigation into the
suspected theft, but no one has ever been arrested in the case. The
scientist has never been publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that China has used design
information from the ``primary'' of the W-70 to help develop the
advanced warhead that will be used on the DF-31 missile. The
``primary'' of a modern nuclear weapon is a small atomic bomb that
serves to ignite the ``secondary,'' a larger hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The W-70 warhead is also known as the neutron bomb, a weapon
that kills people with enhanced radiation while leaving buildings
intact. But its ``primary'' can be used in other, conventional
nuclear weapons as well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have based their belief of Chinese reliance on
U.S. design secrets for the new warhead in part by analyzing
Chinese nuclear tests in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Officials
believe those successful tests were of a small warhead that is
slated for use on the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have also based their estimates on
analysis of the range and payload capabilities of the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   Because this analysis is based partly on inferences, there is
still a debate within the U.S. intelligence community over which
U.S. nuclear secrets the Chinese are using. There is also
disagreement over the extent to which the DF-31's warhead will rely
on American technology, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a debate over how much design information of ours
they are using,'' said one official. ``This is a very sophisticated
piece of equipment, that was difficult for us to develop, so we
think it would be hard for them to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate, the broad conclusion that the DF-31 will
come equipped with a warhead that uses stolen U.S. technology is
included in two new secret government reports, officials said. Part
of one report from a select House committee is soon to be made
public. The other report is the result of a government-wide
intelligence assessment of the damage done to U.S. national
security by Chinese atomic espionage, according to officials. That
government-wide assessment, however, acknowledges the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified summary of the government-wide intelligence
assessment released last month stated that ``it is more likely that
the Chinese used U.S. design information to inform their own
program than to replicate U.S. weapons designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report does not name the specific warhead
design suspected of being stolen by China.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied allegations that it has stolen U.S. nuclear
secrets, and insists that its weapons are based on its own research
and development program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American intelligence community has suspected that China
stole W-70 design information from Lawrence Livermore since the
early 1980s, according to officials. The FBI investigation,
code-named Tiger Trap, never led to any arrests. But officials said
that the scientist who was fired as a result of the investigation
made a series of trips to China after he left the laboratory in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea that the stolen W-70 design technology was being
applied by China for use in its new generation of small warheads
for the DF-31 was a subject of intense controversy within American
intelligence agencies until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that it was not until last month's
government-wide damage assessment report on Chinese nuclear
espionage that many intelligence analysts began to connect the
theft of design secrets with the evidence gathered on the DF-31 and
the ongoing modernization of China's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The DF-31, a solid-fuel missile, would be the first Chinese
inter-continental ballistic missile that would be moved on roads.
China test-fired its rocket motor last July, and the missile was
scheduled to be flight tested last December, The Washington Times
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the missile has apparently been slower than
that of its warhead, officials believe. China conducted six or
seven tests of the two-stage warhead the United States expects to
be deployed on the DF-31, and completed that testing in the early
1990s. U.S. officials now believe the DF-31 will carry only one
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Once the DF-31 and other advanced missiles are deployed, China
is expected to begin to phase out its older and less accurate
ballistic missiles that carry large, bulky warheads. ``The DF-31
ICBM will give China a major strike capability that will be
difficult to counterattack at any stage of its operation, from
pre-flight mobile operations through the terminal flight phase,''
the 1996 Air Force intelligence report predicted. The ``road
mobility'' of the DF-31, the report adds, ``will greatly improve
Chinese nuclear ballistic missile survivability and will complicate
the task of defeating the Chinese threat.''

VICTIMS IN BOMBING OF CHINESE EMBASSY HONORED IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an elaborate ceremony at the Great Hall of the
People, China's leaders bestowed the title of ``revolutionary
martyr'' Thursday on the three Chinese journalists killed by NATO's
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony conferring one of the Communist Party's highest
honors on the dead appeared intended to bring an emotional close to
the anti-American activity that took over Beijing in recent days, a
rare dovetailing of public sentiment and official purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing is widely seen here as a deliberate attack and not
the mistake that NATO maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Student-led demonstrations coordinated by the government have
now stopped. And street traffic returned to normal Thursday in the
diplomatic quarter, which was besieged by raucous rock-throwing
demonstrators after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if China's leaders want to cool mass displays of
emotion, President Jiang Zemin warned at Thursday's ceremony that
China would not consider the matter closed until the United States
and NATO make a full accounting of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise the Chinese people will never let the matter go,''
Jiang said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   On state television's evening news, Jiang and five of China's
most senior leaders were shown going from one hospital room to
another to visit some of the Chinese citizens who were injured in
the bombing and returned to Beijing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all heroes,'' Jiang said to one of the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of what is likely to be many state-sponsored
commemorations of the journalists, The Guangming Daily Press said
it would publish a book next week honoring Xu Xinghu and his wife,
Zhu Ying.
</P>
<P>
   The swell of anti-American and nationalist sentiment is likely
to have far-reaching if not entirely predictable consequences on
China's political, economic and social environment in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Zhu Bangzao, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
said Thursday that the atmosphere of negotiations over China's
entry into the World Trade Organization would inevitably be
affected by the changed political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhu reiterated Beijing's wish to seek entry to the
trade group by the end of the year, his remarks reflect a consensus
here that the intensely strained political mood will further
stiffen the negotiating position of Chinese officials.

LEELEE SOBIESKI BRINGS TO `JOAN OF ARC' A DIGNITY, QUIET
INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Unifying a country is never easy, especially when the
country is France in the early 15th century. Several decades into
the Hundred Years War, the English control Paris, a good chunk of
France would rather be English, and the heir to the French throne
is afraid to wear the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Into this roiling ratatouille rides Jeanne la Pucelle _ Joan the
Maid _ and out of it CBS ladles a tasty four-hour miniseries that
respects the material and its audience. What luck! Had it been an
NBC production in the manner of the recent ``Noah's Ark at the
Improv,'' Meg Ryan would be starring in something called ``You've
Got Chain Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS hews as close to the revered story of St. Joan as a TV
dramatization allows. And Leelee Sobieski, if not the next Natalie
Portman then certainly the former Helen Hunt (they could be
sisters), brings to Joan a dignity and quiet intensity that may
have millions of American males scouring their garages for
trash-can armor and pledging loyalty to la belle France.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen playing a teen, the 16-year-old Sobieski (``A
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' ``Deep Impact'') is startlingly
appropriate in the role. (Ingrid Bergman was in her 30s when she
played Joan in the 1948 Victor Fleming film; Milla Jovovich,
starring in a Luc Besson theatrical release due this fall, is 23;
Mira Sorvino, linked to another possible ``Joan'' project, is 30.)
None can match the open honesty in Sobieski's unlined, youthful
face. Her Joan is naive and unsure, but at the same time plucky and
brave.
</P>
<P>
   It is an understated performance that will disappoint anyone
looking for a passionate zealot leading men into sword-clanging
battle. But Sobieski's approach, under the guidance of director
Christian Duguay, makes perfect sense. How many men would risk
death behind a ranting 16-year-old girl rushing the battlements?
Instead, Sobieski's calm and clever Joan demonstrates a rational
progression from an uncertain adolescent to a gifted woman who
slowly gains the realization that she's a born leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski gets plenty of help in this two-night epic from two
guys named Peter, neither of them saints. As the not-so-venerable
Bishop Cauchon, Joan's one-time supporter but eventual inquisitor,
the venerable Peter O'Toole is imperious, bombastic and tormented.
As a seasoned army captain named La Hire, miniseries veteran Peter
Strauss is a courageous mercenary leery of taking orders from a
girl who dresses as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Like any high-profile sweeps-month project, ``Joan of Arc'' has
enough celebrities to screw in a light bulb on the overtaxed
marquee. Powers Boothe and Jacqueline Bisset blandly play Joan's
peasant parents _ with remarkably good teeth _ in the colorless
village of Domremy. Robert Loggia nods compassionately as a country
priest in shaved-dome tonsure. Shirley MacLaine is an extraneous
Burgundian noblewoman bidding Joan to fight for the other side. And
Olympia Dukakis gamely keeps Joan company as a kind nun drawn to
the maid's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Each role could have gone to lesser-known players, but the
loading up on big names isn't the distraction it might have been.
Even Neil Patrick Harris, as Joan's duplicitous benefactor, Charles
VII, is amusing and slippery, even if one can't help but think of
him as King Doogie, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful scenery (courtesy of the Czech Republic), beautiful
photography (by Pierre Gill) and beautiful costuming (by John Hay)
complement the appealing lushness of ``Joan of Arc.'' One could
quibble with the film's confusing presentation of historical
material. And, since everyone is speaking theatrical English, it's
sometimes hard to tell the good Frenchmen from the bad Frenchmen,
let alone the Englishmen. Still, Sobieski's portrayal of a simple
farm girl who hears the voices of the saints makes this ``Joan'' a
graceful survey of devotion and deceit, inspiration and intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The film, airing Sunday and Tuesday nights, is violent in
places, but Joan's many battles in the cause of awakening a French
national conscience are condensed to a handful of scenes.
Blood-spilling is minimal, and even Joan's unhappy demise at the
hands of the British is not a tasteless special-effects pyro-orgy,
proving that sad tales aren't bad tales when they're told this
well.
</P>
<P>
   Joan of Arc. Four-hour miniseries about the teenager who helped
unite France in the 15th century. Starring Leelee Sobieski, Peter
O'Toole, Neil Patrick Harris and Peter Strauss. Sunday and Tuesday
on CBS. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

A MELLOWER JOHN MELLENCAMP MUSES ABOUT MUSIC TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ John Mellencamp, the feisty Indiana rocker who gave us
hits like ``Hurts So Bad,'' ``Pink Houses'' and ``Jack and Diane,''
knows rock 'n' roll isn't the cultural force it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to realize that what a lot of us grew up
listening to is just another music form today,'' Mellencamp, 47,
said recently in a phone interview from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to look at the situation today in the same way
that Frank Sinatra looked at things when Elvis Presley and the
Beatles showed up. It's like, `Hey, who are these guys? We kind of
had it our own way for a while. Why are they messin' up our gig?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it isn't rock that dominates the record charts, but
hip-hop, R&AMP;B, Latin and mainstream pop. (Mellencamp recently
authorized rewrites of his 1981 hit, ``Jack and Diane,'' by rappers
Jay-Z and Puff Daddy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you listen to the radio, it'll tell you that,''
Mellencamp said. ``And when you turn on MTV, it'll tell you that
rock music is not the most important music anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As he nears 50, Mellencamp has mixed feelings about rock's
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened by it in one sense and encouraged in another,''
he said. ``It's sad when the soundtrack of your life starts to fade
into the background. But people my age don't need music to tell us
who we are _ or to express our feelings for us. We're capable of
doing that on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who began his recording career in the '70s as Johnny
Cougar, realized that popular music was changing when he saw rapper
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the cover of Time magazine a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like the Rolling Stones,'' Mellencamp said. ``It was
the same kind of rebellion for a new generation that the Rolling
Stones were for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp is on tour right now, with a stop in Washington
state's The Gorge on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp's new album, ``John Mellencamp,'' is one of the most
reflective of his career. It's filled with songs of struggle and
growth, such as ``Your Life Is Now,'' written with longtime
collaborator George Green, and ``I'm Not Running Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who suffered a heart attack in 1994 at age 42,
describes ``Your Life Is Now'' as ``a kind of Post-It note'' to
Green about living for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 30s, I was too busy worrying about what was going to
happen next to enjoy the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the early '90s, I was getting terribly bitter about my job
and my career.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been doing it for 20 years, and for 15 years I'd been on the
road every day, day in and day out. I just got tired of it. I only
did it because I had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I decided that I was really wasting an opportunity
and that I needed to refocus my life. My wife had a lot to do with
changing my outlook. It was like when somebody looks at you and
they say, `You know, you're an idiot for thinking like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Not Running Anymore'' is an upbeat song about fatherhood
and faded youth. One of the verses is about Mellencamp's sons _
Hud, 6, and Speck, 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them acting like Johnny Cougar _ always in a hurry,
spittin' and cussin' _ I tell them, `Hey, guys, slow down a little
bit. We don't have to do it this way.' And that's how that verse
came about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who is now with Columbia Records after 20 years with
Mercury Records, recorded his new album with his longtime band.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a vast wealth of experience,'' Mellencamp said. ``So
before we started making the record, I said, `Look, we've been
doing this for a long time. Let's pool all our knowledge and all
our experience and all our musical ability.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp also encouraged them to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Music has changed quite a bit, so it doesn't
matter what kind of record we make. It's probably not going to be
on the radio like our records used to be. It's probably not going
to sell like our records used to. So really all we have to do is
entertain ourselves and make a record that people are going to
love.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, who still lives in his hometown of Belmont, Ind.,
named his current ``Rural Electrification Tour'' after a U.S.
government program in the 1930s that brought electricity to rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to this journalist friend of mine and we were
talking about what a concert is supposed to do for people. And he
said that it should give them power over the evening, power over
their day-to-day lives,'' Mellencamp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what rural electrification did during the Depression.
It gave people in the country power over the evening. And I mean
power in terms of light and music and eventually television. It
gave them a way to communicate with the cities and it gave them the
music of Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams.''

AU PAIR'S PARENTS REPORTEDLY ARRESTED IN FUNDS FRAUD PROBE

<P>
   LONDON _ The parents of Louise Woodward were allegedly arrested
last week by British investigators who believe they fraudently
drained their daughter's defense fund of as much as $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money was donated by worldwide sympathizers of the British
au pair convicted of killing a baby in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Cheshire, England released a statement Thursday
confirming two people were arrested May 4 in connection with
allegations that the suspects misused the money in the Louise
Woodward Family Trust. The pair were brought to the police station,
where they were told to return July 1, when prosecutors will meet
with them.
</P>
<P>
   A source in Woodward's hometown of Elton, who is familiar with
the case, said Thursday that Woodward's mother Susan was one of
those arrested. At the same time, leading British news sources,
including the British Broadcasting Corp., identified Woodward's
father, Gary, as also having been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through her lawyer Thursday, Susan
Woodward denied any misdeeds. Her husband could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards, familiar faces to those who followed their
daughter's sensational trial, separated following Louise Woodward's
Oct. 30, 1997 conviction for killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen of
Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Sky News reported that the police are looking into
allegations that approximately $283,000 was transferred out of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, including the FBI, who have been following a
trail of paper evidence in this country and abroad, refused to
identify the two people arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, police said, were released on what the British call
``police bail'' pending a decision by crown prosecutors on whether
to formally file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former family friend Elaine Whitfield Sharp, a lawyer who hosted
Susan Woodward at Sharp's Marblehead, Mass. home during Louise
Woodward's legal troubles, said Thursday she felt sorry, but not
surprised, by the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad that it's come to this,'' said Sharp, a one-time
ally of the Woodwards who severed any allegiance to them when she
alleged last year that Susan Woodward had forged Sharp's signature
on a $15,000 invoice drawn on the fund. Susan Woodward alleged that
Sharp charged her rent during Louise Woodward's sensational trial
near Boston in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a personal vindication,'' said Sharp, speaking
at a press conference Thursday. ``I never charged them a penny, and
I never lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was an intentional draining of the fund,'' said
Sharp, recalling that she grew suspicious when Woodward's parents
made public appeals for more money, when there was enough to
finance a new trial available.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said she believed the money was taken from the account so
the Matthew Eappen family would not be able to collect any funds in
a wrongful death lawsuit against Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' attorney declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the statement from Susan Woodward's attorney accused
Sharp of making false allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Woodward took the opportunity to give the police her
side of the story and an insight into the motives of Elaine
Whitfield-Sharp in making false allegations against her and her
family,'' the statement read..
</P>
<P>
   Sharp had fallen from favor of the Woodwards in May of 1998,
when she was arrested for drunk driving, and allegedly told a
Massachusetts state trooper she was suffering, and drinking,
because she had to live with the knowledge that the young au pair
was guilty. Sharp denies making the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The defense funds were allegedly solicited to pay for a second
trial to clear the teenager's name.
</P>
<P>
   EF AuPair, the agency which recruited Woodward, paid the costs
of the initial trial, including the high-profile defense team of
Harvey Silverglate, Barry Scheck and Andrew Good.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court jury convicted the au pair in
the second-degree murder of Matthew Eappen, who died of a fractured
skull in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, now 21 and studying law, was alone with the boy when
he was rushed to the hospital, his brain bleeding. A jury listened
to 17 days of testimony and convicted her of second-degree murder,
but Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the verdict to involuntary
manslaughter and set Woodward free on time served -- 279 days.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision was upheld by the state Supreme Judicial
Court.

RUSSIAN LEGISLATORS ASSAIL YELTSIN, WHO REMAINS SILENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia's political and economic fates in suspended
animation after the sacking of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the
Communist-led parliament began a surreal and mostly ritual struggle
Thursday over whether to impeach President Boris Yeltsin for
treason, genocide and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of largely legalistic speeches, Yeltsin's opponents
charged that he ``plunged the Russian people into the deep chasm of
suffering and unfortunate decisions'' in eight years as president,
leaving a trail of ``blood and tears _ the blood of the killed and
maimed; the tears of the dying, the deprived and the humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders said they were certain to obtain the required
300 votes in the 450-member lower house to pass at least one of the
five impeachment counts, a judgment some others disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Yeltsin's emissaries were said to be lobbying
furiously, dangling job offers and other inducements before
undecided legislators. Their goal was more to win a political
victory than a legal one; for an array of reasons, this impeachment
is unlikely to lead to Yeltsin's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the parliament, meanwhile, the very real struggle over
Russia's future set off by Primakov's firing began to take on a
clearer form.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after he replaced Primakov, a Communist favorite,
with his loyal interior minister, Sergei Stepashin, Yeltsin made no
public appearance or comment. Stepashin scheduled a meeting with
parliament's leaders and said he had no specific candidates in mind
for positions in his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But others began to sketch the outline of a new government in
which so-called radical reformers _ the men who charted the
free-market policies that ended with last August's economic
collapse _ might again play a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the speculation focused on the crucial post of first
deputy prime minister for economics and finance, which has been
occupied under Primakov by a Communist, Yuri Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
   Among the names being floated for the job are Boris Fyodorov,
who was pushed out of the government last year after his Federal
Tax Service began dunning major Russian companies for unpaid taxes,
and Victor Khristenko, an international finance expert who is
currently deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Appointment of either man would reassure Russia's international
creditors, who hold the key to the country's economic recovery and
who are already unsettled by the week's developments. That was
underscored Thursday when the World Bank, which has nearly $5
billion invested in Russian programs, suspended plans to lend an
additional $2 billion until the country's financial course becomes
clearer.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund has agreed to extend Russia $4.5
billion more _ enough to forestall a truly crippling default on the
country's foreign debt _ but only if the parliament enacts a
package of politically unpopular tax increases and other
belt-tightening measures.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov had already negotiated parts of that package with his
Communist supporters in the parliament. The Yeltsin government said
Thursday that it would continue to support it, and the parliament
speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, said he expected its
approval this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has filled a second deputy's post, on the same rank as
that of the economic and finance position, with a midlevel official
who currently runs the state railroad monopoly, Nikolai Aksyonenko.
Aksyonenko's duties remain ill-defined, but he may supervise the
government's industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
   On another important front, Russia's Foreign Ministry said the
country's foreign policy was unaffected by Primakov's dismissal,
and it appears likely that the current foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, will keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin clearly has laid down a challenge to the
parliament by dismissing Primakov, it was not apparent Thursday
what the parliament intended to do about it, beyond press for his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders promised to meet Primakov's dismissal with a
nationwide round of street protests, but none of any note occurred.
Nor was it clear how they would deal with Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   A few see the choice of Stepashin as a sly warning that any
effort to remove Yeltsin from office will come back to haunt the
legislators. Stepashin made his career running Russia's formidable
internal security forces; some believe Yeltsin wants those forces
close at hand should he decide to move against his foes by
declaring a state of emergency and seizing parliament's powers.
Others say parliament would shy away from removing Yeltsin because,
under Russia's constitution, that would automatically elevate
Stepashin to the post of acting president.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament could reject Stepashin's nomination. But that is
in some ways an even greater risk because the constitution
potentially allows Yeltsin to dissolve the parliament under those
conditions and call new elections. And most analysts believe the
Communists would lose legislative seats in a new election.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calculation, however, was drowned out Thursday by
the drone of the impeachment debate, which was devoted almost
entirely to a recitation of the charges against Yeltsin and a
technical argument by his defenders that those charges were not
based in law.
</P>
<P>
   The president is accused of five crimes: illegally disbanding
the old Soviet Union; destroying the Russian military; waging an
illegal war against the breakaway republic of Chechnya; staging an
illegal coup against Communists who sought to seize control of the
government in 1993, and genocide against the Russian people, whose
average lifespan has declined since Russia became independent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the charges are widely seen as propaganda tools of
Yeltsin's Communist rivals, and have no chance of being approved.
The exception is the charge involving the Chechen war, which is
supported by at least 280 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on the five charges are expected to take place after
debate ends on Friday or Saturday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any charge approved by the parliament must be referred both to
the Supreme Court, which would rule on its legal content, and to
the Constitutional Court, which judges the constitutionality of the
proceedings. Finally, for Yeltsin to be ousted, the Council of
Federation would have to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an impeachment charge involving the Chechen war would
probably die an early death in the Supreme Court, which is unlikely
to overturn a 1995 ruling by the Constitutional Court that upheld
the legality of the war.

`STAR WARS: EPISODE I' IS BEST ENJOYED WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's this? You're reviewing ``Episode I'' early? The movie
doesn't open until next Wednesday. Isn't this a big break with
tradition?
</P>
<P>
   A. Media everywhere seem to be reviewing it early. When you're
in the middle of a stampede, you gotta run with it or get trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But isn't this a strange way to review a movie _ interviewing
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A. Too much has already been written about the darn thing. It's
time to cut to the chase, get to the essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Q. OK, then, let's do it. Is this movie any good?
</P>
<P>
   A. I enjoyed it _ more than I thought I would.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many of your colleagues seem to disagree. I've got a stack of
reviews here with the word ``disappointment'' in their first
paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   A. There's certainly room for disappointment. If you go into it
expecting the same magical experience you had in 1977, you're bound
to be disappointed. We're all older, and the world has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Surely there's more to the general air of letdown than this.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's also likely to be a letdown for anyone who ate up all
the advance word, read the entire blow-by-blow synopsis in Time
magazine, and learned every beat of the movie before going in.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You protected yourself from all that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did. I didn't read anything. OK, I watched the ``60
Minutes'' segment. But, otherwise, I even shut my eyes when the
preview came on. So the movie was a surprise to me. Look, there's
Yoda! Isn't that C-3PO?
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're saying the hype has ruined the movie for many people?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course, it has. It's built expectations that can't
possibly be matched, and scuttled the element of storytelling
surprise. I polled friends after the Seattle preview last week,
and, without exception, the ones who went in cold enjoyed it
immensely. Everyone else seemed underwhelemed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say you enjoyed it. What does that mean? How would you
rate it next to the rest of the Hollywood product of 1998 and '99?
</P>
<P>
   A. Definitely in the top 5 percent. It's well-made and
entertaining. It gives you your money's worth. It's five times
better than ``The Matrix'' and a hundred times better than ``The
Mummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's back up a minute. For those who've been trekking in the
Himalayas for the past year, what's this movie about?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's about two Jedis who go to an obscure planet that's in
the process of being taken over by an evil trade cartel. The Jedis
help the planet's beautiful young queen foil the scheme, with the
help of a boy they pick up on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The same old save-the-planet formula?
</P>
<P>
   A. More or less.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does it line up with the other three episodes?
</P>
<P>
   A. It takes place 30 years before the first episode, which is
actually Episode IV. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young apprentice Jedi
knight here. The boy hero grows up to be Darth Vader, father of
Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Got that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would you compare it to the previous three episodes?
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, I liked it better than ``Return of the Jedi.''
You have to figure there's diminishing returns with any sequel. And
the basic ``Star Wars'' premise was played out with ``Jedi.'' In a
way, Lucas has started completely over with this prequel, and I
respect that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What didn't you like about the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Jar Jar Binks character _ the computer-animated comic
relief who speaks in a kind of Jamaican patois. He's totally
annoying, and you can't understand even half of what he says. It's
a major miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the movie most lack?
</P>
<P>
   A. I suppose the thing that people will miss the most is Han
Solo. He's the center of the trilogy _ the flawed, cocky,
swashbuckling, rascal-hero. Someone we can love and identify with.
There's really no adult human hero here. The Jedi knights are stiff
and Arthurian, and so competent they never seem to be in any real
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That brings up a good question. The leads of the first ``Star
Wars'' were all unknowns. Yet now, when he's got a built-in
audience, Lucas has cast popular stars _ Liam Neeson and Ewan
McGregor. Why didn't he take a chance on unknowns?
</P>
<P>
   A. Possibly he didn't think he could make lightning strike twice
in the same place. Harrison Ford jumped out of the original to
become the biggest star of the past two decades. Trying to
duplicate that feat must have seemed a poor risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible that Lucas has come to take himself a bit too
seriously? Many reviewers seem to miss the trivial moments, the
bantering scenes between Luke, Leia and Han.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's possible. After all, people have been writing articles
for the past 20 years about how the ``spiritual dimension'' of the
movie _ comparing it less to ``Flash Gordon'' than to Joseph
Campbell and the Tao. But I think the new movie is not as enjoyably
corny and goofy simply because it's the expression of a more
serious-minded 55-year-old filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But Lucas keeps saying that ``Episode I'' is a kids' movie.
</P>
<P>
   A. In a way, it is. On one level, it's much more of a small
boy's fantasy than the others. The kid has the romantic attachment,
and even does most of the heroics. On the other hand, our knowing
he grows up to be an arch-villain gives his scenes a certain
subtext of darkness and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your most pleasant surprise in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A. Its air of political intrigue. Unlike the others, it flirts
with being a fascinating, behind-the-scenes, political drama.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned your displeasure with Jar Jar. How did you like
the other creatures?
</P>
<P>
   A. Frankly, the creatures don't move me that much in any of the
movies. They're just so many guys in rubber masks to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the computer-generated action sequences?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some of them were fairly mindblowing, especially as
backgrounds. The underwater scenes. The cityscapes. The cavernous
Senate chamber. Great stuff. And I thought the 10-minute race
sequence _ Lucas' version of the ``Ben-Hur'' chariot race _ was
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But?
</P>
<P>
   A. But as lifelike and detailed as these CG scenes are, they
never seem completely real. Even the best computer animation still
seems slightly cartoonish _ and maybe it always will. Compare the
big battle scenes here with, say, Kubrick's battle scenes in
``Spartacus.'' Or the charge into Aqaba in ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
Or the ``Ben-Hur'' chariot race. These scenes are thrilling because
they're really happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What implications do you think the extraordinary hype around
the movie will have for the future of moviemaking?
</P>
<P>
   A. We may be entering an era in which we get excited about one
big movie every year. Last year it was ``Titanic,'' this year it's
``Star Wars.'' As American society and culture has become
increasingly fragmented in the '90s, Hollywood movies have become
our only common point of reference, the mainstream. But now, with
so many movies and so many of them ``demographically targeted,''
even movies are losing that position. Maybe the cultural mainstream
in the new millennium will be one big movie that everyone in the
world gets excited about in one way or another for months in
advance. And if it's not there, the media will create it.

EASY APPROVAL IS PREDICTED FOR SUMMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's nominee for Treasury secretary,
Lawrence Summers, appears to be facing relatively little opposition
in the Senate, even from Republican critics of the administration's
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and Robert Rubin, the current secretary who on Wednesday
announced his intention to resign, spent part of the day on Capitol
Hill, dropping in on key members of the Senate. Summers, now the
deputy secretary, left Thursday evening for Malaysia, for a
long-scheduled meeting of Asian finance ministers. But he is to
return by Monday and is expected to say little in public while
preparing for his confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings for any appointee toward the end of an administration
are always a bit unpredictable, and it is always possible that
Summers' nomination could become a political football. White House
aides said they suspected that Rubin tried to time his departure to
maximize Summers' chances of confirmation. ``The closer you get to
the presidential election,'' one White House official said, ``the
more risks you run.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Senate majority Leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
who in recent weeks has cast himself in opposition to several
administration economic initiatives, said Thursday morning that he
saw no problems with Summers' nomination. Later in the day, he met
with Summers, as did Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, which will consider the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said Thursday that his committee had ``a good working
relationship'' with Summers, suggesting that he saw no large
hurdles to confirmation. His committee might have felt differently
a few years ago, when Summers clashed with the panel over the $12
billion bailout of Mexico. To raise the money, the administration
circumvented Congress and drew on the Exchange Stabilization Fund,
which is under the Treasury's control.
</P>
<P>
   Summers himself was uncharacteristically quiet Thursday, and
aides said he would keep public comments to a minimum while his
nomination was under consideration. That is hardly unusual for any
nominee. But it is considered a particularly important strategy for
the sometimes blunt-speaking Summers, who went out of his way this
week to repeatedly use the phrase ``subject to the will of the
Senate'' when referring to his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Rubin devoted the entirety of a short
commencement speech at New York University to talk about
decision-making _ spelling out how he approached problems on Wall
Street and at the treasury by weighing probabilities and focusing
more on how a decision was reached than whether its outcome was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subject he often discussed during the Asian financial
crisis, when he was often faced with the question of whether
propping up a country _ or its currency _ would help promote reform
or, in the alternative, take the pressure off politicians to change
the country's economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those bets went bad. More than $4 billion committed
to Russia was essentially lost, with no reforms. But the bailouts
of Thailand and South Korea went hand in hand with at least some
modest changes in banking systems and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin recalled facing the decision in June 1998 about whether to
prop up the Japanese yen, whose value had been falling sharply _
threatening to trigger devaluations elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, to say the least, a very complicated situation,''
Rubin said. The discussion could have gone on indefinitely, he
said, not adding that in the Clinton White House, discussions
usually do go on at great length. ``But we didn't have that luxury:
Markets wait for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   That bet worked out, and the yen's decline was halted. But Rubin
argued, as he did last year during several failed attempts to prop
up Russia and Indonesia, that ``judging solely on results is a
serious deterrent to taking the risk that may be necessary to
making the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the way decisions are evaluated affects the way
decisions are made,'' Rubin said. ``I believe the public would be
better served, and their elected officials and others in Washington
would do a more effective job, if judgments were based on the
quality of decision-making instead of focusing solely on
outcomes.''

MARKET PLACE: LAWYERS PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO BE PAID 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the first, the litigation triggered by the collapse of
Cendant Corp.'s stock price in April 1998 has provided provocative
entertainment to anyone lucky enough to have avoided being caught
in the financial wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the magnitude of investors' losses _ estimated at
$14 billion _ made the case potentially the most lucrative
class-action lawsuit the securities litigation community had ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the scramble among lawyers for a dominant role in the case
produced accusations of political favoritism, after which the judge
decided to adopt a form of competitive bidding for awarding the
legal work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday before federal
Judge William Walls in Newark, N.J., there will be another
interesting fight over a novel fee arrangement proposed by lawyers
who have negotiated a settlement with Cendant on behalf of the
holders of one of its derivative securities, called Prides.
</P>
<P>
   Those lawyers, led by the Manhattan firm of Kirby McInerney &AMP;
Squire, have agreed that their fee will be paid in the same
``currency'' that their clients are getting _ namely, a new
security to be issued by Cendant. Thus, if the security that
investors are getting in settlement of their claims does not retain
its anticipated value, the lawyers will find that their fee, too,
has withered away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting our fees where our mouths are,'' the Kirby firm
explained in documents filed with the court.
</P>
<P>
   That unusual arrangement is being challenged by a persistent
gadfly in the case, who argues that the legal fees being sought,
regardless of how they are paid, greatly exceed the bid the Kirby
firm submitted in the competition conducted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The gadfly, Howard Sirota, is part of a team of lawyers that
originally pressed for the competitive bidding arrangement, a role
for which they are also seeking a fee. Sirota's team was also an
unsuccessful bidder in the fight to be lead counsel in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The current litigation started April 16, 1998, when Cendant's
stock plummeted 46 percent after the company disclosed serious
accounting irregularities. Those irregularities are still being
investigated by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, with Cendant's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of private class-action lawsuits were filed against the
company in the days after the stock collapsed, and Walls had the
job of designating which of the various plaintiffs would oversee
the legal work and hire the ``lead'' lawyers _ who would reap the
biggest fees in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Public pension funds in New York state, overseen by state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, were named lead plaintiffs among the
common stockholders; Connecticut's pension fund was chosen to lead
the litigation on behalf of the Prides investors.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Sirota officially complained that the selection of
lead counsel might have been influenced by campaign contributions
made to McCall by the lawyers he hired. Without endorsing Sirota's
view, Walls still established a confidential competitive bidding
procedure for lawyers who wanted to work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirby firm emerged from that process as lead counsel for the
holders of the Cendant Prides, a derivative security issued by
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and ultimately convertible into new shares of
Cendant common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the firm announced a complex settlement with
Cendant that experts say is worth between $340 million and $350
million. The plan calls for Cendant to give the Prides holders new
certificates, called rights, that can be traded or held to maturity
in 2001, when they can be converted into new Cendant stock. When
combined with the existing Prides, the rights also entitle
investors to new Prides securities, convertible into a larger
number of Cendant shares than the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   If the valuation experts are right, the settlement adds up to a
full recovery for the Prides investors.
</P>
<P>
   As its fee for negotiating this deal _ which lawyer Roger Kirby
modestly called ``a settlement of monumental, possibly unmatchable,
significance in this field'' _ the plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking
a fee that, they say, links their interests directly with those of
their clients. Specifically, they want to receive 2,916,147 new
Cendant rights as their fee.
</P>
<P>
   But Sirota calculates the value of that compensation would be
$34 million, and argues it would thus be about 10 percent of the
total settlement fund _ a percentage he contends greatly exceeds
the confidential bid that the Kirby firm submitted to the court
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive bidding is still a controversial approach for
awarding legal work on big cases like this one, though a few
federal judges rely on it routinely. But Sirota, a staunch advocate
of the bidding process, said its advantages to investors evaporate
if the winning lawyers can come back later and seek fees in excess
of their original bid.
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that this plan, which calls for the lawyers to be
paid primarily with rights that have gone unclaimed by eligible
investors, creates an unhealthy incentive that could reduce the
aggressiveness with which claimants are encouraged to apply for a
share of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirby firm vehemently disagrees. The search for eligible
members of the class has been very aggressive, they insist, and
besides, any unclaimed rights would otherwise revert to Cendant,
not to the original Prides investors.
</P>
<P>
   Walls will make the final call, of course, and his decision
could lead to more cases in which legal fees are paid in the same
currency as the settlements _ or alternatively, to more cases in
which legal fees are firmly set by competitive bid at the start of
the case. Thus, regardless of who loses, shareholders in future
cases could win.

AU PAIR'S PARENTS REPORTEDLY ARRESTED IN FUNDS FRAUD PROBE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ The parents of Louise Woodward were allegedly arrested
last week by British investigators who believe they fraudently
drained their daughter's defense fund of as much as $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money was donated by worldwide sympathizers of the British
au pair convicted of killing a baby in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Cheshire, England released a statement Thursday
confirming two people were arrested May 4 in connection with
allegations that the suspects misused the money in the Louise
Woodward Family Trust. The pair were brought to the police station,
where they were told to return July 1, when prosecutors will meet
with them.
</P>
<P>
   A source in Woodward's hometown of Elton, who is familiar with
the case, said Thursday that Woodward's mother Susan was one of
those arrested. At the same time, leading British news sources,
including the British Broadcasting Corp., identified Woodward's
father, Gary, as also having been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through her lawyer Thursday, Susan
Woodward denied any misdeeds. Her husband could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards, familiar faces to those who followed their
daughter's sensational trial, separated following Louise Woodward's
Oct. 30, 1997 conviction for killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen of
Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Sky News reported that the police are looking into
allegations that approximately $283,000 was transferred out of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, including the FBI, who have been following a
trail of paper evidence in this country and abroad, refused to
identify the two people arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, police said, were released on what the British call
``police bail'' pending a decision by crown prosecutors on whether
to formally file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former family friend Elaine Whitfield Sharp, a lawyer who hosted
Susan Woodward at Sharp's Marblehead, Mass. home during Louise
Woodward's legal troubles, said Thursday she felt sorry, but not
surprised, by the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad that it's come to this,'' said Sharp, a one-time
ally of the Woodwards who severed any allegiance to them when she
alleged last year that Susan Woodward had forged Sharp's signature
on a $15,000 invoice drawn on the fund. Susan Woodward alleged that
Sharp charged her rent during Louise Woodward's sensational trial
near Boston in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a personal vindication,'' said Sharp, speaking
at a press conference Thursday. ``I never charged them a penny, and
I never lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was an intentional draining of the fund,'' said
Sharp, recalling that she grew suspicious when Woodward's parents
made public appeals for more money, when there was enough to
finance a new trial available.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said she believed the money was taken from the account so
the Matthew Eappen family would not be able to collect any funds in
a wrongful death lawsuit against Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' attorney declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the statement from Susan Woodward's attorney accused
Sharp of making false allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Woodward took the opportunity to give the police her
side of the story and an insight into the motives of Elaine
Whitfield-Sharp in making false allegations against her and her
family,'' the statement read..
</P>
<P>
   Sharp had fallen from favor of the Woodwards in May of 1998,
when she was arrested for drunk driving, and allegedly told a
Massachusetts state trooper she was suffering, and drinking,
because she had to live with the knowledge that the young au pair
was guilty. Sharp denies making the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The defense funds were allegedly solicited to pay for a second
trial to clear the teenager's name.
</P>
<P>
   EF AuPair, the agency which recruited Woodward, paid the costs
of the initial trial, including the high-profile defense team of
Harvey Silverglate, Barry Scheck and Andrew Good.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court jury convicted the au pair in
the second-degree murder of Matthew Eappen, who died of a fractured
skull in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, now 21 and studying law, was alone with the boy when
he was rushed to the hospital, his brain bleeding. A jury listened
to 17 days of testimony and convicted her of second-degree murder,
but Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the verdict to involuntary
manslaughter and set Woodward free on time served -- 279 days.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision was upheld by the state Supreme Judicial
Court.

GOP OFFERS REVAMPED GUN-CONTROL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearing political fallout from angry voters, Senate
Republicans reversed course Thursday, introducing a package of
gun-control restrictions and embracing a measure they had rejected
only 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate Thursday adopted a ban on high-capacity
ammunition clips, a provision that had been defeated a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Senators are scheduled to vote Friday on the GOP package, which
some Democrats called a ``sham,'' as part of the a bill that would
toughen prosecution of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., the measure has become a forum for debating gun
control, with the Clinton administration proposals such mesures as
raising the legal age for gun ownership to 21 from 18 and holding
parents criminally liable for giving their children access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night whether Thursday's Republican
proposals represent a strategic retreat that will enable the GOP to
claim progress on gun-control while forestalling broader changes,
or whether public pressure will carry other Clinton-backed measures
to passage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the Republican reversal was an indication
that the Colorado shootings have for the moment galvanized public
opinion, shifted the political debate in favor of tighter
restrictions on firearms, and created concerns about how potent an
issue gun control may become in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   It also may signal a weakening of the powerful gun lobby, the
National Rifle Association, which launched an intensive lobbying
effort this weak to counter gun-control groups, whicgh also were
out in force on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders decided to reverse course after a group of
senators indicated they were unhappy with a measure approved
Wednesday, which established a system of voluntary background
checks on firearms sales by private dealers at gun shows. Such
checks are mandatory on sales by licensed firearms dealers, and
Democrats had proposed closing this so-called loophole to include
gun show sales between private persons. Two guns used by the
Columbine students during their shooting spree were bought at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary system was proposed by Senator Larry Craig, an
Idaho Republican and NRA board member, and also would change how
the background-check rules apply to pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just woke up unhappy at what we had done,'' said Senator
Gordon Smith, Republican of Oregon, who said he would try to change
his vote. ``I had been under the impression, perhaps mistaken, that
we would have an amendment that closed the gun show loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who made their concerns known to Craig and to
party leaders included moderate Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, both of Maine. It also included Arizona Senator John
McCain, a presidential candidate who, Democrats speculated, might
be worried about the political potency of the issue as the election
year approaches.

SENATE GOP LEADERSHIP RETREATS ON GUN CONTROL MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional ending) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with stinging criticism from the White House
and some of its own members, the Senate GOP leadership Thursday
abruptly reversed course and threw its support behind mandatory
instant background checks for buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to endorse such gun show checks came a day after
the GOP majority narrowly defeated a similar measure proposed by
Senate Democrats and instead opted for voluntary checks. The Senate
is to vote Friday on the amendment to juvenile justice legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker who led the effort against mandatory gun show
checks, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said he changed his mind after
meeting with several Republicans who complained they were misled
about his voluntary approach.
</P>
<P>
   One of those GOP lawmakers, Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, who had
voted against mandatory checks and for the voluntary option,
threatened to have his voted changed unless the leadership
revisited the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defend the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens but not
for nuts and crooks,'' Smith said. ``If a gun is transacted at a
gun show, there should be a background check _ that is not a huge
imposition on the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversal was a major embarrassment to the GOP leadership and
the National Rifle Association, which has lobbied heavily for the
defeat of new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The gun show checks have emerged as a flash point in the
Senate's debate on juvenile crime in part because the issue is
related to the recent high school killings in Colorado. Some of the
weapons used by the student killers at Columbine High School in
suburban Littleton were purchased at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the criminal background checks that are required for
gun purchases under the Brady Law can be avoided at gun shows,
where unlicensed dealers do not have to conduct such checks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately pounced on the about-face by their
Republican colleagues as evidence that they had been overly
influenced by the gun lobby and were out of touch with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the gang that can't shoot straight,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer and other Democrats remained wary of the mandatory
gun-show check proposal advanced by Republicans, arguing that
gaping loopholes remained.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed the GOP provision would exempt certain gun shows,
such as those with 10 tables or less, from forcing sellers to
conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they said the Republican version would exempt
pawnbrokers from doing such checks on people who bought back guns
they had turned over temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said such checks were unnecessary because pawn shops
already had to report to law-enforcement authorities any guns
turned into them.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gun shows overshadowed the fact that the Senate
overwhelmingly approved a provision that would bar juveniles under
the age of 18 from purchasing semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The gun debate began early in the day as President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno took time out to blast the Senate
Republicans for the previous day's vote to defeat mandatory
gun-show checks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate defeated the mandatory checks 51-47 and
approved voluntary checks 53-41.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me I can't figure out how they did it,''
Clinton said. He said that there was ``simply no excuse for letting
criminals get arms at gun shows they can't get at gun stores.''
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference, Reno said ``I am stunned that
less than one month after the worst school shooting in our nation's
history the Senate has decided to make it easier for felons,
fugitives and other prohibited purchasers to buy guns,.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were quick to note the influence of the gun lobby and
pointed out that Sen. Craig is a board member of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA was on the floor of the Senate working the well,''
said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the chief Democratic sponsor of
the gun show checks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Center for Responsive Politics study, the NRA and
other gun rights groups have given nearly $9 million to candidates
and political parties between 1991 and 1998. Republicans have
received 74 percent of those donations.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that those senators who voted against the
mandatory gun show checks Wednesday received an average of $10,478
from gun groups while those who voted in favor of it received an
average of $297.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison led
lawmakers in contributions from gun groups, receiving $23,900
between 1993 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics analysis. The state's senior senator, Republican Phil
Gramm, ranked fourth having received $18,550 from gun rights groups
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gramm and Hutchison voted initially against the mandatory
gun show checks and for the voluntary approach.

AS FOURTH `STAR WARS' FILM PREPARES TO OPEN, THE SALES FORCE IS

<P>
   Coming soon, a film with marketing more choreographed than a
Fred Astaire version of ``Saturday Night Fever!'' More skillfully
planned than the mission to save Matt Damon! A campaign more
orchestrated than all of Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred
Hitchcock! Yes, a movie even more unsinkable than Titanic!
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise what we're talking about. Only those overheated
trailers at the Bijous and Orpheums of the 1940s and '50s can
approximate the frenzied peddling of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.'' Though the movie does not open until Wednesday,
merchandise is flooding toy stores, Web sites, fast-food
restaurants, computer stores, music stores, supermarkets,
bookstores and newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by legions of enthusiasts who have waited years for this
moment _ at some theaters, they camped out for weeks to get advance
tickets that went on sale this Wednesday afternoon _ the fourth
``Star Wars'' film has taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's genuine passion here; no one is telling those people
to line up,'' said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy
and marketing at the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. in
Purchase, N.Y., which is spending $2 billion to sponsor ``The
Phantom Menace'' and sequels to be released in 2002 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The new installment, the first ``prequel'' to the original
trinity, is largely selling itself _ thanks in no small part to the
eager involvement of licensees, merchandisers, retailers and, of
course, the news media, churning out programs and articles like
this one.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the groundswell of excitement, though, is a well-tended
machine, cranking out the biggest marketing blitz ever for a mere
movie. That effort is being supervised down to the teensiest detail
by George Lucas, the zillionaire writer-producer-director who
created the ``Star Wars'' juggernaut and whose Lucasfilm Ltd. has
been working on the next chapter since the last film was released
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing of an entertainment property is becoming the
story instead of the property itself,'' said Michael Schau,
executive editor of the Entertainment Marketing Letter newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to college,'' he said, ``we didn't ask each
other, `What do you suppose the top-grossing movie was this
weekend?' Now we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since ``Gone With the Wind'' has there been so much
spontaneous anticipation so far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something there that touches their hearts,'' said
Howard Roffman, vice president for licensing at Lucasfilm in San
Rafael, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any hype at all, it comes from the media,'' he
added. ``They see this as an important story that will get viewers
and sell newspapers and magazines. It has resulted in a level of
attention we frankly are not seeking ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two major newspapers are printing daily ``countdown''
features. Magazines with cover articles include Entertainment
Weekly, GQ, Newsweek, Premiere, Time, Vanity Fair, Wired _ even
Popular Mechanics (``The Machines of `Star Wars'''), Vogue (```Star
Wars' Couture'') and TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't plan on becoming a cultural phenomenon,'' said
Roffman, who joined Lucasfilm in 1980, or as he dates it, ``a
couple weeks before `The Empire Strikes Back' was released.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like people sat down in 1975 and said, `Let's create
a space mythology that'll last for generations,''' he added. ``It
all stems from demand from the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   That was underscored in November, when thousands of ``Star
Wars'' fans bought tickets for clunky films like ``Meet Joe Black''
just to catch the 130-second trailer for ``The Phantom Menace.'' It
was further verified this week by the telephone and Internet
traffic jams that occurred on buying sites around the country after
tickets went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' has become a consumer brand, promising quality and
performance the way brand-name cars, candy and clothing do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great brands create a relationship between a company and a
consumer that secures future earnings,'' said John Grace, an
executive director at Interbrand, a consulting company in New York
owned by Omnicom Group. `` `Star Wars' has all the characteristics
of a great brand of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at Hasbro Inc., the toy company whose licensing deal
with Lucasfilm dates to the first film in 1977. One Hasbro
executive, Tim Hall, has a title that says it all: vice president
for ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   To renew its agreement with Lucas, Hasbro is guaranteeing an
estimated $500 million in royalties from ``Phantom Menace''
products that range from Darth Maul With Lightsaber to the Anakin
Skywalker Podracer to the Hidden Majesty Queen Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   Behind it all stands Lucas. ``I've got to hand it to George,''
said Jack Trout, president at Trout &AMP; Partners, marketing
consultants in Greenwich, Conn. ``He's turning an 800-pound gorilla
into King Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant the way he has carefully nurtured this property
over many years,'' Trout said. ``Eat your heart out, Walt Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually reclusive Lucas, who oversees Lucasfilm and other
companies like Lucasarts Entertainment, has granted a score of
interviews to help stoke the bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire Lucas for his long-term approach,'' said
Peter Waller, president and chief concept officer at Taco Bell in
Irvine, Calif., one of three chains owned by Tricon Global
Restaurants that are the fast-food marketing partners for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about a great summer movie,'' Waller asserted.
``It's about building `Star Wars' in a real brand sense as an
experience people want to keep re-entering.''
</P>
<P>
   There are predictions that ``The Phantom Menace,'' which will be
distributed by the 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corp., could
set records by taking in as much as $100 million in its first five
days. Topping ``Titanic,'' which garnered worldwide grosses of more
than $1.8 billion, would be ``a tall order,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president at the Exhibitor Relations Co. in Los
Angeles, which tracks box-office performance. Even so, he added,
``if any film has the chance to do it, it would be this one.''

UNDATED: be this one.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, ``any high-profile film that gets lots of interest and
attention can fall victim to the double-edged sword,''
Dergarabedian warned, adding that it is particularly true for a
film that ``has had such a high profile for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs of trouble. Both Time and Newsweek
dubbed the new film ``The Phantom Movie,'' and there have been
harshly negative advance reviews as well as derogatory columns by
critics like Jack Mathews of The Daily News in New York. He mocked
the selling of the film with such lines as ``May the Sales Force be
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   To help cool the overheated expectations, the advertising budget
for ``The Phantom Menace'' is less than $20 million, not much for a
film with a budget of $115 million competing in the blockbuster
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to overdo it,'' said Roffman at Lucasfilm.
``The worst thing you can do is to create a plan based on your
needs instead of the consumers'.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas recognizes the potential pitfalls, said Jill Wilfert,
senior brand manager at Lego Systems in Enfield, Conn., a unit of
Lego Group, who met with him as part of planning for her company's
``Phantom Menace'' line _ its first licensed merchandise ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants people to have a good experience with the movie and
not see it as being overly commercialized,'' Ms. Wilfert said,
``because he doesn't want them to be sick of it after a few
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the movie will benefit from spillover from its
partners' own marketing campaigns, which will include glitzy
commercials by the BBDO New York and TBWA/Chiat/Day units of
Omnicom for Pepsico and Tricon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this to be one of our most successful promotions''
across ``our entire peak summer selling season,'' said Ms. Hudson
at Pepsi-Cola, which hopes to sell millions of cans of five
soft-drink brands that feature ``Phantom Menace'' characters.
Consumers who find cans bearing the venerable visage of Yoda can
redeem them for `` `Star Wars' checks'' worth $20.
</P>
<P>
   At Tricon, which owns Pizza Hut and KFC in addition to Taco
Bell, the campaign marks the first time the three brands have
united under a single promotional theme. ``It's all in the
never-been-done-before league,'' Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   Each chain will be identified with one of three planets in the
movie, Coruscant, Naboo and Tatooine, selling toys and drink-cup
tops with names like Opee Sea Creature Chaser, Jar Jar Binks
Squishy and Hovering Watto.
</P>
<P>
   For true fans, though, even too much commercialization may not
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are so into `Star Wars' that the advertising is almost
entertainment to them, part of the cultural impact the film is
making,'' said Tim Doyle, a copywriter at Leo Burnett Interactive
in Toronto, part of the Leo Burnett Co. Doyle and two fellow fans
in Australia and Los Angeles have on their own put up a ``Phantom
Menace'' Web site (www.starwars.countingdown.com).
</P>
<P>
   So how will ``The Phantom Menace'' do?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the box office, total merchandise sales may reach $2
billion this year _ almost half what the ``Star Wars'' franchise
has sold since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In theaters, ``America is ready to climb back into fantasy land
and see the good guys beat the bad guys,'' Trout predicted. ``Wait
till it opens and the lines are wrapped around the block. Wait till
you see the press for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The final word goes to Dergarabedian at Exhibitor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make money whether there is good word of mouth or bad
word of mouth,'' he said, ``but what will keep it playing is
terrific word of mouth. There's no better marketing than that.''

`MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT DREAM' SUFFERS FROM AN AVALANCHE OF STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent interview, British actor Jeremy Northam groaned over
the popular consensus about William Shakespeare's best-known
comedy, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people persist in thinking it's a twee little play?''
he wondered. ``It's all about sex!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, every character in the enchanted comedy lusts for
someone; Oberon, the fairy king, for his queen, Titania; Theseus
for Hippolyta; Lysander for Hermia; and Helena for Demetrius; even
Nick, the weaver, eyeballs every woman who walks by.
</P>
<P>
   Lust is certainly hinted at in director/writer Michael Hoffman's
long-delayed version, which he has reset in Tuscany at the end of
the 19th century. So why doesn't it have an ounce of oomph or sex
appeal?
</P>
<P>
   The cast is attractive enough: Michelle Pfeiffer is Titania.
Rupert Everett stars as Oberon. Stanley Tucci plays the impish
fairy Puck, who casts spells over a quartet of lost lovers one warm
summer's night. The lovers are played by Christian Bale, Anna
Friel, Dominic West and Calista Flockhart. And Kevin Kline is
onboard as Nick Bottom, the weaver who is turned into an ass by one
of Oberon and Puck's more mean-spirited spells.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Will's tale: Hermia (Friel) is being married off to
Demetrius (Bale). But she really loves Lysander (West). Her best
friend Helena (Flockhart) adores Demetrius, who looks upon her with
disdain. Hermia and Lysander plan to run away and elope but Helena
tells Demetrius, who pursues the couple deep into the woods. They
crash into the secluded kingdom of the fairy king, Oberon, his
queen Titania and his prankster imp Puck. Spells are cast, chaos
ensues and by dawn, true love prevails.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the course of true love never did flow smooth,'' wrote
Shakespeare, and indeed it's not the only thing that stops and
starts in this ragged version. Hoffman, who did the adaptation
himself, cuts and pastes portions of the play into his movie with a
clunky hand. And the avalanche of star power nearly sinks the ship.
Certainly Hoffman is prepared to handle a big cast; his films
``Promised Land'' and ``Restoration'' were full of talent and he
directed both movies stylishly. But he's also the guy who made the
stagnant romantic comedy ``One Fine Day,'' which starred Pfeiffer
as well.
</P>
<P>
   She's one of the biggest problems with this film too. Titania
should sparkle and glow with earthiness. When that happens,
Oberon's demands and trickery make sense. Pfeiffer is too ethereal
to make us believe that the king's libido would rise because of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Of the lovers, Friel and West fare best. They have an ease with
the text and momentarily spark the film to life. Flockhart gives a
valiant effort, but it's too apparent she's ``acting.'' And Kline
throws the film off-kilter entirely with his overblown, hammy
portrayal. By the time he musters the pathos Nick needs, the
credits are about to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is less theirs than the script's. Hoffman stuffs
his film with shots of Tuscany that are as overripe as an olive. He
makes a mess of his marketplace scenes by throwing in everything
but the kitchen sink and his enchanted forest looks like the set
was carved out of plastic. Shakespeare's comical, all-too-human
tale of lust, foreplay and wordplay is buried beneath bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   A Midsummer Night's Dream. Directed and adapted by Michael
Hoffman from Shakespeare's play. Cast: Kevin Kline, Michelle
Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart. Fox
Searchlight. 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes.

A STIRRING `JOAN OF ARC' FROM CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The viewing public might have restrained enthusiasm for whether
a 15th century peasant could break up the Burgundian alliance with
the English and revive the Valois dynasty in France.
</P>
<P>
   No, the 15th century is so ancient and musty that it seems
almost as long ago as 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But French history aside, the story of Joan of Arc is timeless,
and the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc'' (airing Sunday and Tuesday)
is an honest effort to tell it. Sometimes even a grand effort.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a conscious effort, along with NBC's ``Noah's Ark''
and ABC's ``Cleopatra'' this month, to keep alive the flickering
tradition of spectacle in sweeps-month miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan of Arc'' is frustratingly uneven, and some of the stars
in its cast are twinkling in the wrong firmament. But it's head,
shoulders and coat of armor above CBS' junky ``Last Don''
centerpieces of the past two May sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly incongruous cast includes Jacqueline Bisset, Peter
O'Toole, Neil Patrick Harris, Robert Loggia, Shirley MacLaine,
Olympia Dukakis, Powers Boothe, Maximilian Schell and Peter
Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Leelee Sobieski (``Never Been Kissed'') is cast
as Joan, a star-making role that led famously to Marshalltown,
Iowa, and the discovery of Jean Seberg for Otto Preminger's 1957
film ``Saint Joan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski proves to be an acquired taste. It's no big deal that
her face is so startlingly reminiscent of Helen Hunt's. The initial
problem is one of those cinematic mysteries. The eyes, the mouth,
the demeanor, the delivery all smack of United States 1999, not
provincial France nearly 600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Joan of Arc'' unleashes a little miracle of its own.
Sobieski grows into the role. If she never quite propels Joan into
the ethereal realm, she at least achieves dignity and depth, a girl
fearful of her terrible fate _ to be convicted of heresy and burned
at the stake _ but ultimately secure in her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Booth is seriously miscast as Joan's father. Same for Loggia as
the wig-domed priest in Joan's native village, Domremy. And Strauss
as a battle-hardened French warrior? Uh, no.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is a pleasant surprise as the French king, Charles VII.
You might expect him to be more Doogie than dauphin, but he
performs confidently and believably as a cunning ruler who exploits
Joan's magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   MacLaine grabs a few scenes as Madame de Beaurevoir, a
Burgundian noblewoman who briefly protects the captured Joan.
O'Toole dresses up the production as Bishop Cauchon, the king's
spiritual adviser and later one of Joan's inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a restrained O'Toole, venturing no closer to over
the top than a whiff of jaded wistfulness. He seems to respect the
material, even when he ties the ribbon on this deliberately goofy
line:
</P>
<P>
   ``As his majesty's church-appointed spiritual adviser, I advise
his majesty not to take lightly the advice of his church-appointed
spiritual adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   The line is doubly instructive because it suggests that the
screenwriters, Ronald Parker and Michael Miller, can bat the
language around with more skill than is routinely apparent in
network movies. The script is erratic, but it hits peaks far above
the TV norm.
</P>
<P>
   (Incidentally, one of the actual charges against Joan was that
the saints Catherine, Margaret and Michael spoke to her in French
rather than in English. That's not mentioned in the miniseries.
Maybe there's no point in riling Canadian viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   Fluidly directed by Christian Duguay, ``Joan of Arc'' was filmed
in the Czech Republic, where dozens of battlements and hundreds of
extras provide a balance between taste and gore in the medieval
battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Few viewers will succeed in deciphering the historical details
of ``Joan of Arc.'' But there's nothing stale about the conflict
between gnarled intrigue and innocence, or between cunning and
character.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Joan of Arc,'' CBS takes the highest aim of the '98-99
television season. This is a miniseries that wants to stir the
soul. It creates a rustle, at least.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS LOAD UP EMERGENCY KOSOVO BILL
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An emergency measure that began with a $6 billion
request for the air war in Yugoslavia swelled Thursday into a $14
billion package that includes relief for interests ranging from the
oil and gas industry to Alaska crab fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   As House and Senate negotiators continued to wrangle over the
spending bill Thursday night, they received reassurance from
President Clinton that he might sign it, despite earlier hints of a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the funds now, and we need the demonstration of
support for the Kosovar refugees and for Macedonia and Albania
now,'' Clinton said in a speech to veterans groups, adding that he
was ``pretty encouraged'' by reports that the bill would be scaled
back.
</P>
<P>
   However, the only add-on that was deleted Thursday was $1
billion in loan guarantees to bail out the steel industry, which
has been buffeted by a flood of cheap Asian imports. Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., had pushed for the provision and bitterly protested
when the House-Senate conference narrowly dropped his amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see here is a steamroller,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, support by other senators raised the prospect
that Byrd's amendment might be resurrected. In addition, Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was trying to revive a measure killed
earlier that would aid the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill almost doubles the $6 billion that Clinton
sought for the conflict over Kosovo. The joint congressional
conference has agreed to spend $11.7 billion related to the crisis,
most of it for the military, and the rest for aid to the Kosovar
refugees and the Balkan nations which are harboring them.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the bill is nearly $1 billion that Clinton proposed to
help Honduras and other Central American countries hit last year by
the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. The conferees added $566
million in aid to U.S. farmers hit by a drastic drop in commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
   With a bill that seemed almost certain of passage before them,
many lawmakers were not about to miss an opportunity to attach
special-interest provisions. Outside the Capitol basement meeting
room, lobbyists waited in the hallways and dialed cell phones to
report updates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pet issues that made their way onto the bill:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hutchison won approval of a plan to forbid the federal
government from sharing _ or even telling states how to spend _ the
$246 billion won in their lawsuits against the tobacco industry.
Hutchison had been allied with Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., in the
effort to keep the federal government from funneling a share of the
money into Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   _ A second Hutchison provision would give more help to the
energy industry, delaying until at least next October any change in
the way the Interior Deparment calculates royalties for oil and gas
drilled on federal lands. The department has said the royalties are
not based on the actual market value of the oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala., won provisions to aid crab fishermen
in Glacier Bay, Alaska, and also tucked a provision for $3 million
for reindeer ranchers, which he touted as ``my Santa Claus
provision.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., inserted a provision overruling an
Interior Department action that had stalled a mining company,
Battle Mountain Gold of Houston, which has been attempting to
establish a mine on Buckhorn Mountain in his state.
Environmentalists' efforts to head off the Gorton amendment failed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gorton decried the packaging of so much
spending in the guise of an emergency. ``I am very dubious about
the entire bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of the bill, Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wis., said
Thursday that since the emergency bill would provide so much basic
funding for military operations and maintenance, ammunition,
aircraft and a pay raise, lawmakers would be able to include much
more spending for pet local projects in the annual defense
appropriations bill next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the snow plow that clears the way for the snow job,''
Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Kosovo bill and its amendments are considered
``emergency'' spending, the funds are exempt from spending caps
that limit how much Congress can include in annual appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has lambasted Congress for using
defense spending bills as a vehicle for pet programs, offered a
similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so disillusioning because, also as a Republican, you
know we promised when we came to power in 1994 we wouldn't do those
things anymore,'' he said Wednesday on the ``Midweek With Mary
Matalin'' show on the America's Voice Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have to tell you we do them just as much as the
Democrats.''

SARAZEN AN ENDURING HERO OF GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was best known for one incredible golf shot, but the
greatness of Gene Sarazen should be measured by his many triumphs
and unmatched dignity.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a collective conscience in the game, flags on all
pins throughout the land today would be lowered, for the sport must
bid farewell to one of its enduring heroes. Sarazen, 97, died
Thursday in Naples, Fla., from complications of pneumonia and in
all corners of the golf world, the pain is felt. ``You hate to lose
people like him, because you lose such a part of the game,'' said
course architect Rees Jones. ``And the game just ain't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is right. But if those of us who never had the
pleasure of meeting Sarazen are saddened, imagine the heartache
felt by those who knew The Squire not as the ceremonial starter of
the Masters, dressed in his trademark knickers, but as a consummate
gentleman with a stern, competitive spirit. ``It is sad news,''
said Herbert Warren Wind, whose eloquent prose about this great
game appeared for years in The New Yorker and has never been
equaled. ``He was a great friend. Gene had a sense of standards. I
really think the best way to present Gene is to say he had brains
and enough insight to know to stay in shape and pick really fine
people as friends and model himself after them.''
</P>
<P>
   We study history as children, then toss it aside as we grow up
and chase a string of tomorrows. So perhaps we need to be reminded
that the men of hickory and Gutta-percha were skilled athletes,
too, that golfers were not invented by television or nurtured by
irrigation systems. Gene Sarazen played the game long before money
soiled it and his achievements are a testament to his
determination.
</P>
<P>
   If he were a rare athlete to whom success came early _ Sarazen
won both the US Open and PGA Championship in 1922 when he was 20
and earned another PGA title in 1923 _ so, too, was this
5-foot-5-inch son of a carpenter a patient soul who never quit. For
a period of nearly eight years, Sarazen played poorly in the
majors &UR;  &LR; or made bad mistakes when he did challenge, the cause being
a nasty hook he could not solve. When he finally did, he was 30
years old and in the next five years he would win a second US Open,
a third PGA, the British Open, and that monumental event at Augusta
National in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   It was called the ``Annual Invitation Tournament'' back then,
but Sarazen's second shot to the par-5 15th in the final round went
a long way in turning it into The Masters. The 4-wood from 220
yards rolled into the cup, a double-eagle, and became the most
famous shot in the sport's history thanks in part to the playoff he
got into and won over Craig Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular shot,'' Sarazen would always say, ``but
it was just a piece of luck. They forget the championships I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Only if they are ignorant; for Sarazen is one of four golfers
(Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player being the others) to win
all four of the majors. And, in this year of the Ryder Cup, let us
pause to recall that Sarazen was the last living member of that
1927 inaugural event in Worcester, Mass. Nor should we overlook
another remarkable aspect of Sarazen's golf career, that being the
polished play he exhibited as he aged so gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, for instance, he was 38 and semiretired when he lost a
US Open playoff to Lawson Little at Canterbury GC in Cleveland.
Seven years later, Sarazen beat Sam Snead, then the game's dominant
player, in a second-round match of the PGA Championship. The next
year in that event, Sarazen lost to Ben Hogan on the 36th hole in
the third round. At age 56, he finished in a tie for 16th at the
British Open and in 1963, the 61-year-old Sarazen made the cut at
the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was the 1973 British Open at Royal Troon
in western Scotland. Sarazen, then 71, had been extended a special
invitation by the Royal &AMP; Ancient and their wisdom paid off with a
priceless golf memory _ he aced the infamous Postage Stamp par-3
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect stroke of great fortune for a man who was
brought into this world with not a lick of it.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Italian immigrants, Eugenio Saraceni was born in 1902
in Harrison, N.Y., and raised during a time of great hardship, the
likes of which few of us can fathom. ``He was from such an ordinary
family, but he was such a classy man,'' said Wind. ``He was one of
the only players I knew to come from such a family of immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   To help support the family, Sarazen worked numerous odd jobs,
but one of them turned his life around. He was toting golf bags at
the Apawamis Club in Rye, N.Y., in 1913 when a former caddie from
Brookline, Mass. named Francis Ouimet shocked the golf world by
winning the US Open. ``If he can win it, so can I,'' thought
Sarazen, and he immediately changed his grip to the interlocking
style favored by Ouimet.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Sarazen and Ouimet would become close friends and if
they were separated by nearly 20 years, they were brought together
by their love of golf and a common decency that is found in only
the rarest of those special people. ``Please write that,'' said
Wind, ``for they were great friends and great, great men.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen was a true treasure, an athlete who captured a nation's
attention when Ruth was king and still gripped our sporting spirit
every April when he would unleash that classic swing to start the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was doing his autobiography (in the 1940s),'' said
Wind, ``I spent six or seven weeks with him at his farm in
Germantown, N.Y. He always had his feet on the ground. He told me,
`If my game ever disappears, I will have this farm still going for
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His game did fade away, though fortunately for us, he didn't. At
least not for a long, delightful, and very rewarding time.

WAL-MART DECIDES AGAINST SELLING EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has decided not to sell an emergency
contraceptive approved last year for sale in the United States and
widely available in drugstores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company stated in a letter to Planned Parenthood that it had
made a ``business decision'' not to fill prescriptions for Preven,
which stops ovulation and may prevent fertilized eggs from becoming
implanted in the uterus. The drug, manufactured by Gynetics Inc. of
Somerville, N.J., is recommended for use up to 72 hours after
unprotected sex and is sometimes called a ``morning after'' pill.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wal-Mart declined repeated requests for more information
about its decision, Planned Parenthood said it suspected the policy
might have stemmed from pressure from people who say life begins
the moment an egg is fertilized. Anti-abortion groups have not,
however, singled out Preven for attack, as they did with RU-486, an
abortion pill that is illegal in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is the nation's fifth-largest distributor of
pharmaceuticals, with a strong presence in the South, and has
pharmacies in more than 2,428 of its 2,450 stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to a two-sentence statement: ``At this time Wal-Mart
has made the business decision not to sell Preven. However, in the
interest of serving and meeting the needs of our customers, our
pharmacists will refer any request for this product to a pharmacy
that does carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug is being sold in other major retail chains and discount
stores, including Walgreens, Rite Aid and Kmart. Sales are
relatively small, estimated at $10 million this year, though
Gynetics, a private company, declined to release figures.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the decision represents little lost business for
Wal-Mart. But Planned Parenthood worries that in some markets,
particularly small towns where Wal-Mart has little competition,
women may have difficulty getting the drug elsewhere quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Preven, which costs about $20 for four pills that are taken two
at a time over 12 hours, is a high-dose birth control medication.
The drug, which the manufacturer says is 98 percent effective,
usually has only mild side effects, which include nausea, dizziness
and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   For decades doctors have instructed women to take high doses of
regular birth control pills as emergency contraception. But Preven
is the first birth control medication to be marketed specifically
for that use.
</P>
<P>
   It is not to be confused with RU-486, which can be used within
49 days of unprotected sex to induce an abortion and is legal in
Europe and in China. RU-486 requires repeat visits to a doctor and
has been associated with some serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike RU-486, Preven does not work if a fertilized egg has
already been implanted in the uterus. Even so, Pro-Life America,
Protestants Against Birth Control and Pharmacists for Life
International say they oppose Preven because they consider it to
work by prompting an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike RU-486, however, Preven was not the target of widespread
opposition, and some anti-abortion groups, including the Right To
Life Committee, do not take a stance on it at all. But as the drug
has hit store shelves, some groups have issued statements opposing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies for Life International, for instance, says it had
expressed its concerns about the drug to Wal-Mart and applauded the
chain for not selling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concur with Wal-Mart on that decision,'' said Lloyd J.
DuPlantis Jr., president of the group, which said it has 1,500
member pharmacists, though he said his group was not the catalyst
for the Wal-Mart ban.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Wal-Mart's reasoning, the policy has confused the
drug's manufacturer and angered women's health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Planned Parenthood Federation of America expressed outrage
over the decision by Wal-Mart, saying the company ``deserts women
faced with reproductive health emergencies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood's New York affiliate has been one of the most
outspoken critics and has alerted women through newsletters about
Wal-Mart's policy. It has also asked Aetna/US Healthcare, which
provides insurance to Planned Parenthood's employees, to find
another prescription-by-mail service, now provided by Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is unacceptable from a women's health point of
view'' for Wal-Mart pharmacies not to carry the drug,'' said
Alexander C. Sanger, president of Planned Parenthood of New York
City. ``Wal-Mart pharmacies are licensed by the states in which
they operate and are thereby part of the public health system, and
we believe it is incumbent upon them to have available this
time-sensitive medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Wal-Mart refuses to sell other prescription
medications, Jessica Moser, a company spokeswoman, said that she
could not discuss specific products, but ``it is not practical
given the sheer volume to carry every one of them.'' The company
does carry birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is a leading pharmacy
chain, trailing only CVS, Walgreen, Eckerd and Rite Aid, according
to Drug Store News. As such, the retailer has an obligation not to
withhold drugs that doctors have decided its customers need, said
Marie Griffin, editor of the trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not get involved in the sacred relationship
between a physician and patient,'' Ms. Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists for Life International disagrees, saying there are
times when pharmacies should not dispense medication. ``First of
all, our position is that in general a pharmacist has a right to
refuse to fill a prescription,'' said DuPlantis, the group's
president. ``Regarding Preven, based on the way we feel that life
begins at fertilization, it's an abortifacient mechanism.''
Therefore, Wal-Mart, he said, should not sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Gynetics said that Preven does not cause abortions but simply
prevents pregnancy. Roderick Mackenzie, the company's chairman,
said that the product had been better received by major drugstore
and discount chains than initially expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have every piece of business available in the
world,'' Mackenzie said, ``but I'm realistic.''

GOP OFFERS REVAMPED GUN-CONTROL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearing political fallout from angry voters, Senate
Republicans reversed course Thursday, introducing a package of
gun-control restrictions and embracing a measure they had rejected
only 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate Thursday adopted a ban on high-capacity
ammunition clips, a provision that had been defeated a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Senators are scheduled to vote Friday on the GOP package, which
some Democrats called a ``sham,'' as part of the a bill that would
toughen prosecution of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., the measure has become a forum for debating gun
control, with the Clinton administration proposals such mesures as
raising the legal age for gun ownership to 21 from 18 and holding
parents criminally liable for giving their children access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night whether Thursday's Republican
proposals represent a strategic retreat that will enable the GOP to
claim progress on gun-control while forestalling broader changes,
or whether public pressure will carry other Clinton-backed measures
to passage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the Republican reversal was an indication
that the Colorado shootings have for the moment galvanized public
opinion, shifted the political debate in favor of tighter
restrictions on firearms, and created concerns about how potent an
issue gun control may become in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   It also may signal a weakening of the powerful gun lobby, the
National Rifle Association, which launched an intensive lobbying
effort this weak to counter gun-control groups, whicgh also were
out in force on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders decided to reverse course after a group of
senators indicated they were unhappy with a measure approved
Wednesday, which established a system of voluntary background
checks on firearms sales by private dealers at gun shows. Such
checks are mandatory on sales by licensed firearms dealers, and
Democrats had proposed closing this so-called loophole to include
gun show sales between private persons. Two guns used by the
Columbine students during their shooting spree were bought at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary system was proposed by Senator Larry Craig, an
Idaho Republican and NRA board member, and also would change how
the background-check rules apply to pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just woke up unhappy at what we had done,'' said Senator
Gordon Smith, Republican of Oregon, who said he would try to change
his vote. ``I had been under the impression, perhaps mistaken, that
we would have an amendment that closed the gun show loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who made their concerns known to Craig and to
party leaders included moderate Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, both of Maine. It also included Arizona Senator John
McCain, a presidential candidate who, Democrats speculated, might
be worried about the political potency of the issue as the election
year approaches.

LED BY IBM, DOW AND S&AMP;P SET NEW RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices mostly advanced Thursday, buoyed by
economic reports that pushed down long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But while two of the main gauges, the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, reached new
highs, the bulk of their gains came from a spectacular 20{-point
leap in IBM shares after the company's chairman said the computer
giant was getting about one-quarter of its revenue from
Internet-related business.
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue finished at a record of 246 and accounted for 87
percent of the Dow's rise of 106.82 points and nearly two-thirds of
the 3.56-point rise in the S&AMP;P 500. The stock has now soared 43
percent since announcing April 21 that first-quarter earnings far
surpassed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished up 1 percent, to 11,107.19, while the S&AMP;P 500
rose 0.3 percent, to 1,367.56.
</P>
<P>
   A second outsized winner was J.P. Morgan, which jumped 7|, to
146} after traders began recirculating a month-old report by a
Dillon Read analyst suggesting that the bank, which until recently
has been bedeviled by weak earnings, was vulnerable to a takeover
and might be bought during the next year. But people close to
Morgan's senior management said a sale was highly unlikely because
the bank's board wanted to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an afternoon sell-off in Internet and other
high-technology stocks left the NASDAQ composite index with a loss
of 24.54 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,582.00. The index, breaking a
string of four straight gains, now stands 70 points below its
record close of 2,652.05 on April 26. Analysts said the market was
relieved that a government report showed inflation still well in
check, with little sign that an upturn in oil prices was rippling
through the economy. With further encouragement from slower growth
of retail sales in April, interest rates retreated by as much as
one-tenth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was the extremely favorable data as far as
inflation was concerned,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. ``Bonds were very oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is scheduled to report Friday on inflation at the
consumer level. Barring a significant surprise, the Federal Reserve
is expected to leave interest rates alone at its meeting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the central bank are keeping a close eye on the
stock and bond markets, with Fed Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin, saying
that ``someone's being very optimistic about earnings to want to
pay those prices'' in reference to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow's big gain Thursday, achieved despite 15 of its 30
components being down, the blue-chip average has advanced 21
percent so far this year compared with 11.25 percent for the S&AMP;P
500 and 17.8 percent for NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sessions, neither growth stocks nor those sensitive
to the business cycle stood out as a group. Yet the violent
rotation into cyclicals this spring has clearly wound down, with
many analysts contending that stocks like Alcoa and Minnesota
Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which have enjoyed huge run-ups, have
little further potential.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Mining was the Dow's biggest loser Thursday, shedding
2 15/16, to 90 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs was one of the solid sectors Thursday, with Lilly up 2
7/16, to 78~; Pfizer up 2 1/16, to 117 13/16, and Merck up 1 7/16,
to 73. Some bank stocks besides Morgan also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly weak, with Amazon.com down 6
15/16, to 136. Ebay fell 6\, to 192{; Intel dropped 2 7/16, to 60
1/16; America Online sank 5 13/16, to 132|, and EMC fell 5 5/16, to
105 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   In an initial offering, Copper Mountain Networks, a company in
Palo Alto, Calif., whose products provide access to the Internet
over telephone lines, posted the 10th-biggest first-day gain on
record. It offered 4 million shares at 21, with trading starting at
63 and ending at 68 7/16.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's search for help at the point-guard position
continued Thursday when the Trojans signed junior college transfer
Rashad Jones of San Jose Community College to a national letter of
intent.
</P>
<P>
   Jones attended San Jose CC the past two seasons. He averaged
15.7 points, 6.0 assists and 3.1 steals last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2 Jones will serve as the backup to sophomore Brandon
Granville. USC will also add a walk-on point guard in the fall,
Ryan Miller of New Albany, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   USC has one scholarship available. The Trojans previously signed

 How to Become A Telecommuter
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm 66, with arthritis and hearing loss. I'd like to get
a job that involves working at home on my computer but that doesn't
require any telephone work. I assume there are a lot of clerical
opportunities that would fit this bill. However, I'm having trouble
finding lists of big national companies that employ telecommuters
like me. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Telecommuting may sound like a perfect solution but,
frankly, it's going to be hard to find the kind of job you're
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's telecommuters are people who started out in an
office and over time persuaded their boss that they were dependable
enough to telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare for companies to hire telecommuters from
outside: They're almost always selected from the current
workforce,'' said Gil Gordon, a New Jersey telecommuting consultant
with a helpful Web site at  &LR; www.gilgordon.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   There also aren't any good lists of companies that employ
at-home clerical workers. In fact, you should think twice before
joining up with some firms that actively advertise for home-based
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, they're just disguised PC sales operations,''
Gordon said. ``They require you to buy a computer from them before
getting any work. Any venture that requires you to lay out money _
to buy a PC, for instance, or a business kit _ is probably a
scam.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for big national employers, try thinking
locally.
</P>
<P>
   Check the Yellow Pages for local companies that provide services
such as data processing or transcription. Also check the
help-wanted ads in your local newspaper for firms seeking data
entry workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these firms may be willing to let you work at home. But
you'll improve your chances if you're a little flexible about where
you work. For instance, employers may want you to spend your first
few weeks working out of their main office. Or they may want you to
come into the office once a week for meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is starting your own business. You can market
your clerical services to small businesses that have more
data-entry work than their current office staff can handle. The
drawback is that running a business takes constant marketing and
hustle, as well as a lot of record-keeping _ perhaps more effort
than you're willing to put in at this point in your life.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Red Flags
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work at a health care facility, where we insert credit
card-style time cards into a clock each morning. The clock
automatically deducts a half hour for lunch each day, even though
we often have no break due to short staffing. We're not given any
written record of our hours, and when we get our checks, they are
always short a few hours. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: No, it's not legal. In fact, your situation raises a
number of legal red flags:
</P>
<P>
   _Federal and state laws require employees to be paid for all the
hours they actually work. By not paying you for those lunch hours
that you spend working, this company is breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   _California employers are required to give workers a meal break
after five hours of work. In some circumstances employees can waive
their right to a meal break _ but they must do so in writing. It
sounds like your employer is violating the state labor code by
having people work through lunch on a routine basis.
</P>
<P>
   _California also requires employers to indicate total hours
worked on the paycheck stubs of hourly workers. If your firm isn't
tallying your hours on your pay stub, that's another violation.
</P>
<P>
   You should politely inform management of these potential legal
problems. Not only is the company treating you badly, it's putting
itself in serious financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California Labor Commissioner could do an audit of the
past three years, and this company could end up having to pay a lot
of back wages and penalties,'' warned Ralph Yanello, CEO of Lexcom,
an employment law advisory service in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   If management refuses to retool its pay practices and give you
the back wages you are owed, call the labor commissioner's office
at (415) 557-7878. Or call the Employment Law Center, which offers
free legal advice to low-income workers at (415) 864-8208.
</P>
<P>
   Buyout Game
</P>
<P>
   Q: The company my wife works for is being bought out. Some
employees including my wife will be rehired by the new company.
They've been told that their 401(k) plan will be frozen for 60
days, with no additions or withdrawals allowed. At the end of those
60 days, my wife can roll over her proceeds into the new company's
401(k) plan or an IRA. Is this standard procedure? Just what are
the rules in buyouts when both companies have 401(k) plans?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: This sounds pretty typical. Companies facing a merger
have two options for their 401(k) plans, according to David Peckman
of 401k CQ  &LR; Forum, an investment advisory service in San Francisco.
They can:
</P>
<P>
   _Terminate one of the plans and allow employees the option of
moving their funds into the other plan. (It sounds like this is
what your wife's firm is doing.)
</P>
<P>
   _Integrate the two plans. One plan ends and employee funds are
moved automatically into similar investments in the other plan _
from one small-cap mutual fund to another, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, it's not unusual to have a blackout period
ranging from 30 days to three months when employees can't touch
their 401(k) money. That's to give the plan administrators time to
handle all the paperwork involved with the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 60-day freeze is very common when moving over to a new
(401(k) management) company,'' said Cari Kaye, a spokeswoman for
Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   After the blackout period, your wife should be able to choose to
move her funds into the new firm's 401(k) or into an IRA, without
any tax penalty. She can also take the money out in cash _ but
would face stiff tax penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Want more info on 401(k) procedures? Some useful Web sites are
the one run by 401k Forum at  &LR; www.401kafe.com &LR;  and the one run by
Fidelity at  &LR; www.fidelityatwork.com/401k &LR;   &LR; /about/about.htm. &LR;  Or

`TEA WITH MUSSOLINI' A STORY OF DIVERSE CHARACTERS IN DIFFICULT
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to throw stones at the historical accuracy of a
private memoir when it's transferred to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Fred Zinnemann's 1977 ``Julia,'' adapted from
Lillian Hellman's memoir, ``Pentimento.'' Literary critics scoffed
at the truthfulness of Hellman's ``selective memory.'' ``Julia''
told of Hellman's beloved childhood friend, a rich, brilliant woman
who became a resistance fighter during World War II. The tale told
of a courageous plan that Hellman undertook at Julia's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' is much in that same vein. Its
76-year-old
</P>
<P>
   director, Franco Zeffirelli (``La Traviata,'' ``Romeo and
Juliet''), creates a lovely, perfectly composed and lyrical look at
life under Mussolini's black-shirted fascist regime. But despite
danger on every corner in Italy, there is a tinge of rose-colored
sentiment that blurs the events yet lends to the making of an
affecting dramatic period piece.
</P>
<P>
   Florence in 1935 was a place of great culture. It was a magnet
for English and American expatriates eager to soak up its art,
architecture and rural beauty. For the ``Scorpioni,'' a group of
colorful ladies, Italy is also home. It is here they have settled,
having tea sharply at four, and working for Italian employers
desiring the ``English experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Luca, abandoned by his father and orphaned by his mother,
is taken under their collective wing. They give him an education in
manners _ until Mussolini aligns with Hitler and the women become
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   A ritualistic act of bravery must take place in order for Luca
to realize how courageous and unique are the women _ played by
Cher, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli uses Luca as his third eye and his character is the
least developed and motivated. He's used as an observer and
narrator of the action. Consequently, we're sometimes left on the
outside with Luca as well. Recent Oscar winner Dench is demure and
low-key and Plowright and Smith are wonderfully brittle and
self-deluded. They both make an interior journey that adds
dimension and resonance to their roles. Cher is Elsa, the pivotal
object of desire, who is instrumental in Luca's self-education, and
Tomlin is the comic relief _ an outrageously butch archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse characters and the beauty of the landscape combine
to make a movie that veers away from cloying preciousness. Nor does
Zeffirelli get high-handed or pass judgment about political
wrongdoing. He wisely allows his story to unfold without letting us
forget that this is, above all, not a chronicle of Italy's war
crimes but a loving, gorgeous recollection of women who existed in
an extreme time and in a place where the line between life and
death was very thin.
</P>
<P>
   Tea With Mussolini. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli. Written by
John Mortimer, Zeffirelli. Cast: Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright,
Maggie Smith, Lily Tomlin. MGM. 116 minutes. Rated PG for sexual
content.

 Fund Manager Tells Why It May Be Time to Move Into Small Caps
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Given that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index set yet another record
high yesterday, maybe now is the time to shift some S&AMP;P 500 assets
into index funds that track bigger universes of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, S&AMP;P 500 index funds have been world-beaters the past
few years. Just ask any active portfolio manager who has been
eating the S&AMP;P 500's dust.
</P>
<P>
   But history tells us that no sector can dominate a rally
forever, and eventually, some other group of stocks is likely to
take the lead if this bull run is going to continue into the next
millennium. That's why it might be wise to rebalance your portfolio
to include some other index funds that mirror the broader stock
market, says Dick Shelton, president of the California Investment
Trust Fund Group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   With so many investors placing most of their eggs in the S&AMP;P 500
basket, ``they are bound to be underinvested'' in the broader
market, says Shelton, whose fund complex runs nine no-load mutual
funds, including one that mirrors the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the stock market may continue to go up, but
there is no guarantee that every investor will benefit from the
rise because they could be too narrowly focused on the S&AMP;P 500 and
not adequately invested in smaller stocks and foreign markets,
Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top 50 stocks or so in the S&AMP;P 500 account for nearly
half of the entire index's weighted value, which means that many of
these stocks could be overvalued and may run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are hundreds of cheap small- and mid-cap stocks
that have been racking up consistent earnings, but their stock
prices continue to sit idle, Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Wall Street will start buying these stocks, and
the average investor may miss the train out of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings estimates for small and midsize companies are far
better than those for the S&AMP;P 500 and other large-cap stocks.
(Plus), the actual earnings are coming in much stronger than
earlier anticipated,'' Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at the numbers. The S&AMP;P 500 index is
expensive, trading at 24.3 times forward-looking earnings estimates
for 1999, according to IBES International, a New York research firm
that tallies earnings estimates by financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; By comparison, the S&AMP;P MidCap 400 index _ a basket of 400
midsize stocks _ is considerably cheaper, with a price-earnings
ratio of 18.3. And the S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 index _ a basket of 600
smaller stocks _ is an even better bargain, trading at 17.9.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is likely to continue. Earnings for S&AMP;P MidCap 400
companies are expected to grow 22.8 percent a year over the next
five years, and S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 stocks are estimated to rack up
about 18.2 percent in annual earnings growth during the same
period, according to IBES.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with the S&AMP;P 500 companies _ whose earnings are
projected to rise just 12.8 percent a year _ and the littler guys
are starting to look pretty darn attractive, Shelton argues.
</P>
<P>
   With the small-cap indexes, ``you get an earnings double in less
than four years. That's pretty strong stuff,'' Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, small- and mid-cap stocks have been left on the
sidelines during the past four or five years. One of the primary
arguments as to why is the fact that many of these smaller
companies have equally small floats _ meaning that they don't have
a lot of shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   That can make their stocks illiquid, making it difficult for
institutional money managers to amass big stakes and find buyers
for their shares when they are ready to unload them.
</P>
<P>
   However, with such rosy earnings projections, Shelton contends,
the big guns on Wall Street can't ignore smaller stocks forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fundamental. You're going to find some buyers,'' Shelton
says. Of course, in addition to an S&AMP;P 500 fund, California
Investment Trust manages an S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 index fund and an S&AMP;P
MidCap 400 Index. So here is Shelton's pitch: By owning all three
funds, an investor would own approximately 88 percent of of the
entire U.S. stock market on a market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if stock pickers finally rotate out of big-caps into the
littler guys, investors in all three funds should not miss the next
stage of the bull rally &LR;   &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; presuming there will be one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, value will win out. Over the course of history, it
always has,'' Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   The fund group president presents a compelling case. Perhaps
investors can't afford not to heed his words.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SEE YA: &LR;  This is my last column for The Chronicle before I leave to
become the technology columnist for Barron's. I just want to thank
the owners, publisher and editors of the paper for giving me the
opportunity to write Street Smarts. As I said before, it has been a
privilege to write in this space about money and the people who
help us make, manage and lose it. I can honestly say I've never had
more fun in journalism. It's been a blast.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have I enjoyed so much interaction with everyday readers
of the paper. Although some of you did not always agree with my
thinking or even like me, seldom was there a dull moment. You kept
me honest, and for that I am grateful.
</P>
<P>
   My predecessor, Herb Greenberg (who like me is a Crain's Chicago
Business alum, by the way), helped put The Chronicle's business
section on the national map with his must-read column. I hope that
during my short time here I was able to build on that success. May
the tradition continue.

 Gap Reports Record Profits, But Stock Dips
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Shares of Gap Inc. dipped yesterday despite record earnings that
exceeded analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Gap announced that earnings for the first
quarter of 1999, which ended May 1, hit a record $202 million, a 49
percent jump against the same quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share tallied 34 cents, compared to a consensus
estimate of 31 cents among analysts polled by Zacks Investment
Research. But Gap's stock edged down 19 cents to close at $62.06.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly revenues rose 32 percent to $2.28 billion while sales
at stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, rose a
healthy 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Postol, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, said investors
became nervous after Gap's April sales came in lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year this company couldn't do anything wrong and now
everybody is hanging on every little negative thing,'' said Postol.
``This is the first concern that has popped up in this company in
quite some time, and the markets don't like uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap's shares fell 7.4 percent last Thursday after it said
same-store sales in April rose 1 percent, its smallest gain in
almost two years. Analysts had forecast a gain of as much as 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer was hurt by the Gap chain, where same-store sales
declined about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For all of last quarter, same-store sales rose approximately 5
percent at the Gap chain. They fell about 2 percent at GapKids, and
rose about 21 percent at Old Navy and 13 percent at Banana
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales were hurt by a comparison against April 28,
when they jumped 29 percent. Also, most Easter shopping occurred in
March, rather than April, this year, said Postol.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gap was forced to mark down some prices in April,
something it rarely had to do last year, its markdown levels were
typical of most retailers, said Postol.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Gap stock's failure to rise on the good news
is that its shares are considered pricey. It has the third highest
market capitalization among U.S. retailers, exceeded only by
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Postol expects Gap to generate profits this year of $1 billion
on sales of more than $11 billion.

 Assemblyman Wants First Phone Overlay Put on Hold
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
State Assemblyman Wally Knox asked California regulators yesterday
to halt the state's first area code ``overlay'' in the 310 region
of West Los Angeles, saying phone companies have not proven it's
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The overlay _ designed to address a shortage of phone numbers in
the region _ went into effect in the 310 region on April 17,
forcing all residents in that area to dial 1 plus the area code and
phone number for every call. After July 17, new phone customers in
the 310 region will get 424 as their area code.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Utilities Commission approved the overlay at
the request of the telecommunications industry, which said it was
running out of available phone numbers in the region. Phone
companies also complained of a similar number shortage in the Bay
Area and overlays are now planned for the 408, 415, 510 and 650
area codes. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But Knox, D-Los Angeles, told the PUC yesterday that he doesn't
believe there is actually an area code crunch. He said there are
more than 145 million telephone numbers in the state that have been
assigned to phone companies but are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   While Knox's frustrated constituents may dislike the overlay,
industry experts said there's little chance that the plan could be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at 11:57 here,'' said Natalie Billingsley, a
telecommunications expert at the PUC. ``It's not the absolute last
second, but it's pretty close to being too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers in West Los Angeles have been dialing 11 digits for
almost a month and companies have reprogrammed their switches to
recognize the 424 area code when it goes into effect. Changing all
that would be costly and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley said halting the overlay may also violate FCC rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FCC ruled that state commissions may not delay
area code changes just because they are unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you yank the overlay back now, you may run afoul of the FCC
rules,'' Billingsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Knox told the PUC that telephone companies should be forced to
disclose how many phone numbers they have and how many are in use
before consumers are inconvenienced with an overlay.
</P>
<P>
   He has a bill pending in the Assembly that would force the phone
companies to provide the PUC with this information _ something they
currently are not legally required to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Once the state knows how many phone numbers are actually in use,
the PUC could force phone companies to return any unused numbers so
they could be given to other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Until phone companies supply that data, Knox said, the state
should refuse to allow an overlay.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would also change the way phone numbers are assigned so
that unused numbers could be doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, phone numbers are assigned in blocks of 10,000,
regardless of how many customers a company has. So even if a phone
company has only 300 customers, it still must request 10,000
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 150 phone companies operating in California and
requesting new phone numbers, the supply of available numbers in
each area code has dwindled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Knox's bill would require that numbers be assigned in blocks of
1,000 instead of 10,000. Several groups, including the Federal
Communications Commission and a state coalition, are looking into
better ways to assign phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an arcane regulatory structure that hasn't kept up
with reality and it wreaks havoc on the lives of the rest of us,''
Knox said. ``I'm creating as much pressure as I can to have the
system changed as fast as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   While his bill would not specifically ban overlays, it would
lead to fewer area code changes in the future because the supply of
available phone numbers would not be exhausted as quickly. Since
his bill would force phone companies to pool their unused numbers
and return them, there would be more phone numbers to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Only one overlay has ever been halted. In 1995, state regulators
stopped an overlay in Houston several months after it began because
they felt it was too disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rules on area codes were different at that time and
state regulators were not responsible for approving area code
changes. Instead, the local phone company, SBC Communications,
implemented the overlay.
</P>
<P>
   The state then implemented an area code split, but six months
later, it reimplemented the overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very long, protracted, contested proceeding,'' said
Linda Hymans, a utility analyst with the Texas public utilities
commission.

VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY DEFENDS BLOOD-SPLATTERING ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The video game industry opened its annual trade
show here Thursday in a mood part defiant and part defensive about
accusations that violent video games contributed to the high school
shootings last month in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry has no reason to run and hide,''
said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, the trade group that runs the show and
represents most of the major game manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at which every question was related to
video game violence, Lowenstein said: ``The evidence does not exist
to support a link between playing violent video games and community
mass murder. Video games don't teach people to hate. Video games
don't teach people to become Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a joystick, he added, ``And if you get good at using
one of these controllers, it doesn't make you a marksman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lowenstein and other executives, while saying they had a
free-speech right to make violent games, said they would make
greater efforts to inform parents about the industry's rating
system for games and to make sure retailers enforce the ratings and
do not sell inappropriate games to minors. Executives also said
they would tone down some advertisements, which reach children even
if the games themselves are rated as not appropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the word `kill' comes out of the vocabulary,'' said
Phillip G. Adam, vice president for business development at
Interplay Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Interplay Productions, based in Irvine, Calif., makes the game
Carmaggedon, in which virtual motorists rack up points by running
down pedestrians, a pursuit that a company ad said was ``as easy as
killing babies with axes.'' An advertisement for its new game
Kingpin, Life of Crime notes that players can ``target specific
body parts and see the damage done _ including exit wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For the video game industry, the timing of this year's
Electronic Entertainment Exposition is perhaps unfortunate, though
not as unfortunate as that of the National Rifle Association, whose
annual convention took place recently in Denver, less than two
weeks after and only miles away from the Littleton shootings, which
ended in the death of 15 people, including the two teen-age gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Because the gunmen were said to have been avid players of the
shooting video game Doom, the video industry is under attack from
all sides, like a player in one of its games. On Wednesday, the
Senate voted to authorize studies of the effects of violent video
games and of whether the entertainment industry is marketing
violence to youngsters. Several states are considering legislation
to ban or regulate violent games.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the families of three girls killed in a 1997 school
shooting in Paducah, Ky., filed suit against numerous video game
and other entertainment companies, asserting that violent media
influenced the killer, a high school freshman named Michael
Carneal. Similar suits are possible from Colorado, raising the
possibility that the industry will face litigation similar to that
faced by cigarette and gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rifle association's convention, which was cut short
and drew thousands of protesters, the video game expo has not drawn
demonstrators and will run its full three days. There seemed to be
plenty of violent games among the 1,900 new ones being shown here.
The Los Angeles Convention Center was a huge cacophony of on-screen
kung-fu fights, fearsome gun battles, blaring explosions and car
crashes. Signs outside said that ``absolutely no one under 18''
would be admitted to the show, which is not open to the public in
any case.
</P>
<P>
   Many exhibitors said that although they are sensitive to
concerns arising from the Colorado shootings, they did not change
their planned exhibits, or their long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we haven't taken guns out of any games,'' said
Mike McGarvey, chief operating officer of Eidos Interactive, a
British game maker whose booth had a big sign with the slogan ``Go
to War.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many visitors tried out Quake III Arena, the latest game from
the Id Software, the company that made Doom. Like Doom, Quake III
is what the industry calls a first-person shooter, in which there
is no character on the screen representing the player. Only the
player's gun is visible, at the bottom of the screen. As the
shooter fires, bodies splatter into pieces in a sea of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Todd S. Hollenshead, Id's chief executive, said there was no
reason to alter the company's display. ``I don't think pretending
it's Tickle Me Elmo is going to fool anyone for very long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollenshead, 30, said that just because Doom was not responsible
for the Littleton shooting just because the gunmen might have
played it. ``There's probably 20 million other people who love Doom
as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was some caution. Activision, a leading game
company, did not display its Soldier of Fortune game on the show
floor, although it was said to be available in a back room. One
chief executive of a game company has begun consulting
psychologists to inform himself about the research linking games
and violent behavior. Many executives would not comment on the
issue, citing the lawsuit against them.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America, said the video
game industry was being attacked by politicians because it was a
new industry without strong political connections. ``The gun lobby
is pretty powerful so politicians are not going to attack guns,''
Lincoln added, noting that on Wednesday the Senate rejected new gun
control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that there have been few studies so far done on
whether video games contribute to violent behavior and that the
answer is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein, the trade association official, said more than half
of frequent video game players are adults and 90 percent of the
games are purchased by adults. He also said 70 percent of the games
rated over the last five years are rated suitable for children.
Only two of the top selling games last year were rated M for
mature, meaning for those 17 and above. said, ``first-person
shooters'' accounted for only 6 percent of the market last year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some movement away from gratuitous violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, eschewing violence can be risky. Nintendo several years
ago came out with a tame version of Mortal Kombat while Sega
continued to sell the original, ultra-gory version. ``We got
creamed in the marketplace and got letters from parents saying we
were censors,''' Lincoln of Nintendo said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Tapscott, a consultant and author who was the keynote
speaker, said video games were being made a scapegoat for more
complex ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ban video games, I suppose,'' Tapscott said, ``though
doing something about poverty is a little more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But after defending games, he called on the industry to turn its
attention to educational software and to ``shape the industry for
the common good.''

MILOSEVIC REFUSES TO SEE TOP U.N. RIGHTS OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, was frustrated in her aim to ask Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic about his government's human rights
record when he refused to see her here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson, the former president of Ireland and the United
Nations' high-profile campaigner for human rights since 1997, met
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and went to Nis to inspect
damage to a residential area that NATO bombs caused.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson denounced all civilian casualties in the war, but
reserved her strongest language for the ``devastating pattern of
ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. She placed the responsibility
squarely on Milosevic and the Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also voiced her concern about NATO's using cluster bombs
near civilian areas and the resulting civilian casualties. The NATO
campaign, Ms. Robinson added, should attack only military targets.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour that included surrounding countries, Ms. Robinson
was in no doubt where the main guilt lay. ``People in uniform are
driving people from their homes and from Kosovo,'' she said at a
news conference. ``That is a responsibility of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not officers were under orders, she added, the
failure to stop them meant that the government was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav federal government must end immediately the
vicious human rights violations its army, police and paramilitary
forces are accused of in Kosovo and commit itself to an
unconditional and safe return of internally displaced persons,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Robinson questioned the need for NATO to
attack sites in civilian areas and public works.
</P>
<P>
   In her visit, Ms. Robinson was trying to tread a fine line
between the two sides in the conflict, but received little thanks.
Her visit and her intention to meet Milosevic, had already been
attack by other rights organizations, which said the trip would
send the wrong signal to a government that was acting against the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson replied that after having visited Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro and heard the accounts from refugees and
human rights teams, it was important to bring the cases to the
attention of those responsible.

FOR LANDON WILSON, DECISION TO PLAY HURT WAS EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ On Wednesday, many hours before the teams
dropped the puck for Game 3 against the Sabres, Bruins' coach Pat
Burns sat down with injured wing Landon Wilson and picked the
player's brain.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had been absent because of a separated shoulder suffered
in Game 4 against Carolina and he was close to returning. Burns let
Wilson know that with the absence of Sergei Samsonov due to an
injury and the prospect of having to struggle on offense even more
than they already had to, which was difficult for even the coach to
fathom, the Bruins needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Could he go, the coach wanted to know?
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, Burns is the type of coach to tell the player to
sit down another few days rather than risk losing him in the first
shift or any time in the first period and having a hole on the
bench the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson was needed. He said he felt that urgency from the
coach and answered the bell. Burns responded by installing Wilson
in Samsonov's spot with center Jason Allison and right wing Dmitri
Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   He played 20 shifts for a total of 16 minutes, 52 seconds and
performed well, even getting a painful test on the shoulder at
16:50 of the first period that knocked him out for a couple of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Willie and I had a long talk at the hotel and he said he felt
fine in the practices and I said there was going to be a certain
amount of pain involved no matter what,'' said Burns, recounting
his meeting with Wilson. ``Willie is different (than Samsonov). He
can bring something else to the table. He's a banger, he's a
crasher, he's a big man along the boards. He came over to the bench
one time and he was really wincing. Then I said, `(Trainer Donny
Del Negro), work on him,' and he rubbed it down and he finished the
game and (Thursday) he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson showed tremendous flair in the first three-plus games of
the Carolina series, playing the best hockey of his young career.
Then he was injured and it wasn't known how he would respond when
he was able to come back. Burns said he was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he brought something to that line, a physical
part,'' the coach said. ``He played through a little bit of hurt
and saw that it wasn't that bad. He was the guy on that line who
pressured the puck the most and that's what you have to do. When we
don't pressure the puck, we end up by backing up and then we lose
assignments. He's got a great shot. When he comes in on that
off-wing, he snaps it pretty good. He's physical and he has people
looking at him when he comes because he's a big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson potted the Bruins' first shot of the game, a nice wrister
from the right circle at 7:19 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard shot,'' said Wilson. ``It almost went between
(goalie Dominik) Hasek's legs. He even had trouble handling it. I
tried to stop for the rebound and poke it in. I didn't know Ally
was right beside me, otherwise I would've maybe thought of
passing.''
</P>
<P>
   He made some room for Khristich and Allison and though he had no
points to show for it, he played a strong game. It was his shot at
the end, with goalie Byron Dafoe pulled for an extra attacker late
in Game 3, that came the closest to tying it up before the Bruins
fell, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deflected,'' he said. ``I had a good shot and somehow
it went into the corner. It hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as Wilson thought he performed, he said he also felt
like the goat on Buffalo's third and winning goal, scored by Dixon
Ward at 9:38 of the third. Vaclav Varada was behind the Bruins'
net. It was his pass to a charging Ward that resulted in the
one-timer that beat Dafoe. Ward was Wilson's assignment and he
missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Varada) came from the other side,'' said Wilson. ``I didn't
want to chase him behind the net because then (Ray Bourque) would
be put in an awkward situation where he would have to go for him or
go for the high guy (Ward). I couldn't go behind the net so I tried
to go in front of the net and when I saw (Varada) come out, I tried
to go in front of the net and that's when I saw Dixon Ward coming
in. It all happened like that. It was my responsibility for that
high guy. Varada made a very nice pass. I had to go get the high
guy and I was a little late reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said if he had it to do over again, he wouldn't have
hesitated to go after Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go out and meet Dixon instead of going across and trying
to beat him,'' he said. ``I would've angled differently. I didn't
want to make a tough decision for Ray. I went across instead of
coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the young Bruins' team, this series is about learning
lessons and Wilson is one of those who's learning all of them, good
and bad. He learned about decision making in Game 3 and, with a lot
of support from his coach, he also learned about playing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be sore now; you just have to play through it,''
he said. ``I wanted to play. It was up to really myself, I guess.
Donny didn't think it was a good idea for me to come back so early
but I wanted to help out the team any way I could. I talked to
coach and it made me realize I do want to play and I'm going to get
the opportunity to play. I decided it was the right decision for
myself as well as the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said part of what made his decision easy was that he knew
he'd be put in a prime position -- playing with Allison and
Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat wanted me to get involved, be physical and hopefully
create some room for our skilled guys,'' Wilson said. ``It was just
an opportunity for myself to play with those two that really helped
me decide whether to play or not.''

FORD A HIT AT COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gadfly investor Evelyn Y. Davis called him King
William, and so he was: the heir to leadership of Ford Motor Co.,
William C. Ford Jr., took the stage Thursday to run the
family-controlled company's annual meeting for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is a 96-year-old dynasty of industrial America, but it used
information-age technology to introduce its 42-year-old chairman to
shareholders here and even to viewers in Times Square in New York
City, where the first 30 minutes of the annual meeting were
broadcast live on a giant TV screen Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a great-grandson of Henry Ford and the first Ford family
member to lead the company since his uncle Henry Ford II presided
over an annual meeting two decades ago, invoked the company's place
in American history then spoke of his plans.
</P>
<P>
   With that, he showed the mark of a new generation because he
tried to sell his company's shareholders on the business case for
social responsibility. ``We want to find ingenious new ways to
delight consumers, provide superior returns to shareholders and
make the world a better place for us all,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a link between shareholder returns and social
responsibility because recent Ford market research worldwide showed
that customers _ especially younger generations _ ``were demanding
corporate responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who became chairman on Jan. 1, said, ``We can do well for
employees, customers and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``we can do good for society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest any of Ford's owners be concerned the company was not
focusing enough on profits, Ford assured them that the board would
consider raising its dividend later this year and would also
consider a stock buyback as one way the company could lift its
``low'' price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5. Shares of Ford fell $1
Thursday, to $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   Stock buybacks are rare at Ford, however. Analysts say that is
because dividends benefit the Ford family but buybacks do not. The
Ford family owns a special class of stock that gives it 40 percent
of the votes at the company and does not want to cash in any of
that stock in a buyback because it would dilute family control.
</P>
<P>
   Ford steered clear of controversy as he led the meeting, held at
the Detroit Opera House, which Ford has helped restore. Indeed, the
gray-haired audience at the Ford shareholder meeting looked much
like the audience for Detroit's operas, and most who attended were
just as appreciative of a good performance, particularly by the
first Ford family member at the helm in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While a few shareholders voiced concerns about whether Ford was
doing enough for the environment, whether the company was promoting
older employees quick enough and even whether it was too hard to
hail a taxi here in the Motor City, most were adulatory, giving
Ford an advantage where other big companies are seen as faceless
global conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a person of his age, he did a very good job,'' Robert J.
Dersch, 81, of Royal Oak, Mich., said after the meeting. ``I
remember hearing his uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcel O. Taillieu, a Canadian shareholder and Ford buyer so
loyal he had his Winnipeg Ford dealer drive to Detroit with him,
said the Ford family connection made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada we have the royal family,'' he told the young Ford
chairman. ``America has the Fords.''

ANALYSIS: THE SHIFTING POLITICS OF GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich., Wash., Minn., Ariz., Mo.)  (See also CONGRESS-GUNS) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five years ago, when the Democrats lost their
majority in Congress, they felt they had paid dearly for backing a
ban on many kinds of assault weapons. But that was before a series
of school shootings culminated in the massacre at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo. And on Thursday there were strong signs
that both parties sense that the politics of guns and violence are
shifting.
</P>
<P>
   So as the Senate debated gun control for a second day, the
Republicans did an about-face and offered their own proposal to
require background checks for sales at gun shows, just a day after
killing a similar but tougher measure. The Democrats, in contrast,
remained determinedly on the offensive, unexpectedly forcing
through a ban on imported high-capacity ammunition clips for
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who heads the Senate Democratic
re-election effort, vowed that Republicans would be held
accountable for their vote on Wednesday. ``No force on earth can
stop this now from becoming a central issue in the 2000 elections
debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to name some of the Republicans who are up for
re-election and are considered vulnerable. ``It will be very hard
for Spence Abraham to explain to the people of Michigan, Slade
Gorton to the people of Washington, Rod Grams to the people of
Minnesota, that after Littleton, they couldn't require background
checks at gun shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps another sign of the growing potency of the issue,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the candidates for the Republican
presidential nomination, was among the Republican senators who
demanded Thursday that their party change its stance on gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion surveys show that the American public is changing
its views on guns, though it is still conflicted. An Associated
Press poll found that in the week after the Colorado high school
shootings, the percentage of Americans who thought that tougher gun
control laws would be more effective than tighter enforcement of
current law was up nine percentage points to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of split might not seem overwhelming enough to explain
the Democrats' determination to control guns. But there are other
factors bolstering President Clinton and his party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days in the early 1990s when they were voting to
impose a waiting period for handgun sales and to ban 19 types of
assault weapons, the Democrats have recast many of their gun
control measures as ones designed to keep weapons out of the hands
of teen-agers. ``This is not about the broader population,''
Torricelli said. ``It is about guns and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals calling for trigger locks on guns and raising the
minimum age for weapons possession draw overwhelming support from
the public. So the Republicans put up no fight against the
president's proposal to ban sales of semiautomatic assault weapons
to children under 18. The amendment was sponsored by another
Republican up for re-election in 2000, John Ashcroft of Missouri.
It passed 96-2.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, gun control is a regional issue that resonates
differently in the cities than it does in rural and western areas.
But as violence has spread to suburban schools, one place it has
become particularly popular is in the suburbs. And the suburbs have
become the swing areas in both the presidential and congressional
elections. Gun control also appeals overwhelmingly to
college-educated women, who have been considered key to the
Democrats' inroads this decade into the once solidly Republican
suburban vote.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been lost on Elizabeth Dole, who has been seeking
to capitalize on her appeal to women. In contrast to her husband,
Bob Dole, she has attacked the National Rifle Association as a
``special interest group'' and endorsed the assault weapons ban,
trigger locks on handguns and a ban on armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, despite the financial support they receive from
Hollywood, Democrats have learned not to be as dismissive as they
once were of cultural concerns about the entertainment industry's
effect on the national psyche. Clinton made the V-chip to block
objectionable television programs a key point in the family-values
agenda he put forth before his 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, reflected
the Democrats' new way of talking about issues of violence when he
told reporters at a breakfast Thursday that in searching for a
response to the violence in Colorado, ``I don't want this to become
just a discussion of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the gun control issue has become more difficult
as American sentiment has shifted. Their core conservative
supporters include many people who feel strongly about the Second
Amendment's guarantee of the right to bear arms. And the NRA was
one of the advocacy groups that House Republicans credited with
helping them win the majority in 1994. It is also a major donor to
Republicans. In 1998, for example, the NRA's political action
committee donated $1.35 million to Republican congressional
candidates and $283,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That means that, particularly in the House, where the two
parties are fighting for control in 2000, Republicans must carry
out a difficult balancing act, doing nothing to offend these
conservatives while not imperiling the moderate Republicans from
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert has said little about the gun issue
beyond calling for a national dialogue on Littleton. An aide said
he was amenable to an appeal by Gephardt that the two men try to
explore some kind of bipartisan approach to the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   But one House Republican aide said Thursday that the best course
for his party might be to try to sidestep the gun control debate
entirely, despite the votes this week in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either put off the soccer moms or you put off the gun
owners,'' he said. ``So you try to avoid gun votes, period.''

 By STEPHEN LABATON with LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government accused American Airlines
Thursday of driving smaller competitors out of its important
Dallas-Fort Worth market by illegally slashing ticket prices below
their cost and increasing flights.
</P>
<P>
   The government said American used its dominance of the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to prevent weaker
competitors from gaining a foothold there in the mid-1990s, only to
raise prices and reduce service after they departed.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust case is the first predatory pricing action brought
by the government against an airline since the industry was
deregulated 21 years ago. It is part of a broader 18-month
examination by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division of the
steps that may have been taken by major airlines, including Delta,
Northwest and United, to discourage lower-priced competition in
cities where they are the main carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Following deregulation in 1978, the largest airlines have moved
to strengthen the control of their markets, establishing hubs,
locking up gates and expanding frequent flyer programs. While
antitrust cases among the airlines are not uncommon _ indeed,
American once sued United unsuccessfully for predatory pricing _
the government has rarely intervened beyond threats of fines.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer complaints about rising fares and declining service
have led lawmakers to introduce measures in Congress to force the
airlines to disclose more about fares and delays, and offer
compensation for inconveniences. In addition, the Transportation
Department proposed a new enforcement policy last year that would
punish airlines that tried to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at the Justice Department said the American
case was particularly compelling because company documents showed
that American, the nation's second-largest airline, had
deliberately sold tickets below cost and incurred significant
short-term financial losses in recent years in order to drive out
three low-cost competitors _ Vanguard, Sun Jet International and
Western Pacific _ from the Dallas market.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lawyers at American said it would defend itself
agains the charges. They said the airline had not violated any
antitrust laws but simply matched the fares of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once the competing airlines left the Dallas-Fort Worth
market, government lawyers said, American raised its fares,
sometimes by more than 50 percent, and sharply cut service to
cities in California, Colorado, Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``American quickly realized that these new carriers could be a
significant competitive threat, estimating that as much as a
billion and a half dollars of its annual revenues were at risk if
they were to succeed,'' said Joel Klein, the assistant attorney
general in charge of the Antitrust Division. ``To make sure that
this didn't happen, American adopted a predatory responsive
strategy, saturating the market in which the start-up carriers had
begun service with as much new, low-fare service of its own as was
necessary to drive out the start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``American knew that this strategy would be costly and
pursued it only in order to drive out the new carriers, so that
American could go back to its old way of monopoly pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said American ``invested in
short-term capacity increases and fare reductions in order to
maintain its monopoly _ an investment it was able to recover many
times over once its smaller rivals had been driven away.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines disputed the accusations by the Justice
Department that it had priced its fares below cost or flooded the
market, and said the lawsuit was little more than sour-grapes by
smaller up-starts which, unable to compete, had persuaded antitrust
regulators to bring the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the Justice Department's lawsuit, this action
today is very potentially anti-consumer,'' said Chris Chiames, a
spokesman for the AMR Corp., the parent company of American. ``It
would have a chilling effect on the marketplace if companies felt
they could not match prices of competitors. We simply matched the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department complaint, filed in federal court in
Wichita, Kan., seeks an injunction barring American from cutting
ticket prices below cost and increasing flights as part of any
effort to stifle competition. The case is being brought under
Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said federal antitrust law does not
permit them to seek any fines or monetary awards, but that smaller
airlines who were harmed by American's conduct could file their own
civil antitrust lawsuits for money.

   The complaint quoted from company papers describing its
``Dallas-Ft. Worth Low Cost Carriers Strategy.'' The government
said the strategy recognized that ``it could prove unprofitable in
the short run.'' But, according to a company document quoted in the
complaint, the strategy concluded: ``The short term cost, or impact
on revenue can be viewed as the investment necessary to achieve the
desired effect on market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of recouping short term losses through
strengthening American's monopoly, the Justice Department charged,
reflected the views of Robert L. Crandall, then the airline's
chairman and chief executive, who the government said had once
commented about low-cost carriers, ``If you are not going to get
them out then no point to diminish profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also quoted from internal American Airlines
papers that suggested that the carrier intended to add flights to
Kansas City, Mo., to drive Vanguard from the market and that
American decided to get Western Pacific out of the Dallas-Colorado
Springs route before Western Pacific increased its service to that
market.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives declined to answer questions about the
American Airlines documents that the government has called
incriminating but defended them in general terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong or illegal with tough talk about
competition,'' Chiames said.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Nicoud, a senior lawyer at American, said, ``Looking at
aggressive conversations in board rooms is very misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   To win against any airline, the government's evidence would need
to be strong because predatory pricing cases are difficult to
prove. But Justice Department lawyers have argued that it is
relatively easy for a large airline to profit after undercutting a
rival and driving it out of a market. In the past, the government
has distinguished between legitimate competition and predatory
pricing when an airline cut its fares below its costs and added
capacity in a strategy that only made economic sense if the smaller
rival were forced to leave the market.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the smaller rivals portrayed as victims by the
Justice Department praised the lawsuit. Of the three airlines,
Vanguard has since returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth market, Sun
Jet no longer serves that airport, and Western Pacific filed for
bankruptcy protection from its creditors and stopped flying in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the actions that American Airlines took to
eliminate Vanguard Airlines from the Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace
were unlawful and violated the antitrust laws,'' said Robert J.
Spane, chief executive of Vanguard Airlines. ``We are delighted
that the Justice Department has agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vanguard is also quick to trumpet its success in the past
year, which appears to bely the government's claim that American
was unlawfully preying on the carrier. Vanguard posted an operating
profit of $1.5 million for the first time last year compared with
an operating loss of $25.4 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition,
which lobbies on behalf of several large corporations seeking more
airline competition, said the most significant outcome of the
Justice Department lawsuit would be to increase investors'
confidence in start-up airlines. ``It is going to be a huge shot in
the arm in terms of investing in low fare competitors,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a potentially groundbreaking ruling that could
help resolve some of the enduring mysteries of the Cold War, a
federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday ordered the government to
unseal thousands of pages of secret grand jury testimony from the
investigation of Alger Hiss and the underground communist movement
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which came over the strong objections of the
government, could lead to the release of grand jury testimony in
1947 and 1948 by Hiss and dozens of other witnesses, including his
chief accuser, Whittaker Chambers, and Richard M. Nixon, then a
California congressman, whose role in the Hiss case thrust him into
the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss was ultimately indicted on perjury charges in an espionage
case that raised fears about communist infiltration of the federal
government and eventually became one of the most divisive issues of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and legal scholars said that the ruling by Judge
Peter Leisure could lead to more attempts to examine records of
grand juries in other historically significant cases, such as the
attempts to indict Aaron Burr after he was vice president, or more
recently, the espionage case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering the papers released, Leisure cited the longstanding
debate about the case, which he said fits a narrow exception to
grand jury secrecy in matters of compelling historical importance,
an assertion disputed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure noted the continuing questions about Nixon's role and
whether he had sought to lobby the grand jury to indict Hiss, the
extent of Soviet espionage activity in the United States during and
after World War II, and whether there were improprieties in the
grand jury investigation itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is confident that disclosure will fill in important
gaps,'' Leisure wrote, adding that releasing the documents would
lead to new debate and new historical works, ``all to the immense
benefit of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The materials should languish on archival shelves, behind
locked doors, no longer,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Vladeck, a lawyer for a coalition of scholars and
historical associations that had petitioned for the release of the
papers, said the decision was the ``first major ruling establishing
the proposition that grand jury records should not be locked away
forever where there's a historical need for them to be made
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck, of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, said: ``It
says, in a sense, that once the traditional justification for grand
jury secrecy erodes, there will be cases _ extraordinary cases _
but there will be cases, where the public has a right to see its
own history.'' Vladeck's group was founded by Ralph Nader and has
been involved in other cases seeking access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who had fought the papers'
release, said Thursday that they were still considering whether to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said her office
opposed disclosure of the records based on grand jury secrecy
rules: ``There is no exception for historical interest in the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White added that the rules ``safeguard the grand jury
process, the integrity of investigations, and the reputations and
privacy of both innocent subjects and witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there was a ``vast amount of material already in the
public record about this subject _ much of it released by the
government itself,'' and those seeking the papers had failed to
meet ``their extraordinarily heavy burden'' of establishing a legal
basis for access to the materials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's office argued, for example, that scholars had long
ago concluded that Nixon had attempted to persuade the grand jury
to indict Hiss rather than Chambers, and those seeking the records
had not shown a ``genuine gap in the historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leisure concluded that ``the public has a significant
interest in disclosure of Nixon's testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand jury testimony by a congressional official allegedly
attempting to influence a grand jury's charging decision,'' he
wrote, ``is of inherent and substantial historical importance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Confirmation of what was actually said by Nixon will
significantly enrich the debate about the propriety of that
testimony and its importance to the grand jury's decision to
indict.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge did rule that a small portion of the records may
involve privacy interests, and allowed the government additional
time to argue against their release. But Vladeck said those
portions represented a ``trivial'' part of documents that were
being sought.

PREAKNESS SHOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 -LADN-(SLANG) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Race to Watch if You Watch Only One Race
All Year, take two.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical season the Kentucky Derby is the definitive event
for young thoroughbreds and the Preakness merely crosses the T's
and dots the I's in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the Derby was inconclusive because (a) more
than half of the 19 horses suffered traffic trouble, (b) there was
no standout going into the race, and (c) I didn't pick the winner.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's up to Saturday's Preakness, at Pimlico Race Course
in Baltimore, to answer a long list of remaining questions about
America's (and Dubai's) 3-year-olds (and 3-year-old fillies).
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness result will be scrutinized for meaning the way the
Derby result usually is. But why wait for the race to be run?
Here's what it'll mean if. . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Charismatic wins: Then he and D. Wayne Lukas deserve
credit they haven't received since winning the Derby _ as a
supposedly overmatched horse who had the audacity to blossom at the
right time and a supposedly inflexible trainer who figured out what
made this one tick. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Excellent Meeting wins: Then maybe she was best in the
Derby when she rallied from 18th to fourth; the best fillies are
the equals of the best colts this year, and the best colts are
mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some will conclude Silverbulletday, ostensibly the
better filly in trainer Bob Baffert's barn, would have won if she'd
run. (She skipped the Derby to beat fillies in the Kentucky Oaks
and will skip the Preakness to face fillies in today's Black-Eyed
Susan.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe the Silverbulletday hype _ until Baffert and owner
Mike Pegram follow through on their boasts and take on males, she's
only been beating no-name fillies, and her 10-for-11 record is a
testament to careful management. If they thought they had the best
3-year-old, they'd be in the Preakness despite drawing post
position 14. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Vicar wins: Then trainer Carl Nafzger will earn
congratulations for realizing you CAN win from an outside post _
but it seems more likely the epidemic of post-position hysteria has
infected Nafzger and he'll scratch. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Worldly Manner wins: Then it's a rare case in which
America's best 2-year-old goes on to be its best 3-year-old, and we
can conclude he might have held on to win the Derby if his
Dubai-based owners had prepped him in a more traditional manner. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Cat Thief wins: Then Lukas has taken back the King of the
Triple Crown title from Baffert by winning the Derby and Preakness
with different horses for the second time. That's reassuring for
fundamental handicappers shaken by Charismatic. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Menifee wins: Then _ and maybe only then _ there's reason
to be excited about this crop of 3-year-olds, because the Blue
Grass winner and troubled Derby runnerup would be a deserving
Preakness winner. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Stephen Got Even wins: Then the first-turn Derby bumping
was as costly as it looked, if the 14th-place finisher can bounce
back to win the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   That also would complete a Triple Crown season to forget for
Chris McCarron, who lost the mount on Santa Anita Derby winner
General Challenge to Gary Stevens, and now has a foot fracture that
will leave Stephen Got Even to Stevens. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Valhol wins Then a year after Pimlico's Preakness-day
power failure, the electricity would definitely be back on. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Kimberlite Pipe or Adonis wins: Then this is the craziest,
not to say the absolute worst, bunch of 3-year-olds ever. . . .
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Patience Game, Badge or Torrid Sand wins: Then it's a rare
victory for the Preakness ``fresh horse'' angle and the Derby
horses should hang their heads in shame.
</P>
<P>
   All in all it's one of the more intriguing Preaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll win? Charismatic is good enough to win again, but it
might be too much to expect racing luck to go his way twice in a
row. At the morning-line odds _ which will come down because
Silverbulletday (7-2) is out, Menifee (5-2) is too popular and Cat
Thief (8-1) and Worldly Manner (12-1) look like better values.
</P>
<P>
   My picks: 1. Cat Thief (Mike Smith), 2. Worldly Manner (Jerry
Bailey), 3. Menifee (Pat Day).
</P>
<P>
   __ At Hollywood Park: Gates will open at 10 a.m. on Preakness
day and Hollywood Park's first live race will be at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The first of five simulcasts from Pimlico will be at 11 a.m. and
the Preakness is set for 2:27 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness lacks the local drawing power of the Kentucky
Derby. Last year 12,477 went to Hollywood Park on Preakness day
after 21,949 showed up on Derby day.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Black-Eyed Susan is scheduled for 2:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gold Cup is leaking: On Thursday, a week after Strub Stakes
winner Event of the Year was sidelined by a knee problem, Santa
Anita Handicap winner Free House was declared out for at least 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Paco Gonzalez said a nuclear scan showed Free House came
out of his second to Real Quiet in last Saturday's Pimlico Special
with a tear in the ligament connecting the left hip to the spine.
The 5-year-old will recuperate at owners Trudy McCaffery and John
Toffan's ranch in Bradbury.
</P>
<P>
   The injury means Free House will miss the June 27 Hollywood Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   So could 1998 Big 'Cap winner Malek, who has stiffness in his
back and will miss the May 29 Massachusetts Handicap, trainer
Richard Mandella said. &QL;

BIOLOGISTS SOLVE A CHROMOSOME MYSTERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Colo., N.C.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists must have gazed thousands of times through
microscopes at the 46 chromosomes that lie in the nucleus of every
normal human cell without perceiving what has now been discovered:
the ends of the chromosomes _ the immensely long molecules of DNA
that carry the genetic information _ are neatly tied in large,
firmly knotted loops.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery bears on a long outstanding puzzle, that of why
the cell does not mistake the ends of intact chromosomes for the
broken ends of cut chromosomes. A broken chromosome end sends the
cell into full panic mode: If it cannot repair the broken end it
will trigger its self-destruct mechanism and die for the common
good rather than risk the genetic instability that leads to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The loops provide the answer that no one had divined: Normal
chromosomes have no ends, only the perfect topological continuum of
a circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a whole new way to think about how the telomeres
may function,'' said Dr. Carol W. Greider of Johns Hopkins
University, referring to the end sections of the chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery could lead to important insights about cancer and
longevity, with which the telomeres are intimately connected. Each
time a cell divides its telomeres get shorter, as if marking off a
finite number of permissible divisions. When the telomeres get too
stubby, the cell is thrown into senescence and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists recently got a taste of immortality when they found
that human cells kept in culture would grow and divide indefinitely
if their telomeres were artificially lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of extending the technique into the body has been
criticized on the ground that telomere shortening is a last defense
against the runaway cell divisions of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery seems immediately to explain the mechanism
behind these important findings: When the telomeres get too short,
presumably the cell can no longer bend them to form loops. A naked
chromosome end then appears, tripping the cell's hara-kiri program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting finding because biomolecular structure and
function always go hand in hand,'' said Dr. Thomas Cech, a telomere
expert at the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding, published in Friday's issue of Cell, is the
work of Titia de Lange of the Rockefeller University in New York
and Jack Griffith of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. de Lange had been trying for years to find out how the ends
of the chromosomes were capped, suspecting that they might be
swathed in some special protein that concealed them from the cell's
self-destruct mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago she found a protein that would glue itself
along the telomeres. But strangely, it did not stick to the very
end.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago she turned to Griffith, an expert at studying
DNA-protein interactions under the electron microscope. At first
they saw very odd structures that were hard to explain. Further
experiments gave a clearer picture. ``When I saw these loops, I
didn't really believe it,'' Dr. de Lange said. ``We were quite
concerned it might be an artifact.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the loops had never been noticed before is the
enormous length of DNA. Each cell has about six feet of DNA.
Although there must be 92 terminal loops in each full set of 46
chromosomes, they would be hard to notice among the many accidental
circles made by DNA molecules when they are spread out on a
microscope slide. ``If you take spaghetti and sling it on the
floor, you'll occasionally see a little lassolike thing,'' Griffith
said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of the double-stranded DNA molecule the telomere
regions are cross-linked until the very end where one strand
extends alone for about 200 bases, as the chemical units of DNA are
known. This overhang of unpaired bases has turned out to be the
clasp that seals the loop. A special protein pries apart the double
strand at the point where the looped back overhang completes the
circle. The overhang then makes cross-links with one of the exposed
strands.
</P>
<P>
   The overhang and the open strand have the complementary
sequences needed to form correct cross-links because both are part
of the telomeric DNA, which has the same sequence of six DNA units
(in humans, TTAGGG on one strand, AATCCC on the other) repeated
thousands of times.

 &HT;    Symposium keys in on interpretation gap, civil rights
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In Thursday's keynote speech for the ``Legacy of
the Sixties'' symposium at the LBJ Library, historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. invoked ``the tranquilizing perspective of time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the subsequent panels made plain, however, the passage of
time hasn't exactly prove-- tranquil or resolved what Schlesinger
termed ``a chaos of conflicting interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a chasm of imposing perspectives divides those who hail
the decade's idealists and those who condemn its anarchists and
hedonists. The two points on which most participants agreed are
that one of the legacies of the '60s is that we have yet to stop
talking about the legacy of the '60s, and that the significance of
that tumultuous era is in the mind of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar and a special assistant to John
F. Kennedy, Schlesinger proceeded to fire the first shots. He
dismissed New Left activists as ``neo-Stalinists'' (only less
tolerant and cultured than the originals), whose ``scorn for
history was exceeded only by their ignorance of it.'' Whatever
credit the movement claimed for civil-rights advances and an end to
the war in Vietnam, Schlesinger said that the politics of the
street only ``marginally accelerated changes that were already
under way,'' and that their major effect was to strengthen the
conservative movement that would elect Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that followed Schlesinger's speech was titled ``The
Counter-Culture Movement _ Its Effect on American Life Today.'' It
largely reinforced his contention that '60s radicalism was a
marginal aberration, a noisy distraction, before business as usual
reasserted itself. ``In my opinion, the dominant culture won,''
said Rice University history professor Allen Matusow, who cited
``the unchallenged position and power of the large corporations''
in contemporary society. As the anti-materialist hippies became
conspicuously consuming yuppies, commodification (as one wag put
it) transformed the counterculture into the over-the-counter
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon session on ``Civil Rights _ The Situation Now''
touched a strikingly different chord. Moderator Julian Bond, the
national director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, proclaimed that ``the movement for civil rights
made public policy,'' putting pressure on a government that
preferred change at a more deliberate pace, if at all. Addressing
Schlesinger's dismissal of youthful rebellion even more directly,
panelist Vincent Harding celebrated the '60s as an era in which
young people felt ``empowered to work for change for good in their
society. That's a legacy that needs to be nurtured and developed.''
He also suggested that the morning's panel, made up of five white
males, could hardly be reflective of the counterculture of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   What Bond termed the after- noon's ``rainbow panel'' of Latino-
American, Asian-American and African-American activists hailed
President Johnson's domestic policies of the '60s, while charging
that there has been considerable backsliding in the decades since.
Panelist John Maguire, in rhetoric that had a '60s ring to it,
decried the ever-growing gulf between ``the obscenely rich''
(overwhelmingly white) and ``the desperately poor''
(disproportionately of color).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever dialogue might have bridged the cultural chasms was
made more difficult by the framework of the panels, which were
presented as a series of monologues, followed by questions from the
audience. Instead of talking with each other, participants found
themselves talking at each other, or past each other.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium concludes today with sessions on foreign policy (9
a.m.), space exploration (9:30 a.m.), the Great Society (1:30 p.m.)
and LBJ in retrospect (6 p.m.). All events take place at the LBJ
Library's LBJ Auditorium and are free and open to the public.

MEXICO MAY WARN ITS CITIZENS ABOUT HOUSTON POLICE SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>

By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mexican government is considering warning its
citizens to avoid traveling to Houston because of recent fatal
shootings of Mexicans by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is very concerned with this situation,'' said Rodulfo
Figueroa, Consul General of Mexico in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said the Mexican federal government has considered
issuing a travel warning for the past three months because of the
shootings by Houston police of Pedro Oregon Navarro in July and
Uvaldo Garcia Armendariz in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was shot 12 times, nine in the back, July 12 by Houston
police in an aborted drug bust turned sour. Garcia was shot by
police when responding to a domestic disturbance call.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Mexico who travel to Houston and choose to
live in our city can feel safe because they are protected by one of
the finest law enforcement organizations in the world,'' Brown
said. ``Houston has one of the lowest crime rates for any large
city in America.''

   Mexican officials say its government rarely, if at all, issues
travel warnings for its citizens.

is always issuing advisories not to go to Chiapas or Guerrero or
other places of unrest in Mexico, so now it's their turn,'' said
Cristobal Hinojosa, a Houston Hispanic activist.

   ``The city of Houston, as much as it's trying to generate
business and tourism business, it's not something that we can
afford at all,'' said Richard Torres, president and chief executive

look at the problem, but I don't think that by having a travel

in Houston. Most come to Houston to shop, she said. She said June

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mexican government is considering warning its
citizens to avoid traveling to Houston because of recent fatal
shootings of Mexicans by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is very concerned with this situation,'' said Rodulfo
Figueroa, Consul General of Mexico in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said the Mexican federal government has considered
issuing a travel warning for the past three months because of the
shootings by Houston police of Pedro Oregon Navarro in July and
Uvaldo Garcia Armendariz in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was shot 12 times, nine in the back, July 12 by Houston
police in an aborted drug bust turned sour. Garcia was shot by
police when responding to a domestic disturbance call.
</P>
<P>
   Those threats increased following last month's police shooting
death of robbery suspect Eulogio Perez in southwest Houston.

CHRIS ANTLEY BACK IN CONTENTION AS A TOP JOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Charismatic didn't have to face much adversity two
weeks ago in the Kentucky Derby, so he isn't getting as much
respect for tomorrow's Preakness Stakes as a Derby winner might
deserve.
</P>
<P>
   But his jockey, Chris Antley, has endured enough hard times for
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Antley has battled substance abuse. He has been to dieting hell
and back again. But when trainer D. Wayne Lukas was searching for a
Derby jockey for Charismatic, he ignored those personal problems
and instead focused on the 8-year-old trophy perched on Antley's
living room shelf, commemorating a winning ride on Strike the Gold
in the 1991 Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd won the Derby,'' Lukas explained, ``so it wasn't like we
were going with a guy that would break down in the post parade.''
</P>
<P>
   No, if Antley was going to break down, it would have happened
when he tested positive for cocaine at age 22 and was temporarily
suspended from the sport. Or months before the Derby, at home in
Columbia, S.C., when his weight ballooned to 147 pounds and his
career appeared doomed. Or when he was riding in New York two years
and starving himself to get down to 113 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is an albatross to the careers of many riders. To Antley,
it nearly was an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through it all trying to lose weight,'' he said. ``But
I continued to get bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley once was a star rider on the New York circuit, where in
1989 he rode at least one winner for 64 consecutive racing days.
Once he won nine races in one day, five at an afternoon track and
four at night.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately left New York in 1993 because of two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most riders did 113 \Rpounds\S or less in New York. If you did
114 it was kind of unheard of,'' Antley said. ``I came to
California because you were considered light if you `tacked' 115.
\RLaffit\S Pincay and a couple of others tacked 117.''
</P>
<P>
   He rode well in California, too, but the constant stress of
reducing his weight finally took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of riders are Lasix users,'' Antley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasix is a diuretic also commonly used on racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of riders are bulimic. Everybody has their
personal way,'' Antley said. ``Some don't eat or eat a tiny, tiny
bit. Some sit in a hotbox for five hours, or take Lasix or diet
pills. Myself, I went from cycle to cycle. If anybody ever did a
medical report on riders, it might be ... . I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Antley believes, it came down to self-control. And
that had never been one of his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I didn't have the commitment like a Laffit Pincay
would,'' he said, referring to the legendary Hall of Fame rider who
has made dietary nutrition an art form. ``I fault myself on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically weak from battling the scales, Antley returned home
to South Carolina in fall 1997 and temporarily let himself go. When
he decided he wanted to ride again, he needed the resolve of a
Marine. He found it within himself, running 25 miles a day and
earning the nickname Forrest Gump from neighborhood merchants along
his daily route.
</P>
<P>
   But Antley made it back this year at age 33, both to the
occupation he loves and to the Kentucky Derby winner's circle with
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   His experience plus his newfound drive caught Lukas' eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hungry,'' Lukas said, ``and he has a passion to get back
to the higher echelon of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a warm feeling coming to the wire,'' Antley said of his
second Derby victory. ``It wasn't a jump-up-and-down feeling. I
felt a warm feeling like things were coming together.''

WOODS LEADS SCORING ONSLAUGHT AT NELSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Nick Price teased with a course record yesterday
at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic. But he still finished last in his
threesome.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who tied the tournament scoring mark with an
opening 61, failed to earn tee-box honors with a front-nine 29
because playing partner Paul Goydos took birdies on seven of his
first 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Such was life in the Woods-Goydos-Price group, which provided
the perfect microcosm for the most prolific scoring day in
tournament history. Of yesterday's 156 starters, 103 broke even-par
70 at the Four Seasons Resort and Club, the most in any round at
any Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Woods did the most damage, going 9 under par on the Cottonwood
Valley Golf Course and pacing a threesome that finished a combined
24-under. But he never grabbed the solo lead until Goydos (8 under)
misfired on his approach shot to the 18th green, setting up a
closing bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Woods leads Goydos, Steve Lowery and Sergio Garcia by one stroke
heading into today's second round, with Price among a five-player
group at 7-under that includes Corey Pavin and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have shot lower,'' said Woods, who missed only two
putts inside eight feet during a nine-birdie, no-bogey round. ``I
went out and attacked the pins and put myself in a lot of birdie
positions. And from there, I made a lot of putts. It's always fun
when you really get it going like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, Goydos and Garcia all got it going well enough that they
admitted to fleeting thoughts of reaching 59, the PGA Tour scoring
record, during the closing holes. By finishing at 61, Woods tied
both the Nelson tournament record and the Cottonwood Valley course
record on a postcard-perfect day with benign winds and
rain-softened greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best day to play golf out here that I've ever
seen,'' Nelson said. ``If you can't play out there today, you can't
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were so pristine, said Goydos, that players in his
group ``weren't even thinking about bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone got going, and we fed off each other,'' said Goydos,
who had a 28 on the front nine. ``We were all in the same rhythm.
I'd never shot in the 20s on nine holes before. That's a mythical
number. It still seems ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Woods-Goydos-Price group combined for 25 birdies
and a bogey. Fans became so jaded, Goydos joked, that Price ``shot
63, and no one asked for his autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of fans hovered around Woods, who averaged 311 yards
per drive and one-putted 13 greens. Of his nine birdie putts, only
a 30-footer at No. 12 traveled more than 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   With his 61, Woods matched Billy Mayfair (1993), Ernie Els
(1995) and Charlie Rymer (1996) for the lowest score in tournament
history. Els, like Woods, made his mark at Cottonwood Valley.
Mayfair and Rymer blistered the TPC at Las Colinas, which proved to
be a stroke more difficult in the opening round than the Cottonwood
layout.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors averaged 69.1 strokes per round yesterday at TPC,
with a low of 62 by Lowery. Scoring average at Cottonwood was 68.2,
with Woods leading a birdie barrage that saw 140 players shoot 72
or better in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was his lowest score of the season on the PGA Tour,
Woods said he played better during a third-round 62 at the Buick
Invitational in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more rewarding when it takes more effort,'' Woods said.
``People have shot 61s out here before. So it's not as rewarding,
but I'm not saying it doesn't feel good.''

GOLFER LOWERY TRIES TO REBUILD HOME, CAREER FROM ASHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Steve Lowery's million-dollar home went up in
flames three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's determined not to let his golf career go with it.
</P>
<P>
   The date _ Feb. 28 _ is scorched into Lowery's memory, in so
many ways. He had just come off the 18th green after the final
round of the Tucson Open, a tournament he had once been in position
to win, when tour official Mark Russell approached and said he had
some grim news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your family is all right, but there's been a fire,'' Russell
informed Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that maybe it was like a kitchen fire,'' Lowery, 38,
said, picking up the narrative yesterday after his opening-round 62
at the Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured there would be just a little damage, maybe a few
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, Lowery said, he was on a plane headed home to
Orlando, Fla. He turned his street corner around 1 a.m. The fire
engines were still busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was like ... nothing,'' he said. ``We went out to the
house and it was, like, gone. It wasn't there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The home had been located on the fourth fairway of the Bay Hill
Club in Orlando. It had five bedrooms and measured 5,500 square
feet. The Lowerys, Steve and his wife, Kathryn, had spent a year
remodeling the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream house,'' Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn and the three children were at the kitchen table, doing
homework, when 7-year-old Kristen noticed the flames. The family
evacuated swiftly and safely, and firefighters arrived in four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But fire officials estimated that the fire had begun around 2
p.m. and had already been burning for an hour. The
million-dollar-plus home was quickly engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn and the children didn't carry anything with them when
they escaped from the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   As Steve said, ``You think, well, the men are going to put out
the fire, and everything inside is still going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Lowerys, nothing was spared. Gone were the family
mementos, the wedding pictures, everything.
</P>
<P>
   Lost was a $12,000 gold and silver bowl awarded to Lowery for
winning the 1994 Sprint Invitational, his only tour victory. Gone
were every trophy, cup and ribbon from every golf tournament that
Lowery ever won, along with prized memorabilia from the Masters and
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I had,'' Lowery said, wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance people give you money for it. But there are
things you just can't replace. Like, I went to the University of
Alabama, and I had some personalized letters from Bear Bryant. How
can you replace that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks later, investigators still aren't certain what caused
the blaze. Suspicions point to the electrical wiring in the attic.
Not that it matters now, Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it could easily have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to somebody like Stuart Appleby, who lost his wife,
and you start to realize how lucky you are,'' Lowery said. ``We got
everyone out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, however, left more than ashes. After a couple of
weeks, Lowery had to refocus his mind on golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wears on you,'' he said. ``Guys who are doing things like
going through a divorce, building a house _ you just don't have the
energy to focus for four days.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, three weeks after the blaze the golf tour
arrived for its annual stop at the Bay Hill Club. Lowery opened
with what was then his best round of the year, a 67, one stroke off
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys in the press interview room, `Here's your
chance. The headline should be `Lowery on fire at Bay Hill,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery was finding that he was finally able to joke about it.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Colin Montgomerie, they were on the third hole at
Bay Hill when Monty asked, ``Don't you live around here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a great house,'' Lowery shot back. ``I can let you
have it for about $400,000 below appraisal. Five bedrooms.
Fifty-five hundred square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the fireplace has only had one fire in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery finished in a tie for 37th in that tournament. His best
since then has been a $26,000 check for finishing 23rd at the
Greater Greensboro Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowery's 62 yesterday on the TPC course _ six birdies and an
eagle on the par-5 16th _ has him solidly in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The family will build another dream home elsewhere, maybe in
Birmingham, Ala., where Steve grew up.
</P>
<P>
   His golf game will rise from the ashes, too, Lowery said.
There's going to be a new trophy case to fill.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton acknowledged Thursday night that
he had been concerned that Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign was off to a sluggish start. He said he had personally
coached Gore on how to loosen up and appear less remote and rigid
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a telephone interview with The New York Times,
insisted that he was by no means alarmed by the state of the
campaign and that, like most of the Democratic establishment, he
still expected Gore to win his party's nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he was much less worried than he had
been several weeks ago and that he was particularly heartened that
Gore earlier this week named Tony Coelho, the former House
Democratic whip, as his campaign chairman. Coelho has been charged
with whipping the Gore operation into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I have urged him to go out there and enjoy
this,'' Clinton said. ``I have told him to go out and have a good
time. I want people to know him the way I know him. I want people
to see him the way I see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is regarded as unrivaled for his skills on the
stump, said the campaign ``is in a lot better shape now than it was
eight weeks ago _ and I think the appointment of Tony Coelho was a
very good move, because he's a strong man and an experienced person
and he'll really take a lot of the burdens off the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The president telephoned The Times tonight after learning that
the newspaper intended to publish an article citing his worries _
described in interviews by several people close to Clinton _ that
the Gore campaign was floundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not have the feeling that the Gore campaign is moving
in a positive, forceful, determined way to prepare themselves,''
said one person, recounting his conversations with Clinton about
Gore. ``But he'll be the first one to tell you that this has a long
way to go and nobody should overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who views the election of Gore as affirming his own
legacy, has hardly been alone in his worries. A consensus has
emerged among prominent Democrats that the Gore campaign has had a
lackluster start.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats point to the quick and unanticipated rise of
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey as a challenger; polls
showing that Gore's popularity is not particularly deep, that he
may be damaged by Clinton's scandals and that he would be easily
defeated in a general election by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas or
Elizabeth Dole; a sense that Gore has deficient campaigning skills
and has fumbled, making gaffes like taking credit for inventing the
Internet; a view that he has not adequately articulated positions,
and that he was trying to run his own campaign single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Gore campaign publicly insists that it is on
track, noting that it has broken fund-raising records and nailed
down an impressive roster of endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   In his advice to Gore, associates said, Clinton suggested that
the vice president take a more informal approach by shedding his
blue suit more frequently, plunging into crowds, staying overnight
with supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire and striking out on his
own from his his cumbersome entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore came closest to publicly acknowledging the troubles by his
abrupt naming this week Coelho. Gore, who had been making many of
the day-to-day political decisions himself _ from his travel
schedule to topics for his speeches _ has now relinquished that
role to Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who spoke with Clinton said the president had
urged Gore to turn over control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks Gore needs to stop worrying, he needs to look at the
assets he's got, the story he's got to tell the American people _
and focus on that,'' this person said. ``He was one of the people
who thought he shouldn't be terribly concerned about who manages
the thing on a day-to-day basis and spend his time instead on what
he says to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who discussed Clinton's concerns for this article did not
volunteer the information but spoke only reluctantly. They included
people who are loyal to Gore and others who are personally closer
to Clinton but support Gore's candidacy. The reasons they agreed to
interviews _ only on condition of anonymity _ may be multi-faceted:
to give a complete picture of the President's position, to show
themselves in the know, or perhaps, to send a public message to the
vice president that he needs to make repairs quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton monitors his vice president's campaign appearances on
television and reads up on the campaign, according to one of the
people who spoke with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really into what's going on out there,'' he said. ``He,
as well as many Democrats, is concerned about the polls and that
the campaign seemed to be listless, lacking in enthusiasm. How many
times did you hear people saying there was just no excitement?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton's counsel, James Carville, the strategist
who is close to the President, said, ``I think it's good advice.''
Carville added that the president had not told him about his
conversations with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Gore's aides insist that the campaign is in far better
shape than many people think. They note that Vice President George
Bush had similar problems moving out of President Reagan's shadow
in the 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the front runner you have everybody, from
virtually every angle and every side taking their shots at you,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``But the bottom line is that
today the vice president is extremely strong. Our fund raising has
been immensely successful. To the extent that you believe in polls,
in the primaries we're exceedingly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore advisers concede that the vice president had hoped
to keep a low campaign profile throughout the summer, but that the
spate of bad notices had led him to take several steps to try to
demonstrate momentum.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the campaign had planned to put off Gore's formal
announcement of his candidacy until toward the end of the year, if
at all. (Clinton sought to seem above politics during the 1996
campaign by never officially announcing his candidacy.) But now,
Gore's advisers said, they have moved the date to June or July.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also pumping resources into an aggressive
behind-the-scenes effort to assure that Gore has a respectable
showing against Bradley in a straw poll being conducted on Saturday
by the Massachusetts Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is so mindful of catering to an important constituency that
aides said he had overruled White House and State Department
officials and agreed to give an address to the American-Israel
Public Affairs Committee on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had warned that it was risky to give
the speech then because the timing would be awkward: it falls days
after the Israeli election and just before an expected runoff vote
on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore advisers said concerns about his campaign had also led
Gore to move fast in hiring Coelho. ``I was shocked when he called
me,'' Coelho said of his telephone call from Gore last Wednesday.
``It was totally out of the blue. But I don't sense any panic or
urgency. What people don't understand is that this is a start-up
business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Tuesday in the Vice President's residence, where
Gore introduced Coelho to his top advisers, Coelho interrupted the
Vice President twice and and overruled him on decisions, several
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you're in charge,'' they quoted the vice president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, a range of Democratic politicians,
strategists and thinkers cautioned that not everything can be fixed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's closest advisers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was hopeful but not certain that Coelho would
force the vice president to stop micromanaging the campaign. ``The
important thing is not Tony,'' he said. ``The important thing is
that this may signal a willingness on his part to divorce himself
from the mechanics. One of the major problems has been that for
quite some time he has spent too much time being not only the
candidate but being the campaign.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a closed-door meeting at the Democratic Party headquarters on
Wednesday, a day after Coelho's hiring was announced, Gore's top
advisers met with more than 50 House Democrats to reassure them of
the vice president's viability. Craig Smith, the campaign manager,
and others sought to make their case by distributing polls showing
that Gore still holds a sizable lead over Bradley. But some House
members registered a range of concerns, including their fear that
Gore was ignoring key party constituencies, like minorities and
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we prefer to be 80 points up right now? Of course,''
said Rep. Bart Gordon of Tennessee, who helped organize the
session. ``But people recognize that the election is a year and a
half away, and that we're well positioned and that there's going to
be an ugly Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is well known _ and often ridiculed _ for his uncomfortable
campaign style, but several politicians said the president's advice
sounded appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a natural inclination for a lot of Democrats to say,
`Is there anyone else?' and to look for excitement,'' said Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, who is close to Gore. `He added, ``Al Gore's a
serious guy, and you've got to show people that you like what
you're doing and you like being out there with them and be open and
have a sense of humor, a sense of proportion. We don't elect kings
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the president said that he did not believe he
should play an active role in plotting campaign strategy and that
he has resisted entreaties from some of his aides to involve
himself more directly in the Gore operation.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers said Hillary Rodham Clinton was also
worried about the Gore campaign, but was not as focused on it as
the president. They noted that if Mrs. Clinton ran for Senate from
New York next year, her effort would suffer if Gore ran poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be happier if Gore were running well ahead of Bush?
The answer is, `Of course I would,''' said Al From, president of
the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group. ``I don't
think it's extraordinarily significant, but I do think it's an
early warning sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon expressed confidence that once Democrats become realistic
about their expectations they will become more satisfied with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married last year,'' he said. ``I'm 49 years old, and I
went out with a variety of people. But when you get married you're
not looking for a rock star. You're looking for, `Who do I want to
spend the rest of my life with?''' Sooner or later, he said,
``People might say, `I'm looking for someone who's dependable,
someone who understands the issues.'''

Hiss, son of Alger Hiss, in New York last week. In a potentially
groundbreaking ruling that could help resolve some of the enduring
mysteries of the cold war, a Federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday
ordered the government to unseal thousands of pages of secret grand

American secrets, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   A long-range Chinese missile, known as the Dong Feng-31, is
being equipped with a small nuclear warhead whose design uses
secret U.S. technology, according to the American intelligence
assessments. The technology is believed to have been stolen from a
government weapons laboratory, according to the intelligence
information, although there is some debate over precisely what
information officials believe is being used. The missile is
expected to be deployed within three or four years, according to
the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Since suspicions of Chinese nuclear espionage became public, the
Clinton administration has said that there is no evidence that
Beijing has actually deployed nuclear weapons that rely on stolen
U.S. secrets. Officials have said, for example, that China stole
design information about America's most advanced warhead, the W-88,
between 1984-1988. Yet they stress that while China has devloped a
test version with a similar design, it has not actually produced
such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with the warhead to be deployed on China's
DF-31 inter-continental ballistic missile, U.S. officials believe.
They say that this stolen U.S. warhead technology will help China
achieve its goal of building a modern nuclear arsenal that relies
on mobility to evade attacks. The DF-31 will be a truck-based
mobile missile that can be moved and thus will be hard to detect
and destroy.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear arsenal today is still much smaller and less
technically advanced than that of the United States. Yet the DF-31
and its new warhead represent a step forward in China's efforts to
present a more formidable nuclear presence. It also means that
China may soon be using stolen U.S. nuclear secrets on weapons
capable of hitting a wide range of countries, including those in
Europe, Asia and even the western United States. U.S. intelligence
estimates say that the DF-31 will have a range of approximately
5,000 miles. It is expected to be ready for deployment as soon as
2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DF-31 ICBM will give China a major strike capability that
will be difficult to counter-attack at any stage of its
operation,'' a 1996 Air Force intelligence report on the DF-31
stated. ``It will be a significant threat not only to U.S. forces
deployed in the Pacific theater, but to portions of the continental
United States and to many of our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that the new Chinese weapon will use
design technology from the American W-70 warhead, a small bomb
designed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   China stole secret design information about the W-70 from
Lawrence Livermore in the late 1970s or early 1980s, government
investigators believe. A scientist was fired from Lawrence
Livermore in 1981 in connection with the investigation into the
suspected theft, but no one has ever been arrested in the case. The
scientist has never been publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that China has used design
information from the ``primary'' of the W-70 to help develop the
advanced warhead that will be used on the DF-31 missile. The
``primary'' of a modern nuclear weapon is a small atomic bomb that
serves to ignite the ``secondary,'' a larger hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The W-70 warhead is also known as the neutron bomb, a weapon
that kills people with enhanced radiation while leaving buildings
intact. But its ``primary'' can be used in other, conventional
nuclear weapons as well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have based their belief of Chinese reliance on
U.S. design secrets for the new warhead in part by analyzing
Chinese nuclear tests in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Officials
believe those successful tests were of a small warhead that is
slated for use on the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have also based their estimates on
analysis of the range and payload capabilities of the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   Because this analysis is based partly on inferences, there is
still a debate within the U.S. intelligence community over which
U.S. nuclear secrets the Chinese are using. There is also
disagreement over the extent to which the DF-31's warhead will rely
on American technology, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a debate over how much design information of ours
they are using,'' said one official. ``This is a very sophisticated
piece of equipment, that was difficult for us to develop, so we
think it would be hard for them to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate, the broad conclusion that the DF-31 will
come equipped with a warhead that uses stolen U.S. technology is
included in two new secret government reports, officials said. Part
of one report from a select House committee is soon to be made
public. The other report is the result of a government-wide
intelligence assessment of the damage done to U.S. national
security by Chinese atomic espionage, according to officials. That
government-wide assessment, however, acknowledges the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified summary of the government-wide intelligence
assessment released last month stated that ``it is more likely that
the Chinese used U.S. design information to inform their own
program than to replicate U.S. weapons designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report does not name the specific warhead
design suspected of being stolen by China.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied allegations that it has stolen U.S. nuclear
secrets, and insists that its weapons are based on its own research
and development program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American intelligence community has suspected that China
stole W-70 design information from Lawrence Livermore since the
early 1980s, according to officials. The FBI investigation,
code-named Tiger Trap, never led to any arrests. But officials said
that the scientist who was fired as a result of the investigation
made a series of trips to China after he left the laboratory in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea that the stolen W-70 design technology was being
applied by China for use in its new generation of small warheads
for the DF-31 was a subject of intense controversy within American
intelligence agencies until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that it was not until last month's
government-wide damage assessment report on Chinese nuclear
espionage that many intelligence analysts began to connect the
theft of design secrets with the evidence gathered on the DF-31 and
the ongoing modernization of China's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The DF-31, a solid-fuel missile, would be the first Chinese
inter-continental ballistic missile that would be moved on roads.
China test-fired its rocket motor last July, and the missile was
scheduled to be flight tested last December, The Washington Times
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the missile has apparently been slower than
that of its warhead, officials believe. China conducted six or
seven tests of the two-stage warhead the United States expects to
be deployed on the DF-31, and completed that testing in the early
1990s. U.S. officials now believe the DF-31 will carry only one
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Once the DF-31 and other advanced missiles are deployed, China
is expected to begin to phase out its older and less accurate
ballistic missiles that carry large, bulky warheads. ``The DF-31
ICBM will give China a major strike capability that will be
difficult to counterattack at any stage of its operation, from
pre-flight mobile operations through the terminal flight phase,''
the 1996 Air Force intelligence report predicted. The ``road
mobility'' of the DF-31, the report adds, ``will greatly improve
Chinese nuclear ballistic missile survivability and will complicate
the task of defeating the Chinese threat.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that he had misread
Balkan history and he apologized for any past suggestions that
there is ``some Balkan disease'' that condemns all sides in
Yugoslavia to an endless cycle of ethnic blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that for centuries these people have lived
together in the Balkans and southeastern Europe with greater or
lesser degrees of tension, but often without anything approaching
the intolerable conditions and conflicts that exist today,'' he
said in a speech here to combat veterans of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Of the notion that the Yugoslavs are locked in implacable
hatreds, he said: ``I, myself, have been guilty of saying that on
an occasion or two, and I regret it now more than I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's 35-minute rumination on Kosovo came as the
fighting grinds into its eighth week, persisting longer than the
war in the Persian Gulf. The president acknowledged that Americans
are impatient with the pace of NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Clinton
warned against ``refugee fatigue'' and forcefully retold the
stories of Albanians who have been executed, raped and routed from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we see these pictures of the refugees on television
every night, and most people would like another story,'' Clinton
said. ``But we must not get refugee fatigue. We must not forget the
real victims of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was voicing a concern that Blair raised on Wednesday: that
without the ability to show pictures of the atrocities being
committed inside Kosovo, the news media would tire of repetitious
footage of fleeing refugees, and that reduced exposure to such
scenes could then weaken public support for the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the Serbs benefited by barring reporters from Kosovo,
because that factor, along with editorial boredom with the
refugees, was leading the media to highlight NATO mistakes like
last week's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, coverage
that cost NATO an edge in the propaganda war.
</P>
<P>
   Taking that argument to heart, Clinton tried to paint a
compelling portrait of the atrocities inside Kosovo, evoking images
of Hitler's slaughter of the Jews and detailing eyewitness accounts
of mass executions, rapes and people being set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic
extermination of the Holocaust,'' Clinton said, ``the two are
related _ both vicious, premeditated, systematic oppression fueled
by religious and ethnic hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Nine of every 10 Kosovar Albanians now has been
driven from their homes, thousands murdered, at least 100,000
missing, many young men led away in front of their families, over
500 cities, towns and villages burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The president uttered no new policy in his speech, but seemed
determined to clarify, again, the moral imperative for American
participation in a war in Europe that began March 24 and shows
little sign of ending.
</P>
<P>
   He called the campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' being carried out
in Kosovo by the forces of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, ``an affront to humanity and an attack not only on a
people but on the dignity of all people.''
</P>
<P>
   In saying he was mistaken to portray Balkan infighting as
inevitable, he said that Milosevic, like Hitler in Germany, had
been the catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on
their own without Hitler?'' Clinton asked. ``Was there something in
the history of the German race that made them do this? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside any half-measures _ like the partial withdrawal
of Milosevic's troops from Kosovo that was staged Thursday for
cameras that his forces controlled _ Clinton said that NATO would
continue its bombing campaign until Milosevic met the allies'
demands in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central imperative is this,'' Clinton said in his speech,
delivered at Fort McNair. ``The Kosovars must be able to return
home and live in safety. For this to happen, the Serb forces must
leave; partial withdrawals can only mean continued civil wars with
the Kosovar insurgence.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration played down any effect that
the internal political turmoil in Russia might have on diplomatic
efforts to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that Strobe
Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, was continuing to work
``constructively'' with the Russians and that he had detected no
setbacks despite President Boris Yeltsin's firing of Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was in Moscow for two days and had been expected to work
with the Russians on plans for the composition of an international
security force that would be stationed in Kosovo. He was headed to
Brussels for meetings at NATO offices and was also expected to meet
Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As he left Moscow, Talbott offered no new details, but said,
``There are many problems here, but there is reason for hope and we
must continue our diplomatic efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The harshest words of the day came from China, where fury still
raged at the United States for the embassy bombing, which killed
three Chinese. President Jiang Zemin said the United States was
using its economic and technological superiority to aggressively
expand its influence, pursue ``power politics and wantonly
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that despite Jiang's fiery public
comments, tensions with China appeared to be easing. David Leavy, a
spokesman for the National Security Council, said that in a visit
Thursday with the Chinese ambassador, Clinton said that the United
States would carry out a full investigation of the bombing and
would inform the Chinese people of its results.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the ambassador told Clinton that Jiang was now
ready to speak with him by telephone _ an overture that the Chinese
had rebuffed since the bombing. Leavy said that Jiang was trying to
reach Clinton and that the two leaders might talk as early as
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton signed a book of condolences for the
deaths, writing next to his signature: ``With profound grief and
sincere condolences to the victims, their families and the people
of China.''

BUSH BACKS COMPROMISE ON PARENT NOTIFICATION BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A delicate compromise on parental notification
fell apart Thursday, at least temporarily, amid sniping at
Republican Gov. George W. Bush by anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remained steadfast, however, in his support of a compromise
bill to notify parents when minors seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, the result of weeks of haggling between House
Republicans and a few key Democrats, is a substitute for Senate
Bill 30 by Republican Sen. Florence Shapiro of Plano. The agreement
would waive a waiting period for a girl whose parents bring her for
an abortion. In return, only a judge could decide if there is
justification for a girl not to tell her parents. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Even though the negotiated compromise was signed by various
parties, most of whom are conservative Republicans, an expected
favorable vote from the House State Affairs Committee was called
off late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, anti-abortion activists railed against the
compromise for allowing doctors stronger legal defenses against
criminal misdemeanor charges, which carried a punishment of a
possible one-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot support this legislation, and we would consider a
vote in favor of this language to be a pro-abortion vote,'' the
Texas Coalition for Parents' Rights said in a statement signed by
members of eight socially conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully disagree,'' Bush said at a press conference on
various legislative matters. ``I believe the bill we have discussed
would have accomplished the objective of reducing abortions in
Texas by having a strong parental notification bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important for us to pass a good parental
notification bill. This is a good opportunity to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, said he had
lost trust in Bush, whom he accused of not showing enough interest
in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the governor has to gain by alienating
members of the pro-life movement,'' Price said. ``It's going to
have to be negotiated by the governor. The governor's going to have
to come out of the mansion and engage himself in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Price also threatened that the anti-abortion movement would seek
to kill parental legislation this year if it contains the
protections for doctors against criminal charges now contained in
the compromise bill Bush said he supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have drawn the line in the sand,'' he said of the doctor
issue. Earlier, the anti-abortion forces had drawn the line over
allowing only a judge to bypass the parents, which the compromise
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Price added that he would rather believe the attorney for the
National Right to Life Committee in Washington, D.C., that the
compromise is an ``abortion doctor protection bill'' than he would
``a candidate running for president who wants desperately to pass a
piece of legislation to catch up with his little brother (Gov. Jeb
Bush of Florida).''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he understands that some people are casting the
dispute as one of presidential politics but insisted he's
attempting to do what's best for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the compromise deal could well be on again, after a
key Republican player in the controversial negotiations said she
had misunderstood the intentions of Rep. Patricia Gray,
D-Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and Rep. Dianne Delisi, R-Temple, have backed parental
notice legislation this year, but Delisi is the House sponsor of SB
30, which passed that chamber in March.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats, including Houston Reps. Kevin Bailey and
Debra Danburg, thought Delisi killed the compromise she had agreed
to under pressure from angry anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   Delisi, however, said Thursday evening that the real explanation
is a misunderstanding between her and Gray, for which Delisi takes
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Republican Caucus leader Ken Marchant of
Coppell said he had been asked to accept a ``code of silence'' on
the issue. He said that talks are now going on between Delisi and
Democrat Steve Wolens, chairman of the key committee and the
credited author of the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Wolens was not available for comment Thursday, but Delisi
indicated the confusion, at most, has stalled the compromise from
passing committee by just one more day. She said she signed an
agreement to support it, and she will honor that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation down here is that politics at this particular
time (in the last days of the session) is compromise,'' she said.
``I have always held to my agreement. The only reason for a delay
in time is I thought the door was open again for future
negotiations.''

BELGRADE BLACKED OUT AS NATO PLANES CONTINUE ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parts of Belgrade sustained a blackout Thursday
night as NATO warplanes struck at least one of the city's power
plants in the heaviest strike in the capital since the Chinese
Embassy bombing nearly a week ago, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian television reported that NATO bombers also dropped
short-circuiting graphite bombs against power plants in the cities
of Novi Sad and Nis, causing widespread power blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by surprisingly good weather, NATO scheduled 900 air
sorties over Yugoslavia Thursday. The number of sorties will
``continue to grow as the weather gets good and the aircraft
continue to arrive,'' said Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced its decision to send the last 176
airplanes requested by NATO to Europe over the next few weeks,
bringing the total fleet for this war to 1,259.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday onight's flights over Belgrade were the most intense
since three missiles were mistakenly dropped on the Chinese Embassy
last Friday, and NATO and the Pentagon insisted they will continue
striking targets in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that
President Slobodan Milosevic had miscalculated if he believed there
would be a letup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he believed that NATO would hit Belgrade hard,
night after night,'' Bacon said. ``It has, and it will continue to
do so,'' he added. ``I don't believe he felt that we would fly low
enough and often enough to have a big impact on his forces on the
ground in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO airstrikes focused again on Serbian ground troops in
Kosovo, striking at tanks, barracks and troop formations in the
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Wald announced that the 24 Apache attack helicopters that
arrived in Albania more than three weeks ago were now ready for
combat. There were delays in sending the Apaches to the country,
and once there two crashed in training accidents. In one crash, two
Air Force pilots died.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, said the
Apaches would be used ``very soon.'' However, Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO's supreme commander, has yet to request permission to deploy
the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials dismissed claims by Yugoslavia that
it was withdrawing troops from Kosovo, scoffing at footage that was
released Thursday showing 120 troops leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no signs of a legitimate withdrawal,'' said Bacon,
dismissing the television footage as a ``staged withdrawal, handful
of troops in starchy uniforms getting onto a shiny bus, smiling at
each other and driving away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also said the State Department's announcement on Monday
that the United States would begin airdrops to the displaced
Albanians in Kosovo was premature. The Pentagon is trying to find
some way to deliver food to the more than half a million stranded
Kosovars, he said.

DUKE RESEARCHERS ARE TAKEN ABACK BY HALT IN STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ As an expert on the effects of stress on health,
Dr. Redford Williams Jr. does not want to say he is hopping mad
about the abrupt shutdown this week of his and other federally
financed research at Duke University Medical Center. But he is
decidedly passionate about it.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his experiments were shut down on Tuesday, involving
$1.2 million in research costs and some 150 patients, including
some who were being taught ways to reduce their stress after heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just a bunch of adults playing in the sandbox
here,'' Williams said. ``Day to day we are working to save lives.
If we can reduce stress in patients, we believe we can prevent some
deaths. And now we have a halt to our research. As best I can tell,
the halt does not come because patients are being harmed, but
because there are administrative problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he added, ``we need to think about the harm that may
come from halting work.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators on Monday evening temporarily decertified
Duke University Medical Center as an institution eligible to do
research with federal financing. The investigators, from the Office
of Protection From Research Risks, found a number of apparent
violations of safety and ethics rules, and the university failed to
correct them for several months, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The violations cited by the government were chiefly failures at
Duke's Institutional Review Board, the body that reviews each
proposed human experiment. The board must follow federal rules in
determining which experiments are permitted, and what risks
patients may be subjected to. Twenty violations were found, ranging
from informed consent documents that may have given patients
incomplete information about what they were undertaking, to the
board's approval of experiments without complete review.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Duke officials met in Maryland with officials of
the agency charged with overseeing the safety of patients in human
experiments around the nation. After presenting a plan to correct
the deficiencies cited, the Duke officials characterized the
meeting as ``both collegial and productive'' and said they hoped to
get the research license reinstated soon.
</P>
<P>
   All over the sprawling medical center, doctors grappled with the
shutdown. Some patients who had traveled from other parts of the
nation to get blood tests or X-rays as they took part in
experiments had to be sent home without getting the work done, they
said. Researchers getting grant requests ready for June 1 deadlines
were delayed from finishing studies and analyzing the data they
will need to persuade grantors of the worth of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Specially trained nurses who work on experiments like the
testing of new drugs either now or soon may be on the payroll but
unable to do the work. The cost in his area, said Dr. Christopher
Granger, a cardiologist who runs a number of experiments that have
been stopped from bringing in new patients, could amount to a few
hundred to a few thousand dollars per patient if the delay lasts
more than a few days. Several dozen patients are included in his
studies, and the costs will begin to mount after a few days of no
new patient enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   The behavioral studies being conducted by Williams, who heads
the Behavioral Medicine Research Center, involve $1.2 million in
mostly federal money. Williams calculated that roughly $3,260 a day
would be lost if the decision remained in effect past a few days.
Asked if he would have to come up with new money to replace it, he
replied: ``No, I hope not. We will work much harder to try to make
up lost time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a point in a couple of weeks, researchers suggest, past
which time and money cannot be made up, and studies will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. K. Ranga Krishnan, chairman of the department of psychiatry
at Duke, said some 150 studies in his department had been
completely closed down. Asked his view of the federal investigators
and what they did, he replied: ``They are right. In this kind of
work they always must be right. After all, they are not doing this
to be mean. It is their job.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a positive side, he said, explaining, ``We are
certainly educating researchers about the importance of federal
oversight and evaluating risks.''

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NAZARETH, Israel _ New York cabbies are sissies.
 &HT;    Of course, everything is relative. En route to Israel last week,
I had a 10-hour layover at John F. Kennedy International and
decided to visit two friends. Trust me when I tell you that the
lane-changing sprint from JFK to Greenwich Village was a
beard-whitening experience. The return trip to the airport, just
after rush hour, was more frightening.
 &HT;    But a few seconds after renting a car at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion
International, I learned that the Big Apple's infamous hacks are
sweethearts when compared to Israeli drivers.
 &HT;    Nothing, not reading, not watching documentaries, not talking to
those who have driven there, prepares your mind and nerves for
driving in Israel. Even the most sobering statistic _ that 450
people die on Israeli roads each year, 2 1/2 times the rate of
northern Europe _ fails to convince the bold adventurer like me.
 &HT;    Make no mistake, though, after a week of executing
life-and-death maneuvers on the highways of the Holy Land, I am
beginning to question my sanity. Am I a bold journalist or a damned
fool? Yes, I have been to Israel before, but I was someone else's
passenger each time. I had never been behind the wheel.
 &HT;    I had not driven my Avis Subaru more than 20 yards when the
parking attendant, giving me the are-you-a-foreign-fool hand
gesture, hurled another rental toward me _ the wrong way. My
stomach tightened and I swerved. Suddenly, I recalled the book,
``The Travelers' Guide to Middle Eastern and North African Customs
&AMP; Manners,'' and these words: ``If at all possible, don't drive in
Israel. The country has more cars per kilometer than any other in
the world. And it's the leader in number of automobile accidents.''
 &HT;    Too late to turn back now, I said to myself as I pulled into the
rush-hour traffic on Highway 1, a modern, multilaned thoroughfare
to Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Because I had to read the road signs, which
are in Hebrew, Arab and English, I drove in the right lane as often
as possible to let speeders have their way. No matter. They honked
and glared, many tailgating me so closely that I wanted to park and
swim back to St. Petersburg. I am convinced that more than a few
Israelis and Palestinians delight in tormenting rental car drivers.
 &HT;    Anyway, after about 6 miles on Highway 2 through downtown Tel
Aviv, I had gained composure and was determined to complete the
two-hour drive north to the Marriott Hotel in Nazareth. Wanting to
arrive before sunset, I picked up speed, all the while trying to
watch traffic and read the road signs at the same time.
 &HT;    During the 115-mile trip to the hotel, I saw the aftermath of at
least five wrecks, one of them serious, and countless close calls
as cars, buses and huge trucks played chicken between the lines. In
Nazareth itself, where crowded, narrow, dusty streets snake around
the mountainsides, drivers cut off one another, run lights and
yield signs, execute illegal U-turns, turn without signaling, honk
incessantly, wave their arms and generally display an arrogance
unmatched anywhere _ including New York.
 &HT;    After arriving at the Marriott, I deposited my luggage and went
straight to the cafe for a bottle of Carmel Merlot.
 &HT;    Even though the drive from Ben-Gurion had been harrowing, I was
not prepared the next morning for the trip to Tiberius and the
Upper Galilee. The scenery of Galilee is breathtaking, with
mountains challenging the highest clouds, valleys burrowing toward
the Jordanian border and outcroppings of limestone settlements and
towns defining the distant landscape.
 &HT;    The urge is to lose oneself here, to let go and drink in all of
its beauty and majesty. You know better, however, because death is
a constant companion on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
 &HT;    When I was about a mile from the Church of the First Feeding of
the Multitude at Tabgha, for example, I thought that I was about to
see more than 100 people die. A loaded tour bus zoomed downhill
past me, traveling at more than 60 miles per hour. I could not
believe that the driver went around me. After all, a sharp curve
was just ahead. Surely, I thought, if I can see that other oncoming
bus rounding the curve, this driver, with his height advantage,
must also.
 &HT;    Even if he saw the other bus, the driver gunned the engine and
moved farther out into the passing lane _ in a no-passing zone. I
hit my brakes to put space between my Subaru and what I assumed
would be a deadly crash that would send debris, fuel and human
flesh into the air.
 &HT;    Perhaps because we were in this place _ where Christ is said to
have prayed with his disciples and walked on water _ the bus that
had passed me pulled hard to the right, avoiding a collision with
the other loaded vehicle by only a few yards. As soon as I came to
a designated ``panoramic view'' area, I parked and stared down to
the shimmering sea. A replica of a boat from the days of Jesus
sailed along the northern shore.
 &HT;    Are average Israelis trying to kill themselves, I wondered,
remembering a quote that travel researcher Dick Winter, a former
Israeli soldier, attributes to famous Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
Kolleck, when he was asked to explain Israelis' suicidal driving
habits: ``When you have to fight a war once every 10 years, safe
driving becomes the farthest thing from your mind.''
 &HT;    Fine. If Israelis want to commit suicide in their cars, that is
their business. They should remember, though, that some of their
visitors do not want to go down with them. Frankly, I am more
afraid of being killed by a reckless Israeli than I am by a
terrorist's bomb.

JOHNNY CHUNG'S RETORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Chung, the hustler and fund-raiser who received money
from Beijing bigwigs and deposited some of it in Democratic Party
coffers, told members of the House Government Reform Committee this
week a truth about campaign financing they probably did not want to
hear. ``I didn't create the system,'' Chung said. ``You did.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung's volleying of responsibility back to the legislators was
surely self-serving. No matter how unpracticed in the ways of
Washington he pretends to be, he knew that the Chinese general from
whom he accepted $300,000 was the chief of Beijing's military
intelligence. And when General Ji Shengde said that he and the
other Red millionaires ruling China liked President Clinton and
wanted some of their $300,000 to contribute to his reelection,
Chung had to sense not only that he had fallen into a rare
opportunity for easy money but that he was participating in
something illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Chung has fessed up, receiving a suspended jail
term and 3,000 hours of community service for cooperating with the
law. He should be heeded when he tells the people responsible for
the US campaign financing system that they have built a contraption
ideally suited for auctioning political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's 50 visits to the White House and the photographs he
garnered there of clients with the Clintons _ an asset he traded
upon during his business dealings in Asia _ depict this country as
a cut-rate version of the crony capitalisms Americans commonly
deride abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Chung says the politicians receiving his campaign contributions
_ which were returned after their dubious provenance was disclosed
_ did not at first know where they originated. Thus far there is no
proof Democratic Party officials knew they were accepting laundered
money from Chinese military intelligence. For the future,
corrective measures must focus on creating a cleaner and more
transparent campaign financing system and on warning Beijing that
US-Chinese relations, which are already troubled, can only get
worse if Beijing tries to meddle in American elections.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    NAZARETH, Israel _ New York cabbies are sissies.
 &HT;    Of course, everything is relative. En route to Israel last week,
I had a 10-hour layover at John F. Kennedy International and
decided to visit two friends. Trust me when I tell you that the
lane-changing sprint from JFK to Greenwich Village was a
beard-whitening experience. The return trip to the airport, just
after rush hour, was more frightening.
 &HT;    But a few seconds after renting a car at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion
International, I learned that the Big Apple's infamous hacks are
sweethearts when compared to Israeli drivers.
 &HT;    Nothing, not reading, not watching documentaries, not talking to
those who have driven there, prepares your mind and nerves for
driving in Israel. Even the most sobering statistic _ that 450
people die on Israeli roads each year, 2 1/2 times the rate of
northern Europe _ fails to convince the bold adventurer like me.
 &HT;    Make no mistake, though, after a week of executing
life-and-death maneuvers on the highways of the Holy Land, I am
beginning to question my sanity. Am I a bold journalist or a damned
fool? Yes, I have been to Israel before, but I was someone else's
passenger each time. I had never been behind the wheel.
 &HT;    I had not driven my Avis Subaru more than 20 yards when the
parking attendant, giving me the are-you-a-foreign-fool hand
gesture, hurled another rental toward me _ the wrong way. My
stomach tightened and I swerved. Suddenly, I recalled the book,
``The Travelers' Guide to Middle Eastern and North African Customs
&AMP; Manners,'' and these words: ``If at all possible, don't drive in
Israel. The country has more cars per kilometer than any other in
the world. And it's the leader in number of automobile accidents.''
 &HT;    Too late to turn back now, I said to myself as I pulled into the
rush-hour traffic on Highway 1, a modern, multilaned thoroughfare
to Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Because I had to read the road signs, which
are in Hebrew, Arab and English, I drove in the right lane as often
as possible to let speeders have their way. No matter. They honked
and glared, many tailgating me so closely that I wanted to park and
swim back to St. Petersburg. I am convinced that more than a few
Israelis and Palestinians delight in tormenting rental car drivers.
 &HT;    Anyway, after about 6 miles on Highway 2 through downtown Tel
Aviv, I had gained composure and was determined to complete the
two-hour drive north to the Marriott Hotel in Nazareth. Wanting to
arrive before sunset, I picked up speed, all the while trying to
watch traffic and read the road signs at the same time.
 &HT;    During the 115-mile trip to the hotel, I saw the aftermath of at
least five wrecks, one of them serious, and countless close calls
as cars, buses and huge trucks played chicken between the lines. In
Nazareth itself, where crowded, narrow, dusty streets snake around
the mountainsides, drivers cut off one another, run lights and
yield signs, execute illegal U-turns, turn without signaling, honk
incessantly, wave their arms and generally display an arrogance
unmatched anywhere _ including New York.
 &HT;    After arriving at the Marriott, I deposited my luggage and went
straight to the cafe for a bottle of Carmel Merlot.
 &HT;    Even though the drive from Ben-Gurion had been harrowing, I was
not prepared the next morning for the trip to Tiberius and the
Upper Galilee. The scenery of Galilee is breathtaking, with
mountains challenging the highest clouds, valleys burrowing toward
the Jordanian border and outcroppings of limestone settlements and
towns defining the distant landscape.
 &HT;    The urge is to lose oneself here, to let go and drink in all of
its beauty and majesty. You know better, however, because death is
a constant companion on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
 &HT;    When I was about a mile from the Church of the First Feeding of
the Multitude at Tabgha, for example, I thought that I was about to

 &HT;    
 &HT;    I've always liked the word ``euphemism.'' There are just some
words that sort of roll around on the tongue and are fun to say.
This word is one of them. But it can be used in the wrong way.
 &HT;    A professor of English I had many years ago had his own special
words for euphemisms. He called them ``Nice-Nellyisms.'' One
example he gave was in a story about Winston Churchill. It seems
the British prime minister was invited to a state dinner in
Washington. The lady known as ``The Hostess with the Mostess,''
Perle Mesta, arranged the seating so that she could be next to the
prime minister. When Churchill asked for the breast of the chicken,
Ms. Mesta whispered in his ear, ``In America we are very discreet
and we refer to the breast of the chicken as the white meat.''
Churchill nodded and continued with his meal.
 &HT;    A few years later Churchill had the duty of awarding medals to
several Americans, Ms. Mesta among them. As he approached Perle
with medal in hand he whispered in her ear, ``Pardon me, while I
pin this medal on your white meat.''
 &HT;    That is what my professor referred to as ``Nice-Nellyisms.''
 &HT;    Laid to rest, gone to the great beyond, met his maker, journeyed
to the spirit world, pushing up daisies, or has gone to a better
place, are just a few of the euphemisms to describe death.
 &HT;    For deaf people we now have hearing impaired. For bald people
some now say follicle impaired. Children once referred to as
retarded are now children with a learning disability. Some would
say these are politically correct expressions rather than
euphemisms.
 &HT;    When it comes to gender distinction we have created an entirely
new vocabulary. Instead of the stewardess on airplanes we now have
flight attendants. Our old reliable mailman is now a mailperson.
Chairman of the board is now chairperson. And on and on.
 &HT;    I thought about these things when the words ``ethnic cleansing''
kept bouncing around the airwaves. It put me in mind of the
euphemisms used by the Nazis during World War II. When they first
started to move Jews from their homes to concentration camps they
called it ``relocation.'' When they got real serious about
exterminating the Jewish population of Europe, they called it ``the
final solution.''
 &HT;    Ethnic cleansing is genocide pure and simple. Creating a
``Nice-Nellyism'' to soften its meaning does not change the end
result. It is still genocide.
 &HT;    In early America, Manifest Destiny meant that God had chosen a
race of people to occupy a land. To the American Indians the words
still meant genocide.
 &HT;    If an errant bomb or missile strikes a civilian neighborhood
killing and maiming many people, the carnage is known as
``collateral damage.'' If an attack by artillery or bombers strikes
its own forces by mistake and incur casualties, this is known as
being killed by ``friendly fire.''
 &HT;    In the Lakota language, a very ancient language, it would be
very difficult to create euphemisms. There are many words nearly
impossible to translate into English. In fact, there were no words
in Lakota for key, jail or prison because these objects or
facilities did not exist in the pre-colonization land of the
Lakota.
 &HT;    When euphemisms are used to dilute or soften the meaning of
words because they are offensive or cruel, perhaps this carries
things too far into dishonesty. Ethnic cleansing is genocide and it
should be referred to as such. Because Nazis used the phrase ``The
Final Solution'' to describe the murder of millions of Jews, it did
not make it easier on those being murdered.
 &HT;    To me, euphemisms are amusing only when they are not used to
cover or disguise an evil deed. Winston Churchill could have told
you that.

and we refer to the breast of the chicken as the white meat.''
Churchill nodded and continued with his meal.
 &HT;    A few years later Churchill had the duty of awarding medals to
several Americans, Ms. Mesta among them. As he approached Perle
with medal in hand he whispered in her ear, ``Pardon me, while I
pin this medal on your white meat.''
 &HT;    That is what my professor referred to as ``Nice-Nellyisms.''
 &HT;    Laid to rest, gone to the great beyond, met his maker, journeyed
to the spirit world, pushing up daisies, or has gone to a better
place, are just a few of the euphemisms to describe death.
 &HT;    For deaf people we now have hearing impaired. For bald people
some now say follicle impaired. Children once referred to as
retarded are now children with a learning disability. Some would
say these are politically correct expressions rather than
euphemisms.
 &HT;    When it comes to gender distinction we have created an entirely
new vocabulary. Instead of the stewardess on airplanes we now have
flight attendants. Our old reliable mailman is now a mailperson.
Chairman of the board is now chairperson. And on and on.
 &HT;    I thought about these things when the words ``ethnic cleansing''
kept bouncing around the airwaves. It put me in mind of the
euphemisms used by the Nazis during World War II. When they first
started to move Jews from their homes to concentration camps they
called it ``relocation.'' When they got real serious about
exterminating the Jewish population of Europe, they called it ``the
final solution.''
 &HT;    Ethnic cleansing is genocide pure and simple. Creating a
``Nice-Nellyism'' to soften its meaning does not change the end
result. It is still genocide.
 &HT;    In early America, Manifest Destiny meant that God had chosen a
race of people to occupy a land. To the American Indians the words
still meant genocide.
 &HT;    If an errant bomb or missile strikes a civilian neighborhood
killing and maiming many people, the carnage is known as
``collateral damage.'' If an attack by artillery or bombers strikes
its own forces by mistake and incur casualties, this is known as
being killed by ``friendly fire.''
 &HT;    In the Lakota language, a very ancient language, it would be
very difficult to create euphemisms. There are many words nearly
impossible to translate into English. In fact, there were no words
in Lakota for key, jail or prison because these objects or
facilities did not exist in the pre-colonization land of the
Lakota.
 &HT;    When euphemisms are used to dilute or soften the meaning of
words because they are offensive or cruel, perhaps this carries
things too far into dishonesty. Ethnic cleansing is genocide and it
should be referred to as such. Because Nazis used the phrase ``The
Final Solution'' to describe the murder of millions of Jews, it did
not make it easier on those being murdered.
 &HT;    To me, euphemisms are amusing only when they are not used to
cover or disguise an evil deed. Winston Churchill could have told
you that.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Premise No. 1 among those working to strangle immigration _
legal and illegal _ into the United States, is that we don't need
newcomers because there are plenty of Americans to do the work in
the largest economy in the world. WRONG!
 &HT;    Welfare and unemployed people, they maintain, can fill all the
jobs. WRONG!
 &HT;    Raise wages and better working conditions and people will flock
to the fields to earn $10 an hour or more, they claim. WRONG!
 &HT;    During harvest season in California's San Joaquin Valley,
perhaps the greatest agricultural complex in world history, a
quarter of a million workers are needed to harvest dozens of crops.
The 1998 work force was shy 80,000 workers. That's more people than
hundreds of cities in the country. Is this for real? Yes, according
to Manuel Cunha, president of the Nisei Farmers League of Fresno,
California.
 &HT;    Oregon and Washington labor contractors were raiding California
fields for workers by paying $75 bounties and free transportation.
``Contractors were pulling workers off the fields,'' Cunha told the
Los Angeles Times.
 &HT;    There was such a worker shortage in the Fresno area that the
raisin harvest was lengthened by a month. Nevertheless, grapes were
still lost.
 &HT;    There are people who don't believe the farmers. They are people
like the ultra-liberal Farm Worker's Union, and ultra-conservatives
like Pat Buchanan, David Duke, and the Federation of Americans for
Immigration Reform (FAIR). Anti-immigrant advocates (they call
themselves `immigration reformers') would like fewer immigrants
altogether, but would select immigrants who are preferably white,
Protestant and Northern European. As usual, however, the facts
prove them wrong. Why?
 &HT;    A lack of farm labor is just one shortage caused by
anti-immigrant restrictions forced on the American economy in
recent years. Other examples are the hospitals that are having to
cut services because of workers shortages. St. Bernard's Hospital
in the Chicago suburb of Englewood threatened to shut down because
of a lack of nurses. Into the breach stepped Democratic Rep. Bobby
Rush, formerly of the Black Panthers, with an emergency bill to
allow 500 foreign nurses into the country to staff hospitals like
St. Bernard's.
 &HT;    California's St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard has
announced that it will close acute-care wings and drop some
elective surgeries _ for lack of nurses.
 &HT;    Foreign nurses ``work mostly evenings, nights, weekends and in
areas where majority (white) nurses will not work,'' states Barbara
Nichols, head of the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing
Schools. She points out that; ``foreign-educated nurses have been
used to fill the gaps.''
 &HT;    Not enough nurses, not enough farm workers, and this is merely
the beginning. Hi-tech industries in Silicon Valley, San Diego and
Boston are suffering from labor shortages. There are 300,000 empty
hi-tech job billets. And, hi-tech is the one field in which
Congress has loosened the curbs and doubled the number of foreign
workers permitted. These are high-pay jobs going begging. It will
get worse.
 &HT;    In the fields, Fresno farmers raised wages 20 percent last
summer and asked the state for welfare and unemployed people and
were sent 1 percent of their required workers.
 &HT;    The shortage of workers is fueled by something else, too,
besides the unwillingness of Americans to work in the fields or in
inner-city hospitals, and that is the hammer of tighter immigrant
control at the border and in the hinterland. On the one hand, the
Border Patrol has been beefed up with several thousand new agents
and they have clamped the border down at all the usual places where
illegals used to cross with impunity.
 &HT;    Recently, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
announced that it was going to comb the personnel records of
Midwestern meat-packing plants to weed out and run out of their
jobs any immigrants they suspected of using forged or false
documents in applying for jobs. Such was the case recently in the
Yakima Valley of the State of Washington where the INS forced
employers to fire over 500 workers whom the INS suspected of
circumventing regulations by giving employers false documents.
 &HT;    A crisis is building throughout the country and it is a direct
result of anti-immigrant hysteria and people who are uncomfortable
with the race, religion and ethnicity of America today. But in
their success there is danger.
 &HT;    ``We've lost asparagus, cauliflower. Broccoli, peaches, grapes.
These are things I know for a fact. It's statewide and it's
nationwide.'' So says Steve Scaroni, president of the Imperial
Valley Vegetable Growers Association.
 &HT;    And so say I. The situation will get worse. Our booming economy
will slow because there aren't enough workers. Laying the blame for
the end of the booming '90s will be easy this time.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Are civil rights _ that is, the fight for equality and civil
liberties for African Americans _ and gay rights really a common
struggle?
 &HT;    All three panelists from left and right of the political
spectrum _ State Rep. Jarrett Barrios, the Rev. Peter Gomes, and
Patricia Ireland _ answered with a resounding ``yes'' at a recent
forum held at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
 &HT;    Sponsored by the Kennedy School's gay student group, the Women
and Public Policy Program, and the student advisory committee of
the Institute of Politics, the event drew more than 200 people _
standing room only.
 &HT;    Gomes, Harvard's Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and
minister in the university's Memorial Church, provided a
comparative perspective. Gomes, who is gay, African American, and
Republican, said that from the time of the Civil War onward the
term ``civil rights'' applied almost universally _ much like a
copyright _ to the rights of African Americans.
 &HT;    Then came the issue of gays in the military.
 &HT;    ``When I tried to promulgate the parity and equity question
between gays in the military and the integration of the armed
services by President Truman at the end of the Second World, a
great howl was raised, frankly on the part of African Americans,
who felt that their copyright on the struggle was somehow being
infringed, that there somehow was a moral distinction to be made
between civil rights, capital C, capital R, and whatever it was
that gay people seemed to feel the country owed them,'' Gomes said.
 &HT;    Continuing, ``This revealed a tremendous fissure in our moral
and our legal universe in this country, part of the divisioning ...
by which no rights get accorded to everybody because everybody with
a few rights defends his or her territory absolutely and feels that
sharing of rights in some respect makes vulnerable the rights
heretofore won and compromises the integrity of the enterprise,''
he said.
 &HT;    But for those who lack the moral imagination and civic courage
to see that gay rights are not special rights _ rather civil
liberties entitled to everybody _ Patricia Ireland, president of
the National Organization for Women, makes the necessary
connections.
 &HT;    ``We support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered issues
for the same reason we support ending racism or bias on ethnicity _
nobody should be discriminated against because of an accident of
birth,'' she said.
 &HT;    ``We support lesbian and gay issues for the same reason we
support non-discrimination based on religion: if it's something you
choose _ and most of us, even those of us who are born into a
particular religion, choose our religion as adults _ you shouldn't
face discrimination,'' Ireland said.
 &HT;    ``We support lesbian and gay civil rights for the same reason we
support abortion rights because in the very intimate area of our
lives, sexuality or reproduction, we don't think that we should
have interference with our privacy,'' she said.
 &HT;    ``As a matter of a pragmatic political position, there is no
question that lesbian and gay rights are part of the feminist
agenda,'' Ireland said. ``It's also a principled position.''
 &HT;    Barrios _ the first openly gay man elected to the Massachusetts
legislature and one of three Latino representatives _ also said
that gay rights and civil rights were similar. They ``are not
something that can be divorced. Both are the legally and morally
distinguishable part within us that motivates us to be imaginative
and indignant about issues, about how we are going to overcome
them. It's clear from that part of you that wants to change the
world whether you are gay or Latino,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gay rights and civil rights are one in the same _ no matter
what's considered: fair housing, employment, or even civil
marriage, Barrios said.
 &HT;    All three panelists agreed that the right to same-sex civil
marriage is the current hot button issue; and as Gomes said, the
``blessing of same-sex ceremonies, not a substitute for marriage,
even that raises cultural hackles.''
 &HT;    Gomes went on to say that the ``secular order will drive the
religious order to do the right thing. If one had waited for
churches to lead the civil rights movement, we'd all be at the back
of the bus ... for better or worse the culture has to have this
debate.''
 &HT;    Continuing, ``as a Christian minister it scandalizes and
embarrasses me to say that in so many movements for the liberation
of the spirit, the religious community is on the sidelines, waiting
to see how it turns out,'' he said.
 &HT;    That's truly a shame since so much opposition to civil rights
and equality for gay people stems from organized religion and
misinterpretation of the Bible.
 &HT;    Ecclesiastical courage, coupled with moral imagination and civic
valor, could go a long way in the common struggle for equality and
civil liberties for all _ gay and straight.

religious order to do the right thing. If one had waited for
churches to lead the civil rights movement, we'd all be at the back
of the bus ... for better or worse the culture has to have this
debate.''
 &HT;    Continuing, ``as a Christian minister it scandalizes and
embarrasses me to say that in so many movements for the liberation
of the spirit, the religious community is on the sidelines, waiting
to see how it turns out,'' he said.
 &HT;    That's truly a shame since so much opposition to civil rights
and equality for gay people stems from organized religion and
misinterpretation of the Bible.
 &HT;    Ecclesiastical courage, coupled with moral imagination and civic
valor, could go a long way in the common struggle for equality and
civil liberties for all _ gay and straight.

 &HT;    (Kirsten Chapman writes a weekly column for the Columbus
Dispatch in Columbus, Ohio, and is the author of three books,
including recently published ``The Way Home.'')

 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1948, Dinah Shore filled the air with ``Buttons and Bows,''
Citation became the eighth horse in racing history to win the
Triple Crown and Harry. S. Truman was re-elected president of the
United States.
 &HT;    That spring, 36-year-old Thelma Lien boarded a bus in her
Wisconsin hometown of Beloit and headed for Kenosha 2 1/2 hours
away.
 &HT;    ``A friend had mentioned that somebody needed a
bookkeeping-machine operator, so I took a chance,'' she recalled
recently.
 &HT;    The job had fallen through, though, but then she learned that a
Kenosha doctor needed a secretary. Fortunately, she knew shorthand.
 &HT;    ``I was scared stiff,'' she said, remembering the day she
climbed the white marble steps of the old Kenosha Clinic for her
interview.
 &HT;    Yet she found my father, 41 at the time, ``congenial and easy to
talk to. The next thing I knew, I was hired,'' she said.
 &HT;    ``I was a jack-of-all-trades; anything that concerned the
office, I took care of.''
 &HT;    She not only filled the role of the receptionist but also
balanced the books, did the banking and kept the files. She was
known to even wash the windows and scrub the floors.
 &HT;    One time, during dictation, the building janitor appeared
suddenly, so scared he was stuttering. After calming him down, Dad
and Thelma discovered what had frightened him: An arm from the
clinic skeleton had dropped from the rafters onto his shoulder
while he was cleaning the basement.
 &HT;    They thought they'd have to conduct a funeral to dispose of the
deteriorating bones. ``But Dr. Swift, who taught radiology classes
at the hospital, took it off our hands.''
 &HT;    Thelma, who doesn't drive, lived close enough to walk to work.
Conveniently, she had an apartment overlooking Library Park _ for,
as she said, ``My nose is always in a book.''
 &HT;    Sometimes she had us kids over for dinner. On one occasion she
served orange-juice ``cocktails'' and lobster tails to make us feel
grown up.
 &HT;    And she and my mother shared a mutual admiration, each one
helping the other.
 &HT;    Thelma first baby-sat for us right after my brother, the fourth
and youngest, was born. When she stayed a week or two, she asked in
the morning what we wanted for dinner.
 &HT;    Excitement waited to happen until she came to visit: Once, the
water heater broke and flooded the basement.
 &HT;    Another time, down in the basement, my toddler brother looked up
and asked, ``Why is that man coming through the window?''
 &HT;    Thelma, unintimidated, scared him off. The police found only his
tools.
 &HT;    Many years later, the 85-year-old woman who served my father for
more than three decades continues to be a fountain of information.
 &HT;    ``Whatever happened to that old x-ray machine that Dad used to
have in his office?'' I wondered..
 &HT;    ``He sold it to Dr. Schmick for a dollar.''
 &HT;    ``Why did he keep anise candy in his top right desk drawer?''
 &HT;    ``Frank Christiansen knew he liked it; he always brought him
some whenever he had an appointment.''
 &HT;    Of her 32-years with Dad, she said: ``The time went so fast, it
seemed as though it stood still. My job was enjoyable. I was a
member of your family. It was a perfect way.''
 &HT;    For Thelma, he was never Leif, always ``Dr. Lokvam.''
 &HT;    ``No one could ever say anything against Dr. Lokvam in front of
me.''
 &HT;    After a national day to honor secretaries was initiated in 1952,
Dad (``when he wasn't in surgery'') would take her to lunch.
 &HT;    ``We might just go and get a hamburger, but it was
entertainment,'' she said.
 &HT;    In her apartment, Thelma still displays a picture of my father,
a photograph taken in his prime, when together they saved the
world.
 &HT;    ``He was like a brother to me,'' she said.
 &HT;    Although he has been gone for seven years, she still sees him
every day.
 &HT;    I can't imagine a more loyal secretary. Or a luckier boss.

   ISRAEL, THE LAND OF DRIVING ADVENTURE. Nothing, not reading, not
watching documentaries, not talking to those who have driven there,
prepares your mind and nerves for driving in Israel, writes
columnist Bill Maxwell, on assignment in the Middle East. ``After a
week of executing life-and-death maneuvers on the highways of the
Holy Land, I am beginning to question my sanity,'' he admits. But
more importantly he wonders about the sanity of Israelis. Former
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kolleck was once quoted as explaining: ``When
you have to fight a war once every 10 years, safe driving becomes
the farthest thing from your mind.'' Not much comfort to the
intrepid reporter.

   EUPHEMISMS COVER UGLY TRUTH: `ETHNIC CLEANSING' MEANS GENOCIDE.
Thinking about the many euphemisms used today often to disguise
truth, the words ``ethnic cleansing'' put columnist Tim Giago in
mind of the expressions ``relocation'' and ``the final solution''
used by the Nazis during World War II. ``In early America,
`Manifest Destiny' meant that God had chosen a race of people to
occupy a land,'' he writes. ``To the American Indians those words
meant genocide ... for, in the Lakota language, a very ancient
language, it would be very difficult to create such euphemisms.''
Ethnic cleansing is genocide pure and simple, he declares.
``Creating a euphemism to soften its meaning does not change the
end result. It is still genocide.''

   LABOR SHORTAGES THREATEN U.S. ECONOMY. The premises that America
doesn't need immigration because there are plenty of U.S. citizens
to do the work in the largest economy in the world, or that welfare
and unemployed people can fill all the jobs, or that by raising
wages and better working conditions people will flock to the fields
to earn $10 an hour or more, are all WRONG! states columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. The realities of strict immigration and migration
controls are severe shortages of farm laborers, meat packers,
hospital nurses and hi-tech workers, to name just a few of the
industries suffering serious losses. ``This could dramatically slow
down our booming economy,'' Contreras notes somberly.

   EQUALITY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES FOR ALL. Are civil rights _ the
fight for equality and civil liberties for African Americans _ and
gay rights really a common struggle? All three panelists from left
and right of the political spectrum, attending a recent forum held
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, answered with a
resounding ``yes,'' reports columnist Chuck Colbert. Panelist
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women,
made it clearer: ``We support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgendered issues for the same reason we support ending racism
or bias on ethnicity _ nobody should be discriminated against
because of an accident of birth.''

   MOST LOYAL SECRETARY; LUCKIER BOSS. Her father's secretary
Thelma has become an enduring piece of her family history, writes
columnist Kirsten Chapman. The woman, now 85, who served her father
for 32 years, recalls every detail of those years beginning in
1948: ``I was a jack-of-all-trades,'' she says, ``anything that
concerned the office, I took care of.'' She not only filled the
role of the receptionist but also balanced the books, did the
banking and kept the files, and was known to even wash the windows
and scrub the floors on occasion. ``The time went so fast,'' she
tells Chapman now, ``it seemed as though it stood still. My job was
enjoyable. I was a member of your family. It was a perfect way.''

   EUPHEMISMS COVER UGLY TRUTH: `ETHNIC CLEANSING' MEANS GENOCIDE.
Thinking about the many euphemisms used today often to disguise
truth, the words ``ethnic cleansing'' put columnist Tim Giago in
mind of the expressions ``relocation'' and ``the final solution''
used by the Nazis during World War II. ``In early America,
`Manifest Destiny' meant that God had chosen a race of people to
occupy a land,'' he writes. ``To the American Indians those words
meant genocide ... for, in the Lakota language, a very ancient
language, it would be very difficult to create such euphemisms.''
Ethnic cleansing is genocide pure and simple, he declares.
``Creating a euphemism to soften its meaning does not change the
end result. It is still genocide.''

   LABOR SHORTAGES THREATEN U.S. ECONOMY. The premises that America
doesn't need immigration because there are plenty of U.S. citizens
to do the work in the largest economy in the world, or that welfare
and unemployed people can fill all the jobs, or that by raising
wages and better working conditions people will flock to the fields
to earn $10 an hour or more, are all WRONG! states columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. The realities of strict immigration and migration
controls are severe shortages of farm laborers, meat packers,
hospital nurses and hi-tech workers, to name just a few of the
industries suffering serious losses. ``This could dramatically slow
down our booming economy,'' Contreras notes somberly.

   EQUALITY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES FOR ALL. Are civil rights _ the
fight for equality and civil liberties for African Americans _ and
gay rights really a common struggle? All three panelists from left

resounding ``yes,'' reports columnist Chuck Colbert. Panelist
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women,

   MOST LOYAL SECRETARY; LUCKIER BOSS. Her father's secretary
Thelma has become an enduring piece of her family history, writes
columnist Kirsten Chapman. The woman, now 85, who served her father
for 32 years, recalls every detail of those years beginning in
1948: ``I was a jack-of-all-trades,'' she says, ``anything that
concerned the office, I took care of.'' She not only filled the
role of the receptionist but also balanced the books, did the
banking and kept the files, and was known to even wash the windows
and scrub the floors on occasion. ``The time went so fast,'' she
tells Chapman now, ``it seemed as though it stood still. My job was
enjoyable. I was a member of your family. It was a perfect way.''

GOP-CONTROLLED HOUSE PANEL SEEKS TO CUT NASA PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House Science Committee
wants to scrap NASA's Triana project, a camera-equipped satellite
pushed by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The panel voted 21-18 along party lines Thursday to prohibit the
space agency from spending money on the project, which would
broadcast live, round-the-clock video images of Earth over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members also decided against spending any more
taxpayer money on an inflatable habitat for the international space
station, a project called TransHab being developed at Johnson Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to pull the plug on U.S. involvement in the
international space station was rejected by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibitions were written into so-called ``authorization''
legislation outlining NASA spending priorities over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The measure envisions the agency receiving $41.2 billion as part
of the federal budget through 2002, slightly more than requested by
the Clinton administration. The bill now goes to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   NASA this year will spend about $35 million on the Triana
project, which Gore convinced the agency to tackle in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Named for Rodrigo de Triana, the sailor who first spotted the
New World on Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492, the satellite is
scheduled for launch aboard a space shuttle in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once released by the shuttle, the satellite would be guided to
its permanent station about halfway between Earth and the sun. The
new spacecraft would carry a small telescope and a high-definition
camera.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being available to Internet users, images of the
sun-splashed Earth would be used by scientists to study weather
patterns, cloud formations, oceans and the planet's vegetation
canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the project ``a multimillion-dollar screen saver,'' Rep.
Dave Weldon, R-Fla., led the effort to shift $35 million requested
for Triana into cancer and microbiology research overseen by the
space agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has ``cut NASA's budget year after
year, and then turns around and proposes tripe science like
Triana,'' Weldon complained. ``Maybe NASA can't stand up to the
White House, but the U.S. Congress certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., accused Republicans of trying to kill
the enterprise in ``a misguided partisan effort'' to harm Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a tremendous education tool that all schools
would have access to and be a treasure chest of resources'' for
scientists and weather forecasters, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   If the authorization bill clears both the House and Senate
without the Triana project, NASA administrator Dan Goldin has told
lawmakers, he will urge President Clinton to veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years, NASA has operated under guidance
Congress has provided in annual ppropriations legislation and an
authorization bill passed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While congressional budget-writers will have the final say on
how much will be allocated for 2000, House Science Committee
members recommended fully funding NASA's request for the space
station and space shuttle programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA's streamlining and reform efforts over the past few years
have strongly improved our space operations,'' said Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif. and chairman of the House space subcommittee.
``This legislation builds on this by both increasing NASA's budget
and pushing NASA to continue on the reform path.''
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Science Committee Chairman James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., the bill prohibits any funding for TransHab,
which NASA is developing to provide space explorers more room on
long missions.
</P>
<P>
   Set for launch in 2004 as one of the final components of the
space station, TransHab would provide crews a three-level habitat.
One level would be sleeping quarters, another a gymnasium and the
third, a large galley. Its estimated cost is $80 million more than
the crew quarters in the current design.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, had planned to push for removal of
the TransHab spending restriction, but faced opposition from
Sensenbrenner and his Republican allies. Lampson said he might try
to amend the authorization bill when it reaches the House floor,
possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tie the hands of NASA scientists to keep them from finding
better, safer, more efficient ways to improve the living space of
astronauts is unbelievable,'' said Lampson, whose district includes
the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said he is not opposed to the concept, merely to
the idea of redrawing space station components five years after the
U.S. and its international partners adopted the current design.
``We're sticking to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space station almost got killed (in 1993) because we had
eight years of perpetual redesigning,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``I
don't want to get back on that track.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the committee approved the NASA authorization bill, a
provision pushed by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, was added to
include minority facilities in the agency's academic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee's proposal would ensure that almost half the $387.8
million spent by NASA on academic programs over the next three
years would go into minority education and research programs. In
addition, just over $100 million of that amount would be spent at
historically black colleges and universities under her proposal.

NBC EDITS `NUCLEAR WASTE' FROM MINISERIES, AND OUTSIDE PRESSURE IS
CHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Idaho, Nev.)  (rk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What began as a generic disaster movie about a runaway train has
turned into an unusual damage-control exercise for NBC, which went
to great lengths to redub ``Atomic Train,'' a two-part miniseries
to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday nights, to delete all
references to nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. senator, in a speech Thursday, accused NBC of bowing to
pressure from the nuclear power industry. But NBC executives say
the only pressure came from the network's own chief censor, who
stepped in after the entertainment division's promotions department
had put out news releases that wrongly portrayed the miniseries as
a fact-based docudrama.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries' plot involves a train traveling from Idaho to
Colorado carrying nuclear waste _ now being redubbed as ``hazardous
material'' _ as well as a Russian-made nuclear bomb secretly tucked
on board by the bad guys. When the train's brakes fail as it
hurtles toward Denver, the hero (played by Rob Lowe) must try to
stop it. When the train crashes, the ``hazardous material'' catches
fire, and the nuclear bomb explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Atomic Train'' is fictional, the issue of safety in
transporting nuclear waste is a real concern, especially to Sen.
Richard H. Bryan, a D-Nev., whose state is the site of proposed
nuclear waste repositories still being haggled over in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a speech on the Senate floor, Bryan questioned
whether NBC had redubbed ``Atomic Train'' in deference to the
nuclear power industry, since NBC's parent company, General
Electric, has a nuclear energy unit. While admitting he had no
proof, the senator said it seemed ``extraordinary'' that the
network would go to such lengths to change a movie a week before it
was scheduled to be broadcast, and after releasing reams of
promotional material on it.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC argues the flip side of that coin, saying it would not
have gone to the cost (estimated by industry sources as tens of
thousands of dollars) and trouble of redubbing unless it believed
it had a responsibility to viewers not to mislead them. The network
says it could simply have put disclaimers on the miniseries to
remind viewers that it was fictional.
</P>
<P>
   NBC revised its account from Wednesday to Thursday. At first,
NBC executives said nuclear waste was not typically carried by
train, making the miniseries grossly inaccurate. Later they said
that nuclear products might be carried by train, but would not be
carried in boxcars, as the miniseries depicted. Ultimately, they
said the problem was that the drama was being promoted as
fact-based and had never been ``vetted'' for factual accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives say part of the problem is that the network's
publicists were eager to whip up audience interest in the drama,
which will appear during a ``sweeps'' month when Nielsen ratings
are used to calculate future advertising rates. The publicists had
sent out news packages that vividly connected ``Atomic Train'' to
real life.
</P>
<P>
   It ``may sound like total fiction _ but it isn't,'' one release
read, going on to provide excerpts from newspaper articles and
technical studies about the possibilities of accidents from the
transport of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Another included a map of train and highway routes, and directed
television editors to ``look at the enclosed map and you will see
that your city is currently on a truck or train route for nuclear
waste transportation.'' That one concluded: ``If you want to
explore the timeliness of this miniseries, please contact me. I can
put you in touch with authorities who will give you great quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such releases came to the attention of Rosalyn Weinman, NBC's
executive vice president for content policy, only when the
publicity department, she said, proposed screening the drama for
someone in a government agency or special-interest group; such a
publicity move requires Weinman's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Weinman said that when she saw the extent to which the
miniseries was being promoted as factual, she felt she had to take
two steps _ making sure it had a prominent disclaimer on the
broadcast itself, emphasizing that it is fiction, and redubbing the
words ``nuclear waste'' to ``hazardous material.'' The nuclear bomb
is still part of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our own promotional positioning led people to perceive it
as nonfiction,'' Weinman said Thursday, ``then I think our level of
responsibility includes not only putting a disclaimer out but also
to taking that next step. There's a lot of science here, and a lot
of regulatory and transportation issues, and we didn't have the
time to vet it properly. The conservative broadcasterly thing to do
was to make those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it would have been different had the drama been
promoted strictly as a ``straight-out roller coaster action
thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the hubbub about whether the frightening scenario
could be interpreted as fact-based, NBC had to deal with another
difficult scenario. The network had considered changing the
miniseries' setting from Denver to another city because of a
real-life disaster that had afflicted the Denver area _ the
Littleton, Colo., school shootings. But those changes would have
been prohibitively costly, NBC said.

MEG GREENFIELD, WHO SHAPED WASHINGTON POST'S EDITORIAL PAGE, DIES
AT 68
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mass.)  (Eds: an 1800-word version has also been filed.)  (DW) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial
page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit
to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and
politicians, died Thursday morning at her home in Washington. She
was 68.
</P>
<P>
   She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham.
The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the
last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence
her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on
March 15.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly
influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield
provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the
public perception of six presidential administrations and scores of
policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights
to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf War. In 1978,
when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was
awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the
last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25
years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the
passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex
architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone
of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd. Though capable of a
passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's
progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's
abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also
arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss
attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   A hands-on manager of both the editorial and Op-Ed pages of The
Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual
talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will,
Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Krauthammer credit
Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Greenfield was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of
Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was
also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of
the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns
both The Post and Newsweek. As an editorialist, she was both a
judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and
intellectual elites. ``Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Will said.
``Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using
understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''
</P>
<P>
   Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began
to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980s and
1990s, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues,
from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University
offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her
colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Greenfield _ she derived Meg from her initials _ was
born on Dec. 27, 1930 in Seattle, where her father, Lewis
Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude
from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature,
then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in
England, specializing in William Blake's works.
</P>
<P>
   After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on
journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis
and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in
the heat of the 1960 presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon
and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to
attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote.
``But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a
debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon
apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is
not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him
until they have been pitted against something else _ an extreme
danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack
from some sinister quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in
1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter
shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by
Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The
Washington Post. One of Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post
away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its
departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   A year after she arrived at The Post, Geyelin made Miss
Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in
the 1970s so she could read more classic works. She was also a
perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary
degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University,
Williams College and Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield
returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the
Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see
her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her
only remaining relatives.

STUDY LINKS MEDICAID DROP TO WELFARE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new study estimates that 675,000 people lost
Medicaid coverage and were without health insurance in 1997 because
of sweeping changes in federal and state welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study was issued Thursday by Families USA, a consumer group
that has worked closely with the White House on health policy for
the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said most
of those who became uninsured ``as an unintended consequence of
welfare reform'' _ 420,000 of the 675,000 people in 1997 _ were
children.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said the Clinton administration was not enforcing
federal laws intended to guarantee Medicaid for people who lose
cash assistance. In addition, he said, many states have apparently
failed to comply with those laws.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has told states what they are required to
do, but has not penalized them for failure to comply, preferring to
coax and exhort state officials.
</P>
<P>
   While advocacy groups and some local officials have complained
about the loss of Medicaid coverage, the study by Families USA is
the first that tries to paint a comprehensive national picture of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack predicted that the problem would get worse because more
and more people are leaving the welfare rolls for low-wage jobs
that do not provide health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Three million people left welfare in the year after President
Clinton signed the welfare bill in 1996. The Families USA study
suggests that at least 1 in 5 former welfare recipients became
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates are consistent with the findings of many studies
by various experts who have examined the experience of individual
states. The Clinton administration, which in the past has embraced
Families USA as an impeccable source of health policy research,
said it had questions about the methodology of Pollack's new study.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony just two weeks ago, federal officials
acknowledged that the loss of health insurance was a serious
problem for many former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Health and Human Services, said, ``It's too early to
know for sure if there is a cause-and-effect relationship'' between
the steep decline in welfare recipients and the increase in the
number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a federal district judge has ruled that
thousands of people were improperly denied Medicaid at city welfare
offices. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, has suggested that
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is responsible, and White House officials
said she would criticize him more harshly if she decided to run for
the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Pollack said there had been ``an abdication of
responsibility'' by the federal government as well. ``There's much
more the federal government could do to make sure states comply
with clear and unequivocal federal laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, Pollack said, computers automatically cut off
Medicaid for people leaving welfare, and state employees have not
been trained to override the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Susan J. Golonka, a welfare expert at the National Governors'
Association, said: ``It's true that there are unintended
consequences of the 1996 welfare law. We have heard concerns that
some families who are eligible for Medicaid are not receiving it.
States are working hard to address these issues, by reaching out to
low-income families, simplifying eligibility procedures, expanding
coverage for working parents and changing computers to make sure
people can keep Medicaid when they go off welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, done with assistance from the Lewin Group, estimated
the number of people who would have had Medicaid in the absence of
changes in welfare policy. It then compared this number with actual
Medicaid enrollment.

SHOWS

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Senate Republicans defeated a
Democratic proposal to require background checks on buyers at gun
shows, they turned around Thursday and advocated a measure of their
own to do precisely that, a startling reversal that reflected their
skittishness about being portrayed as soft on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative fate of the Republicans' surprise proposal was
undecided Thursday evening _ a vote was expected on Friday _ but
the very fact that it had been introduced demonstrated the potency
of the gun-control issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a sizeable majority of senators voted Thursday
night not only for a Republican gun control measure to prohibit the
sale of semi-automatic assault weapons to children under 18, but
also for a Democratic proposal to ban the importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips for those weapons. That Democratic
proposal had been defeated in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, a stark contrast to the Senate action on
Wednesday, showed that Republicans were indeed concerned that the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo., last month had altered public
opinion and created fresh outrage among many Americans about gun
violence and the availability of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Democrats and Clinton administration officials
said late Thursday that the new Republican gun show amendment was
so ambiguously worded that it appeared, in fact, to create a whole
new class of venders, both at gun shows and away from them, who
would be exempt from conducting background checks. Republicans
disputed that interpretation in an argument on the Senate floor
that went late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to stand on the floor of the United States Senate
and proclaim myself a defender of the Second Amendment,'' said Sen.
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., referring to the right to bear arms, which
Republicans frequently invoke to explain their opposition to more
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But, Smith added, ``I think it's possible to defend this
constitutional right and also defend the kids in the school
cafeteria.'' He said he would support tighter restrictions on gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of about a half dozen Republicans who, after
voting with the Republican majority on Wednesday to oppose such
restrictions, later expressed concern to Republican leaders about a
measure advocating voluntary background checks at guns shows that
they had helped to pass.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, created
and financed a system that would allow _ but not oblige _
unlicensed sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks on
buyers. Under current law, only licensed dealers, who represent
about 60 percent of vendors at gun shows, have the ability and
obligation to perform that task.
</P>
<P>
   Unlicensed dealers are people, for example, who do not operate
out of established businesses or who sell guns as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising turn of events, Craig Thursday introduced a
measure to make those backgrounds checks mandatory, as the
Democratic proposal would have. He said it had been his intention
all along, and that his first measure was merely a necessary
prelude to the second.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that after Wednesday's votes, some of his
Republican colleagues had received angry calls from constituents
and had indicated some alarm about that. Democrats said that
Republicans realized they had misjudged the political climate, an
assessment that some Republicans privately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, there was some reflection taking part in the
Republican conference last night, some second thoughts induced by
an inner conscience or perhaps even newspaper comments and
editorials,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who had sponsored
the Democratic measure on gun shows that was narrowly defeated
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's measure included a provision for the keeping of
records of sales at gun shows that Republicans said they had found
to be an unnecessary infringement on the privacy of law-abiding gun
buyers. The National Rifle Association had the same complaint.
Craig's new proposal did not include such a provision.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the second day in a row that a debate over gun
control took center stage in the Senate's consideration of a
broader juvenile justice bill whose fate has yet to be decided. The
House has not yet taken up a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control measures were being offered as amendments to
that bill, which would create $1 billion in federal grants to
toughen prosecution and punishment of juvenile crime and, to a
lesser extent, enhance programs to help troubled and violent
children.
</P>
<P>
   None of the measures represented monumental changes in public
policy. But the full airing they were getting, and the Senate's
approval of a few of them, would probably not have occurred a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats charged that much of what Republicans were
doing was mere posturing and said that Craig's new gun show
amendment, on which votes were expected on Friday, was not all that
much improved.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., noted that it did not require
unlicensed dealers to maintain any record of their sales and said
that would make it impossible for anyone ever to monitor whether
these vendors had conducting the requisite checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loophole you could drive a Mack truck through,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said that his amendment would mandate the presence at
gun shows of a ``special registrant,'' licensed by the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, to oversee the process.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that most, if not all, Republicans would vote
for Craig's new gun show amendment, even though all but six
Republicans had voted against Lautenberg's similar measure.

 WASHINGTON: gun shows. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Senators, in addition to Smith of Oregon, who
expressed concern to Craig about Wednesday's votes included John
McCain of Arizona, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Susan Collins of
Maine. McCain and Collins both rose to speak on the Senate floor
Thursday in favor of background checks.
</P>
<P>
   In comments Thursday morning, President Clinton urged lawmakers
to amend what he saw as Wednesday's mistake. ``For the life of
me,'' Clinton said, ``I can't figure out how they did it or why
they passed up this chance to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are watching this debate,'' the President
added. ``They care very much about the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the result was that the Senate passed, by an
overwhelming majority, 96 to 2, the amendment on semiautomatic
assault weapons, which was sponsored by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   It not only made sales of those weapons to those under 18
illegal, but also make possession of such weapons by children
without parental consent a crime. That merely brings the federal
law on assault weapons into line with the law on handguns, which,
curiously, was more severe.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's amendment included exemptions for assault weapons
used by hunters, ranchers or sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, senators also approved, 59-39, an amendment by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to ban the import of ammunition
clips that enabled assault weapons to fire more than 10 rounds at
once. The manufacture of such clips in America is already illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Republicans joined 39 Democrats in favor of the
amendment, while only four Democrats joined 35 Republicans in
opposition. Two Democrats were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein attributed the outcome to ``a realization that the
American people want some regulation.''

IN TEXACO DEAL, CHEVRON WANTS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. will continue merger talks next
week, but they remain divided principally over Chevron's insistence
that it control the combined company, said executives close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has been talking to potential partners, the executives
said, since the $42.8 billion takeover of Amoco Corp. by British
Petroleum last August, forming BP Amoco PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron chairman and chief executive Kenneth Derr had sought to
buy Atlantic Richfield Co. earlier this year but lost out to BP
Amoco, which reached agreement to buy ARCO in March for $26.8
billion. Derr had also discussed a possible combination with Amoco
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Derr and other Chevron executives now face several major
stumbling blocks in the company's effort to acquire Texaco, which
is still in a preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is what role Texaco chairman and chief
executive Peter Bijur would play in a combined company, the
executives and industry analysts said. Other issues include an
appropriate price for Texaco and possible antitrust issues deriving
from the dominant position that the combined companies would have
in refining, particularly in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur, who ascended to Texaco's top job in 1996, stressed in an
interview in December that while he was open to a merger he had
positioned his company to go it alone. He began last year to cut a
further $650 million in costs on top of deep reductions already in
place. Texaco, like other oil companies, has had to cope with a
plunge in crude oil prices that has only been reversed in recent
months. Crude oil that averaged about $14 a barrel last year has
recovered to $18 a barrel, and some analysts think it may go higher
than $20.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of analysts, this has eased the pressure on Bijur to
agree to a takeover by Chevron, which is about the same size at
Texaco in terms of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco stock closed Thursday at $69.125 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Chevron closed at $94.4375. An analyst said
that a $75-or-lower share price for Texaco was more likely than the
$80 price that had earlier been floated by bankers to see what the
reaction of Wall Street and stockholders would be.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst with BT Alex. Brown, said that if
Chevron made a good offer Bijur would have a simple decision to
make: ``Do you fight hard to keep slots open for Texaco management,
or should you take the money and run?''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, however, is determined to absorb Texaco on its own
terms, according to an Chevron executive close to the talks.
``We've told them if we go through with this, we will run it _
period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unsurprisingly, Texaco is not comfortable with this
position. `` Bijur does not perceive Texaco as a company desperate
to be taken over,'' particularly at a time of rebounding crude oil
prices, said John D. Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette who is based in London.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in recent major takeovers in the industry, one executive and
company have emerged as clearly dominant. BP Amoco chief executive
Sir John Browne assumed such a role in carrying out the Amoco and
ARCO deals.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly in the $80 billion agreement by Exxon to take over
Mobil, Lee R. Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon,
added the title of president and has emerged dominant.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication in the Chevron attempt with Texaco is
that Chevron vice chairman David O'Reilly is viewed as a likely
successor to Derr, and would therefore find it hard to allow Bijur
a turn to run a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of the strategic reasons why Chevron is pursuing Texaco
was given by Martin Klitten, the vice president and chief financial
officer of Chevron, in a meeting with some analysts in New York on
Tuesday, a participant in the session said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what gaps Chevron was seeking to fill, Klitten,
without specifically discussing the talks with Texaco, said that
the company wanted to add to its domestic production of oil and
natural gas to generate the cash to finance its exploration in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco is a large producer of both oil and natural gas in the
United States. Unlike most oil companies, whose domestic production
is declining, Texaco increased its production of crude oil last
year to 433,000 barrels a day from 396,000 barrels in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The growth came largely through the acquisition in 1997 of
Monterey Resources, which has fields of heavy oil that Texaco has
expertise in producing.
</P>
<P>
   By applying new methods, Texaco has been able to revive
production of heavy oil at one if its oldest fields, at Kern River
in Bakersfield, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Klitten also said that Chevron was looking to become a major
refiner and marketer of gasoline in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco owns a large refinery in Britain and 35 percent of
another in the Netherlands, and Chevron has tried to buy these
refineries. Texaco also has more than 3,000 gasoline stations and
other retail outlets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although smaller in Europe than some major competitors like BP
Amoco and Shell Oil, a deal would give Chevron a base to build a
major European refining operation.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for a prospective merger is an existing alliance
between Texaco and the Shell, the U.S. subsidiary of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group. In refining, the alliance now controls about 15
percent of the U.S. market, and is particularly strong on the West
Coast. This could set off antitrust concerns.

GUITAR CENTER TUNES UP FOR E_COMMERCE WITH PENDING MERGER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Guitar Center Inc. announced that it will merge
with an Oregon mail order and e-commerce company to become the
world's largest seller of musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal announced after the close of U.S. markets Thursday,
the firm based in Agoura Hills northwest of Los Angeles said it
will be the surviving entity in a $50 million pooling of interests
with Medford-based Musician's Friend Inc. The deal includes a
one-for-one stock swap valued at $33 million and the assumption of
about $17 million in Musician's Friend debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon company is the nation's largest catalog retailer of
musical instruments and operates nine brick-and-mortar stores in
Oregon, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, Utah and Washington.
Musician's Friend had 1998 sales of $97 million, with roughly $4
million coming from online sales. By comparison, Guitar Center's 52
stores generated sales of more than $391 million in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Albertson, chief operating officer of Guitar Center, said
the proposed merger fulfills his company's longstanding goal of
dominating online instrument sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Guitar Center and Musician's Friend, ``There's nobody
else out there with a full-service musical instruments e-tailing
site,'' Albertson said. ``And this obviously puts us at the leading
edge of catalog sales as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Albertson said Guitar Center will continue to operate its own
e-commerce Web site, which generates negligible revenue, but will
use the Musician's Friend fulfillment center to speed delivery of
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company, which will retain the Guitar Center name and
Agoura Hills corporate headquarters, will have a relatively complex
management structure. Larry Thomas, Guitar Center's chairman and
chief executive, will be chairman of the new company and co-CEO
along with Albertson. Musician's Friend CEO Robert Eastman will
become CEO of the new company's online and catalog business, and
will be a member of the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little weird, but it's a good way to initially manage
three complementary but very different lines of business,'' said
Bank Boston analyst Sara Craig. Craig said Eastman should bring
Guitar Center needed strength in the online sales arena.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Musician's Friend's nine retail outlets
will be converted to Guitar Center shops. Because of their location
in smaller, secondary markets, they will give the organization a
chance to better study that niche, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the proposed merger, which must be approved by Guitar
Center shareholders, came after the close of U.S. markets. The
company's stock could use a boost, having peaked as high as $30.625
in January but subsequently falling to the mid-teens. The stock
closed at $16.75 Thursday, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this a great deal,'' Craig said, ``but I wouldn't
expect any sort of big boost (on Wall Street).''

CHINESE NUCLEAR WARHEAD USES STOLEN U.S. TECHNOLOGY, INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts 4th graph with no comment from White House; subs
sixth graph to clarify technology is supected to have been stolen) (rm) 
 By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, China is close to deploying a
nuclear missile with a warhead whose design draws on stolen
American secrets, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   A long-range Chinese missile, known as the Dong Feng-31, is
being equipped with a small nuclear warhead whose design uses
secret U.S. technology, according to the American intelligence
assessments. The technology is believed to have been stolen from a
government weapons laboratory, according to the intelligence
information, although there is some debate over precisely what
information officials believe is being used. The missile is
expected to be deployed within three or four years, according to
the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Since suspicions of Chinese nuclear espionage became public, the
Clinton administration has said that there is no evidence that
Beijing has actually deployed nuclear weapons that rely on stolen
U.S. secrets.  &UR;  &LR;  The White House declined to comment Thursday night
on the estimates of China's nuclear intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said, for example, that China stole design
information about America's most advanced warhead, the W-88,
between 1984-1988. Yet they stress that while China has devloped a
test version with a similar design, it has not actually produced
such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials believe that that the technology that is
suspected of having been stolen for use in the DF-31's warhead will
help China achieve its goal of building a modern nuclear arsenal
that relies on mobility to evade attacks. The DF-31 will be a
truck-based mobile missile that can be moved and thus will be hard
to detect and destroy.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear arsenal today is still much smaller and less
technically advanced than that of the United States. Yet the DF-31
and its new warhead represent a step forward in China's efforts to
present a more formidable nuclear presence. It also means that
China may soon be using stolen U.S. nuclear secrets on weapons
capable of hitting a wide range of countries, including those in
Europe, Asia and even the western United States. U.S. intelligence
estimates say that the DF-31 will have a range of approximately
5,000 miles. It is expected to be ready for deployment as soon as
2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DF-31 ICBM will give China a major strike capability that
will be difficult to counter-attack at any stage of its
operation,'' a 1996 Air Force intelligence report on the DF-31
stated. ``It will be a significant threat not only to U.S. forces
deployed in the Pacific theater, but to portions of the continental
United States and to many of our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that the new Chinese weapon will use
design technology from the American W-70 warhead, a small bomb
designed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   China stole secret design information about the W-70 from
Lawrence Livermore in the late 1970s or early 1980s, government
investigators believe. A scientist was fired from Lawrence
Livermore in 1981 in connection with the investigation into the
suspected theft, but no one has ever been arrested in the case. The
scientist has never been publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials believe that China has used design
information from the ``primary'' of the W-70 to help develop the
advanced warhead that will be used on the DF-31 missile. The
``primary'' of a modern nuclear weapon is a small atomic bomb that
serves to ignite the ``secondary,'' a larger hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The W-70 warhead is also known as the neutron bomb, a weapon
that kills people with enhanced radiation while leaving buildings
intact. But its ``primary'' can be used in other, conventional
nuclear weapons as well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have based their belief of Chinese reliance on
U.S. design secrets for the new warhead in part by analyzing
Chinese nuclear tests in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Officials
believe those successful tests were of a small warhead that is
slated for use on the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have also based their estimates on
analysis of the range and payload capabilities of the DF-31.
</P>
<P>
   Because this analysis is based partly on inferences, there is
still a debate within the U.S. intelligence community over which
U.S. nuclear secrets the Chinese are using. There is also
disagreement over the extent to which the DF-31's warhead will rely
on American technology, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a debate over how much design information of ours
they are using,'' said one official. ``This is a very sophisticated
piece of equipment, that was difficult for us to develop, so we
think it would be hard for them to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate, the broad conclusion that the DF-31 will
come equipped with a warhead that uses stolen U.S. technology is
included in two new secret government reports, officials said. Part
of one report from a select House committee is soon to be made
public. The other report is the result of a government-wide
intelligence assessment of the damage done to U.S. national
security by Chinese atomic espionage, according to officials. That
government-wide assessment, however, acknowledges the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified summary of the government-wide intelligence
assessment released last month stated that ``it is more likely that
the Chinese used U.S. design information to inform their own
program than to replicate U.S. weapons designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report does not name the specific warhead
design suspected of being stolen by China.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied allegations that it has stolen U.S. nuclear
secrets, and insists that its weapons are based on its own research
and development program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American intelligence community has suspected that China
stole W-70 design information from Lawrence Livermore since the
early 1980s, according to officials. The FBI investigation,
code-named Tiger Trap, never led to any arrests. But officials said
that the scientist who was fired as a result of the investigation
made a series of trips to China after he left the laboratory in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea that the stolen W-70 design technology was being
applied by China for use in its new generation of small warheads
for the DF-31 was a subject of intense controversy within American
intelligence agencies until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that it was not until last month's
government-wide damage assessment report on Chinese nuclear
espionage that many intelligence analysts began to connect the
theft of design secrets with the evidence gathered on the DF-31 and
the ongoing modernization of China's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The DF-31, a solid-fuel missile, would be the first Chinese
inter-continental ballistic missile that would be moved on roads.
China test-fired its rocket motor last July, and the missile was
scheduled to be flight tested last December, The Washington Times
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the missile has apparently been slower than
that of its warhead, officials believe. China conducted six or
seven tests of the two-stage warhead the United States expects to
be deployed on the DF-31, and completed that testing in the early
1990s. U.S. officials now believe the DF-31 will carry only one
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Once the DF-31 and other advanced missiles are deployed, China
is expected to begin to phase out its older and less accurate
ballistic missiles that carry large, bulky warheads. ``The DF-31
ICBM will give China a major strike capability that will be
difficult to counterattack at any stage of its operation, from
pre-flight mobile operations through the terminal flight phase,''
the 1996 Air Force intelligence report predicted. The ``road
mobility'' of the DF-31, the report adds, ``will greatly improve
Chinese nuclear ballistic missile survivability and will complicate
the task of defeating the Chinese threat.''

AUTHOR DENIES THAT MIT PROFESSOR WAS THE RUSSIAN SPY, KNOWN AS
PERSEUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Russia)  By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Stone, having accused a prominent American physicist
of spying for Moscow while involved in the making of the first
atomic bomb half a century ago, has now written him to accept his
denial that he was the Soviet atom spy whom the Russians called
Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, a
private group in Washington, laid out his suspicions in a chapter
of his new memoir, ``Every Man Should Try: Adventures of a Public
Interest Activist'' (Public Affairs, 1999). The book referred to
the physicist only as a ``Dr. X,'' but Stone, after initially
refusing to identify him, did so once the physicist identified
himself to a reporter as the object of Stone's suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The physicist, Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, was accused by Stone of being a Soviet spy
whose code name, disclosed by the Russians at the end of the Cold
War, was Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Stone on Monday, Morrison listed ways he
differed from the spy's profile, as outlined in Stone's book and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the light of these facts, which I certainly cannot
contradict,'' Stone wrote in response on Tuesday, ``I can only
accept your denial that you are Perseus.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, however, Stone refused to discuss his letter or
whether he believed Morrison might have spied under another code
name, or none. ``I feel my letter speaks for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone added that he hoped his book would help locate a Perseus
suspect who more closely fit the relevant facts.

MAN AWARDED $4.4 MILLION IN NRA SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal jury in Philadelphia awarded $4.4 million Thursday to
an Iowa man who said he was assaulted last year by a security guard
for the National Rifle Association at a session of the group's
annual convention there.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found the association liable for ``false light
publicity,'' a form of defamation, for a suggestion by the NRA
president, Charlton Heston, that the man had staged the incident at
the behest of opponents of the NRA leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've been vindicated,'' said the plaintiff, Ken
Brodbeck, 40, an agricultural engineer from West Des Moines, who
was attacked for videotaping his wife, Sally, an NRA board member
at the time, as she spoke at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the rifle association said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA fought vigorously to defend itself from false
accusations,'' said the spokeswoman, Debbie Nauser.
</P>
<P>
   Such jury awards are frequently lowered on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred on June 8, the day Heston was elected the
association's 56th president.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, in which Brodbeck and several witnesses said
a guard grabbed him by the throat and threw him down, Heston said,
``As an actor and director, I can tell you it was very bad
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Guards had told Brodbeck that the taping violated NRA laws.

STUDY COMPARES U.S. AND ENGLISH DRUG CRIMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia, Chile, Netherlands, Scotland and South Africa)   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Illegal drugs drive crime in England just as they do in the
United States, says a two-nation survey that challenges assumptions
that addicted criminals are a particularly American problem.
</P>
<P>
   The report, being released Friday, found that among suspects
arrested in England, 55 percent said they had used a psychoactive
drug in the prior three days. That is slightly more than in
America, where just under half a comparable sampling said the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The type of crime and of drug use differs between the countries.
``We don't have the problem with gun-related violence,'' Dr.
Malcolm Ramsay, principal research officer for the Research
Development and Statistics Directorate of the British Home Office,
said in a telephone interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Ramsay said, ``robbery and burglary are rare as a
means of financing the purchase of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoplifting accounted for one-third of the arrests of the
English heroin users sampled, Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 35 percent of the Americans arrested were
charged with personal crimes of violence like robbery compared to
16 percent of the English. The Americans were also more likely to
be arrested for drug or alcohol offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects arrested in England use heroin and amphetamines at a
higher rate than people arrested in the United States, but cocaine
is more popular in the United States, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of 839 people arrested in England showed that they
appeared twice as likely as their American counterparts to have
used heroin and amphetamines. But more than 40 percent of 4,470
people arrested in five American cities tested positive for crack
or powder cocaine, compared with 9 percent of the English.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-page report is the first under a program that began last
year. The National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the
United States Justice Department, has used such statistics since
1987 to try to measure links between crime and drugs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the institute, Jeremy Travis, said adopting the
same research methodology made possible a true comparison between
patterns of arrests in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a window into the world of offender behavior so we can
understand drug use, public health issues and socioeconomic factors
related to crime,'' Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high cocaine use, 68 percent of the suspected
criminals sampled in the United States were found using an illicit
drug, compared with 59 percent of the English sample. But the
English admitted using more kinds of drugs than the Americans. The
findings were based on urine tests, as well as the suspects'
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The preference for heroin among English offenders may stem from
England's position on trade routes of opium-producing countries
like Myanmar, Pakistan and Iran, the report said. Similarly,
Americans may use more cocaine because it comes from Colombia and
other Andean countries close to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and Chile are collecting data to join the program, and
the Netherlands, Scotland and South Africa also plan to
participate, Travis said.

OFFICER'S TESTIMONY ATTACKED IN TORTURE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers defending two police officers in the Abner
Louima brutality case Thursday attacked the credibility of another
officer who testified against them, suggesting that he was
motivated by self-interest and had offered an initially shifting
account.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers questioned the witness, Detective Eric Turetzky,
sharply about what they termed inconsistencies between his
testimony at the trial Wednesday and his original account to
investigators days after prosecutors say Louima was tortured in the
restroom of a Brooklyn station house.
</P>
<P>
   And they sought to convince the jury that rather than being a
hero who came forward out of a sense of duty, Turetzky was acting
out of fear that he might be accused of wrongdoing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky, who was a patrol officer in the 70th Precinct when
prosecutors say Louima was attacked in August 1997, testified
Wednesday that he had seen one of the accused officers, Justin
Volpe _ in an agitated state and with a stick in his hand _ escort
Louima from the restroom area to a holding cell.
</P>
<P>
   He told the jury in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that
Louima's pants were around his ankles and that after placing Louima
in the cell, Volpe began swinging the stick ``like it was a sword
and hitting it against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Volpe, in the restroom, had rammed a
stick into Louima's rectum and then his mouth, inflicting severe
internal injuries, while another officer, Charles Schwarz, held him
down. And the prosecutors charge that these two officers, and two
others also on trial, had earlier beaten Louima, a 32-year-old
Haitian immigrant, in a police car after his arrest in a melee
outside a nightclub in Flatbush.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining Turetzky on Thursday, Volpe's lawyer sought
to contrast the brisk and smooth account he had given Wednesday
with the uncertain and confused version he had originally given
investigators in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, cited Turetzky's interview with
police investigators on Aug. 15, 1997, six days after the reported
attack on Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a transcript, Kornberg showed that Turetzky had
admitted confusion, saying at one point that he was ``not clear''
on who took Louima to his cell, then saying, ``I think it's Officer
Volpe,'' and finally expressing certainty that it was Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky expressed no doubt that he had seen Volpe standing with
a stick near the restroom at the time. But Kornberg appeared to be
suggesting that the detective's initial uncertainty over who
escorted Louima from the restroom to the cell called into question
his entire testimony implicating Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   In his cross-examination of Turetzky, Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen
Worth, sought to puncture whatever image jurors might have
developed of a selfless whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you consider yourself a hero cop who broke the blue wall of
silence?'' the lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the detective, 28, replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you acting out of self-interest?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you come forward?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth then pointed out that by the time Turetzky came forward,
two days had already passed since news reports of the alleged
attack had provoked public shock, denunciations from the mayor and
an intensive investigation. Volpe, in fact, had already been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Turetzky, who was still a patrol officer at the
time, had helped arrest Louima in the street melee, Worth said that
Turetzky knew he was soon to be questioned by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer suggested that fear of being accused of involvement
in the alleged assaults drove Turetzky to cooperate and called into
question his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true, Detective Turetzky, that you were scared to
death what would happen to you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the detective responded. But a moment later, he
said, ``I was concerned with my welfare, but not what was going to
happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Turetzky became the first officer to aid investigators in
the Louima case, police officials praised his cooperation as a sign
that the ``blue wall'' would not protect rogue officers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir told reporters Thursday that
Turetzky ``is doing what all police officers should do, but it
takes a great deal of courage to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Officer Turetzky has shown a great deal of courage
right from the beginning,'' Safir said.

SPORTS COLUMN: NO. 8 TEAM LEADS NO. 1: VERY STRANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I start laughing every time I think of the Monty
Python reunion last year, when they kicked over poor Graham
Chapman's ashes. Right on cue, out come the vacuum cleaners and the
brooms, and the lads start sweeping up their fallen comrade.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me started, or I won't be able to type.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny in the comics when the urchins knock off the rich
man's top hat with a snowball. Chris Rock is funny. It's funny when
Groucho lurches around with the cigar held behind his back. Who
walks that way in real life?
</P>
<P>
   It's also funny that the Knicks are leading the Heat, two games
to one. I am not rooting here for the New York team. In fact, the
Knicks disrupt my springtime big time if they do something bold
Friday night or Sunday. It's just funny, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, No. 8 is leading No. 1. Bugs Bunny is popping up
behind Elmer Fudd and asking, ``Anybody here seen any Winners
Within lately?'' Or maybe it's Elmer Fudd harassing Bugs Bunny. Man
bites rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody in the Knicks' camp is talking up such
nonsense. They're professionals. They know better. They know Tim
Hardaway must be hurting or he'd be able to shoot the ball. They
know how tenacious Pat Riley and Alonzo Mourning will be with the
season in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are down, 2-1, and they're coming out with all
their warfare,'' the Knicks' Larry Johnson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's not funny. That's an honest sports cliche. However, we _
the press, the civilians, the fans, with imagination, our human
taste for the bizarre _ we can see the banana peel lying out there
on the sidewalk. We can imagine the first-place team flopping
around in midair in the middle of a pratfall. Nothing personal, but
upsets are funny.
</P>
<P>
   The chattering teeth in the glass on the old Ernie Kovacs show
were funny. It's funny when David Letterman envisions his grubby
lonely loser weekends in Connecticut. (Maybe it's guy humor, but
it's funny to me.)
</P>
<P>
   It was funny Thursday when Jeff Van Gundy came out for his daily
news briefing and discovered somebody had moved the table out of
the glare of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a habit of creature,'' Van Gundy said, moving back to his
normal spot.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know if he reversed the words on purpose, or not. He gave
a shrug, and commenced his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was kind of funny when Jeff mimicked the rabid New York news
media for its mood swings about his team. ``They build 'em up after
Game 1, they crush 'em after Game 2,'' he said in a pretty good
singsong. And he was right. It's a goofy dance. It could go on for
a while.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is not funny over in New Jersey, where Ernie
Grunfeld watches the team he assembled, watches Latrell Sprewell
and Marcus Camby run through the suddenly porous Riley defense.
</P>
<P>
   However, I bet it looks and sounds funny in the corporate
headquarters of whoever owns the Knicks this quarter. I bet they
are doing Marx Brothers conniptions over this strange little turn
of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, what if we get into the second round? What do we do
about the coach? How much money do we make if we get into the
Eastern finals? Who gets the celebrity seats if we get into the
finals? How much is the franchise worth at the moment? Is this for
real?''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how to approach this business of a No. 8 team leading
a No. 1 team. If this were a normal season, there would be more of
a track record, but this is a 50-game aberration. The Knicks are
just getting to know one another's names.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing says it is difficult to think of the Knicks as a
mere No. 8 team ``given the way we finished the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the history of the NBA has a No. 8 team knocked off
a No. 1 team in the playoffs. That was in the spring of 1994 when
Denver (42-40) won a fifth game in Seattle (63-19).
</P>
<P>
   In this weird little season they have foisted upon us, there was
only a six-game difference between the Heat (33-17) and the Knicks
(27-23).
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is,'' Johnson said Thursday, ``Miami is a No. 1
and we are a No. 8. You can't dwell on it, but we are up, 2-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people will say none of this matters, in a weird season
with the Chicago Bulls having been dismantled. Any way you look at
it, No. 8 is home Friday night, in position to befuddle No. 1.
Funny.

BOEING TO ELIMINATE AS MANY AS 7,000 JOBS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing a key order for its F-15 Eagle jet fighter two
weeks ago, the Boeing Co. said Thursday that it planned to cut as
many as 7,000 jobs at its manufacturing plant in St. Louis by the
middle of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, two-thirds of which will be white-collar jobs, will
reduce Boeing's total work force in St. Louis by one-third from the
current 20,000. The company also plans to consolidate its real
estate and take other steps to cuts its expenses there.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said that the cuts would be included in its previously
announced plan to reduce employment over the next two years. The
company, which is engaged in a long-term campaign to raise its
flagging profits, has said that it intends to cut as many as 46,000
jobs by 2001. The company now employs about 219,000, down from
231,000 at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement, while not unexpected, still surprised
some analysts because Boeing is awaiting a decision from Israel
about whether it will order more F-15s. ``Are they signaling
something?'' Byron K. Callan, an aerospace industry analyst at
Merrill Lynch, asked Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Downey, a Boeing spokesman, insisted that the company was
competing aggressively for the order from Israel, which is also
considering buying the F-16 fighter made by the Lockheed Martin
Corp. But after Greece passed over Boeing on April 30 in favor of
the F-16, Downey said that it became clear that Boeing would at the
very least have to suspend production of the F-15 next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that because of the lead time related to the
order from Israel, we will have a gap in the line,'' he said. If
the order comes through, the gap might be as short as 12 months,
meaning that employment could rise again. But if it does not come
through, the cuts would last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also winding down the current generation of the F/A-18
Hornet, another aircraft made in St. Louis, creating another gap
before production of the new so-called Super Hornet begins.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is said to be considering buying 12 to 25 of the
twin-engine F-15s, which cost about $50 million each. The
single-engine F-16 is about half the price. Moshe Arens, the
Israeli defense minister, visited both Boeing and Lockheed earlier
this month. A decision is expected soon, but Arens did not say
when, and next week's election in Israel may delay an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 F-15s have been built in St. Louis since the
plane was introduced in 1972. The fighter is flown by air forces in
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate now, but there are other planes on the horizon
that are as expensive but may be more modern,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the job reductions should not alarm investors. ``I
wouldn't put this in the same catalog of woes as some of the things
that went on last year,'' he said, referring to production turmoil
at Boeing's flagship commercial airplane division.
</P>
<P>
   But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, whose members account for about one-third of the jobs to
be cut in St. Louis, may see things differently. The union and
Boeing are scheduled to begin new contract negotiations this
summer.

MEMORIES OF SERIES PAST MODERATE THE KNICKS' GIDDINESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The New York Knicks streamed through the
corridor clapping their hands and letting out a whoop or two as
they crossed the threshold of a locker room that had a fraternity
house feel to it. Then there was the buzz killer.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson and Chris Childs lifted their voices to throw a
bucket of cold reality on the afterglow of the Knicks' Game 3
victory on Wednesday night, an unfathomable 97-73 dismantling of
the Miami Heat that gave them a 2-1 edge in the three-of-five-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   After riding a preposterous 32-2 run, the Knicks are on the
verge of becoming only the second eighth-seeded in 15 years to
advance past a No. 1 seed. (The Denver Nuggets eliminated the
Seattle SuperSonics in 1994.) They are one home victory away, with
Game 4 at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. The possibility of
achieving the feat at their rival's expense makes it that much more
tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and Childs remember what wicked turns can snarl a
path that seems so clear. Two years ago, they were part of a Knicks
team that seemed so unselfish, dominant and unlimited in its
playoff potential. Two years ago, the Knicks had clicked together
like Legos to form a team that was unstoppable in sweeping
Charlotte, and the Knicks were one home victory away from
eliminating the Heat and advancing to the conference final.
</P>
<P>
   Then Charlie Ward boxed out P.J. Brown with 1 minute 53 seconds
left in Game 5. Brown responded by flipping Ward over like a
flapjack onto the Heat's court, and the Knicks mindlessly left the
bench only to receive suspensions that were handed out like
leaflets. Two short-handed playoff games later, the Knicks were
left devastated by their bitter elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry and Chris talked briefly, and basically said that we
don't want to go back to Miami,'' Marcus Camby said Thursday after
the team practiced at SUNY-Purchase. ``We have to go out and close
it out. We don't want to be in a Game 5 situation, where everything
is on the line. And especially not in a Knick-Heat series because
anything can happen down there in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything is possible. With that, the cautionary tales were being
told in every corner of the Knicks' practice facility, like
campfire stories. There were cameras and microphones circling every
player who could point to a moment this year when the enigmatic
Knicks let their complacency get the best of them. Like Game 2 of
this series, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let down, we sure did,'' Johnson said. ``The third game was
an excellent game for us. That said, if anyone was coming in here
today with their shoulders up and their heads held high over what a
great game we played, the tape showed different.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the jostling and physical nature of this rivalry have
not ignited the kind of series-altering moments that have occurred
in a past the Knicks are not likely to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, they outplayed us badly down there in Game 5,
and then we know what happened after that,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``We just have to be committed to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning would leave the once dysfunctional Knicks with an
invitation to the second round. ``When you have an opportunity to
do something like this,'' Childs said, ``you want to take advantage
of it.''  &QL;

CLINTON SAYS GORE IS `SMART' NOT TO MENTION HIM ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-CAMPAIGN) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his most extensive comments thus far on how the
2000 presidential race is unfolding, President Clinton on Thursday
night discussed his campaign tips for Vice President Al Gore and
said it was perfectly understandable that the vice president rarely
uttered his name on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a telephone interview, said he had advised Gore that
it was unrealistic for him to be steeped in the details of running
a campaign while also serving as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no person on the face of the earth who can be both
the most active vice president in history and an active candidate
for president,'' he explained, suggesting that Gore step back from
the day-to-day campaign minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he told Gore not to retreat from boasting about his
accomplishments _ and to mix more with voters. ``He's got a lot to
be proud of in his record,'' he said. ``I told him to go out and
have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was hurt that Gore, in his campaign appearances,
usually did not mention him, the president said, ``Oh, goodness no.
I think he should be very proud of what we accomplished together
because he played a big role in a lot of the economic progress we
made and on a whole range of issues. We should be proud of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he continued, ``people need to look at him when he's
out there campaigning as the person who would be the next
president. I would advise him to spend most of his time on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked again if Gore's failure to mention him was appropriate,
the president said, ``I think it's smart. And I really agree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hesitated when asked about the strength of Gore's sole
rival for the nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
``I don't know,'' he said. ``We've not talked about that very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for his observations about Bradley, whose candidacy has
recently been taken far more seriously by leading Democrats,
Clinton said: ``I don't know because I've been so covered up in
Kosovo. He's an intelligent man. He's an interesting man. But I
have always believed that the vice president would win the whole
thing. Not just the nomination. That's what I've always believed.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he was not unnerved by early polls
showing that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would defeat Gore by more
than 20 points in a general election matchup or by polls showing
that Elizabeth Dole would also defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less concerned about that than nearly everybody else,''
Clinton said. ``I bet if you go back and look at the polls in 1959
or look at President Bush's polls in 1987, I bet you whoever the
best-known Democrat was in 1959 was running way ahead of Richard
Nixon. So I'm just not concerned about that.'' In fact, the 1960
Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy, narrowly defeated Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing will shake out. My view is that he is doing
well, that he is addressing the issues in an appropriate way. He
has now addressed the issue of his campaign structure in an
appropriate way. I just want him to get out and have a good time,
talk about what he would do in the next four years, just enjoy
himself and let people see him the way I see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked for years behind the scenes to help Gore,
with whom he is close personally. ``I will do whatever I can and
however I can best be helpful,'' he said of his role. ``I've got a
job, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his exact involvement should be, he said, ``He's got
to make that decision and that call. I'll do whatever I can. He's
going to win this on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he sympathizes with the run of tough publicity that
Gore has had to endure. ``You know as well as I do that every
presidential campaign is part joy and part agony,'' he said. ``I
took my licks in 1992. He's the front-runner, so he's the
convenient target for everyone. I expect him to do very well the
whole way, and I feel very good about where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton kept returning to the value of Gore's true
personality. ``I think it's very important to recognize that as
smart as he is and as energetic as he is, he's a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added of the politician who has been by his side
(if not behind him) since 1992: ``I care a lot about him. I know
him as few people in America do.''

RILEY AT THE CROSSROADS AS THE UNTHINKABLE LOOMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley left New York in 1995 for power, money and
sun. Packing his vision of a championship team, he arrived in Miami
and found a franchise center, an improvisational point guard, role
players with high pain thresholds and the ability to discern
between being ``a'' winner and being ``the'' winner.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Riley, the coach with the highest winning
percentage in the National Basketball Association, cannot shake the
Knicks. Game 4 is Friday night at Madison Square Garden against the
Knicks, and the unthinkable looms: being eliminated again in the
first round by his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've worked for, everything we've talked about is
on the line,'' Riley said the after the Heat were run off the
Garden floor in a 97-73 loss. ``We have an mvp candidate, veteran
warriors on this team, one of the greatest clutch players in the
history of the NBA with Tim Hardaway, role players that help us win
games on a regular basis. We have a great defensive foundation. We
are a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the team that got me here. This is the team that will
get me over the top, or we're all going to go down together.''
</P>
<P>
   The house that Riley built in South Florida has been pounded
mercilessly by the Knicks. Its confidence shaken and its point
guard hurting, the Heat has been exposed as a structurally flawed
team. Facing elimination, the Heat players walked glumly into
Madison Square Garden Thursday for perhaps their last practice of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, with his bruised knee, is having a miserable series.
An aging Dan &QC; Majerle staggers around like a woozy prizefighter with
a bad shoulder, refusing to drop from a barrage of overhand rights.
No Heat player can throttle Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell for
more than one game, and Jamal Mashburn cannot make an important
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' said P.J. Brown. ``It's just
amazing to see how well they shoot, how well they play against us.
You would think they're the No. 1 seed and we're the No. 8 seed.
We're kind of back on our heels. They have an amazing high level of
confidence when they play the Miami Heat. And it's been like that
almost every game. I don't know what it is, but they get the job
done when they play us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bunker is empty, Riley's players were not admitting it.
Alonzo Mourning as much as predicted victory, saying his team was
using Game 4 as a potential steppingstone for a deciding Game 5 on
Sunday at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two more games to play,'' Mourning said. ``We are
going to start out with the one on Friday and finish with the one
on Sunday. That's the way we're looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the influence of Sprewell (19 points a game) in the
series, Mourning said: ``It's the same team. Nothing has changed.
They run the same plays. Sprewell has had some good ball games. We
haven't done anything to alter it. The second game we came out a
little more aggressive defensively to alter his play and Allan
Houston's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as a Sprewell factor, to tell you the truth, we're
shooting ourselves in the foot. We know what we have to and we're
not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Miami is eliminated Friday night, it may be the last time
several players on the roster wear a Heat uniform. Other than
Mourning, who has carried the team on his huge shoulders for three
games, expect Riley to keep almost no one safe from the trading
block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching other games,'' Riley said, ``watching Sacramento beat
the Jazz last night, watching Portland beat Phoenix, watching
Milwaukee go down to the wire against Indiana _ I mean, the Lakers
with a new, refound identity and enthusiasm. There's a different
freshness. There's a new kid on the block. And the new kid on the
block is hunger, excitement, enthusiasm and a chance to perform on
a platform they've never been on before.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I see that being the difference from some of the teams
that have been there before, that are sort of used to the routine
and getting into the playoffs and having good regular-season
records. Those teams are running into some ferocious energy on the
part of teams that may have been out of it, and all of a sudden the
hunger and enthusiasm is rising above the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who doubles as the team president, stubbornly believed in
his veterans, enough so that he did not give Riley, the coach, a
bona fide third offensive option in the off season. He thought
Golden State asked too much for Sprewell and left the bidding to
the Knicks. He made overtures to the Lakers about Eddie Jones and
Elden Campbell and explored several other deals, but he never
pulled the trigger to upgrade his team offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into building a team,'' he said. ``We went through the
season with this basketball team because we wanted to see it whole
in the playoffs, and if this is what I've seen in the playoffs,
then we got a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a winning team. We're a good program. We're building
something good down there. But this isn't good at all. It doesn't
mean anything to win three Atlantic Division titles if we lose in
the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Dilapidated, leaky and losing value every day, this is the house
that Pat built. Yet it was built with integrity and character, and
until it becomes unlivable Riley cannot tear it down, for that
would be to admit that his way was the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if another loss to the Knicks would be the season's
enduring image.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's going to happen,'' Riley said. ``But it's up to
us to objectively evaluate exactly what happened and why it
happened and then go from there. We're still in a building process
of championship dreams. And right now those dreams are getting a
little bit cloudy.'' &QL;

TEMPORARY MICROSOFT WORKERS WIN STOCK RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a decision that could have wide ramifications for
employment practices, a federal appeals court has ruled that about
10,000 of Microsoft's current and former temporary workers are
entitled to take part in the company's discounted stock-purchase
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday, by a three-judge panel of the 9th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, determined that a
worker hired through a temporary agency could qualify as a
Microsoft employee, depending on which company controlled that
person's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if for some purposes a worker is considered an employee
of the agency,'' the judges ruled, ``that would not preclude his
status as a common-law employee of Microsoft. The two are not
mutually exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the seven-year-old class-action suit said that a
broad group of temporary employees, those working at Microsoft from
1986 through the present, were entitled to a benefit enjoyed by
permanent employees: the right to purchase Microsoft stock twice a
year at a 15 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision reversed a previous ruling that had
narrowly limited the group potentially eligible to several hundred
contract employees _ not temporary workers hired through an agency
_ who worked at Microsoft between 1987 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, a vice president at Giga Information Group in Santa
Clara, Calif., which follows the computer industry, said that if
the ruling was upheld, it could cost the company $15 million to $20
million, though the formula that might be used to arrive at a
remedy was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a broad decision, and it applies to all businesses,''
he said. ``If you've got a temp worker putting in 20-plus hours a
week, you better start considering him or her like you would a
part-time worker,'' including providing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock was off by $1.375 Thursday, closing at
$79.125.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to appeal the decision to a larger panel of
9th Circuit judges in the next two weeks, said Dan Leach, a
Microsoft spokesman. Microsoft uses about 6,000 temporary
employees, out of a work force of 30,000 worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft and many other companies in this industry continue
to think it's important to have contingent staff for temporary
assignments,'' through temporary agencies that offer flexible hours
and, often, higher hourly wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Claims are also pending against Microsoft regarding temporary
workers' rights to retirement plans, health insurance, vacation,
holidays and sick leave.

76ERS BEAT THE MAGIC WITH SPEED AND STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The coach owns two NBA championship rings. The
starting power forward owns three. Two of their leading scorers
have finals experience, and the Orlando Magic is far more seasoned
than its upstart opponents, the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic's maturity was nowhere to be found Thursday night
at the First Union Center. Whatever savvy Orlando brought to
Philadelphia crumbled beneath the pressure of a smothering 76ers
assault that was sparked by quickness and enforced by strength.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting Orlando's call to brawl, the youthful 76ers pummeled
their guests by 97-85 to take a 2-1 lead in this best-of-5-game
series. Game 4 is here Saturday afternoon, and if the third-seeded
Magic want to avoid elimination, they had better bring more mettle
to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway, who along with teammate Nick Anderson helped
Orlando reach the NBA finals in 1995, had fear in his eyes. Horace
Grant, who won three titles with Michael Jordan, was no enforcer on
this night, and Chuck Daly, the celebrated coach of Detroit's Bad
Boys, could not come up with a scheme to solve Philadelphia's
abrasive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Allen Iverson, the league-leading scorer who was bumped
and jostled into an erratic 13-point performance in Orlando's Game
2 victory, dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Redeeming himself with a vengeance, he scored 33 points and used
his breathtaking quickness to put expressions of fright on the
Magic players' faces and generally take them out of their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Swarming the passing lanes, Iverson set an NBA playoff record
for steals, with 10. His ninth theft, which set the mark, came less
than five minutes into the third quarter and ended with a
fashionable two-handed dunk that gave the 76ers a 56-39 lead. Two
more slams in the next two minutes buried the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by the defensive pressure of the faster 76ers, Hardaway
committed seven turnovers, including four of the Magic's 20 in the
first half. Orlando finished with 27 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made 14 steals to break the game open by halftime,
taking leads of 23-15 after one quarter and 46-31 after two. As
careless as Hardaway was with the ball, his backcourt mate, Darrell
Armstrong, was worse, committing nine turnovers. &QL;

CLINTON'S REMARKS IN DEFENSE OF MILITARY INTERVENTION IN BALKANS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-CLINTON) 
 (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from President Clinton's
speech to a veterans' group Thursday on Kosovo, as recorded by The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Now from the outset of this conflict, we and our allies have
been very clear about what Belgrade must do to end it. The central
imperative is this: The Kosovars must be able to return home and
live in safety. For this to happen, the Serb forces must leave.
Partial withdrawals can only mean continued civil wars with the
Kosovar insurgents. There must also be an international security
force with NATO at its core. Without that force, after all they've
been through, the Kosovars simply won't go home. Their requirements
are neither arbitrary nor overreaching. These things we have said
are simply what is necessary to make peace work.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say Europe and its North American allies
have no business intervening in the ethnic conflicts of the
Balkans. They are the inevitable result, these conflicts, according
to some, of centuries-old animosities, which were unleashed by the
end of the Cold War restraints in Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I myself have been guilty of saying that on an occasion or two
and I regret it now, more than I can say. For I have spent a great
deal of time in these last six years reading the real history of
the Balkans and the truth is that a lot of what passes for common
wisdom in this area is a gross oversimplification and misreading of
history.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that for centuries these people have lived together
in the Balkans and southeastern Europe with greater or lesser
degree of tensions, but often without anything approaching the
intolerable conditions and conflicts that exist today. And we do no
favors to ourselves or to the rest of the world when we justify
looking away from this kind of slaughter by oversimplifying and
conveniently in our own way demonizing the whole Balkans by saying
that these people are simply incapable of civilized behavior with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is, people say, OK, maybe it's not inevitable but
look, there are a lot of ethnic problems in the world. Russia has
dealt with Chechnya and you've got ... all these ethnic problems
everywhere, and religious problems, you've got, that's what the
Middle East is about. You've got Northern Ireland. You've got the
horrible, horrible genocide in Rwanda. You've got the, the war now
between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   They say oh, we've got all these problems. And, and therefore,
why do you care about this? I say to them, there is a huge
difference between people who can't resolve their problems
peacefully and fight about it and people who resort to systematic
ethnic cleansing and slaughter of people because of their religious
or ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference. There is a difference. And that is the
difference that NATO, that our allies have tried to recognize and
act on. I believe that is what we saw in Bosnia and Kosovo. I think
the only thing we have seen that really rivals that rooted in
ethnic or religious destruction in the, this decade is what
happened in Rwanda and I regret very much that the world community
was not organized and able to act quickly there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the Kosovars home is a moral issue. But it is a very
practical, strategic issue in a world where the future will be
threatened by the growth of terrorist groups, the easy spread of
weapons of mass destruction, the use of technology, including the
Internet for people to learn how to make bombs and wreck countries.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a significant security issue, particularly because
of Kosovo's location. It is just as much a security issue for us as
ending the war in Bosnia was. Though we are working hard with the
international community to sustain them, a million or more
permanent Kosovar refugees could destabilize Albania, Macedonia,
the wider region, become a fertile ground for radicalism and
vengeance that would consume southeastern Europe. And if Europe
were overwhelmed with that, you know we would have to then come in
and help them.
</P>
<P>
   Far better for us all to work together to be firm, to be
resolute, to be determined to resolve this now. If the European
Community and its American and Canadian allies were to turn away
from and therefore reward ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, all we
would do is to create for ourselves an environment where this sort
of practice were sanctioned by other people who found it convenient
to build their own political power and therefore we would be
creating a world of trouble for Europe and for the United States in
the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   I'd just like to make one more point about this in terms of the
history of the Balkans. As long as people have existed, there have
been problems among people who were different from one another and
there probably always will be. But you do not have systematic
slaughter in an effort to eradicate the religion, the culture, the
heritage, the very record of presence of the people in any area,
unless some politician thinks it is in his interest to foment that
sort of hatred. That's how these things happen. People with
organized, political and military power decide it is in their
interest that they get something out of convincing the people they
control or they influence to go kill other people and uproot them
and dehumanize them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe that the Serb people in their souls are any
better, I mean any worse, than we are. Do you? Do you believe when
a little baby is born into a certain ethnic or racial group that
somehow they, they have some poison in there that has to at some
point when they grow up, turn into some vast flame of destruction?
</P>
<P>
   You think the Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on
their own without Hitler? Was there something in the history of the
German race that made them do this? No.
</P>
<P>
   We've got to get straight about this. This is something
political leaders do.
</P>
<P>
   And if people make decisions to do these kinds of things, other
people can make decisions to stop them and if the resources are
properly arrayed, it can be done. And that is exactly what we
intend to do. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nobody claims that we can make everyone love each other
overnight. That is not required.
</P>
<P>
   But what is required are basic norms of civilized conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Until Serbia accepts these conditions, we will continue to grind
down its war machine. ...
</P>
<P>
   But the cycle of violence has to end. The children of the
Balkans, all of them, deserve the chance to grow up without fear.
The Serbs simply must free themselves of the notion that their
neighbors must be their enemies. The real enemy is a poisonous
hatred unleashed by cynical leaders based on a distorted view of
what constitutes real national greatness. ...
</P>
<P>
   We stand ready, therefore, to embrace Serbia as a part of a new
Europe if the people of Serbia are willing to invest and embrace
that kind of future, if they are ready to build a Serbia and a
Yugoslavia that is democratic and respects the rights and dignity
of all people, if they are ready to join a world where people reach
across the divides to find their common humanity and their common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   This is the right vision and the right course. It is not only
the morally right thing for America; it is the right thing for our
security interests over the long run. ...

BUYERS ARE SELECTIVE AT CHRISTIE'S MODERN ART SALE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sophisticated group of collectors came to
Christie's sale of 20th-century art Thursday night prepared to buy,
but only if the price was right. While clearly the market is hungry
for modern art, bidders for the most part were a controlled group,
willing to stretch their budgets but only so far. The sale totaled
$62.6 million, below the sale's low $64 million estimate. Of the 62
works offered, 10 failed to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were glued to the bidding for Jasper Johns' ``Two
Flags,'' a 1973 painting made of two sets of three canvas panels
each that depicts two vertical flags in red, white and blue. The
work _ the most expensive sale of the evening _ came with a past
auction history. In 1989, at the height of the auction market,
Sotheby's in New York sold it for $11 million. Before the sale,
some experts said they thought the $7 million to $10 million
estimate was too high. Two bidders tried to buy the painting which
sold to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer, for $7.1 million,
making it the evening's most expensive picture.
</P>
<P>
   The evening got off to a brisk start because Christie's shrewdly
began with a cohesive collection of modern art put together over
the last 20 years by a Detroit couple, Maurice and Margo Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen this week is the way people pay a premium for
works of art coming from special collections,'' said Franck Giraud,
head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments.
</P>
<P>
   Three bidders tried to buy one of the Cohens' best paintings,
Leger's ``Three Women with a Bouquet,'' (1922) which combines an
elongated nude figure with two clothed women. Estimated to sell for
$5 million to $7 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone
buyer for less, making $4.4 million. Experts had thought it would
bring a higher price because of its similarity to ``The Big
Breakfast'' which was painted a year earlier and which hangs in the
permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens collected the work of several artists in depth, among
them Miro, Calder and Dubuffet. Miro's ``The Hope,'' which the
artist painted in 1946 as an expression of joy at the end of World
War II, was estimated to bring $2 million to $3 million. It became
one of the evening's top sellers, bringing $4.5 million to another
unidentified telephone bidder. Five people wanted to take home
``Woman being Stabbed by the Sun,'' a 1939 gouache that relates to
a painting on view at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice. After
a serious bidding war it finally sold to a telephone bidder for
$1.4 million, twice its $700,000 low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Four bidders also wanted ``Painting (The Circus Horse)'' (1927)
a Surrealist painting on a brilliant blue background that was
estimated at $1.8 million to $2.5 million. Eventually the hammer
fell at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens also owned a number of works by Calder. Among the
best was a standing mobile, ``Red Post, Black Leaves,'' which was
estimated to fetch $600,000 to $800,000. Abigail Asher, a Manhattan
dealer, bought the sculpture for $937,500. Another standing mobile
sold for way above its estimate. ``Hanging Apricot,'' (1950) was
thought to sell for $500,000 to $700,000. William Acquavella,
another Manhattan dealer, was willing to pay $992,500.
</P>
<P>
   Dubuffets made up a large group of the Cohens holdings. ``Secret
Dances of the Beard'' is a small ink collage of a standing man with
a beard from a series the artist executed in 1959. Four bidders
made a serious effort to buy the collage which finally sold for
$173,000, nearly three times its high estimate of $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also from 1959, ``The Vase of Beard,'' in which a beard is
juxtaposed with a vase _ an improbable fusion between two disparate
elements _ was thought to sell for $1.2 million to $1.6 million,
Marc Blondeau, a Parisian dealer, bought it for $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade earlier, in 1948, Dubuffet painted ``Sahara''
from a trip he made to North Africa. It was estimated to sell for
$900,000 to $1.2 million, and was bought by a telephone bidder for
$1.9 million. An early gouache, pen and ink, ``The Nude Cyclist''
inspired by a bicycle trip that the artist took in 1943 through the
South of France, was thought to sell for $100,000 to $150,000. It
sold for twice its high estimate. A telephone buyer, bidding
through Giraud, paid $332,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohen collection was by far the evening's success story,
making $22.1 million, above its $16.5 low estimate. The rest of the
evening, however, was touch and go.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse has been a particularly popular artist recently. His
``The Safrano Roses (Still Life in Front of an Open Window, Nice,
Place Charles-Felix)'' from 1925, one of a group of sun-filled
still lifes the artist painted in Nice, was estimated to bring $3
million to $4 million. There were many interested takers and the
painting sold for $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   One record price was set last night. It was for Henry Moore's
``Reclining Figure (1969-1970.) Robert Mnuchin, a Manhattan dealer,
bought it for $4 million, $1 million above its high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contributed to one of the strongest prices of the evening,''
said Mnuchin after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Mitchell-Innes, another Manhattan dealer said that ``even
mediocre pictures did well.'' But, she added, ``The biggest problem
these days is that good property changes hands so fast it is
distressing. It means works aren't reaching the auction rooms and
for dealers, it's hard to keep any inventory.''  &QL;

WITH TEAM PRICES SOARING, INDIANS GO UP FOR SALE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tantalized by escalating franchise prices, Richard Jacobs put
his Cleveland Indians up for sale Thursday, less than a year after
taking the team public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this,'' said Jacobs, a 73-year-old real estate
developer. ``Somebody said Steinbrenner said his team is worth $1
billion and he had a buyer. And I said, `If that buyer has a
brother, give him my number.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Jacobs may sell drove Indians stock up by 63.5
percent, to close at $16.25. Since going public last June at $15 a
share, the stock has underperformed the market, sinking to a low of
$5.375 a share. Based on Thursday's closing price, the team is
worth about $224 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll go for more than that,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer whose brother, Charles, is the
chairman of Cablevision, said the plan to sell the Indians came as
a ``real surprise.'' In a statement, he said, ``It is premature to
say whether or not I am a prospective buyer.'' Recently, Larry
Dolan unsuccessfully bid for the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he was not selling for estate-planning reasons. In
fact, he had tried to diversify the company by adding real estate
properties like hotels or television and radio stations, which
might have made the stock more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he felt the easiest way to boost the stock was to sell
the team,'' said Jeffrey Phillips, a vice president at Houlihan
Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, a Chicago-based investment banking firm that
specializes in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs was motivated to consider selling by the prices paid
last year for other Major League Baseball teams, like the Los
Angeles Dodgers, at $311 million, and the Texas Rangers, at $250
million. Earlier this year, the Yankees were valued at $600 million
for their merger with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs watched as the National Football League sold the
expansion Cleveland Browns for $530 million _ Jacobs was an early
candidate in the team's auction _ and kept an eye on the pending
$800 million sale of the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Abe Pollin, 75, sold the Washington Capitals and a
small stake in the Washington Wizards and the MCI Center for about
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any interest in disposing of the franchise until
recently,'' Jacobs said. ``But there's a market for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' sale by the Jack Kent Cooke estate has been a
rancorous affair that has featured the withdrawal of one contracted
buyer, Howard Milstein, and the entrance of Daniel Snyder, one of
his partners, as the likely purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs said he wanted to control the process and keep the
Indians in Cleveland. If he is unhappy with the prices offered or
the suitors, he said, he will yank the team off the market. But
Jacobs has hired two investment banking firms, Goldman Sachs Group
and McDonald Investments, to identify buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the price, Jacobs will profit handsomely. He and his
late brother, David, acquired the once-moribund team in 1986 for
$36 million. When the team went public, Jacobs collected $60
million from selling four million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jacobs was paid a $467,424 salary. General Manager
John Hart earned $600,000 and received a bonus of $195,692.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine a future owner wanting to flee
Cleveland or lose the financial foundation of revenues that flow
from the publicly owned Jacobs Field. The five-year-old stadium has
sold out 308 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team earned operating income of $12.7 million on
revenues of $144.5 million, which included $55.8 million for
tickets, $16.2 million for concessions, $9.4 million for luxury
suite and club seat rentals and $9.8 million for advertising.
Playoff revenues totaled $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Indians have maximized most existing revenues,
Jacobs said the team expected to benefit greatly when baseball's
national television contracts expire after the 2000 season and from
selling naming rights to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do better than they've been doing,'' said Andy
Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. ``They have
excess demands for all tickets, and they've thought of merging with
the Cavaliers into a holding company that would present a united
front to sell TV rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Since moving into Jacobs Field, the Indians' record is 464-310,
a winning percentage of .599. The team lost the 1995 and 1997 World
Series and the American League Championship Series to the Yankees
last season.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE AND THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's first instinct in responding to April's high school
massacre in Littleton, Colo., was to obey the gun lobby by ducking
any crackdown on weapons and, incredibly, even relaxing existing
gun controls. Fortunately, this action was so perverse, so out of
touch with the tides of public concern, that it triggered a
backlash that has forced a partial retreat.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Republican-led Senate, jumping as high as the
National Rifle Association demanded, killed a proposal to close the
egregious loophole in the Brady law that allows criminals and
juveniles to purchase firearms at gun shows without any background
check. Then it approved an amendment offered by Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, an NRA board member, that would significantly weaken
existing gun control laws by opening big new loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just three weeks after the tragic events at Columbine
High School, where all four weapons used in the massacre were
bought at gun shows, this outcome was an insult to all Americans
concerned about the ease with which troubled youngsters can now
obtain weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, under pressure from President Clinton and
Republican colleagues who had second thoughts, like Sens. John
McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Gordon Smith of
Oregon, Craig reversed course on gun shows by introducing a
amendment _ itself shot through with loopholes _ to require
background checks for firearms sales at such shows.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``fix'' would not rescind other gifts to the NRA
designed to ease gun access that are buried in his original
measure. These include a new pawnshop loophole that will allow
convicted felons to get their guns out of hock without any
background check, and a provision that will allow licensed gun
dealers to sell their wares at gun shows outside their home states,
making it harder to effectively police shady gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is not yet over. Taking advantage of the backlash
against gun-lobby politics, gun control advocates Thursday
successfully added some important provisions to a broader juvenile
crime bill, including a ban on juvenile purchase and possession of
assault rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is no friend of gun control.
But given the embarrassing events of the past two days, and the
public's strong interest in seeing Congress seriously address the
problem of youth and guns, he should allow an extensive
freestanding debate, and recorded votes, on all the items in the
Democratic package.

CRIME DOWN IN NEW YORK CITY SUBWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the subway system may be a long way from
shedding its image as a symbol of urban menace, new police
statistics show that underground crime has dropped precipitously in
the first four months of the year, continuing an eight-year decline
that has been steeper than the city's overall drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such high-profile crimes as the shoving of two riders to
the tracks in that period, crime experts say the most telling
measures of crime in the subways are different from those elsewhere
in the city, in part because murder and rape have always been rare
in the subway system. The new figures show that the most common
types of subway crime, like pickpocketing and common assault, have
dropped the most sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with New York City Transit and transit watchdogs
attribute the drop in part to improved police work and in part to
the impact of a major increase in subway ridership. They say that a
new-found safety in numbers, and perhaps a renewed sense of
civility, may be reinforcing the downward trend, in which six
categories of felonies dropped 15 percent in the first third of
1999 compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are doing a better job, and people are looking out
for each other,'' said Michael T. Doyle, a transportation planner
for the New York City Transit Riders Council, a state-funded
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also the sheer factor of numbers,'' he added. ``With
so many people riding the subways, its is hard for the criminals
not to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The police figures released Thursday showed that in a system
serving 3.4 million riders daily, there were were 547 robberies
reported, or 4.6 a day, during the first four months of the year, a
drop of 17 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Grand larceny, a category that includes the theft of wallets,
credit cards, jewelry and other property worth over $1,000, was
more commonplace, the police said, with six such crimes reported
each day, but dropped 12 percent over last year. The other of the
most common subway crimes, assaults, was least prevalent, with and
average of 1.1 reported to the police each day, a drop of 18
percent.

THE `REAL' SIDE OF SPEAKERS IS WHAT BUSINESS AUDIENCES WANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the idea of giving speeches gives you quaky knees and
nightmares, Geoffrey Lane has some reassuring thoughts for you.
</P>
<P>
   Think Roberto Benigni, the effusive Italian actor, at the
Academy Awards. Just be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The highly polished presentation speech is rapidly becoming
obsolete in an era when audiences demand more interaction with
their speakers, Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, making presentations is a growing part of many
people's jobs. People present their ideas to staff, customers,
regulators, community members and a host of other audiences, often
on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to effectively present an idea and connect with an
audience is a critical skill in today's work environment, said
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, whose NuMethod Education Inc. training business is based
in Vancouver, B.C., has spent more than two decades talking for a
living. Now he's teaching others new ways of approaching public
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ironic twist for Lane, whose speaking career nearly
tanked after his first time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook and I sweated,'' he said. ``I died that awful social
death everybody fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he got off the stage, though, he was fine presenting his
ideas on a one-to-one basis with audience members.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that if he applied the same relaxed, informal
style of speaking he used in those face-to-face conversations when
he got back up in front of groups, the response of the audience was
much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience wants to know who you are, and what you care
about,'' he said. ``So don't waste your time trying to be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Most audiences are sophisticated. They're experts at getting
information quickly. What they want from a speaker is something
they can't get off the Web _ a sense of personal connection and a
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ``public speaking,'' which connotes standing up
before a vast auditorium of people, has changed, he said. Most
speaking is done to groups of 30 or fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   That demands a more intimate, ``real'' presentation style.
</P>
<P>
   People are put off when speakers are so formal that their
natural style doesn't show through, he said. The best-remembered
Oscar speeches, for example, are those when the true personality of
the speaker shines. Benigni made an indelible impression with his
infectious enthusiasm. Gwyneth Paltrow made an equally strong one
by revealing her personal ties to her family, something that
mattered deeply to her.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers make those personal connections with the audience by
letting their guard down, showing people who they really are, and
sharing relevant personal stories, Lane said. Most people are the
most persuasive when they're being themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People can also improve their presentations by knowing their
audiences. ``You have to understand their demographics, their
psychology, how they listen and what their intention is in
listening to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will come to get educated. Some will come to get a
few pointers to support what they already know, and some come so
they can criticize you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing at the outset helps you tailor your message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every speaker should have a purpose and objective,'' he said.
``The reason you do research about the audience is so you can craft
the message so it will be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   An engineer presenting the environmental impact of a project,
for example, would present the information differently to a panel
of regulators than to a meeting of community members. The
information may be the same, but the presentations will take into
account the different needs of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some other tricks Lane has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Today's audiences want to be informed and entertained, he said.
There's nothing duller than someone who stands in one place and
lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Moving around, making eye contact with the audience, laughing
and using humor where appropriate will help people connect with
what you're telling them. Involving the audience helps as well.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell jokes. Most people aren't that good at telling them,
he said. Bob Hope once admitted he sometimes practices his
one-liners for years to get them right.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   End on a strong note.
</P>

GOVERNMENT SUES AMERICAN AIRLINES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday accused
American Airlines of engaging in predatory practices to drive three
small airlines away from its hub at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials contend American, the nation's second-largest
carrier, saturated markets with flights and slashed fares in a
systematic attempt to snuff out competition from start-up carriers
Vanguard Airlines, SunJet International and Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``American crossed a fundamental line,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joel Klein. ``It operated at a loss for one reason only _
to kill off a competitor so that it could then more-than-recoup
those short-term losses through monopoly pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they were ``bewildered and
disappointed'' by the Justice Department action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than enforcing established legal standards in an
appropriate case, the government has chosen to overreach and
improperly attempt to extend the law to punish actions that have
consistently been found by the courts to be lawful and beneficial
to consumers,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth, Texas--based carrier argued the Justice
Department was attempting to enforce a standard that would ``take
away from consumers the ability to choose between two
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Small, start-up carriers have been complaining for years about
the major airlines' tactics at their ``fortress hub'' airports.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District
Court in Wichita, Kan., represents the first time antitrust
enforcers have gone to court over an airline's behavior at a hub
airport since the industry was first deregulated 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shot across the bow, warning all airlines not to
overreact when a small guy enters the market,'' Ray Neidl, an
airline analyst with ING Barings Furman Selz, said of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials are known to have been investigating at least
three other carriers _ United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and
Northwest Airlines. Klein confirmed Thursday that investigations of
other airlines are continuing, but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   American is far-and-away the largest carrier operating at DFW,
the nation's third-busiest airport. American offers more than 700
flights from DFW daily, serving 70 percent of the nonstop
passengers flying between that airport and other cities, the
Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit _ the product of an 18-month investigation _
Justice officials say American executives first became concerned
about competition from low-cost carriers back in 1993. Airline
managers feared these new entrant, low-cost carriers could threaten
nearly $1.5 billion in revenues annually, the government alleges.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Kansas City, Mo.-based Vanguard launched air
service between DFW and Kansas City, with three round-trip flights
daily. American operated eight round-trip flights _ controlling 65
percent of the market _ while Delta offered six.
</P>
<P>
   By April, American had matched Vanguard's fares, dropping its
prices from an average $108 each way to $80 each way. Vanguard cut
back its service to one round trip a day, and in May, Delta dropped
all of its service between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   American then beefed up its service, adding six new round-trip
flights daily. Company documents indicate American's plan was ``to
drive (Vanguard) from the market,'' the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Vanguard withdrew from that market. American began
reducing service, dropping from 14 flights daily to 10 a day by
July 1996, the suit notes.
</P>
<P>
   American also kicked up its fares, with prices for a one-way
ticket ranging from $112 to $147. The route was transformed from
one of the carrier's worst performers to ``best in the West,''
Justice officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in September 1996, Vanguard announced plans to expand its
DFW service once again, with nonstop flights to Kansas City,
Phoenix and Cincinnati. The carrier was already flying to Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   American responded by expanding service to Kansas City and
Wichita, accelerating plans for new service to Phoenix and resuming
previously abandoned service to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard dropped the plan, and American again raised its fares,
some to Cincinnati by as much as 80 percent, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   When Smyrna, Ga.-based SunJet, a public charter operator, and
Western Pacific also tried to expand at DFW, American likewise
added service in effort to force them from the market, the Justice
Department contends.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard hailed the suit as vindication of a position it has
argued for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a move that will preserve open competition throughout
the industry and help consumers and new entrant airlines alike,''
Robert ``Rocky'' Spane, Vanguard's chief executive officer, said in
a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard plans to begin service between Chicago and Buffalo,
N.Y., a market American serves, with four flights daily. Vanguard
officials said they will be watching closely for any behavior they
would consider predatory.
</P>
<P>
   SunJet said it was pleased the Justice Department took into
account the harm it had suffered. Western Pacific is believed to be
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes as the airline industry is already under
scrutiny for its customer service. At least four so-called
passenger rights bill have been introduced in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called the suit ``good
for consumers'' and ``consistent with this department's efforts to
prevent major carriers from using anti-competitive tactics to drive
low-fare carriers from their hub markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials are currently readying new guidelines
on airline competition, proposals they plan to send up to Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler, a consumer advocate for the on-line travel
service 1travel.com, said ``The entire hub set-up could really come
under attack if this thing succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers themselves must accept some responsibility for the
fate of new carriers, Trippler said. If passengers want new
carriers to stay in business, they must fly them, he said.

STARS COACH UNFAZED BY HIGH EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock leaned back in his chair and
laughed a loud ``Hah!''_ the kind of laugh that clears the throat,
the kind of laugh that clears the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure? Is this pressure?'' the Stars coach said, answering
a question with a question. ``I guess you could call it pressure,
but the playoffs are always pressure. This is no different than any
year of my career. I've been through this at every level. Yeah,
there's pressure, but you have to be able to thrive on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off consecutive overtime losses and heading into a
crucial Game 5 of their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals
series with the St. Louis Blues tomorrow night at Reunion Arena,
the Stars have earned the pressure of the playoffs. It can be read
in newspapers, heard on radio talk shows and seen on national
television, where even hockey's greatest experts are starting to
dissect the Stars to find out if there's something to accusations
that the team can't step up its play from the regular season _
where it twice has won the Presidents' Trophy _ to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the series is tied at 2-2 and the Stars still hold the
home-ice advantage, experts and fans are asking the Stars for a
sign _ pondering whether the Stars need to beat the Blues
convincingly to prove themselves a worthy contender for the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it goes to seven games, just so long as we
win,'' Hitchcock said. Nobody's talking about what will happen if
the Blues don't advance past the second round _ they don't have any
expectations to make it to the Western Conference finals. If the
Stars' lose, however, people in North Texas will want answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just life,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said. ``That's
life outside the rink and outside the room. And that's life we
can't worry about right now. Our life is on the ice, and on the ice
it's a dogfight between two teams who expect to win.'']
</P>
<P>
   But should the Stars worry themselves about what others think?
Certainly, North Texas will be putting even more pressure on the
Stars' _ the one shining chance at a championship for local teams.
As Game 5 approaches, the Stars' collective city will get even more
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the city's problem, not mine,'' Hitchcock said. ``My
problem is to get every ounce of potential out of every player,
that's my goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will win this series, I have that confidence,''
Hitchcock said. ``But if we don't, what are you going to do? You
can't go worrying about what's going to happen if you lose, then
you already have one foot in the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he can't understand why people continue to paint
the Blues as such an underdog. They allowed the fewest shots on
goal of any NHL team (23.5) per game, they had the second-best
penalty-killing unit and the third- best power play. They also were
able to post a 37-32-13 record despite using five goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team, this has been a good team for years and
it's a team that gives us a lot of problems,'' Hitchcock said.
``Can't people see that?''
</P>
<P>
   What people see is the Stars had 114 points during the regular
season and the Blues had 87. What people see is that they've never
heard of Pavol Demitra, Michal Handzus and Jochen Hecht, no matter
how good they are. What people see is that a team with Mike Modano
and Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull and Pat Verbeek should be able to
score, should be able to run a decent power play, should be able to
advance past the blue-collar Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every team is going to win, and first seeds get knocked
off all the time in hockey,'' Keane said. ``Look at New Jersey,
look at Ottawa, look at Philadelphia. I mean, this is a sport where
it's not always the top teams that win, and you obviously are aware
of that as a player. But at the same time, do you want to be the
team that might have a chance to pull an upset or do you want to be
the team that is supposed to win, that carries the expectations of
winning?''
</P>
<P>
   Keane said the Stars don't mind the pressure. Several of the
players carried it every day when they used to play for the
Montreal Canadiens. Keane, a former Canadiens captain, said it was
no different than when he helped the Colorado Avalanche win the
Stanley Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we got \Rgoalie\S Patrick \RRoy\S, it was `All
right, go out and win the thing,'' Keane said. ``That was the
expectation, and we were able to meet that expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, a team has to answer key challenges, and Game 5
will provide just that. of the final three games at home.] To hold
their home-ice advantage, they need to assert themselves tomorrow
night. A win at Reunion Arena, where the Stars are 4-0 in the
playoffs and where they went 29-8-4 during the regular season _ the
best home record in the league _ puts the pressure squarely back on
the Blues. A loss by the Stars means they'll have to win at Kiel
Center, where they are 0-5-1 in their past six visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on the home team in Game 5,'' Hitchcock said.
``It should be a helluva a game, and it shouldn't be any different
than any other game in this series. They thought they should have
won some games, we thought we should have won some games. I see the
series is exactly where it should be.''

TEEN SPANIARD SPINS HIS BEST TIGER TALE, TRAILS WOODS BY 1
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ He packs a yo-yo and a video game into his
suitcase on long trips. He is still studying for his June high
school graduation. And if everything falls right, he'll have
completed requirements for his first driver's license next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, 19, might have a lot of growing up to do. But the
native of Borriol, Spain, is already grown up on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, hailed in his homeland as the European Tiger Woods for
his boyish charm and killer golf game, fired an 8-under-par 62
yesterday at Cottonwood Valley Course during the first round of the
GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   With his scoring forged by nine birdies and only one bogey,
Garcia is in a three-way tie for second place. Interestingly,
Garcia sits one stroke behind the very player to whom his career is
being compared, Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to be myself,'' Garcia said, ``but if they
compare you with a good player, I guess that means you have
something in your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia has plenty of game. His father, Victor, is a golf pro and
serves as Sergio's swing coach. The work with dad has paid off. At
15, Garcia was the European Amateur champ. He has won Spanish and
French amateur championships and is the reigning British Amateur
champion. Last month, he finished as the low amateur in the
Masters. And his Miami-based agent, Jose Marquina, said Garcia has
won more than 70 amateur tournaments in 15 different countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got every part of the game that you need to be
successful,'' said Jerry Higginbotham, who served as caddie for
Mark O'Meara's 1998 Masters championship and is now the caddie for
Garcia. ``He is very aggressive. He attacks the golf course. He is
very accomplished. He'll be a force for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia began yesterday with a 29 on the front nine, scoring five
birdies in his first eight holes. He was briefly tied with Woods
for the lead after a birdie on the par-3 17th. But his tee shot on
18 hit a tree and then he two-putted after he left his 8-iron
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-two is OK,'' Garcia deadpanned to a laughing media
audience. ``I finished bad. ... You need to have luck. You need to
play well. Maybe some days I shoot 75 and some days I shoot 62.
I'll just try to keep playing my game and see if it goes well.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has.

TEETH AREN'T A WEAPON IN AN ATTACK, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state's highest court decided Thursday to take the
teeth out of the state's laws on assault.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vigorous dissent invoking the infamous Evander
Holyfield-Mike Tyson fight, the state Court of Appeals ruled that a
former Brooklyn resident, Maxwell Owusu, could not be charged with
using his teeth as a ``dangerous instrument'' in a fight with his
estranged wife's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The teeth were part of Owusu's body and not some portable device
he picked up to cause more serious injuries, the court decided,
noting that ``Owusu's teeth came with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-1 decision stemmed from a February 1996 incident in which
Owusu entered his former apartment on Caton Avenue in the
Kensington section and started fighting with Michael Samuel. After
punching him in the face and knocking him to the floor, court
papers contend, Owusu bit Samuel's left index finger to the bone,
severing nerves and causing serious permanent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Owusu, a Nigerian native who is now a U.S. citizen, was charged
with first-degree burglary and first-degree assault, both felonies
involving a dangerous instrument. The top charge carried a possible
sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years in jail, said Joyce Slevin, the
assistant district attorney handling the case in state Supreme
Court, noting that domestic violence cases often involve teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't come up with strangers, it doesn't come up with
robberies, but in domestic abuse cases it does,'' said Ms. Slevin,
who compared teeth to weapons like a baseball bat. ``We are saying,
why should anyone be treated differently for using his teeth?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ruling, the charges against Owusu will have to be
reduced to second-degree burglary and second-degree assault, with
the top charge carrying a maximum sentence of 7 1/2 to 15 years.
The case has never been tried and no trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate division of state Supreme Court had upheld the
original charges, citing an earlier case in which a man's foot was
deemed a dangerous instrument. But in that case the foot had been
encased in a boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add something to a body part, then it would be a
dangerous instrument,'' said Edward Friedman, Owusu's
court-appointed lawyer, in praising Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that molars can be menacing depending on
how they are used and noted the strong dissent to Thursday's ruling
by Judge Joseph Bellacosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield,'' the justice wrote, ``might then
legitimately wonder about the implied extrapolation from this case
holding that Tyson's (or anyone else's) `choppers' could never be
deemed or used as an `instrument' of dangerous propensities.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that previous rulings had found that even a sidewalk
could be a dangerous instrument if someone was seriously injured by
having his head beaten against it, Bellacosa said the jury should
decide in each case what constitutes a dangerous instrument.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the court's decision might produce absurd
cases in the future. Someone with dentures biting someone else, for
instance, might be found liable of using a dangerous instrument
because they are not attached to the assailant's mouth.

FOR SCURRY, IT'S WORLD CUP OR NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn.)  (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ It was a harmless victory ritual by the Norwegian
soccer players, crawling on the ground, linked hand-to-ankle like
human boxcars, but the memory of the celebration has been as
indelible for Briana Scurry as the tattoo of a panther on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The match occurred in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World
Cup, and Scurry allowed the lone goal in a 1-0 defeat for the
United States, which disconsolately settled for third place after
winning the initial women's world championship in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Norway's victory came on a ball headed past Scurry, the American
goalkeeper, on a corner kick. She tried vainly to muscle through a
wall of opponents, and the ball whistled past her, inside the near
post, seemingly no more than an inch beyond her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the Norwegians fell to the ground, linked up and
began choo-chooing around the field in a routine called the Train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was harmless but humiliating,'' Scurry said as the
Americans prepared for an exhibition match here Thursday night
against the Netherlands in a tuneup for next month's 1999 Women's
World Cup. ``I burned it into my head so I wouldn't forget it
later. I felt I wasn't strong enough to get to the ball, so I hit
the weight room hard. I was determined to knock a few Norwegians
around.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the two teams met again in the semifinals of the
1996 Summer Olympics. Scurry had put on 15 pounds, weighing about
150, and she stood her ground as the Americans prevailed, 2-1, in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the Americans won the inaugural Olympic
tournament over China and, keeping a promise, Scurry streaked down
a secluded street in Athens, Ga., wearing nothing but her gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such a release of anxiety from the year before,''
Scurry said. ``I did not cry a tear until we beat them in the
Olympics. That's when I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, in the Rose Bowl, the United States could face
Norway yet again in the final of the 1999 World Cup, and there is a
redemptive need among the Americans to defeat the defending world
champions and to derail the Train once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics was a great payback, but that was separate,''
Scurry said. ``To be the Olympic champion and world champion at the
same time would be the be-all and end-all. We took that game hard
in 1995. We expect to win, and when we don't it's devastation. We
won third, but it was like `Who cares?' We felt like they had taken
something that was ours. We need to take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry grew up in Anoka, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis that is
the supposed inspiration for Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, where
``all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all
the children are above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first love was football, not soccer. In fourth and fifth
grades, she played cornerback and wide receiver in a youth league,
loving that she could ``hit people and it being legal and you would
not get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother would not let her play in a heavier weight division,
so Scurry turned to soccer in the sixth grade. Then, as now, soccer
remains a suburban sport in the United States, unlike the rest of
the world, where it is a city game.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry is the only African-American in the starting lineup for
the United States. The American players feel an almost missionary
zeal as role models for young girls, and for Scurry there is a
particular urgency in her purpose. She hopes that black boys and
girls will see her in person, or on television, this summer and
decide to give soccer a try.
</P>
<P>
   When she gives clinics, Scurry encourages kids to approach
soccer as if it were licorice _ you may not like it, but just taste
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer's not a sport that's in the inner city at all,'' said
Scurry, who is 27 and holds a degree in political science from the
University of Massachusetts. ``For one thing, there's no place to
play. You go in the inner city and what do you see? Tar. And what
do you play on tar? Basketball. Minneapolis has one soccer field in
the entire inner-city area. It's just not something that kids are
exposed to. It's like ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans do well and dominate every sport _ football,
basketball, baseball,'' she said. ``Why not soccer? There's no
reason we can't get more African-Americans playing soccer. It's all
about exposure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When France won the 1998 men's World Cup, galvanizing an entire
country with an exquisitely multiethnic team, American soccer
officials conceded that they had not cast a sufficiently wide net
in seeking talent to build the men's team to respectability and to
keep the women's team atop the sport's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, that is changing. A foundation to develop the sport in
this country has been created by the U.S. Soccer Federation with a
$60 million surplus from the 1994 men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has awarded more than $8 million in grants and
intends to build 500 soccer fields nationwide in the next five
years. About 25 percent of the $2 million in grant money to be
dispensed in the year beginning July 1 has been earmarked for
underprivileged neighborhoods, according to Alan Rothenberg, former
president of the soccer federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continue to develop soccer in this country, there are
two minority groups we have to do a better job with,'' said
Rothenberg, who is chairman of the 1999 Women's World Cup
organizing committee. ``Hispanics are out there playing, but
largely not in federation leagues, so we have to scout outside our
customary locations. And we have to sell African-Americans on the
sport. There are not enough African-Americans playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8-inch Scurry was an all-state basketball forward in
high school who also went to the Minnesota state high school track
championships as a sprinter and long jumper.
</P>
<P>
   She has now built herself into one of the world's top
goalkeepers. Once primarily a shot blocker, relying on her
anticipation and reflexes, she has matured into a goalie who spends
more time organizing the defense and less time having to make
spectacular saves.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Cup, coach Tony DiCicco is counting on Scurry to be
more assertive away from the goal line and to be a reliable
pressure valve when the ball is played back to her by the American
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need her to be the best she's ever been,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Her love of the game, Scurry said, comes from knowing that she
controls the outcome. If the other team cannot score on her, it
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, there will be no nakedly enthusiastic
celebration this summer as at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't top it,'' Scurry said, laughing. ``Maybe bungee
jumping naked, but I don't think that's going to happen.'' &QL;

CITY IS SAID TO WEIGH MOVING FISH MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city is considering a multimillion-dollar plan to
modernize and move the Fulton Fish Market from the storied but
gritty site it has occupied for 166 years in lower Manhattan, a top
Giuliani administration official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to act because of more stringent federal requirements
regarding the refrigeration of fish, the administration plans to
decide by this summer whether to renovate the existing market or
build a new center for wholesale fish and shellfish companies
elsewhere in the city, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said in an
interview. Either alternative would cost $30 million to $55
million, Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify what sections of the city were being
considered as possible sites for the market, the nation's largest
wholesale seafood distribution point, with annual sales of $800
million to $1 billion. But as fishmongers and workers toiled
Thursday in the early morning mists, many said they believed that
City Hall was reviving previous proposals to transfer them to a
spot near the Hunts Point Produce Market in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants and employees also said that the administration
was bent on razing the two main buildings of the market, a remnant
of 19th-century New York that has figured in the works of the
writings of Joseph Mitchell and others. Moving the market, people
who work there say, could clear the way for development of valuable
city-owned land near the South Street Seaport and alongside the
East River.
</P>
<P>
   Washington acknowledged that the city could profit from the sale
of a three-block area for commercial and residential use if the
market is moved. Real estate developers and brokers estimated the
property could be sold for $40 million to $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the city was being forced to act because of
stricter federal regulations for the handling and refrigeration of
perishable seafood. Much of the seafood brought to the market daily
by refrigerated trucks is kept for hours in containers packed with
ice but not refrigerated before it is sold to fish stores and
restaurants, Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that there were no health dangers or sanitary
violations in the current system. But he said that new rules from
the federal Food and Drug Administration would eventually require
more refrigeration, especially in the summer, and other food-safety
protection programs that cannot be easily accommodated in the
market's antiquated electrical system and scruffy buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come into compliance with the new regulations,'' Washington
said, ``we must come up with the most economical plan for the city:
to retrofit the old buildings or relocate and build another
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials want the city to produce a compliance schedule by
this summer, he added, and that is the deadline for a decision on
the market's future.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who is deputy mayor for community development and
business services, said that food safety was not the only reason to
revamp the market. ``The wholesale merchants understand as well as
we do that something has to happen,'' he said. ``The market was
built with technology from the turn of the century, not the
millennium we are about to enter.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shirley Potash Clurman, a retired magazine editor and
television producer, died Thursday at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan.
She was 74 and lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clurman, a native of Los Angeles, began her career in the
publicity department of 20th Century Fox before moving to New York
to work as an assistant to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
II.
</P>
<P>
   She did public relations work for Time Inc. and, until the early
1960s, for the Rockefeller family, then worked as an editor at
People magazine. When she retired, she was working for ABC News as
an associate producer of the news magazine program ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clurman was the widow of Richard M. Clurman, a longtime
leader in New York City's cultural life and former chief of
correspondents and head of Time-Life News Service. He died three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by their son, Michael, of Manhattan; two
stepdaughters, Susan Emma Clurman of Manhattan and Carol Mae Duning
of Alexandria, Va., and a sister, Ellen Schwartz of Waco, Texas.

PSYCHO BABBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Fox Sports News Primetime broadcast, the video
highlight from a New York Yankees game showed Chuck Knoblauch
taking a lead off second base when teammate Tino Martinez hit a
liner up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Steve Lyons looked down at the monitor on the desk and
picked up the live narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes Knoblauch. . . OFF LIKE A PROM DRESS. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Did he just say. . .?
</P>
<P>
   When you live and die by the ``Psycho,'' that's what you've come
to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps testing the boundaries of the Fox attitude to a
psychotic extreme, Lyons continues a career in sportscasting with
much the same, er, gusto, that he exhibited during a nine-year ride
as a do-everything major-leaguer, when his most notable
contribution to the game was as the Chicago White Sox player who
sheepishly yanked up his pants after pulling them down in front of
the Tiger Stadium crowd to shake out dirt after a head-first slide
into first base nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A tour around the cable box reveals Lyons is the only ex-jock
given the responsibility of delivering news on a national studio
show five nights a week. But, please, he doesn't want to be called
a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an idiot ex-baseball player,'' the 38-year-old says.
</P>
<P>
   And many would agree.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fox Sports News rotation, Lyons isn't a bench player any
more. He's teamed in an ``Odd Couple''-like sequel with Chris Myers
on the 10 p.m. and midnight East Coast feeds and the 11 p.m. shows
that go to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same when Lyons was a player and he'd look at
the lineup card posted on the dugout wall to see his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, aren't we TRYING?'' the career .253 hitter would announce
to his teammates _ he hoped before they could say it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing was probably muttered around the Fox Broadcasting
Center in Century City when Fox Sports News executive producer John
Terenzio decided a few months ago that Lyons, who came to Fox after
trying sports-talk radio in Boston and Chicago and spot reporting
at ESPN2 in his post-playing career, would be a permanent anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone probably thought I was nuts, too,'' Terenzio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons jumped aboard Fox's expanding sports staff as a baseball
game analyst several years ago. Terenzio said he noticed Lyons'
broadcasting flair about a year ago when he was doing studio work
for the news show. During a Fox Scope segment, Lyons described a
player going from first to third ``faster than a 16-year-old on a
third date with the same girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio looked up. Did he just say. . .?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little crude,'' Terenzio agreed. ``But it showed
imagination. He was doing highlights better than some of our
highlight people.''
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio asked Lyons if he'd be interested in trying out as an
anchor. Lyons thought Terenzio was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   After a few auditions, which were ``terrible,'' Terenzio said,
Lyons was ready to give up on it. But a month later, Lyons flew in
three weekends in a row from his home in Phoenix to give it another
try. Terenzio said Lyons kept getting better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Steve has always been a natural broadcaster,'' said
Terenzio. ``He talks so effortlessly to the viewer, as he was in
their living room. All we needed to do was train him with the
logistics of a sports anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Fox added Keith Olbermann and Myers to the news
corral, new anchor teams had to be drawn. Terenzio felt Lyons was
ready. So did Lyons. But with what partner? If opposites attract,
Lyons seemed to be a better fit with Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons recognizes his shortcomings. He gets help writing his
nightly scripts, and he types about as well as Myers might handle a
curveball. But Lyons' sports knowledge, competitive nature and
personality are the strengths he's banking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I try to dumb down the scripts I'm given _ if
it's a three- syllable word, I'm in trouble,'' said Lyons. ``I'm
thinking, `If I can't understand it, why make the guy sitting at
home feel stupid?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Lyons' promotion could start a ripple effect in the
``jockocracy'' of sportscasting. If he's considered a success, more
former players who aren't trained in journalism but who producers
feel are engaging enough to pull it off could be lining up for
these spots, rather than gaining experience by doing three-minute
sports segments on local newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a blueprint for the new kind of anchor everyone will
be looking for,'' said Terenzio, who has also tried ex-NFL players
Bill Maas and Ron Pitts as Fox Sports News anchors, with varying
degrees of success. ``It's a case-by-case basis. Some can't pull it
off five nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be three elements for success on a sportscast:
content, logical presentation and the strength of the personalities
who front the show. If there's zero personality, the shows are
simply no good. Clearly, Steve has the natural personality _ a
child-like wonderment _ and the experience of a professional
athlete. We can teach him the other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Except when it comes to ad-libbing, which Lyons admits can work
for and against him. Viewers might tune in to see what the loose
cannon says tonight, but crossing a line of taste is something that
could bring him down some day.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the time when Lyons said Oakland pitcher Kenny Rodgers
was hit by a line drive and ``went down like a sniper got him''
right around the time of the Columbine High School shootings.
Things Lyons says can come off as sophomoric, homophobic or just
plain mean-spirited, some at Fox privately fear, and it will
reflect on everyone who works there in a negative way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be reeled in,'' said Lyons. ``I'm not going to pull
off everything I say. I know some people in the control room are
probably rolling their eyes saying, `What is he doing?' But even as
a player, I was that way. I relied on sarcasm. And maybe sometimes
there's a little too much political correctness going around.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who refers to Lyons and himself as ``the jock and the
journalist,'' admits the pairing is a bit strange but says his
partner has helped bring out more of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder how he pulled me `out there' or how I
allowed myself to get into these conversations with him,'' said
Myers. ``But he brings a lot of the fun back in sports and reminds
me why I got into this in the first place. Steve reminds of Phil
Sims when he first started out working with me at ESPN _ he was
eager to learn and he did his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   And the workload will only increase. Soon, Lyons will host a
weekly half-hour ``Hardcore Baseball'' show for Fox Sports Net. And
on Saturdays during the summer (starting June 5), he'll host the
teen-oriented ``In The Zone'' show, then join Olbermann in the
pregame show for the national Fox Game of the Week broadcast. It
means Lyons won't be doing any more game analyses for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the risk of sounding conceited, I'm pretty proud of what
I'm doing now,'' said Lyons. ``I have an opportunity that I
wouldn't get probably anywhere else. I thought I'd be a studio or
game analyst. But I feel this is a time in my life when I want to
settle down and get serious. I take the job serious. But it is
sports.'' &QL;

ORACLE SHARES TUMBLE 9 PERCENT OVER WARNING ON EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped 9 percent
Thursday after several analysts suggested that the company might
not meet earnings estimates for its fourth quarter, which ends May
31, because of a slowdown in sales of software that manages
corporate information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, which was the most active stock Thursday, with 57.3
million shares changing hands, fell $2.3125, to $23 a share, in
NASDAQ trading. Oracle shares are down 20 percent this year even as
other technology companies reach new highs. Much of the drop came
March 12 after Oracle reported third-quarter earnings that
essentially matched analysts' expectations, but database and
application revenue fell short. Oracle said at the time that
several large sales had slid into the fourth quarter, traditionally
its strongest, so any weakness in this quarter did not bode well
for the future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, who met with Oracle executives Thursday at the
company's headquarters in Redwood Shores, Calif., predicted weaker
revenue and profit. If sales and earnings do fall short this
quarter, one likely cause will be the general weakness in the
so-called enterprise resource-planning software market. Companies
are delaying purchases of these software packages, which manage
critical tasks like human resources and manufacturing, because of
the Year 2000 problem. Companies that sell such software, including
Peoplesoft Inc., Baan Co. and SAP AG, have all experienced a
slowdown in sales.
</P>
<P>
   William Epifanio II, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said that
Oracle was directly affected because about one-fourth of its sales
come from enterprise resource software and indirectly because about
one-third of the rest of its sales is database software used with
other companies' enterprise resource applications. ``Given that
that market is in such bad shape, with no sign of improvement until
the middle of 2000, I am concerned as to where they will find these
revenues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Oracle's sales pattern, it's heavily weighted
to this quarter,'' he added, noting that customers hold off
purchases to get end-of-the-year discounts. ``Weakness now portends
at least another quarter or more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that Oracle's traditional database business
is getting squeezed by IBM's DB2 product at the high end and by
Microsoft Corp.'s SQL Server at the low end. Oracle looked first to
the enterprise resource applications to stimulate new growth, but
that market is stalled, and the company is now promoting a new
suite of customer-relationship management programs to compete with
companies like Siebel Systems Inc.

WOODS' 61 LEADS GARCIA BY ONLY ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was a record-tying day for Tiger Woods, and
an attention-getting day for 19-year-old Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Woods opened the GTE Byron Nelson Classic on Thursday with a
nine-under- par 61, his first 61 as a professional, which tied the
Cottonwood Valley Course record set by Ernie Els in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But while Woods left Thursday's first-round with a one-stroke
lead, it was Garcia who left people wondering if they had just
witnessed a coming-out party for the game's next young star.
Shooting a 62 in his first PGA Tour professional round, and showing
why the comparisons between Woods and Garcia are bound to continue,
Garcia was tied for second place with Paul Goydos and Steve Lowery
as Woods and Garcia positioned themselves for perhaps their first
head-to-head weekend tournament battle.
</P>
<P>
   Woods set a blistering pace on a birdie-filled day, shooting a
29 on the front nine, and returning from his three-week hiatus
looking fresh, confident and determined. It was his best round
since his 10-under-par 62 in February en route to winning the Buick
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove in a lot of fairways and the greens were very soft, so
I attacked,'' said Woods, who shot a 29 on the front nine. ``It's
always fun when you can get it going like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia, who teed off almost three hours after Woods, was
hardly intimidated. Garcia made his pro debut in Spain, after
winning low amateur at last month's Masters, and after dominating
the amateur ranks in Europe much the way Woods dominated in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of 70 amateur tournaments, including last year's British
Amateur championship, Garcia is a long-hitting, aggressive player,
with an intuitive short-game touch, an maturity beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   Tutored by both Seve Ballesteros and the reigning Masters
champion, Jose Maria Olazabal, Garcia hopes to follow in their
footsteps to become Spain's next great player. And as Thursday
indicated, Garcia has special gifts.
</P>
<P>
   He made a 30-foot putt for birdie at No. 14, holed a bunker shot
for birdie at No. 15, and he reached No. 18 tied with Woods at nine
under par, before making a bogey on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good putter, he's very aggressive, and he's got every
part of the game,'' said Jerry Higginbotham, Garcia's caddie this
week and Mark O'Meara's caddie for five years. ``He's not your
average 19 year-old kid. Once every 10 years, somebody comes along
like this. He's the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia plans to play at least four more tour events this year _
The Memorial, the FedEx St. Jude Classic, the Sprint International
and the Westin Open. Asked what his goals were coming into this
week, Garcia said, ``To make the cut and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I have a chance to win, I'll go for it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how Garcia will fare over 72 holes,
because he was just one of many players who turned Thursday's round
into a birdie barrage. Goydos, playing with Woods for the first
time, shot a 28 on the front nine, one better than Woods. Goydos
was so hot that Woods never teed off first on the front nine. Nick
Price, the third player in the Woods-Goydos threesome, shot a 63.
How often is a 63 the worst score in a threesome?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited about playing with
Tiger and Nick Price,'' said Goydos, whose only tour victory came
at the 1996 Bay Hill Invitational. ``I might have been a little
more focused. You don't want to embarrass yourself. I'm used to
playing in front of my wife and the other player's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery's 62 may have been the most impressive, because it was
the lowest score at the TPC of Las Colinas, the tougher of the two
courses on which the tournament is played. It has been an eventful
year for Lowery, whose home burned to the ground in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to play better,'' said Lowery, who is thankful
that his wife and three children escaped injury in the fire. ``It's
to the point now where the insurance is handling it. They have to
hire a builder and reconstruct the house. I've been able to focus
back on golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was focused Thursday, in a round that included nine
birdies and no bogeys. When Woods putts as well as he did Thursday,
he is usually in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made four consecutive birdies, starting at No. 5, and his
most spectacular birdie came at No. 12, where he made a 30-foot
putt. But while Woods set the pace, he was joined on the
leaderboard by another talented young player, four years his
junior.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Garcia have become friends, they have practiced
together numerous times, and nobody has to tell Woods how good
Garcia is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him advice if he asks me,'' said Woods, when asked
about Garcia on Wednesday. ``But he'll find his own way of doing
things to be successful. And believe me, he's going to be
successful.'' &QL;

NUCLEAR INDUSTRY'S ADS CALLED POTENTIALLY DECEPTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Better Business Bureau said Thursday that ads
run by the nuclear power industry about the air pollution benefits
of reactors ``have a strong potential to mislead customers'' and
that it would ask the Federal Trade Commission and possibly state
attorneys general to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's assertions, about gases thought to cause global
warming, are ``overly broad claims that tell, at best, only a
half-truth, and therefore have the capacity to deceive,'' the
bureau said Thursday morning. Its decision came in an unusual
second round in a case in which the bureau had investigated the
claims and tried to resolve them as part of a self-regulatory
scheme within the advertising industry. Thursday it said it was
referring the matter to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization that placed the ads, a trade association
called the Nuclear Energy Institute, contended that the ads were
factual and that it had never agreed to abide by the bureau's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau had found in December, in a case brought by
environmental groups, that the industry had falsely claimed that
reactors make power without emitting so-called greenhouse gases.
The environmental groups said _ and the bureau eventually agreed _
that the uranium fuel for reactors was made using electricity from
coal plants, which emit large amounts of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists said that nuclear utilities were trying to
deceive consumers, who can choose their power suppliers in states
that have deregulated utilities. Companies that make electricity
from sun, wind and other ``green'' sources are marketing their
electricity by appealing to consumers especially concerned about
the environment, but environmental groups say reactor operators
should not be able to make strong environmental claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nuclear Energy Institute continued running the ads, in
The New Republic, the Atlantic Monthly, two papers published on
Capitol Hill, Roll Call and the Hill, and The New York Times. The
ads say, ``Chances are you know nuclear power generates about 20
percent of America's electricity without emitting greenhouse
gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Howard, senior vice president of the industry group,
said the ads were not geared toward consumers who had to pick an
energy supplier; the group was ``advertising to a policy community
on a policy issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising business established a voluntary resolution
process for questionable advertising claims 25 years ago, through
the Better Business Bureau, to head off the threat of government
regulation. The bureau said the nuclear case was unusual because of
100 or so cases decided each year, only three or four advertisers
did not abide by the rulings.
</P>
<P>
   At the FTC, C. Lee Peeler, the associate director for
advertising practices, said the Better Business Bureau referral
would ``go to the top of the pile that's here,'' so his agency
could determine promptly whether the charge met its criteria for
follow up. The FTC strongly supports the Better Business Bureau's
voluntary program, he said, and in cases where an advertiser has
ignored a ruling, if the FTC finds the ads deceptive or unfair, it
can order a broader remedy.

SHEIK ABDELAZIZ BIN BAZ, TOP SAUDI CLERIC AND ROYAL ALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Sheik Abdelaziz bin Baz, the pillar of Saudi
Arabia's religious establishment and a crucial ally to the royal
family, died Thursday in Taif. He was believed to be in his late
80s.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, Saudi religious officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Blind since his teens, and frail in his declining years, bin Baz
remained a figure of extraordinary influence. In a country ruled by
kings but also by Islamic teachings, he was the senior cleric,
which meant that his rulings often had the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he issued thousands of fatwas, or religious
decrees, to insure that the kingdom hewed to the traditional Wahabi
interpretation of Islam, which gives Saudi Arabia its deeply
conservative cast.
</P>
<P>
   He was regarded with reverence by millions of Saudis, to whom
faith in Islam comes more naturally than fealty to monarchy. But as
grand mufti and head of the Council of Senior Islamic Clerics, or
ulema, he owed his post to the royal Saud family, and his rulings
rarely contradicted their favored course.
</P>
<P>
   Among his edicts, the best known may have been one issued in
1990, which upheld a prohibition on women driving cars.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to the history of Saudi Arabia were two other
edicts that bin Baz issued around the same time. The first, in
August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, approved the
stationing of large numbers of non-Muslim soldiers, many of them
Americans, in Saudi Arabia. The second, in January 1991, approved
of the Persian Gulf war, waged by an international coalition
against Iraq, an Islamic country, as a jihad, or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, bin Baz and other members of the ulema overruled
more radical clerics in passionate disputes over whether the step
was religiously permissible. The radicals challenged the idea that
non-Muslims, as ``infidels,'' should be permitted in Saudi Arabia,
home to Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest sites, and that
non-Muslims should be allowed to attack a Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the rulings brought to a halt rumblings in Saudi
mosques and streets that might have undermined the war effort. But
they also made bin Baz a target of criticism from the radicals,
including the dissident Osama bin Laden, and stoked anger in some
circles against the royal family and its decision to accept
non-Muslim forces.
</P>
<P>
   As such criticism grew, in 1991 bin Baz condemned those who
``whisper secretly in their meetings and record their poison over
cassettes distributed to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger exploded in two bombings, in 1995 and 1996, that
killed a total of 24 Americans, but bin Baz remained a fierce
critic of the radicals, issuing rulings that called the attacks a
sin against Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, bin Baz was known and sometimes mocked
around the Muslim world for rulings that leaned toward the
traditional. He ruled that consulting fortune tellers and
practicing witchcraft were forbidden by religious law. And he
persuaded the Saudi government two years ago to forbid the import
and production of veils that failed to cover faces completely.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Baz was blinded by disease as an adolescent, but little else
is known about his early life. Estimates of his birth year vary
from 1909 to 1912.
</P>
<P>
   He was Saudi Arabia's leading cleric for 25 years, and since
1993 held the additional rank of minister after King Fahd appointed
him grand mufti of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   He is to be buried Friday in Mecca, said Saudi officials.

LEON THOMAS, JAZZ SINGER KNOWN FOR `YODEL,' DIES AT 61  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Tenn., Mo.)   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Thomas, a jazz singer known for his bellowing
glottal-stop style in free jazz of the 1970s, died on Saturday at
Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. He was 61 and lived in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure as a result of leukemia, Karen
Dagneau, his tour manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who was born in East St. Louis, Ill., and studied music
at Tennessee State University, moved to New York in 1958. With his
stout tenor voice, he worked as a straight blues-jazz singer,
performing with Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams in the mid-'60s.
But by then he had also begun to spend time with young jazz
musicians, like Randy Weston and Pharoah Sanders, who were looking
to Africa, the East and meditation for musical material.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage with Sanders in the late 60s Thomas developed his
ululating singing style, which has been compared to African pygmy
and American Indian singing techniques, and which he later called
``soularphone.'' He believed that his ancestors had given him his
elastic throat articulation, he said, and henceforth always used
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This voice is not me,'' he explained in a 1995 interview. ``My
voice is ancient. This person you see before you is controlled by
ego, but my voice is egoless.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-known Pharoah Sanders tracks on which Thomas performed
were ``The Creator Has a Master Plan'' from 1969 and
``Hum-Allah-Hum-Allah-Hum Allah'' from 1970, both full of Thomas'
wordless yodeling over band vamps. In recent years Thomas' profile
rose a bit as this kind of spiritual African-tinged soul-jazz has
become known by record connoisseurs and club D.J.'s as
``kosmigroov.''
</P>
<P>
   After working with Sanders and making some of his own albums for
the Flying Dutchman label, Thomas spent two years as a member of
Santana, performing on the albums ``Welcome'' and ``Lotus.'' He
also appeared on recordings by Johnny Hodges, Oliver Nelson, Hank
Crawford and Jamaaladeen Tacuma. In the last few years Thomas often
sang at the Lenox Lounge in Harlem, backed by the Donald Smith
trio. He had just come home from performing at the Up Over Cafe in
Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he died.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Amos, of the Bronx, and a brother,
Curtis of St. Louis, Mo..

gone ``very well.'' As for MovieFone, the nation's largest
movie-ticket service, it announced Thursday that it had received
more than 4 million inquiries in the first 24 hours of sales with
95 percent of those for ``Phantom Menace'' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the sales went very well although we know that not
everyone was going to be able to get through,'' said spokeswoman
Christine Facundiny. ``It may have taken some people a couple of
hours to get through, but I think they expected it to be busy.
There's been a gradual tapering off, but it's still very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox plans to book ``Phantom Menace'' into about 2,950 theaters,
which will mean showings in about 5,000 auditoriums. That's well
short of the record 3,306 theaters used a year ago for the launch
of ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers expect ``Phantom Menace'' is likely to top the
domestic records held by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' for
biggest opening, including $26.1 million gross in the first day and
$104.9 million gross for the first week. With early reviews mixed,
it could have a hard time matching the final $601million in gross
ticket receipts sold domestically set by ``Titanic.''

SCALPERS OFFER `STAR WARS' OPENING DAY TICKETS ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let the scalping begin.
</P>
<P>
   In what some might say is the dark side of next week's opening
of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' thousands of
people who bought tickets to next Wednesday's debut turned around
and offered some of those tickets for sale Thursday via newspaper
advertisements, ticket brokers or online at places like eBay.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear indication of the unprecedented anticipation over
George Lucas' prequel, there were 124 different ``Star Wars''
ticket packages on sale at eBay, the leading Internet auction site,
less than 24 hours after ticket sales began. More tickets are
available through newspaper ads and at ticket brokers that usually
deal only with sporting events and music concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be selling tickets for prime shows at places like Mann
Chinese in Hollywood at prices from $25 to $65,'' said Richard
Shelter with Applause Tickets of Los Angeles. ``The 12:01 a.m.
showing is the most desired.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Evans of Yorba Linda is asking $525 for four opening-night
tickets at the Edwards Anaheim in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who bought 44 tickets for opening-day showings at four
different theaters, plans to sell them all through eBay and
believes he might clean up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invested $308, so I'm thinking I could clear a lot on
this,'' said Evans, a 20-year-old who lost his job last month as an
event coordinator. ``I'm anticipating selling them all because
these kinds of tickets are going to be pretty scarce by next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a veteran of selling jewelry and computer equipment on
eBay, won't go to ``Phantom Menace'' for several weeks. ``I'm not a
fan at all and that was making some of the people in the lines
pretty upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ticket scalping is a fact of life for concerts, plays
and sporting events, it is virtually unheard of for movies. As a
result, many sellers said Thursday that it is hard to predict
exactly where prices will head for ``Phantom Menace'' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers agreed, however, that location and timing are the
critical factors to pricing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting to get about $35 or $40 for a pair of
opening-night tickets at the Winnetka 20 because there's no way
people will pay more than that for a showing in the San Fernando
Valley,'' said real estate agent Asher Sarkis, who is selling two
dozen tickets online. ``I could see tickets for the Chinese going
for $50 or $100 each for the 12:01 a.m. show. It's like going to a
concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mills, a broker with the Good Times agency, said the agency
had no tickets available for the first showing at the Chinese. He
added that he probably would pay $30 per ticket _ nearly four times
the $8.50 face value _ if they were offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that most of the people who stood in line
want to go, but I would imagine there will be some available in the
next few days,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's likely to be a premium for tickets even if they
aren't at flagship theaters. Gina, a mortgage company employee who
elected not to give her last name, already had received a $30 bid
for two tickets for the first show at the Edwards Grand Palace in
Calabasas she had received from a co-worker. And she's hopeful the
excitement over the film will spark a bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get a good bid, I'll stand outside and sell them,''
she said. ``I know that sometimes these online auctions roll out of
control because for some people it gets to be a matter of pride to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas and 20th Century Fox warned of the scalping scenario a
month ago when they sought to convince theater owners that advance
sales should be banned. When they relented a few weeks later, they
imposed a 12-ticket-per-customer limit in order to limit scalping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we're not surprised by the
scalping,'' said Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox's
domestic film group. ``We weren't born yesterday. We are
disappointed but that's how people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak advised those seeking tickets for first-day shows to
avoid scalpers. ``There's still plenty of theaters with tickets for
the shows, although maybe not at the Chinese and the Mann Village
(in Westwood),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans began forming lines at those two theaters more than a month
ago. Since the seats at each show are taken on a first-come,
first-served basis, many of the hard core were in new lines
Thursday to be the first to get into the theaters next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they've been there for a month, what's another week,''
said Mann executive Sandy Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hazen, who works as an assistant to a literary agent, stood
in line for 18 hours to get a dozen seats for the first show at the
Glendale Exchange. The 24-year-old plans to attend with nine
friends and sell two over eBay.

NEW GAME TITLES UNVEILED AT ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT EXPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With offerings from cyber-bowlers to stealth
fighters, digirati made a strong showing at the Electronic
Entertainment Expo's return to Los Angeles, with game makers THQ
Inc. and NovaLogic unveiling nine new titles between them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Thursday opening of E3, the multimedia industry's largest
annual gathering, attention firmly focused on the launch of several
``Star Wars''-related video games. And THQ, for one, has a hand in
the ``Phantom Menace'' juggernaut. It is the primary games
distributor in Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Lucasarts, the
game company owned by ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   But like rival NovaLogic, THQ emphasized its proprietary titles
in a preview Wednesday. And in a move that could help its Wall
Street standing, the company took special care to promote its
nonwrestling products. Despite strong earnings growth, THQ stock
has performed sluggishly in recent quarters with investors
apparently still concerned over the loss of the license to market
games under the WCW title beginning this summer to industry
behemoth Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street doesn't understand we're not just about
wrestling,'' THQ Chief Executive Brian Farrel said, adding that it
has successful titles in the children's segment, sports and
adventure games. ``I don't think the market understands that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For its first-round of E3 launches,THQ unveiled Felony Pursuit,
an urban driving police chase; Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling, a new
title for the Nintendo 64; Toy Story 2, a collaboration with Walt
Disney Co. based on the coming movie; and Championship Motocross, a
motorcycle simulator endorsed by two-time national champion Ricky
Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stewart Halpern at ING Baring Furman Selz said THQ's E3
performance is winning the company accolades and should translate
into a higher price for the stock. ``It looks like they're going to
be a big winner at this show,'' Halpern said. ``They've come out
with great momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   THQ shares rose to $27.5625 Wednesday, up $1.6875.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, privately held NovaLogic, also of Calabasas,
presented five new titles _ four of them sequels _ including a
World War II flying game, a tank battle game based on the M-1A2
Abrams main battle tank, a helicopter flight simulator and a flight
simulator based on the F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Novalogic's one entirely new title, JSF, is a combat flight
simulator based on Lockheed Martin's stealthy joint strike fighter
design.

SILVERBULLETDAY IS WITHDRAWN FROM THE PREAKNESS FOR THE `SUSAN'
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ ``I have to take care of her,'' Bob Baffert said
Thursday morning, and so he withdrew his prize filly,
Silverbulletday, from the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer from California, dejected because he had drawn the
No. 14 post position on the far outside for Silverbulletday,
followed through on his earlier warning and said that he would
scratch her from the Preakness on Saturday and run her instead in
the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for fillies on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And the flight from the Preakness seemed to be widening when
Carl Nafzger insisted that he would not start his colt Vicar from
the No. 13 post.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the good ones, you've got to be careful,'' Baffert said.
``This was a hard decision. We even discussed it with the groom and
with the jockey's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had won the Kentucky Derby, we might take a shot from
Post 14. If this had happened to my other filly, Excellent Meeting,
we wouldn't have run her, either. In this game, you expect the
worst and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday has given one smashing performance after another
as she raced to the top of the filly class in racing. She won 10 of
her 11 starts, extended her winning streak to seven and raised her
career earnings past $2 million when she won the Kentucky Oaks two
weeks ago on the day before the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But when Baffert drew the No. 14 post position for the
Preakness, he lost interest in running her against colts, even
though she was second choice for the Preakness, behind Menifee, in
the morning-line odds.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer said he and Mike Pegram, the filly's owner, had
reached their decision after a long evening of mulling the
short-term opportunity against the long-range danger to the filly's
career. Pegram said that he was deeply disappointed that they were
going to scratch Silverbulletday but that he agreed with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' Pegram said, outside the stakes barn at Pimlico
Race Course, ``but it was the right thing to do. We had to look at
the book to see how far the Black-Eyed Susan was. She was entered
in it, but I never thought of anything but the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black-Eyed Susan will be run at a 1 1/8 miles; the
Preakness, at 1 3/16 miles. But the race for fillies carries a
purse of only $200,000; the Preakness, $1 million. Silverbulletday
already drew the No. 1 post position on the inside for the
Black-Eyed Susan, and she will be the overwhelming favorite in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Another horse with a shining record, Vicar, seemed ready to
follow Silverbulletday out of the Preakness because he drew No. 13
after drawing No. 17 for the Kentucky Derby and finishing 18th. The
colt came out of Florida last winter with consecutive victories in
the Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Florida Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just not run from No. 13,'' Nafzger said. ``I learned
a long time ago never to try to predict the unpredictable. If we
scratch, it won't be until Saturday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about the custom of scratching by noon Friday in
order to make the advance betting on the Preakness more realistic,
and he replied: ``I can scratch whenever I want to. I can scratch
45 minutes before post time, or I can scratch with a veterinarian
20 minutes before post time.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the defections, a revised list of early odds was
presented by Clem Florio, the linemaker for Pimlico, although
Menifee stood as the 5-2 favorite. With Silverbulletday taken off
the list as the 7-2 second choice, Florio moved up Excellent
Meeting to that role at 9-2. The Kentucky Derby winner,
Charismatic, now was third choice at 5-1 with Kimberlite Pipe next
at 6-1 and Stephen Got Even at 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   The defections proved a boon to Nick Zito, who lost his jockey
on Stephen Got Even when Chris McCarron fell from a horse during a
workout at Hollywood Park on Tuesday and broke a bone in his foot.
Because Silverbulletday was being withdrawn, Gary Stevens was now
excused as her jockey in the Preakness. And Zito promptly signed
him to ride Stephen Got Even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had luck with Gary in the past,'' Zito said. ``He rode
Halory Hunter for us to win the Blue Grass last year. We've got
Adonis in the No. 9 post and Stephen in No. 11, and they're not
ideal, but I can't do anything about that now.''

GOVERNMENT LAWSUIT ACCUSES AMERICAN AIRLINES OF PREDATORY PRICING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The U.S. Justice Department sued American
Airlines for alleged antitrust violations Thursday, accusing the
carrier of using illegal pricing tactics to drive out Vanguard
Airlines and other small competitors from its Dallas hub.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, a low-cost carrier based in Mission, Kan., is one of
three airlines cited in the Justice Department's lawsuit as a
victim of American's alleged monopolistic practices. The Justice
Department said Sun Jet and Western Pacific also faced predatory
pricing moves by American, the nation's second-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit culminates more than two years of investigation by
the federal government into complaints of predatory pricing
practices by American and other major carriers. It is the first
predatory pricing case brought in the industry since airline
deregulation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts said many airlines use questionable
pricing tactics to attract business. However, one analyst said the
government's case against American was weak.
</P>
<P>
   The department's civil lawsuit, filed in federal court in
Wichita, said a megacarrier such as American must be prohibited
from future predatory pricing practices when facing competition
from smaller, discount airlines at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, the nation's third-largest airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without competition, hub carriers will charge high fares on
routes they dominate,'' said Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
``Hub carriers cannot be permitted to use predatory tactics to keep
new entrants out of their markets.''
</P>
<P>
   American issued a statement vowing to fight the lawsuit, saying
the Justice Department's action goes ``against the very essence of
free market competition.''
</P>
<P>
   American said it was confident its actions in Dallas//Fort Worth
``will prove to be nothing more than those of any tough competitor
in a highly competitive industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, which has struggled financially since its inception in
December 1994, said its position had been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the actions that American Airlines took to
eliminate Vanguard Airlines from the Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace
were unlawful and violated antitrust laws,'' said Robert J. Spane,
Vanguard's president and chief executive officer. ``This is a move
that will help preserve open competition throughout the industry
and help consumers and new entrant airlines alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lawsuit focuses on Vanguard's attempts to move into
the Dallas market and the subsequent response by American. In
January 1995, when Vanguard was starting up, the carrier began
operating three daily, nonstop round-trip flights between Kansas
City and Dallas at discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   American immediately matched Vanguard's fares and then added
several more Kansas City-Dallas flights later that year. By the end
of the year, Vanguard withdrew its Kansas City-Dallas nonstop
service, and American raised its fares in early 1996, according to
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, American, in documents, vowed that its
additional Kansas City-Dallas flights were intended ``to drive
(Vanguard) out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard again tried to enter the Dallas market in September
1996, with new nonstop service from Dallas to Kansas City, Phoenix
and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, according to the lawsuit, American announced
plans to expand service from Dallas to Kansas City, Cincinnati,
Phoenix and Wichita. American also matched Vanguard's fares on
selected flights.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, Vanguard withdrew its Cincinnati and Phoenix
service from Dallas and reduced its Kansas City-Dallas schedule.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Thursday that the actions it took in the
face of competition from Vanguard and other discount carriers did
not violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply matched their fares,'' said American spokesman Chris
Chiames. ``At no point did we undercut fares. Vanguard set the
fares, and we matched them.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that with the lawsuit, the federal
government essentially is telling American it cannot compete with
new-entrant carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the lawsuit is potentially anti-consumer and would
have a chilling effect not just on airlines but on other businesses
as well,'' Chiames said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gillman, Vanguard's general counsel, disagreed. Vanguard
has been cooperating with the Justice Department since 1997 on the
inquiry. The airline supplied additional pricing information to the
government last month, which had fueled speculation that the
Justice Department was close to taking action.
</P>
<P>
   One aviation industry analyst said he was surprised by the
Justice Department's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard was a new and financially troubled carrier with
operational problems during the period the Justice Department
focuses on, said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, a
consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the federal government) wanted American to do is not
match their competitors' fares,'' Boyd said. ``Is there predatory
pricing out there? Yes. But is American guilty in this case? I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst said that although American and other major
airlines use questionable pricing tactics, customers need to fly on
high-quality discount carriers that are competing head-to-head with
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit may get the major carriers to step back and say,
`They're watching us,' '' said Terry Trippler, a consumer affairs
expert with 1travel.com, a discount travel Web site. ``But a lot of
the blame for this behavior lies with the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vanguard comes to town and offers a low fare that
American matches, people choose to fly American. People want
Vanguard prices, but they want to fly American. Consumers have to
make wise decisions and support the discount carrier to maintain
that low fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard has begun posting operating profits in the past year.
The company has about 780 full- and part-time employees in the
Kansas City area. Vanguard and American now offer nonstop flights
to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time American has faced antitrust
allegations. In 1983, the Justice Department charged Robert L.
Crandall, American's ex-president, with conspiring with Braniff's
top executive to raise fares. American eventually agreed in a court
order not to engage in such activity in the future.

THE MARKETS ARE IGNORING CONVENTIONAL WISDOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An incredible happening occurred this week. Just about the same
time the government reported a substantial first-quarter gain in
productivity, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to its
highest level in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to defy conventional economic wisdom, because rising
productivity restrains wage inflation and thus implies continued
price stability. Labor costs represent the biggest chunk of
overhead for most businesses and thus have the most effect on
pricing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the bellwether bond's interest rate spike all the
more remarkable was a companion report showing only a small gain
for unit labor costs in the January-March period.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity for nonfarm businesses rose at a 4 percent annual
rate. The year-over-year gain of 2.8 percent is the best in three
years. Unit labor costs inched up only 0.3 percent from last year's
fourth quarter, which brought the year-over-year gain to a
relatively piddling 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in long-term interest rates over the last few weeks is
not only a puzzle, but also a big disappointment for investors
expecting good inflation news to translate into rising values for
their bond holdings. Instead they've been losing money because bond
prices and yields move in opposite directions, which means bond
prices decline as interest rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   Smart money would bet that economic conditions normally
promising price stability would be a boon rather than a bane for
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Although the April reading of the Consumer Price Index due out
this morning is expected to show a higher-than-usual rise, the
retail inflation gauge through March was up only 1.7 percent during
the previous 12 months. While Thursday's Producer Price Index
report showed wholesale prices up 0.5 percent, the core rate that
excludes the volatile food and energy components was up only 0.1
percent. The same core-rate showing is expected of the CPI if its
overall increase is comparable to the PPI's gain.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of alarming inflation developments makes recent
interest rate jumps curious, because interest rates are normally
driven by inflationary expectations. They also are also driven by
anticipation of Federal Reserve policy, of course, which is also
guided by its policy-makers' inflationary expectations. The Fed's
Open Market Committee, which decides monetary policy, will hold one
of its regular meetings next week to review the situation, but Wall
Street isn't expecting the committee to boost rates.
</P>
<P>
   So, if inflation isn't a discernible near-term threat and the
Fed is expected to hew to the status quo for the time being, what
is spooking the bond market into bidding up yields?
</P>
<P>
   A consensus is beginning to emerge among analysts that even if
the Fed doesn't tighten monetary policy with a rate increase next
week, a boost is inevitable later this year if the economy
continues its strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   Another contrarian wild card, meantime, is the stock market's
ability to continue defying gravity. Conventional wisdom again
would dictate a weakening stock market in the face of rising
interest rates, but it hasn't happened. This is as incredible as
interest rates soaring in the absence of any immediate inflationary
threat.

IN LARRY BROWN ITEM AT BOTTOM 
PSYCHO BABBLE
</HEADLINE>
 CORRECTS INDIANA TO PHILADELPHIA(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On a recent Fox Sports News Primetime broadcast, the video
highlight from a New York Yankees game showed Chuck Knoblauch
taking a lead off second base when teammate Tino Martinez hit a
liner up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Steve Lyons looked down at the monitor on the desk and
picked up the live narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes Knoblauch. . . OFF LIKE A PROM DRESS. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Did he just say. . .?
</P>
<P>
   When you live and die by the ``Psycho,'' that's what you've come
to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps testing the boundaries of the Fox attitude to a
psychotic extreme, Lyons continues a career in sportscasting with
much the same, er, gusto, that he exhibited during a nine-year ride
as a do-everything major-leaguer, when his most notable
contribution to the game was as the Chicago White Sox player who
sheepishly yanked up his pants after pulling them down in front of
the Tiger Stadium crowd to shake out dirt after a head-first slide
into first base nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A tour around the cable box reveals Lyons is the only ex-jock
given the responsibility of delivering news on a national studio
show five nights a week. But, please, he doesn't want to be called
a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an idiot ex-baseball player,'' the 38-year-old says.
</P>
<P>
   And many would agree.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fox Sports News rotation, Lyons isn't a bench player any
more. He's teamed in an ``Odd Couple''-like sequel with Chris Myers
on the 10 p.m. and midnight East Coast feeds and the 11 p.m. shows
that go to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same when Lyons was a player and he'd look at
the lineup card posted on the dugout wall to see his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, aren't we TRYING?'' the career .253 hitter would announce
to his teammates _ he hoped before they could say it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing was probably muttered around the Fox Broadcasting
Center in Century City when Fox Sports News executive producer John
Terenzio decided a few months ago that Lyons, who came to Fox after
trying sports-talk radio in Boston and Chicago and spot reporting
at ESPN2 in his post-playing career, would be a permanent anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone probably thought I was nuts, too,'' Terenzio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons jumped aboard Fox's expanding sports staff as a baseball
game analyst several years ago. Terenzio said he noticed Lyons'
broadcasting flair about a year ago when he was doing studio work
for the news show. During a Fox Scope segment, Lyons described a
player going from first to third ``faster than a 16-year-old on a
third date with the same girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio looked up. Did he just say. . .?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little crude,'' Terenzio agreed. ``But it showed
imagination. He was doing highlights better than some of our
highlight people.''
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio asked Lyons if he'd be interested in trying out as an
anchor. Lyons thought Terenzio was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   After a few auditions, which were ``terrible,'' Terenzio said,
Lyons was ready to give up on it. But a month later, Lyons flew in
three weekends in a row from his home in Phoenix to give it another
try. Terenzio said Lyons kept getting better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Steve has always been a natural broadcaster,'' said
Terenzio. ``He talks so effortlessly to the viewer, as he was in
their living room. All we needed to do was train him with the
logistics of a sports anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Fox added Keith Olbermann and Myers to the news
corral, new anchor teams had to be drawn. Terenzio felt Lyons was
ready. So did Lyons. But with what partner? If opposites attract,
Lyons seemed to be a better fit with Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons recognizes his shortcomings. He gets help writing his
nightly scripts, and he types about as well as Myers might handle a
curveball. But Lyons' sports knowledge, competitive nature and
personality are the strengths he's banking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I try to dumb down the scripts I'm given _ if
it's a three- syllable word, I'm in trouble,'' said Lyons. ``I'm
thinking, `If I can't understand it, why make the guy sitting at
home feel stupid?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Lyons' promotion could start a ripple effect in the
``jockocracy'' of sportscasting. If he's considered a success, more
former players who aren't trained in journalism but who producers
feel are engaging enough to pull it off could be lining up for
these spots, rather than gaining experience by doing three-minute
sports segments on local newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a blueprint for the new kind of anchor everyone will
be looking for,'' said Terenzio, who has also tried ex-NFL players
Bill Maas and Ron Pitts as Fox Sports News anchors, with varying
degrees of success. ``It's a case-by-case basis. Some can't pull it
off five nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be three elements for success on a sportscast:
content, logical presentation and the strength of the personalities
who front the show. If there's zero personality, the shows are
simply no good. Clearly, Steve has the natural personality _ a
child-like wonderment _ and the experience of a professional
athlete. We can teach him the other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Except when it comes to ad-libbing, which Lyons admits can work
for and against him. Viewers might tune in to see what the loose
cannon says tonight, but crossing a line of taste is something that
could bring him down some day.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the time when Lyons said Oakland pitcher Kenny Rodgers
was hit by a line drive and ``went down like a sniper got him''
right around the time of the Columbine High School shootings.
Things Lyons says can come off as sophomoric, homophobic or just
plain mean-spirited, some at Fox privately fear, and it will
reflect on everyone who works there in a negative way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be reeled in,'' said Lyons. ``I'm not going to pull
off everything I say. I know some people in the control room are
probably rolling their eyes saying, `What is he doing?' But even as
a player, I was that way. I relied on sarcasm. And maybe sometimes
there's a little too much political correctness going around.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who refers to Lyons and himself as ``the jock and the
journalist,'' admits the pairing is a bit strange but says his
partner has helped bring out more of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder how he pulled me `out there' or how I
allowed myself to get into these conversations with him,'' said
Myers. ``But he brings a lot of the fun back in sports and reminds
me why I got into this in the first place. Steve reminds of Phil
Sims when he first started out working with me at ESPN _ he was
eager to learn and he did his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   And the workload will only increase. Soon, Lyons will host a
weekly half-hour ``Hardcore Baseball'' show for Fox Sports Net. And
on Saturdays during the summer (starting June 5), he'll host the
teen-oriented ``In The Zone'' show, then join Olbermann in the
pregame show for the national Fox Game of the Week broadcast. It
means Lyons won't be doing any more game analyses for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the risk of sounding conceited, I'm pretty proud of what
I'm doing now,'' said Lyons. ``I have an opportunity that I
wouldn't get probably anywhere else. I thought I'd be a studio or
game analyst. But I feel this is a time in my life when I want to
settle down and get serious. I take the job serious. But it is
sports.'' &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Check out the new movie ``Trippin' '' if only to see
thespian/sportscaster Scott St. James play the president of the
United States. The title has nothing to do with Linda Tripp. &QL; 
__ The 12-team Cricket World Cup, which started Thursday in
England, has a TV home on the 2.2 million-strong EchoStar Dish
Network. Order now, and it's only $299.95 _ Jiminy Cricket! _ for
the whole six-week-long tourney. &QL; 
__ Fred Roggin's loss is Jim Hill's gain. Mike Cunningham, a
producer at KNBC-Channel 4 for the last 16 years, was named
executive producer of sports for KCBS-Channel 2. &QL; 
__ Philadelphia coach Larry Brown admits to Fox's Chris Myers on
Sunday's episode of ``Goin' Deep'': ``Two of the greatest
experiences I've ever had were coaching at UCLA _ I never should
have left there _ and coaching at Kansas. I think based on the way
I am, and the kind of person I am, I am a college coach.'' &QL; 
__ Monday's edition of ``Rewind'' on Fox Sports Net includes an
interview Van Earl Wright did with Boston pitcher (and former
Cleveland High star) Bret Saberhagen. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Jim Rome's nationally syndicated radio show cuts back from a
four-hour frolic to a three-hour romp starting Monday, when it'll
run 9 a.m. to noon. The domino effect: ``The BodyShaper/Regenex
Show'' on KXTA-AM 1150 gets another hour. &QL; 
__ Reaction to ABC's yielding to IMG's made-for-someone Tiger
Woods-David Duval ``Showdown at Sherwood'' event in Thousand Oaks
for Aug. 2. ABC sees its risk as minimal _ it'll at least match
whatever summer re-run they'd be airing in that prime-time 8-to-11
p.m. slot on the East. So what's the problem? Anyone ever see the
Shell-sponsored matches between Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus or
Gary Player in their day? The fact IMG represents both Woods and
Duval and is shoving this ``rivalry'' at the public is what seems
to irk media members most. Hey, it's just two guys golfing. Rent a
Dorf video if it's so upsetting. &QL; 
__ ESPN's Joe Theismann is the latest
sportscaster-turned-loan-shark for hire, hooking up with an
Internet-based financial-services company called Financial
Intranet. He'll be the commercial spokesperson in ads later this
year. Break a leg, Joe.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES: chairman of Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo announced deals with Matsushita Electric Co. and with
IBM Microelectronics to provide key parts of the new machine,
though Nintendo officials released relatively few other details.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita, whose best-known American brand is Panasonic, will
create special DVD drives with additional anti-piracy protection to
run the games created for the Dolphin, Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Nintendo has been criticized for relying on
cartridges for its games. Although the cartridges are hard to copy
illegally, at least compared with the CD-ROMs used by the
PlayStation, they also are much more expensive to make, increasing
the cost to producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita and Nintendo also will work together to create other
kinds of consumer electronics devices, such as set-top cable boxes
or DVD drives that can also play Nintendo-branded games, movies and
music, Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Nintendo signed a separate $1 billion deal to make the
new computer brain for the Dolphin, and Lincoln promised it would
exceed anything proposed by any of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Sony-Hitachi partnership, designed to create a
superfast processor for Sony's next-generation PlayStation 2, IBM
is already making chips using the specialized techniques that allow
it to cram more circuits than ever on wires as fine as one-500th
the width of a human hair, Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, nobody else in the world, does what IBM can do,''
Lincoln said. ``It will be the fastest, most powerful chip in any
home video game system now or announced, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega is making a do-or-die pitch during E3 to push its own
next-generation console, the Dreamcast. Its last run at the video
game business, the Saturn, failed miserably, and most observers
believe the company must do well with Dreamcast or it will founder
or need radical remaking. Dreamcast, already released in Japan,
will debut in the United States on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has announced most technical details of its PlayStation 2
but has what its own executives admit is an aggressive schedule to
debut the final product in 2000 _ in the spring in Japan and in the
fall in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nintendo machine will debut in late 2000, Lincoln said.

VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY BETS ON STAR WARS RACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the companies betting big on the new ``Star
Wars'' prequel is video game giant Nintendo, which used this week's
Electronic Entertainment Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center
to show off its newest game, based on what is probably the movie's
most exciting sequence, the pod races.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo can count on one very interested fan: Jake Lloyd, the
10-year-old actor who plays Anakin Skywalker in the movie ``Star
Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun _ a really fun game. It's faster than most
regular car games because it's pod racing,'' said Lloyd, an avowed
Nintendo fan, who was there when the company unveiled the game,
Star Wars Episode 1 Racer, in a press conference in downtown Los
Angeles Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's character participates in the pod races in an attempt to
win his freedom. The pod racers are basically two rocket engines
tethered by long cords to a small control pod.
</P>
<P>
   The racers careen over a series of tracks across the desert
planet of Tatooine, bumping against each other, swerving around
curves and trying to shoehorn through tight canyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the sets, as much moving as I did with the pod, I was just
sitting there,'' Lloyd said. But in the game, he said, ``I got to
really react.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd also appeared at Nintendo's mammoth booth at the Expo on
Thursday, playing others in head-to-head races for a brief time,
before resuming the whirlwind of publicity appearances leading up
to the movie's release next week.
</P>
<P>
   The game is to be released Monday, two days before the movie,
and company officials hope it will help push Nintendo's share of
the $7 billion-a-year video game business to more than 50 percent
this year, said Peter Main, the company's executive vice president
for sales and marketing. He called the game the star of the
company's lineup of titles for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company will spend $10 million marketing the game with ads,
television commercials and other promotion, Main said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six weeks, Nintendo is expecting to sell 1.5 million
copies of the game, which runs on the Nintendo 64 video game
console, Main said. The company also expects to sell 500,000
special-edition N64 consoles that will come packaged with the game.
</P>
<P>
   At its press conference, Nintendo showed about five minutes of
video clips from the game, which appears to be wildly fluid and
quite fast. It takes good advantage of the talents of the N64
machine, which has substantially faster graphics capability than
Sony's industry leader, the PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who have seen the movie, you'll agree with me
that the most exciting part is the 10-minute clip of the pod
racing,'' Main said. ``America's going to need seat belts in every
living room to play this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucasarts, the San Rafael-based game company owned by ``Star
Wars'' creator George Lucas, also showed off its other
movie-related titles at a packed theater presentation at the
Electronic Entertainment Expo, known as E3, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The array of titles will appear on most major gaming platforms
at some point this year, said Mary Bihr, director of sales and
marketing for Lucasarts. Racer will also appear for personal
computers but will work only with those using a graphics
accelerator card.
</P>
<P>
   In another good-looking game, with the same name as the movie,
players will be able to live out the adventures of the main
characters of the movie, which is mostly a third-person action
adventure, Lucasarts President Jack Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think, at its heart, `Phantom Menace' is an
adventure game,'' Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short video clip shown by Lucasarts, protagonists fight
light-saber duels, travel through space, negotiate with hundreds of
computer-based characters and work their way through a series of
backdrops that look like scenes in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen said his company worked closely with the filmmaker to
create scenes very similar to those in the movie's earlier
versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's great we were able to get close to the original
shots,'' Sorensen said. ``Maybe it's an earlier version of the film
than you'll see, but it's no less valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Electronics also was showing off its array of ``Star
Wars''-related electronic games and other products, including
Princess Amidala compact phones, royal Naboo starship answering
machines, Darth Maul binoculars with a listening device and laser
tag toys based on versions of ``Star Wars'' blasters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' hype nearly overshadowed other big news from
Nintendo _ namely the first details of its next-generation gaming
machine, which is code-named Dolphin for now, said Howard Lincoln,
chairman of Nintendo of America.

`MEXICO'S KOSOVO': THOUSANDS IN TRANSIT TO U.S. SWAMP BORDER CITY 
</HEADLINE>
 PRIETA-ALIENS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUA PRIETA, Sonora _ It was last month that Mayor Vicente Teran
really realized how much this dusty border city has become what he
calls ``Mexico's Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others in this, the border's most popular crossing point
for illegal immigrants, already had watched the number of strangers
wandering daily around downtown grow to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   They'd seen the new, low-end hotels springing up, lured by a
demand so lucrative that even three doctors turned their offices
into lodging for people heading north.
</P>
<P>
   They'd heard of the 100 immigrant-smuggling organizations
supposedly operating within a 10-minute walk of the border
checkpoint to neighboring Douglas, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But what really drove home the point, Teran said, was the
``waiting line to get in the cemetery'' during one week last month
when 27 people met a violent end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes'' _ immigrant smugglers _ were killing other coyotes
in the turf war over human bounty, he said. Border bandits were
killing helpless immigrants for their meager possessions. A
prisoner from another part of Mexico slipped his restraints and
murdered two local police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a giant mafia controlling this city,'' said Paula
Lopez Martinez, who operates a jewelry store on bustling Fourth
Avenue downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not the drug smugglers like in the past. It's the
people smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a half-dozen hotels served this city of 120,000.
Agua Prieta, located in arid, isolated northeastern Sonora, had
never been on anyone's map of likely destinations.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed when U.S. immigration officials started
clamping down on traditional immigrant-smuggling routes _ first El
Paso, then San Diego and later, Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Agua Prieta boasts 16 hotels and more than 500 rooms. At
least, that's the official version of the hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, dozens of other smaller hotels also have opened in
the city, many in abandoned storefronts. Many homeowners have
converted vacant rooms and sheds into lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Eight blocks from the border, a developer is nearing completion
of a large multilevel dormitory with cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church also is getting in on the act,
building a shelter for 50 people with beds and eating facilities
about two miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Human smuggling is against the law in Mexico, and several
`coyotes' have been arrested in Agua Prieta. Still, local
entrepreneurs say they aren't going to turn their back on such
inviting money-making opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is so great that smugglers stuff as many as 20 people
in one hotel room; some hotels rent out space on hall floors for
immigrants to sleep on.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Mayor Ray Borane, who's lobbying the U.S. government to
do something about the relentless waves of immigrants, said he has
met resistance from Agua Prieta businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying, `Hey, stay out of this. Business has never
been better and we want to keep it that way,' '' Borane said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Agua Prieta businessmen, like hardware-store owner
David de la Torre, said the problem of the ``floating refugees'' is
ruining legitimate businesses and respectable townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious problem when you have 3,000 people just hanging
around your downtown area, and buses full of more of them coming
here every day,'' de la Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has had to close her curio shop because of the
increased violence and the fact that tourists just don't come here
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Efrain Martinez, who hosts an Agua Prieta radio talk show, put
the problem this way: fewer gringos with money and more Mexicans
from the interior without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also are angry about all the crime, how you can't find a
taxi any more because they are all moving immigrants around to
cross the border,'' Martinez said, ``and how the used-car lots
don't seem to have anything but vans for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people on the streets have been caught numerous
times by U.S. Border Patrol agents and are left penniless in the
Mexican city.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, more than 20,000 Mexicans a month have been
returned to their country at Agua Prieta. The Border Patrol drew
the ire of city leaders in February when it was learned that, in
addition to those being caught in the Douglas area, immigrants
caught in the Nogales area also were pushed back south at Agua
Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   But the Border Patrol, in an attempt to disrupt smuggling
operations, then started deporting people caught in the Nogales
area in Agua Prieta and those in the Douglas area in Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   Teran, the Agua Prieta mayor, said the immigrants have taxed his
city's services to the max. Many of those who have been repeatedly
captured by the Border Patrol have formed neighborhoods of
cardboard and scrap-wood shacks on the city's far-south side.
</P>
<P>
   They typically live hand-to-mouth or pick up the worst jobs that
the city's maquila industries have to offer, Teran said.
</P>
<P>
   '`In the past five years, our population has doubled to 120,000,
and this is where a large part of that growth has come from,`'
Teran said.
</P>
<P>
   Teran said city officials talked one bus company into offering
half-price fares to take those people back home who wanted to go,
but he didn't know how successful the special fare had been.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, the jewelry-store owner, gets a big chuckle out of that
one.
</P>
<P>
   She said she recently took a bus trip to her native state of
Guanajuato on a virtually empty bus. On the way north, however, she
could find only one seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was full of people from southern Mexico and Guatemala with
a `coyote' who controlled the movements of the bus,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver stopped whenever the `coyote' wanted him to, and we
stayed a lot of time at the checkpoints wherever there were federal
police because he was paying bribes to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez glanced down the street to the half block of buildings she
bought with her husband three years ago, when they were empty. Now
they house her jewelry store, a flourishing law practice and a
restaurant kept busy by lines of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we bought at the right time,'' she said. &QL;

FEDERAL RULING THREATENS HIGHWAY PROJECTS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Among the Kansas City area highway projects
threatened by an unexpected federal ruling is the $30 million new
Chouteau Bridge, state highway officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And the ruling may affect more than federal projects, officials
said. It could also delay some projects that local governments are
paying to complete, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling set off a flurry of activity in Washington, Topeka
and Jefferson City on Thursday, as officials scrambled to interpret
its impact and decide how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation ruled that the area's
transportation plans failed to conform with federal clean-air
requirements. As a result, the agency this week began to withhold
approval for area highway projects that widen roads or add lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also could stop some projects that have started,
because several contracts are usually required to complete an
expansion project, said Bill Ahrens, urban planning manager for the
Kansas Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've finished design and you're ready to go to
right-of-way acquisition, you can't do it,'' Ahrens said. ``If you
finished right-of-way and you're ready to go to construction, you
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri highway officials on Thursday listed four major
projects that may be affected. The projects and their anticipated
costs:
</P>
<P>
   - Missouri 7, between Moreland School Road and Wyatt Road,
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Missouri 291, paving of the new bridge over the Missouri
River, $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   - The Chouteau Bridge, two contracts, $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   - Missouri 78, east of Missouri 291, $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those projects were to begin as early as September, said Linda
Clark, the Missouri Department of Transportation's planning manager
for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get this problem worked out soon, nothing will happen to
those projects,'' Clark said. ``And when I say `soon,' I mean in
the next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas highway officials were working Thursday to assemble a
list of threatened projects.
</P>
<P>
   The list may be available as soon as today, when state and local
officials plan to meet in Kansas City with representatives of the
U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, said he hoped to
introduce a bill soon that would prevent the kind of roadblock to
local highway funds facing the Kansas City region.
</P>
<P>
   His measure would turn into law an Environmental Protection
Agency rule that would allow ``grandfathering'' of previously
approved transportation projects into conformity with current clean
air rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can pass it, that would solve the problem for the Kansas
City metro area,'' he said. He added that other cities face similar
tensions between highway money and clean-air rules.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials think the federal agencies are taking a hard
line on the Kansas City issue because of recent federal court
rulings involving long-range transportation plans in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There, a federal judge ordered federal officials to stop
allowing highway projects to proceed when area transportation plans
didn't conform to federal clean-air requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson City, Gov. Mel Carnahan's staff planned to meet
late Thursday with the state's environment and highway officials to
assess what to do about the situation, said Chris Sifford, a
spokesman for Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kansas Gov. Bill Graves said he is awaiting
official notice of the ruling from federal highway officials before
considering what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   One quick way for the area to comply with federal clean-air
requirements would be for the governors of Kansas and Missouri to
formally ask that reformulated gasoline be brought to area pumps
next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the governors have decided to wait until an
early June ``fuels summit'' with refiners, regulators and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, officials involved in this issue thought that
waiting until June would present no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Regional planning officials had thought the U.S. Department of
Transportation wouldn't place the area's transportation plans in
noncompliance until next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   But early this week, federal transportation officials informed
the Mid-America Regional Council that it had also placed the area's
current plan in noncompliance and had begun to halt new approvals
of highway expansion projects.
</P>
<P>
   Only projects that add to a highway's capacity are affected, but
such projects are usually among the most expensive. In 1998,
expansion projects amounted to half of the area's $400 million
transportation program, federal highway officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal clean-air laws require that long-range transportation
plans conform to the area's clean-air plans. In Kansas City, the
latest plan involves bringing reformulated gas to area pumps as
early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   That can't happen until the two governors ask for the gas to be
brought to Kansas City. Until that happens, the Environmental
Protection Agency said in an April 6 letter, it couldn't recommend
approval of the area's transportation plans.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation ratified the agency's
position this month.

EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL HITS $15 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (The following story, eliminated earlier from N.Y. Times News
Service budget, is now restored.)  (See related CONGRESS-PORK) 
(rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three days and nights of haggling, House and
Senate negotiators on Thursday night wrapped up an emergency
spending package that ballooned to almost $15 billion, more that
twice what the White House had sought, to pay for wars and
disasters around the word.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers included more than $5 billion in military programs
that the Pentagon had never asked for, as well as some deeply
disputed legislation that would aid the mining, steel, fishing and
energy industries. They proposed Thursday night to pay for most of
it with surplus money from Social Security and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Wearily emerging from bargaining sessions in the basement of the
Capitol and their personal suites, the conferees had accomplished
two things: They had added more than $8 billion, mostly in military
funds, to the package, and they had earned the anger and
disappointment from some fellow members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties who saw the bill as politically and
financially undisciplined vowed to oppose it when it comes to a
final vote next week. Veteran staff members said the House-Senate
conference sessions had been chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   The final cost of the bill grew almost by the hour, and remained
in doubt at the close.
</P>
<P>
   To reach an agreement, the negotiators had to remove from the
spending bill measures offered by Sens. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
and Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., intended to help the steel, oil and
gas industries. Domenici's amendment would have spent $125 million
to back half a billion dollars in loans for oil and gas companies.
Byrd's measure would have spent $145 million or more to create $1
billion in loan guarantees for steel companies, including one in
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   The House-Senate appropriations conference first accepted the
package shortly before 1 a.m. Thursday. Then, under pressure from
Republican leaders, two House conferees switched their votes late
Thursday afternoon, defeating it on a vote of 12 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate stood firm for the package, creating an impasse
with long speeches by Byrd citing the Bible, Roman history and
congressional lore.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, late Thursday night, the conferees agreed to place the
steel, oil and gas measures in a separate emergency package for
future consideration by the House and Senate. With that maneuver,
the conferees had wrapped up a $14.7 billion bill.
</P>
<P>
   They took President Clinton's $6 billion request for the bombing
of Yugoslavia and Iraq and the care and feeding of refugees from
Kosovo, and added $2.25 million for military operations, $1.84
billion for a military pay increase, $475 million for military
construction, $300 million for aircraft, $250 million for weapons
and $200 million for the Coast Guard. They also increased money for
assisting refugees to $919 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money in the emergency bill would come from surplus
Social Security money, infuriating fiscal conservatives. The
members of the House Appropriations Committee in the conference
committee proposed Thursday night to offset some of those costs by
eliminating $1.25 billion in money for food stamps, which they said
was surplus and would go unspent this year, $350 million in
programs for low-income housing and $50 million for foreign
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That decision prompted an angry reaction from Rep. Marcy Kaptur,
D-Ohio. ``I cannot believe we're going to take funds from the most
vulnerable people in this country and give it away, most of it to
defense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaptur's colleagues said most of the food-stamp money was
technically being used to offset costs of disaster aid to Central
American victims of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They included $687 million for the hurricane victims, with an
additional $216 million for the Defense Department's initial relief
efforts for them; $570 million for assistance to American farmers
stung by low commodity prices, and $80 million to deter illegal
immigration from Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also included $900 million for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, mostly to help tornado and storm
victims in the Midwest, and $100 million to shore up Jordan's role
in the Mideast peace process. And it gave the Census Bureau $45
million to finance its operations through the end of the year.

GREENE STARTS THREE-GAME SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins made out his
lineup card for Thursday's game, which included Todd Greene in
right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he came in and said, `I'm suspended,' '' Collins said.
``So I said `OK, there's a scratch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Greene dropped his appeal of a three-game suspension handed down
by the American League for charging the mound in a game against the
Mariners April 18. Greene had been hit with a pitch by Mariners
pitcher Brett Hinchliffe, one pitch after Troy Glaus homered.
</P>
<P>
   Both general manager Bill Bavasi and team president Tony Tavares
talked with AL President Gene Budig, but ``talking to Budig,
(Bavasi and Tavares) didn't feel the league was going to budge on
it,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene began serving the suspension Thursday and will miss games
tonight and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a national TV game _ I couldn't have given them a sad
enough story to change it,'' Greene said, adding that he would do
it again given the circumstances. Angels hitters were hit five
times in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to do it again, but if I have to, I will,''
he said. ``Baseballs break bones.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Thanks to O'Brien: Pitcher Chuck Finley's eight shutout
innings Wednesday against the Yankees was easily his best
performance of the year, and he credited catcher Charlie O'Brien
for making a key adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie suggested something after my last start. He said,
`This is what I need your forkball to start doing for me,' ''
Finley said. ``I throw two forkballs, one for strikes and one in
the dirt to get guys to swing at. He didn't like the one I throw
for strikes, particularly when I'm ahead in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   So Finley threw plenty of forkballs in the dirt, gave up only
three hits and registered a season-high 11 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Breathe deeply: Troy Glaus had started all 34 games this
season at third base until Thursday, when Tim Unroe started in his
place. Glaus has just three hits in his past 34 at-bats, his
average falling to .274.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to sit here for a day and just take a deep breath,''
Collins said of his 22-year-old third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't seeing pitches or recognizing pitches, it'd be a
whole different problem. It's a matter of executing,'' Glaus said
of his slump. ``I'm not tired at all. Physically I feel great.
</P>
<P>
   __ Can't hold Mo down: Mo Vaughn's sprained left ankle limits
him to the designated-hitter spot. But even after it improves
enough to allow him to play first base, he'll need occasional
stints at DH to keep the ankle from being overworked.
</P>
<P>
   However, a week of Vaughn not playing at all is not an option
according to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big enough to hold him down,'' Collins said. ``We
don't have enough guys to hold him down.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough sked: The schedule continues to be an enemy for the
Angels early in the season. Thursday they completed a 10-day,
nine-game trip to Detroit, Boston and New York but are home to play
just three games _ their third three-game homestand of the season _
before traveling to Baltimore and Tampa Bay for six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get home at 3 in the morning, get up and play (tonight),''
Collins said. ``We wake up Saturday and play, then Sunday we bring
our suitcases to the stadium again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels begin a three-game series against the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays tonight at 7:05. Tim Belcher (1-3, 9.89 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Tampa Bay's Bobby Witt (3-0, 4.11).

TOBACCO COMPANY WINS JURY VERDICT IN KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. had no
responsibility for the 1995 lung cancer death of 56-year-old
Charles Steele, a Kansas City federal jury ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters and with Brown &AMP; Williamson's lawyers
after the verdict, jury foreman Gary White, himself a smoker, said
deliberations quickly focused on testimony that Steele, of
Vandalia, Mo., apparently understood the risks of smoking and
consciously chose to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced he knew cigarettes had a danger,'' White
said. ``His final decision was that the pleasure outweighed the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's third-largest tobacco manufacturer hopes the
victory, combined with a win in a Tennessee courtroom earlier this
week, represents a return to the way juries traditionally have
viewed smoking cases and the way the industry defends its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Kansas City case, as well as the trials in Memphis, was
about personal responsibility and choice,'' said Steven McCormick,
a lawyer representing Brown and Williamson. ``Those juries'
verdicts are consistent with an overwhelming majority of American
citizens who believe plaintiffs should not be awarded money for
actions in which they exercised their own personal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has consistently prevailed over complaints
brought by sick smokers over the years. But two recent losses by
Philip Morris in California and Oregon dented the industry's armor
and helped drive down stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Gary Black, with Sanford C. Bernstein, said
Brown &AMP; Williamson's wins in Kansas City and Memphis show investors
the industry still can manage its legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking-related lawsuits filed against tobacco companies rose
from about 150 in 1996 to about 800 in 1998, and about 180,000 new
cases of lung cancer are diagnosed every year, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry needed to win this case and the case in Memphis
to show plaintiffs' attorneys that these cases are not easy to
win,'' Black said. ``They needed to show they were in control.''
</P>
<P>
   And with victory, the markets responded.
</P>
<P>
   American depositary receipts for British American Tobacco, Brown
&AMP; Williamson's parent company, rose 1 to 19 by the end of trading
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Other tobacco stocks also showed improvements. Philip Morris
climbed 1 to 39. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which plans to spin
off its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit, gained to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Steele, Charles Steele's daughter, said she was not
surprised by the verdict. She said she and her brother, Charles
Steele Jr., brought the case at the request of their mother, who
died a year after their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into this with an open mind,'' Michelle Steele said.
``This was our mother's decision. When she died we decided to
continue it. We knew from the beginning it would be a hard case.''
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, J. Michael Cronan of Independence, said he did not
plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a fair shot at this,'' Cronan said. ``The jury
took it seriously, and we accept their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, the Steeles contended that Brown &AMP;
Williamson's Kool Filter Kings were defective, ``unreasonably''
dangerous and directly responsible for his lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses for the defense, including company Chairman Nicholas
Brookes, acknowledged that smoking was risky but argued that Brown
&AMP; Williamson has helped fund about $300 million in independent
health research on smoking since the 1950s and helped to disclose
its hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are emerging as a potent tobacco industry
defense, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know jurors come to these cases with a very negative view
of the industry from what they've read in the papers,'' McCormick
said. ``Absolutely telling the story of Brown &AMP; Williamson will be
central to our defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine jurors in the Steele case were smokers or
ex-smokers. But White said they didn't consider that in their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   It did factor into their deliberations, however.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the case about 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, jurors
asked court officials a question that is never far from a smoker's
mind:
</P>
<P>
   Would they be able to take cigarette breaks? &QL;

 KC area soon will have more digits to dial  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Denverite Jenni Pieratt has words of solace
for the communication junkies who are going to panic when they hear
the cold hard truth.
</P>
<P>
   True, Kansas City is going to 10-digit local dialing. But it's
``no big deal,'' Pieratt says.
</P>
<P>
   The area is running out of seven-digit telephone numbers for all
of those computer lines, fax machines, cell phones and home phones
that people are buying. On Dec. 4, callers are going to have to use
area codes when making local calls across the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Calling from Overland Park to Lee's Summit, for example, will
require dialing 816 and then the number. A call from Kansas City,
Mo., to Kansas City, Kan., will start with a 913. These calls still
will be local, won't require a 1 before the area code and won't be
charged as long distance. They simply will require the 10 digits of
the area code and the number.
</P>
<P>
   Denver went to a similar system in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty basic,'' said Pieratt, spokeswoman for Janus,
the Denver-based mutual fund company that is owned by Kansas City
Southern Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to go through the issue of programming your speed
dials. When you have a cell phone and a work phone and a home
phone, that can take a bit of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The most nettlesome thing Pieratt faced was figuring out that
she needed to reprogram her home computer so she could connect to
her Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, the issues are more complex. In addition to
reprogramming phone equipment, they will have to change such things
as van signs, company phone lists and client lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 25,000 accounts in the metro area,'' said Kent Rowland,
service manager for ADT Security Services, which has its monitoring
offices in Missouri. ``It could mean we will have to go out to all
of our customers in Kansas and reprogram their systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although regulators know it will be inconvenient, they said
there was no other choice. And no one local telephone company is
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hidden agenda behind this. It is a mathematical
thing,'' said Rosemary Foreman, spokeswoman for the Kansas
Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Kansas City area has had the convenience of local
calling, even though there are separate long-distance exchanges for
each side of the state line, said Bill Adair of Southwestern Bell,
who serves the area as the local codes administrator. He is the
industry go-between who handles requests for new telephone numbers
on behalf of all area telecommunication providers.
</P>
<P>
   The area's local calling system meant that the same prefix and
phone number couldn't be used in Kansas and Missouri, even though
residents lived in different area codes. As a result, a big pool of
potential numbers couldn't be used in one state or the other. But
by December, he said, the area will run out of seven-digit numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear this past summer that we had gone as far as we
could,'' Adair said. ``Yet we had a big pool of numbers just
sitting there doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair and others said the two factors exhausting numbers are
technology and competition. People use much more telephone
technology and many more telephone companies are selling those
services. Those companies have to have a supply of telephone
numbers to be able to sell their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago the only people with cell phones were doctors and
lawyers,'' Adair said. ``I have two cell phones and a pager. I have
six telephone numbers personally, counting fax, phone and computer.
When you go to the mall, just about every kid has a pager on their
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kelly, spokesman for the Missouri Public Service
Commission, which regulates telephone service in the state, said
that a few years ago only Southwestern Bell and Sprint Corp.'s
United Telephone Co. provided local telephone service in the Kansas
City area. Now that local phone competition is permissible, 39
telephone companies have been approved in the state since 1997.
Most of those have made Kansas City a target and need phone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   With available numbers slipping away, a study group of
telecommunications companies and regulators in both states devised
the 10-digit plan. It mimics plans in place in Houston, Dallas,
Atlanta, St. Louis, Denver and the entire state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the process easier, the group decided to leave
seven-digit dialing in place within each area code. In other words,
nothing changes for a local call within an area code, although the
call will go through if the caller dials the area code first.
</P>
<P>
   It was also decided to have a lengthy ``permissive period,''
starting June 5, when customers can use 10-digit dialing but don't
have to. That way they can prepare for the change in December.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Bosshardt, administrator of external communications at
Sprint, said the company knew 10-digit calling was coming and has
been preparing employees, fielding questions and urging them to
begin using 10 digits this summer to become comfortable with the
extra numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting question Bosshardt received was whether a
wireless phone with an 816 exchange but being used while traveling
