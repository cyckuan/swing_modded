<HEADLINE> Christopher Hopes to Bring About Immediate Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today expressed the hope that his new peace mission to
the Middle East would bring about an immediate cease-fire between
Israel and militant Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the mission would lead to a new, written
accord to prevent new bloody conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen in the Hague, the Netherlands, Christopher was flying
to Damascus today with promises from Syria and Lebanon that they
would be "actively involved" in trying to arrange the truce.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the eve of his shuttle trip,
Christopher said that apart from the cease-fire, he would try to
revive and strengthen a verbal accord in July 1993 between Israel
and Hezbollah not to target each other's civilians with shelling
and rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary said that he wanted the accord "written down
this time," but a senior U.S. official said that he doubted
Hezbollah would be accorded the recognition of signing a pact with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's on-going trip to the Middle East will be an
open-ended one, U.S. officials said. He is setting no deadline to
return to Washington, although his schedule calls for a
Congressional hearing late next week and meeting with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire is becoming urgent for both Israel and the United
States since Israel is facing an international condemnation. The
U.S. backing to Israel's repeated attacks in Lebanon is losing
Washington respect, and possible influence, in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Greek Officials Optimistic about Island's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides and Greek Deputy Foreign Minister George Romeos
expressed optimism concerning prospects of the island's accession
to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here today at the end of
Romeos' contacts in this country, Michaelides described the Greek
official's three-day visit as "especially productive."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides stressed the importance of cooperation of the
Cypriot and Greek Foreign Ministries on Cyprus' application for
accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
He believed that any obstacles met in the way can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Romeos said he shares Michaelides' optimism,
adding that "serious work" is being done here in cooperation with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Romeos said that during his meetings with President Glafcos
Clerides, he briefed him on Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis'
recent visit to Washington and they went through certain
preparations concerning the president's visit to Athens in May.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed visit of the new U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, John
Kornblum, to Nicosia-Athens-Ankara, the Greek official said, "we
believe that the U.S. initiative on Cyprus problem could be
launched after President Clerides' visit to the U.S. in June."
</P>
<P>
This gives enough time to both Cyprus and Greece to intervene
in the shaping of the framework of the initiative, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Encourages Citizen's House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today reiterated his government's commitment to promoting
citizen's house ownership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Kasama of Northern Province, Chiluba stressed that
promotion of house ownership would ensure total independence of
the people's mind and provide social security to the citizens.
</P>
<P>
He said some council houses in low-cost sections, which were
built before 1957, could be pegged at about 10,000 kwacha (8.3 US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He urged the Kasama municipal council to sell more houses in
other sections to the sitting residents at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
However, he appealed to the people who would benefit from the
sale of council houses not to resell their houses to others,
adding that it would be unfair and unwise to resell the houses
they were acquiring very cheaply.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Chiluba has been inspecting council houses
in various parts of the country, encouraging local councils to
sell houses to the sitting residents at affordable prices.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers' Wives Picket Beef Burger Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Members of Britain's Women's
Farming Union mounted today a picket outside a chain of burger
restaurants, telling people that British beef is safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, about 350 women, many of them
farmers' wives, distributed leaflets in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset
and Dorset, all in southwest England, about the safety of British
beef.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that British beef was safe to eat, and they
urged burger chains to restore it to their menus.
</P>
<P>
Since March 20 when a wave of scare was stirred up by the mad
cow disease, many burger chains in Britain have switched to
foreign beef, and schools across the country have also cut off
British beef from dinner menus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission then imposed a worldwide ban on British
beef exports and beef consumption in domestic markets has rapidly
declined accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The British government has time and again ensured the EC that
British beef was safe to eat, and it has urged it to lift its ban.
</P>
<P>
But the EC has urged the UK urgently to produce a program for
slaughtering herds in order to eliminate the risk from the BSE, or
the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told European leaders Friday
night that Britain had handled the beef crisis over the mad cow
disease responsible and that there was no reason to destroy
millions of animals.
</P>
<P>
However, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President
Jacques Chirac and Italian Premier Lamberto Dini have been
reported not to support Major's call for an early lifting of the
ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
British officials said that they would continue making
representations to the EC and in particular to Franz Fischler, the
agriculture commissioner, next week.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Israel Protesters Clash with Police in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today arrested
five people during clashes in Nazareth, northern Israel, at a
protest march against Israeli military operation in southern
Lebanon, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Police broke up the march and used tear gas to keep the
demonstrators from the main street of the Arab town in the north
of Israel, and a police van was stoned by angry protesters.
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters carried black flag, and some of the
speakers urged Israeli Arabs to abstain instead of voting for
Shimon Peres for prime minister in the May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came following Israeli army artillery fire
"accidentally" landed at a U.N. position in south Lebanon,
killing about 100 Lebanese civilians who were seeking shelters
there.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred last Thursday, on the eighth day of the
Israeli blitz on Lebanon, code-named Operation Grapes of Wrath,
against Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of residents have fled from their homes in
southern Lebanese villages and towns since the Israeli army
started the operation on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah
continued to launch Katyusha rockets into Israel, most residents
of the northern Israeli towns and villages have been evacuated
southwards, while others have been living in shelters for more
than a week.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Arabs observed a commercial
strike today, and schools were also closed to protest the killing
of the Lebanese civilians Thursday.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen claimed
his third consecutive men's singles title at the European
championships in Herning, Denmark, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, the world number two, needed just 32 minutes to
overcome his compatriot Peter Rasmussen 15-5, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, seeded two, staged a fightback in the second game
to lead 11-10. But his advantage was squandered due to some
unforced errors before Hoyer-Larsen scored five points in a row to
take the win.
</P>
<P>
The win helped Hoyer-Larson equal the three in a row record
achieved by another Dane, Flemming Delfs, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In the women's side, Denmark's Camilla Martin breezed past
Russia's Marina Yakushev 11-0, 11-3 in only 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In a marathon women's doubles final, Lisbet Stuer-Laurdisen
and Marlene Thomsen recovered from one game down to defeat fellow
Danes Rikke Olsen and Helen Kirkegaard 6-15, 15-12, 15-10.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces have
arrested a number of people suspected of involvement in the bloody
attack on Greek tourists in Cairo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are now underway to determine the suspects'
relations with the attack which killed 17 Greeks and an Egyptian
parking attendant and injured 16 others, the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) quoted Assistant Interior Minister Major General
Ra'ouf al-Menawy as saying today.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on a group of Greek tourists
outside the Europa Hotel near the Pyramids as they were about to
board a bus. The hotel has been frequented by Israeli tourists.
</P>
<P>
Menawy denied reports that the perpetrators had a map of the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
Police have found in the populated Cairo district of Mouski a
microbus of the Volkswagen brand without plates, which fits
eyewitnesses' description of the car used by gunmen in their
attack on Greek tourists, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's largest Moslem militant group, Al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group), today reportedly claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying that it had mistaken the
victims for Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The group said that the attack had been aimed at avenging
Israel's bombings of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> 19th Ordinary Ministerial Session Of OAU Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The 19th Ordinary
Ministerial Session of Labour Commission of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) ended here today after adopting 15
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The "Resolution on the Libyan Labor Force and Migrant Workers
in the Great Jamahiriya" calls on the UN Security Council to
reconsider its resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) with a view
to lifting the unjust sanctions. It calls upon the secretary
general and the Security Council of the UN to take into account
the damages caused to human elements before taking any decisions
on the imposition of sanctions against states, as such sanctions
tend to violate the UN Charter itself and human rights as well
as the International Labour organization Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The "Resolution on the Fourth World Conference on Women, with
Particular Reference to the Issues Affecting the Employment of
Women" calls upon the OAU Secretariat to submit a progress report
on the follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women to the
20th Session of the OAU Labour Commission and invites the OAU
Secretariat to take urgent measures with a view to strengthening
the women's unit to enable it to implement the African and
International Platform and Plan of Action on Women, adopted in
Dakar (1994) and Beijing (1995).
</P>
<P>
The Resolution on Employment Promotion and Tripartism in
Africa says about two-thirds of the African labor force is either
unemploy- ed or under-employed and almost six million youth
entering the labour market will face serious difficulties in
finding productive employment. It calls upon the OAU Secretariat,
in collaboration with the Pan-African Employers' Confederation
and the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, to hold a
tripartite workshop on employment-creation strategies for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The "Resolution on Implementation of the Treaty Establishing
the African Economic Community" urges all member states to accord
top priority to the implementation of the treaty, within their
respective regional and sub-regional economic communities with
the full involvement of all segments of the society, in
particular the professional and business associations, the
private sector and the trade unions. It appeals to those member
states which have not yet done so to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting also adopted some other resolutions.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies Step UP Political Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- British companies are stepping up
their donations to political parties in the run-up to the general
election scheduled for May 1997, the Financial Times newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Four companies which will hold their annual meetings in the
next few weeks have all disclosed large donations to the ruling
Conservative party, while the opposition Labor has been offered
21,000 pounds (31,500 U.S. dollars) by the Mirror Group.
</P>
<P>
Vickers, the industrial manufacturing and defense equipment
company which financially supported the Conservatives in 1991, has
again donated 55,000 pounds (82,500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
GKN, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, has given the
Tories 25,000 pounds (37,500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two companies have large defense businesses and are big
government suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Tory officials said that while donations to all parties tended
to rise before a general election, business leaders were becoming
more worried about the prospects of a Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The rise in donations is being seen as evidence of
stronger-than-expected fundraising by the political parties,
particularly the Tories.
</P>
<P>
But corporate governance activists are exerting pressure on
companies to put donations to a shareholders' vote.
</P>
<P>
Pirc, the corporate governance consultancy, said that political
donations were not an appropriate use of shareholder funds unless
the directors could demonstrate that the company would benefit.
</P>
<P>
Pirc is particularly critical of the donations offered by
Vickers and GKN to the Tories and is also recommending that
shareholders vote against the donation.
</P>
<P>
Pirc maintained that providing financial support to a political
party was not relevant to the investment trust's interests.
</P>
<P>
Conservative party chairman Brian Mawhinney admitted that his
party had fallen into the red. He said last month that his party
would be back in the black this year having cut its overdraft from
11.4 million pounds (17.1 million dollars) in 1994 to 2.5 million
pounds (3.75 million dollars) last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini here today following
the one-day Group of Seven (G-7) and Russia's summit on nuclear
security, according to the presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Dini discussed bilateral relations, European
security and relations between Russia and the European Union, now
chaired by Italy.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a good deal of attention was paid to the
preparation for the upcoming summit meeting of the leaders of the
world's major countries in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side stressed the importance for the Lyon summit to
adopt a final decision on establishing a full-formation Group of
Eight (G-8).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, French President Jacque Chirac, who
co-chaired today's Moscow summit meeting together with Yeltsin,
told a joint news conference that he and the Russian leader
planned to propose at the Lyons summit that the G-7 be transformed
into a G-8.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same news conference, Yeltsin admitted that not
all of the G-7 leaders "decisively speak" in favor of Russia's
admission to the G-7 as a full-fledged member.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Italian leader during today's meeting that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) expansion to the East
was inadmissible to Russia. It did not say how Dini replied.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed satisfaction with the Russian-Italian
relations and called for their transformation into a genuine
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Dini, together with other G-7 leaders, attended today's summit
meeting on nuclear security held in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>

During the meeting, the two sides exchanged views on bilateral

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Meets with French Counterpart in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov declared here today that Russia had no ready-made
initiative for a ceasefire in Lebanon but would support any
initiative to lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
This came in press statements made by Primakov following his
meeting with his French counterpart Herve de Charette here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Primakov examined with de Charette ways of
effecting a ceasefire in Lebanon and prospects of resumption of
the peace process after the recent setbacks suffered by it.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Minister made it clear that the France had
offered a plan to tackle the crisis in Lebanon, and this plan
could be adopted as a working basis.
</P>
<P>
"Syria has an attitude that must be taken into consideration,
and we have to do all that can help secure a settlement," Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his aim -- as well as that of the foreign
ministers of France, the U.S. and Italy who are in Damascus now --
is to attain a ceasefire in Lebanon, to end the tragic situation
there and to take all measures necessary to halt the escalation of
the Israeli military operations and the bombing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Lebanon began on April 11 when Israel launched
its air, artillery and naval onslaught to try to end Hezbollah (or
Party of God) guerrilla Katyusha rocket attacks on northern
Israel. Despite the air raids and bombardment, its goal has proved
elusive as the guerrillas continue to attack the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The international diplomatic offensive was spurred by the death
Thursday of at least 75 Lebanese refugees in Israeli shelling of a
Fijian U.N. peacekeepers' base in a village 12 kilometers
southeast of the southern port city of Tyre. The Lebanese side put
the death toll at 101.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, both Israel and Hezbollah indicated willingness to
stop shooting if the other side did. But in the absence of a
formal armistice the fighting rage on.
</P>
<P>
On his part, de Charette confirmed his optimism about the
possibility of finding a way out of the tragic situation in
Lebanon, which affected the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister added that his upcoming meeting
with the foreign ministers of the U.S., Russia, Italy and Syria
is intended to effect a ceasefire in Lebanon and to bring Lebanese
refugees back to their homes.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Pledges to Aid Lebanon's Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) - The World Bank today pledged to
move quickly to help Lebanon rebuild from heavy Israeli
bombardment once a cease-fire is reached in the region.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made by World Bank President James Wofensohn
during the semi-annual meeting of the Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) here.
</P>
<P>
"I am personally very concerned to ensure that... we come in as
quickly as possible to try to look at the question of
reconstruction," he told reporters covering the meeting. "I am
committed to that."
</P>
<P>
Since Israel launched the bombardment in southern Lebanon on
April 11 to avenge Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel by
Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas, more than 100 civilians have
been reportedly killed and hundreds of others wounded. The bloody
conflict also forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France and Russia as well as other nations
have been trying to mediate an immediate cease-fire between Israel
and radical Islamic Hizbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has already lent Lebanon some 300 million U.S.
dollars, but Wolfensohn admitted that they were not enough.
</P>
<P>
"I've asked my colleagues to make a thorough review of the
Lebanon situation, particularly in light of this round (of
fighting)," the World Bank chief said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not believe that the Bank and other rich donors
had taken what he called the same "structured approach" to the
rebuilding of the war-torn Middle East nation as they had done in
Bosnia and the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Powers' Leaders Hail Moscow Summit Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of seven leading
Western countries and Russia have welcomed the results of today's
summit meeting on nuclear security held in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the one-day summit, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin told a news conference, "We were conducting our
discussions as friends."
</P>
<P>
Choice of Moscow as the venue for such a meeting means "the
status of Russia as a great power has been recognized," he said,
adding that the meeting was the first G-8 summit.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was attended by the leaders of the Group of
Seven (or G-7) industrialized countries -- Canada, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- and Russia.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who together with Yeltsin
chaired the summit, described the results of the meeting as
"extremely positive."
</P>
<P>
He told the same news conference, "We have been able to take an
important step towards better security for the world of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The nature of the discussions and the documents signed mean
"partnership between the three great political forces -- the
United States, Europe and Russia -- has risen to a new level,"
Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed deep satisfaction with
the results of the summit, saying, "We have reached very good
results."
</P>
<P>
The Moscow meeting will give a powerful impetus to resolving
the problem of security of nuclear reactors, which was tackled
very slowly after the Munich G-7 summit in 1992, Kohl told a news
conference at Moscow's Balchug-Kempinsky Hotel following the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called the Moscow summit
"an important step towards the recognition of global
responsibility for nuclear safety and security."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about weapons-grade plutonium obtained from removed
nuclear warheads, a problem that Russia and the United States are
currently facing, Chretien told reporters here that this
radioactive material can be used for peaceful purposes as fuel for
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that canada has the necessary reactors and safe and
efficient technologies which can help deal with this problem.
Touchingbility upon the problem of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant to be shut down by the year 2000, the Canadian leader said,
"We plan to help Ukraine reach its goal, including by providing an
adequate replacement for this source of energy."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed the program
of combating illegal trade in nuclear materials worked out at the
summit and described it as a specific result of international
cooperation to ensure the safety of the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the G-7 and Russia to conduct a more open and
transparent policy in the nuclear security field.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question at a news conference here, Hashimoto
said he and Yeltsin "established friendly relations" during the
Moscow summit, "although this does not mean that all disputes
(between Japan and Russia) are over."
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, it is thanks to the friendly atmosphere which
developed at their talks in the Kremlin Friday that the sides
could discuss such issues as talks on fishing cooperation in the
zone of the disputed islands and an end to the dumping of nuclear
waste by Russia into the world ocean.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the results of the Moscow summit, U.S. President Bill
Clinton also pledged support for reforms in Russia and said that
he believes Russia has a huge economic potential.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the Kremlin, adopted a package of
documents, which reaffirmed that the participants of the meeting
want to strengthen their cooperation in the efforts to further
nuclear disarmament and fight the illegal trafficking of nuclear
materials.
</P>
<P>
They called for expanding denuclearized zones, and for
promoting joint monitoring and advanced technologies in utilizing
and depositing nuclear materials. They were also interested in
stopping the production and testing of new types of nuclear arms,
according to the documents.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Dispels Rumours Buthelezi Wanted Out Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela today said Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader and
Home Affaris Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi had not indicated that
he wanted to withdraw from the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks to reporters after addressing
teachers and pupils at a school in Kwamashu north of Durban.
</P>
<P>
At an eleciton rally last week, Buthelezi warned the IFP might
withdraw from the government if the African National Congress
(ANC) succeeded in postponing the local government elections in
Kwazulu/Natal Province scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said anyone that withdrew from the government would be
lagging behind the rest of South Africa which was united and
focused on nation building and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
''The government of national unity is extremely strong. I have
not the slightest fear about the future because the people of
South Africa are united,'' said the president.
</P>
<P>
While addressing 15,000 ANC supporters, Mandela urged pupils
to return to school in Kwamashu where a week-long teacher boycott
brought schooling to a stop after the Easter recess.
</P>
<P>
Teaching had stopped at 75 schools in the township and
affected about 8,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
The murder of a teacher during a school assembly in March
prompted the teacher boycott to demand stepped security at
teaching institutions in the township.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was on a two-day visit to Kwazulu/Natal as part of the
ANC's election campaign ahead of the proposed local poll next
month. enditem

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Visits Egypt Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti is due to pay a short working visit to Cairo
Sunday to discuss the Lebanese situation and means of furthering
consultation and coordination with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest move of Jordan's efforts to defuse the 10-day
crisis in Lebanon which has killed more than 150 Lebanese
people, wounded 300 and displaced some 400,000.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher, who announced the visit
by the prime minister after a cabinet meeting today, said that
consultation with Egypt is an ongoing matter since its relation
with Cairo is a strategic one.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's current diplomatic efforts came within the framework
of cooperation, which is also the reason behind Premier Kabariti's
Sunday visit to Cairo, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has strongly condemned the Israeli military operations
in Lebanon launched on April 11 in retaliation for Hezbollah's
Katyusha rocket attacks on north Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, King Hussein said the Jordanian government and
people "strongly condemn Israel's malicious aggression and
criminal military operations" against the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's strong-wording comments came after the failure
of the quiet diplomacy the Jordanian government had been pursuing
since the start of the fighting, and following Israel's Thursday
raids on a U.N. peacekeepers' base, killing over 100 Lebanese
refugees who were seeking shelter there.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein sent Kabariti to Israel Tuesday with a messages to
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
urging them to halt the assault on Lebanon and re-engage in its
peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Helps Peace in Bosnia: WB Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- To maintain a lasting peace in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is mostly important to find jobs for
its people returning from war and "economic development helps
peace," World Bank President James Wolfenshon said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference ahead of the annual joint spring meetings
of the bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Wolfensohn
also said, "Peace will only be achieved in that area if we can get
jobs to these people."
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 people were returning from fighting fields in the
former Yugoslav republic, he added.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot have 300,000 people wandering around with guns in
their hand and no job," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank estimates, Bosnia needs some 5
billion U.S. dollars for its post-war reconstruction.
International donors, including the World Bank, have committed 1.2
billion dollars to help rebuild Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
About Lebanon, where the World Bank has already approved 300
million dollar loans, Wolfensohn said he was personally very
concerned for the current situation and was committed to take
actions to help the country rebuild from heavy Israeli bombardment
once a cease-fire was reached in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank announced that it planned to provide
a 20 million dollar loan to the West Bank and Gaza to help
Palestinians improve roads and extend water supplies.
</P>
<P>
The loan will come from funds set aside by the World Bank to
support the economic development in the West Bank and Gaza and
will be free of interest. The money will be used to finance the
projects designed to help revive local industry and create jobs.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil plans to import 11
million tons of coal this year to power its steel industry, and
the imports will cost the south American country up to 650 million
U.S. dollars, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil imported 11.6 million tons of coal last year.
</P>
<P>
A country without coal resources, Brazil depends heavily on
coal imports for its industries. Otherwise, many steel factories
in the nation have to use charcoal to ensure steel production.
</P>
<P>
This year, Brazil will buy 3 million tons of coal from the
United States, and the rest will be imported from other countries
including Colombia and China.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Obstacles Looming over Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Obstacles loom over Bangladesh's
coming parliamentary elections although both the authorities
concerned and different political parties are going all out in
preparation.
</P>
<P>
The main rivals, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami
(People's) League (AL), still differ on several major issues
concerning the polls, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
The BNP insists on holding the elections by the end of May
whereas the AL and the BNP's other rival parties object to it and
instead support a poll date planned in mid-June by the caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
They said the former ruling party (BNP) wanted polls before
arms recovery as "a maximum of illegal arms remained in the
possession of BNP activists as the then home minister equipped
them with firearms during their 5-year rule."
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has the intention of holding the
national polls in the second or third week of June since poll
preparations can not be completed in a short time.
</P>
<P>
In its 21-point draft election manifesto announced last Friday,
the AL called for a "war" against corrupt practices by those in
the "fallen" BNP regime. It urged the caretaker government to
start investigation into the "widespread corruption and plundering
of public money done by the BNP government in its 5-year rule."
</P>
<P>
The former opposition parties also demanded immediate transfer
of the Defense Ministry and Armed Forces Division from President
Abdur Rahman Biswas to the chief adviser of the caretaker
government in order to keep the armed forces above controversy
because the president is a BNP member.
</P>
<P>
But the demand has been rejected by the president, saying that
the power is placed under him in accordance with the
constitutional amendment. "There is nothing wrong in it and nobody
should confuse public mind about it," he argued.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson and ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia has
been critical of the caretaker government for arresting BNP
activists and lodging false cases against them in the drive to
recover illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
Questioning neutrality of the caretaker government, the BNP
chief warned of withdrawing her party's cooperation with the
government "if it failed to act impartially."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Jatiya (National) Party (JP), one of the
former largest opposition parties, has demanded to release
incarcerated party chairman H.M. Ershad before the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Elections will not be free and fair if the JP chairman remained
behind the bars, JP leaders said, adding that Ershad must enjoy
the rights like other party chiefs to join the election campaign
as a free citizen.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the diverse demands from the rival parties have not
only posed a challenge to the neutrality of the caretaker
government, but also set difficult questions to the holding of the
coming polls.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation over the radio and television,
Chief Adviser Mohammad Habibur Rahman of the caretaker government
pledged to create a congenial atmosphere and take proper
administrative steps to discharge the responsibilities bestowed on
the caretaker government by the Constitution to hold free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue our efforts to consolidate and strengthen
our efforts in this regard" and "we will be able to accomplish the
duties vested on us successfully" if the cooperation from all
quarters concerned continues, he said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Probes Alleged Drug Trafficker Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian authorities said
today they are investigating the bank accounts across the country
to the name of the alleged Colombian drug trafficker Jorge
Castrillon Henao, who is now under custody.
</P>
<P>
The drug lord, allegedly heir to the businesses of the jailed
chiefs of the Colombian Cali drug cartel, has more than half a
dozen bank accounts of million dollars in Panamanian banks and
bogus enterprises in Colombia, said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Castrillon had a crime network in Panama and owns 11 deluxe
departments in the Central American country in addition to 62 real
estate properties in Colombia, official reports said.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian authorities have recently detected at least 2.5
million dollars registered to the name of Castrillon in Panamanian
banks, said a source close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is now going on, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian General Prosecutor's office is also probing
possible connection between the Castrillon's case and the
bankruptcy of the Agro-Industrial and Commercial Bank of Panama
(Banaico), added the source.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Panama William Hughes praised the Panamanian
government for the move.
</P>
<P>
He said law enforcement agencies in several countries were
closely watching the case.
</P>
<P>
"We believe he has been involved in the transportation of
thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States through Panama,"
said the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Castrillon was detained March 18 in Panama with the help of
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Colombia, and the United States and
is now jailed in the "Modelo" high-security prison.

Presidency, said the detained Cali cartel chief had been operating
in Panama since 1985, using two banks for his transactions and had
six safe houses.
</P>
<P>
Castro said there might be some reaction from the Cali cartel,
but stressed that "this is not the moment to live with fear from
possible threats."
</P>
<P>
The United States, which had been involved in the manhunt of
Castrillon, is not asking for the extradition of the man, who,
therefore will stand trial in Panama, Castro said.

<HEADLINE> Fund Shortage Haunts International Jute Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Fund shortage has been haunting the
International Jute Organization (IJO) over the past few years,
which has stalled some of the approved projects.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 3-day 24th session of the Dhaka-based
International Jute Council (IJC) Saturday, IJO Executive Director
K.M. Rabbani voiced concern at the fund shortage, saying that the
IJO Secretariat was searching unconventional sources for fund.
</P>
<P>
Even the non-governmental agencies have been approached, but
largely in vain, he said, urging the IJC to consider how better
IJO could attract more members into its fold and how its funding
crisis could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the withdrawal of the United States from
the IJO two years ago came as a major blow to the organization's
financial strength. This year, Australia, another major importing
member of the IJO, also quit.

CARACAS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is ready to give
Venezuela the biggest support possible to back its economic
recovery, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in Washington
today.
</P>

The aid will come after Venezuela reaches an agreement with the

The World Bank support will be aimed at reforms in the
financial sector and payment of social programs.

Wolfensohn will meet in Washington Sunday with Venezuelan
Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar, who is in the
U.S. capital to brief the bank on the economic measures announced
Monday by the Venezuelan government. He is also trying to speed
up the negotiations with the IMF.
</P>

The Venezuelan minister said that in addition to an agreement
with the IMF, he also expects to sign an accord with the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank before returning to
Caracas next week.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan financial sources estimate that the loans of each of
these institutions could be up to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Campus Drug Arrests Up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A new survey shows drug
arrests rose in 1994 on American college campuses.
</P>
<P>
Results released on Sunday by The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported 6,138 drug violations, an increase of 23 percent over
1993. This follows increases of 34 percent in 1993 and 46 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Drug arrests are up partly because more private colleges are
gaining arresting authority for their campus law enforcement
officers, said Douglas F. Tuttle, public safety director of the
University of Delaware and president of the International
Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
</P>
<P>
In addition, increased awareness about drug and alcohol abuse
has led to more tips to campus police departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle's annual survey is based on campus crime reports
from 831 colleges with more than 5,000 students.
</P>
<P>
The campus survey also reported varied increases in murders,
forcible sex offenses, robberies, liquor-related offenses and
decreases in aggravated assaults, burglaries and auto thefts.

The team, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William
Twaddell, will include representatives from the State Department,

back on track," the statement said.

<P>
The United States has also agreed to commit an additional 30
million U.S. dollars in equipment and training support to the West
African peace-keeping forces in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as a truce that began Friday continued
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from Liberia since
fighting broke out two weeks ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He'll Sign Anti-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday that he will sign a Congress anti-terrorism bill
early next week although he said that important parts of the
measure were "left on the cutting room floor."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his weekly radio address broadcast from Russia
where he is visiting, said he was disappointed that Congress
dropped provisions that would have made it easier for authorities
to wiretap all phones used by suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He also said police should have more leeway to investigate and
prosecute terrorists who use machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and
explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, said the bill still makes important progress.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed the Congress Thursday, will allow
deportation of alien terrorists without disclosing classified
evidence against them, prevent fund raising in the United States
for terrorists, and require chemical taggants in plastic
explosives so they can be traced.
</P>
<P>
"It may not go as far as I would like," Clinton said, "but it
does strike a real blow against terrorism, and I will be happy to
sign it."

<HEADLINE> Efforts Pay off in Costa Rica's Anti-Poverty Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica said that efforts
had paid off in the nation's war against poverty after investing 32
billion colones (about 11 million U.S. dollars) in social programs
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
During the same period under survey, 72,000 jobs were created,
the real income of the most needy families increased 2.2 percent,
and 3,400 school cafeterias were built, said the Presidential
House in a report published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The document, titled "National Plan To Combat Poverty," was
presented at a ceremony attended by President Jose Maria Figueres
and Second Vice-president Rebeca Grynspan.
</P>
<P>
The document states that more than 74,000 housing units were
erected for poor persons, more than 5,500 housewives received
training, and 442 million colones (some 151.94 dollars) in credits
were granted to small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
President Figueres said he "is satisfied with what has been
achieved" so far in the nation's anti-poverty drive, but added
that the task is just half of what needs to be done.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The American boxers have set
for seven medals at the Olympic Games in Atlanta as its 12-member
squad was finalized after the box-offs concluded in Georgia on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Among the qualifiers was light heavyweight world champion
Antonio Tarver.
</P>
<P>
Together with Tarver, ten of 12 champions in the trials early
this month qualify for Atlanta after winning their first-round
matches this week.
</P>
<P>
However, trials champion Lawrence Clay-Bey, 30, had to go
through the box-offs before winning his spot in the super
heavyweight division, the same with light flyweight Alberto
Guardado.
</P>
<P>
Clay-Bey lost to Joseph Mesi in the first round but rallied
back in the box-off by beating Mesi in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Guardado, 21, also qualified from the box-offs with two wins
against Jauquin Gallardo.
</P>
<P>
Though the world champion Cubans are tipped to dominate the
gold medal haul, the hosts may likely bag home some silver and
bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the United
States won only one gold, one silver and one bronze.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Encouraged to Invest in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises are being
encouraged to invest in the agricultural sector in order to boost
productivity, according to the State Economic and Trade Commission
(SETC).
</P>
<P>
The commission is co-operating with the Ministry of Agriculture
and other departments to formulate financing, banking, marketing
and foreign trade policies in the sector, said SETC Vice-Minister
Yu Xiaosong.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the commission will select enterprises in several local
areas to serve as the bearers of syndicated bank loans flowing to
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The fiancing scheme partly reflects demands from the country's
banking, manufacturing and commercial circles for accountability
for the loans and protection of their business interests.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that enterprises who borrow agriculture-earmarked
loans from foreign and Chinese banks would be responsible for
their repayment and are thus more likely to strive to introduce
the latest manufacturing technology and managerial know-how into
their rural businesses.
</P>
<P>
To help support the scheme, land administration departments are
expected to favor such enterprises when granting land-use rights
and the State will favor them in granting export licenses.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging enterprises to develop business portfolios in
agriculture is expected to help millions of rural small-parcel
farming households gain broader access to the market.
</P>
<P>
At least 90 percent of current foreign and Chinese investment
in agriculture is in government loans and low-interest bank
credits thought Chinese administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year the Agricultural Bank of China
saw its agriculture-earmarked outstanding loans reach 157.8
billion yuan (19 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The one-year-old Agricultural Development Bank of China, the
government's policy-oriented banking body for rural economic
development, saw outstanding loans of 478.3 billion yuan (78
billion U.S. dollars) by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
China has used more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
investment for agricultural development since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that China needs a total
of 130 billion yuan (15.7 billion U.S. dollars) to 180 billion
yuan (21.7 billion U.S. dollars) in investment to increase annual
grain output by 50 million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Obstacles to increased output include decentralized management,
small production scale, low productivity, out-of-date methods and
slow growth in farmers' income.

<HEADLINE> Industry to Boost Farm Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is fully
aware of the slower growth in agriculture compared with the
industry sector, said Yu Xiaosong with the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The ratio of agricultural output growth to industrial output
growth has fallen from 1 to 1.3 in 1984 to 1 to 5 at present, Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
Tight control of financing by some local government is
hampering the development of agricultural processing, storage,
transport, marketing and managerial know-how.

<P>
New policies to encourage agricultural industrialization will
not only benefit farmers but also tap the idle production capacity
of Chinese enterprises, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
At least one-third of the productive capacity in the country's
automobile, refrigerator, television and machine-building
industries is laying idle.
</P>
<P>
The excessive productive capacity, along with valuable legions
of technicians, could be of great use in developing the rural
conglomerate businesses, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will strongly support the combination of
agriculture, industry and commerce, which will give an impetus to
developing the country's rural market, technical study,
information, finance, insurance, transportation, storage as well
as retailing businesses."
</P>
<P>
Yu said there is a string of profitable agricultural sectors
awaiting development, such as "green" food -- produced without
chemical fertilizers or pesticides, bio-farming, seed processing,
animal feed production and fish breeding and deep-processing.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Laws Constrict Tobacco Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Municipal efforts to ban smoking
in public sites are choking off cigarette consumption, leading the
State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (STMB) to slash planned output to
1,712.5 billion cigarettes this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai initiated a public-smoking ban at the beginning of
last year; since then, 26 cities have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
STMB has called on the enterprises under its umbrella to bring
down production costs by stressing quality and management
efficiency, said a spokesperson with STMB.
</P>
<P>
Price rises in raw materials like tobacco and paper over the
last several years have already forced the industry to adopt
leaner production. The amount of tobacco needed to produce 50,000
cigarettes have fallen from 60 kilograms in the 1980s to 45.2
kilograms today.
</P>
<P>
Several tobacco planting bases have been remodeled and upgraded
by introducing fine breeds, raising the proportion of high-grade
tobacco to 20 percent of total output, up from three percent a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Total output of the cigarette industry last year was 34.72
million 50,000 cigarette cases, up 6.5 percent from 1990, whereas
pre-tax sales rose to 71 billion yuan (8.5 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1995, almost triple the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have also developed a series of low-tar
cigarettes which have improved sales in the past couple of
years. Output of filter-tip cigarettes accounts for 87 percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The industry also took big steps to merge many small
loss-making enterprises to achieve economies of scale and return
them to the black. Almost 50,000 workers displaced in the process
have been re-deployed to non-cigarette business.
</P>
<P>
STMB has also teamed with related State law enforcement
institutions to crack down on smuggled cigarette imports.
</P>
<P>
Although the import tax levied on foreign cigarettes has been
cut from the former 430 percent to the current 260 percent,
smuggling remains rampant.
</P>
<P>
A recent STMB circular prohibits auctioning of confiscated
smuggled cigarettes by anyone but the 11 State-franchised tobacco
monopoly auctioneers without STMB approval. Seized cigarettes can
only be auctioned to and sold by licensed retailers and must bear
"confiscated smuggled cigarettes" labels.
</P>
<P>
Though State-run auction houses handled 220,000 boxes of
smuggled cigarettes last year, confiscated cigarettes nevertheless
flew to the domestic market through illegal channels.

<HEADLINE> Consultants Flock to Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 overseas-based
consultancies have opened offices in Beijing to serve clients in
industries from consumer goods, infrastructure and energy
construction to financial services and public administration.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, our business focus on both foreign
multinational companies and Chinese firms will be two sides of a
coin," said Rick Yan, vice-president of Bain Co Inc, which has
been helping foreign businesses invest a combined 500 million
U.S. dollars in China since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The company also aims to help domestic companies become viable
and more competitive in international markets through advanced
business strategies.
</P>
<P>
It is currently discussing consulting work with some
State-owned enterprises in Liaoning Province on issues from cost
reduction and technical renovation to sales expansion and
globalization through effective management.
</P>
<P>
But some domestic firm managers argue the consultancies need to
cite genuine examples of successes in turning lumbering
State-owned firms into modern, efficient organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need lip service. We want reliable efforts and
follow-up work by think tanks familiar with Chinese business,"
said one director of a State-owned enterprise in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
Often, negotiations with the consulting companies hinge on
whether the consultancies will help raise capital for the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
There are success tories. One Munich-based international
management consulting company has helped an administrative
institution in Shanghai turn into a holding company by redesigning
its internal organizations and working out its stock distribution.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the reform is to let the newly-launched holding
enterprise know that it will no longer be backed by the
government," said an executive consultant with the company.

<HEADLINE> Subsidy Repeal Not Leading To Big Savings Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Most people in China have calmly
accepted the suspension of interest rate subsidies on new
long-term deposits, which took place on April 1, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an official with the Beijing branch of the Bank of
China as saying "We heard no complaints. I think people have got
used to the government's financial measures taken with the change
of the country's economic situation."
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan and Shanxi provincial branches of the
People's Bank of China reported that many depositors have
expressed intention to shift their new fixed deposits to one-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies on deposits with a term of three or more years were
inaugurated in 1988 to counteract erosion of bank savings' real
interest rate, says the report.
</P>
<P>
It was suspended in 1991, drawing complaints of many
depositors, and resumed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
said the latest suspension was undertaken because the country has
been highly successful in curbing inflation through macroeconomic
control.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted a structural modification of bank
savings after the subsidies' suspension as investors move their
long-term savings into short-term deposits.
</P>
<P>
But they said the suspension will not hamper "society's
enthusiasm for savings." In addition, limited investment options
are a barrier to widespread withdrawal of savings.
</P>
<P>
Many people feel they have no choice but bank their savings
after losing money to a bearish stock market over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the subsidies on April 1 was followed by the
issuance of the year's fourth batch of certificate treasury bonds
on the next day, reminding people of another investment channel.
</P>
<P>
But the amount of treasury bonds issued every year is equal to
only about 20 percent of the bank savings.
</P>
<P>
Last year, treasury bonds worth 150 billion yuan were issued
while new deposits in the country totalled 812.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of February, total individual savings stood at
3,200 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> HK Sales to Russia Picking Up: HKTDC Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong sales to Russian
consumers are picking up this year, which reflects a strengthening
economy driven by commodity exports together with a rebound in
investment in the country, according to a new research report
released by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
Good growth in Russia's energy and processed raw materials
sectors -- which combined account for over two-thirds of the
country's exports -- is anticipated, as well as the return of
investment capital attracted by the more stable economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
These factors should contribute to gross domestic product which
is expected to rise by three percent in 1996 compared with an
estimated contraction of 2.6 percent last year and a 14.9 percent
drop in 1994, according to the TDC's "Market Report on Russia --
1996 Edition".
</P>
<P>
Russia's growing service sector, which contributes some 52
percent to the GDP, is driving the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of market reforms in 1992, some 120,000
state enterprises have been privatized, while another 6,000 have
been transformed into joint-stock companies, with ownership
jointly held by the government, management and employees.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated by some analysts that around half of the market
share of food and consumer products in Russia is captured by
imports which have now been liberalized.

<HEADLINE> Interbank Lending Turnover Down 47 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An oversupply of money led to a
downturn in activity at Shanghai's interbank lending market,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Turnover at the Shanghai Short-term Lending Center plummeted 47
percent from February to 8.63 billion yuan in March, a drop of 55
percent compared to the year previous. The center loaned 4.29
billion yuan and took in 4.34 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted center analysts as saying the abundant money
supply was partly due to an increase in deposits at local
financial institutions, as local residents began putting money
back into their bank accounts after the Spring Festival holiday
season ended in February.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has allocated funds for local financial
service organizations to redeem the record amounts of State
treasury bills that began maturing in March. Meanwhile, money
raised from some new government bond issues have not yet been
turned in to the central government, analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
Demand for funds also has abated because domestic financial
organizations now have more options for borrowing short-term
capital since the country's new unified interbank borrowing
market, based in Shanghai, linked up with its primary dealers in
19 banks and 35 regional credit brokerages last month.
</P>
<P>
In response to the oversupply, the center has brought down its
rates in line with the quotations on the national
market. Officials from the center said a further rate cut is
anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Strategic Approach Urged in Developing Sino-Africa Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar has called for
a strategic approach in the development of Sino-Africa ties under
the current international situation.
</P>
<P>
Africa has emerged from a 'lost decade' into a decade of hope,
commented the scholar.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tan Shizhong said 21st-century-oriented policies
towards Africa should be formulated in order to forge the new-type
friendly and cooperative relations with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tan, deputy director of the Institute of West Asian
and African Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Tan noted that the future Sino-Africa ties should be based on
the Five-Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and in line with the
principle of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the purpose of such relations is to achieve
common development.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Sino-Africa ties should enjoy long-term
and steady growth when a multi-level and all-round diplomatic
pattern involving political, economic, cultural and other fields
is gradually formed.
</P>
<P>
Tan, who specializes in research on African affairs, said that
influences posed on African nations by the changes in the
international structure after the Cold War has now been apt to be
weakened.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of the new South Africa, and the cooling
down of some regional hot-spot issues, he said, Africa's economy
has begun stepping out of the all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that average economic growth rate of the
African nations registered 3 percent last year and this growth
rate is expected to reach an even higher mark this year.
</P>
<P>
If the 1980s was a "lost decade" for Africa, Tan said, the
1990s can be described as a "hopeful decade."
</P>
<P>
There exists traditional friendly relations between China and
Africa and such ties were nurtured by the leaders of older
generation of both China and the african nations, he said, adding
that the Chinese and African peoples once suffered the same
misfortunes in the past and have forged profound friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-African ties facing the 21th century should be those
of equality, mutual understanding and support, as well as
cooperation, and such ties should be based on the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tan held that, under the new international situation, the focus
of China's African policy should be moved gradually from the
political aspect to economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
By expanding the economic and trade ties with the many African
countries, an economy-centered, multi-form and multi-level
diplomatic pattern should be gradually formed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the role of non-governmental diplomacy should be
given full play as a promoter of official relations.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental exchanges in academic, culture, sports,
arts and all areas should be further increased, Tan explained. In
particular, he added, China should encourage its enterprises,
especially the medium-sized and small enterprises to expand
business and markets in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the scholar also called for the strengthening of
study on African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Through all these practices, the traditional friendship between
China and Africa can be consolidated, and China-Africa friendly
relations can enjoy long-term and steady development, Tan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is to set up a special law
enforcement force to crack down on polluters who do damages to the
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period, China
passed 14 environmental laws, 20 administrative rules on
environmental protection, and over 350 environmental standards in
line with international practice.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the National Environmental Protection
Agency, the major problems lie not in lack of laws, but in weak
enforcement. Therefore, there must be a special environmental law
enforcement force, they said.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement in the coming five years will be focused on the
Yangtze, Yellow, Liaohe, Haihe rivers and Taihu, Caohu and Dianchi
lakes as well as areas where acid rain is severe, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According the State Council's plan, the treatment rate of
industrial waste water at county level or above will reach 83
percent by the year 2000, treatment rate of waste gas will reach
86 percent, the comprehensive utilization rate of solid waste will
reach 50 percent, the concentrated treatment rate of urban sewage
will reach 25 percent, urban tree coverage will reach 27 percent,
the detoxifying treatment rate of garbage will reach 50 percent,

<P>
XINING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Flower power has added an unusual
splash of color to Northwest China's Qinghai Province on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Local dwellers seldom see flowers because of the plateau's cold
climate. But the area has started exporting tulip bulbs and bulb
flower products.
</P>
<P>
The gardening departments in Xining, the province's capital
started experimenting with the cultivation of tulips and lilies in
the early 1990's. And the researchers successfully solved the
problem of cold storage of bulbs.
</P>
<P>
The tulip flowers of about 20 varieties are well-reputed for
their handsome shapes and bright colors. The blossoming rate of
the bulbs has remained above 95 percent, much higher than
imported ones.
</P>
<P>
The province's fresh-cut flowers have been exported to
Southeast Asian nations, creating a record-high bid price among
similar products in the coastal provinces.

<P>
Delhi Police Commissioner Nikhil Kumar, who was personally
supervising the rescue operation, said that the death toll was
likely to go up. The narrow and congested bylanes of the guest
house hampered the rescue work for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
The police have not identified the cause of explosion and they
would not say whether it was the handiwork of militants. Most of
the 25 rooms of the guest house were rented by Kashmiris,
according to agitated residents.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Bitumen Consumption Reduced by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The consumption of bitumen in
Bangladesh has been reduced by 50 percent due to the slow-down of
development of roads and highways following the recent political
turmoil, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the sole public
sector distribution authority, said that the total consumption
during the current dry season could not exceed 120,000 tons, half
of its original estimation.
</P>
<P>
The BPC attributed the low consumption of bitumen to the
continuous political unrest, which seriously affected the
development of roads and highways from December to April in the
dry season.
</P>
<P>
The BPC has slowed down the planned import of 130,000 tons of
bitumen from Iran, the biggest supplier of bitumen to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eastern Refinery Limited, the lone manufacturer
of bitumen in the country, is going to shut down for the next one
and a half months. It produces about 7,000 tons of bitumen per
month.

<HEADLINE> Clean-up of Himalayan Peaks Discussed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government began to
identify ways to clean up the increasing garbage in the country's
Himalayan region left by mountaineers as more climbing teams are
allowed into the region.
</P>
<P>
A one-day workshop on Himalayan clean-up recently organized by
the Ministry of Tourism collected suggestions on how to remove the
mountain trash above the base camp areas and make mountaineering
teams leave less littering there.
</P>
<P>
Preparation of a profile on the Himalayas was also on the
agenda of the workshop where government officials and
representatives of various institutions in the mountaineering
field including the Nepal Mountaineering Association discussed
what kinds of information need to be included in the profile, the
categorization of mountain peaks and the formation of a task force
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism Chakra Prasad Bastola said at the workshop
that Nepal was rich in world famous mounts and mountaineers and
the country should work to stem the deterioration of the Himalayan
environment caused by lack of appropriate management.
</P>
<P>
Officials revealed that as the previous 'one team one route'
policy had been canceled, more mountaineering teams were expected
to attempt to climb the same peaks during one season. Thus more
waste could be left in the mountaineering region.
</P>
<P>
Eleven mountaineering teams had been permitted to clime the
world tallest mount this summer, they said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Asks US to Exert Influence on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia has
asked the United States to use its influence in the United Nations
to impose economic and military sanctions against the Kabul
regime, reports from Kandahar, Afghanistan said here today.
</P>
<P>
The idea was stated by Taliban's spokesman Amir Muttaqi who met
Robin Raphel, US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian
Affairs who visited Kandahar Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi also put the step-down of Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani as the pre-condition for intra-Afghan peace dialogue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamabad Accord signed by Afghan factions in
March 1993, Rabbani's tenure of office should have expired on June
28, 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is international pressure and an end to foreign
assistance to the Kabul regime, Rabbani will not relinquish
power," Muttaqi added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Raphel persuaded the Taliban to participate
in a proposed intra-Afghan peace moot in the Afghan eastern city
of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
However, Muttaqi said, "Rabbani is not sincere and such
meetings in the past bore no fruits."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also turned down a request forwarded by Raphel on
behalf of US President Bill Clinton to release the seven-member
Russian crew of a cargo-plane force-landed in Kandahar on August
5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Taliban said that the plane was transporting
a large number of weapons to Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
Raphel said that the crew members were not prisoners of war and
should be set free on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
But Muttaqi said, "they are prisoners of the Afghan nation and
only they can decide about their fate."
</P>
<P>
He also drew Raphel's attention to the sixty-thousand missing
Afghans in the ten-year Russian invasion in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Taliban leaders, Raphel had held talks with
Rabbani and his military strongman Ahmed Shah Masood in Kabul
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Chefs Used Plums for Seasoning 4,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Wise Chinese chefs are thought to
have found the right recipe for cooking condiments thousands of
years ago. In the days before vinegar was produced they had
resorted to plums as a natural cooking aid, experts believe.
</P>
<P>
The clue comes from a plum stone at the Nanjing Museum in the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province which has been dated as
at least 4,000 years old, the earliest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
As the stone was discovered together with cooking utensils and
tableware, the plum is thought to have been used as a condiment,
according to Deputy Curator Xu of the museum.
</P>
<P>
There was no vinegar in the ancient times, and plums were used
in cooking meat, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stone, originally unearthed in Wujiang City, Jiangsu
Province, is 1.65 cm long, 1.1 cm wide, 1.15 cm thick and weighs
1.4424 g.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Sino-Russian Border, A Peaceful, Tranquil Tie (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Russian border, which
for a period of time separated the friendly contacts between the
people of the two countries, has now become a peaceful and
tranquil bond featuring good neighborhoodly relations and
friendship.
</P>
<P>
People of both countries along the border, now living in a
relaxed mood while conducting normal, orderly exchanges between
them, have every reason to believe it as "a tie linking the two
peoples, a bridge of cooperation and a window mirroring the
friendly relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchanges of visits and cooperation across the border
constitutes a major component part of Sino-Russian good-neighborly
relations and the daily-growing bilateral relations, coupled with
the strict and standardized border administration and the
cooperative mechanism for consultations on an equal footing are
among the main reasons for the peaceful and tranquil environment
prevailing along the border, according to an official responsible
with the border management authorities.
</P>
<P>
The 4,300 km-long Sino-Russian border is divided into two
sections: the eastern section that adjoins Northeast China's
Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces and the Inner-Mongolia Autonomous
Region on the Chinese side, and the Western Section bordering on
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Overwhelming parts of
the border lines have been delimited following the conclusion of
the border agreements on the Eastern and Western Sections signed
between the two countries in May 1991 and September 1994
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the border agreements and the signing of the
border management agreement have laid down not only a solid base
for developing neighborly, friendly relations but a legal
guarantee for the two countries to abide by. The two governments
have done all these, proceeding from the fundamental and long-term
interests of the two peoples, a relevant source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The exchanges between army leaders and border management
officers of both countries for increasing mutual understanding
have helped create a good atmosphere for establishment of the
peaceful and tranquil border and played a great role in promoting
the bilateral relations between the two countries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission Liu Huaqing paid a successful visit to Russia, and
Russia Defense Minister Grachev also visited China.
</P>
<P>
An important guarantee for the establishment of a healthy and
orderly border of cooperation lies in an increase in the exchanges
by border residents. The Chinese government and relevant
departments responsible for border administration have taken a
series of measures for implementing the agreement on border
management system, including educating local residents in border
regions to conscientiously maintaining border stability and
tranquility through introduction of the joint responsibility
system that involves both stationed frontier armymen and local
residents.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts have resulted in a steady reduction in the
number of conflicts or other accidents that might produce a
negative impact on the feelings of the two peoples. In case a few
occasional accidents occur, they can be properly handled through
consultations in the spirit of mutual understanding and
accommodation, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The growing cooperation between border management departments
of the two countries is another important reason for maintaining
the peaceful and tranquil border environment and is a concrete
manifestation of the environment as well. There have been more
direct contacts and frequent exchanges of visits by border armymen
and officers. These exchanges include those personnel from the
military commands of China's Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and
the Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region and from the Pacific,
Far-East and Baikal military commands of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Improved contacting and working systems between the border
defense forces' meeting and conferring units of both countries
have been founded. Since 1990, there have been almost 1,000 rounds
of negotiations involving some 5,000 meeting sessions at dozens of
border stations on both sides, thus prompting resolving a great
number of disputes, increasing mutual trust and further improving
the peaceful and tranquil environment.
</P>
<P>
Observers held the signing of the agreement on the build-up of
confidence in the military field in border areas by leaders of
China, Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrghyz and Tajikistan in Shanghai this
week would further consolidate and develop the new-type
Sino-Russia border relations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Gives up Lawsuit against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has given up a lawsuit
against the United States in the International Court of Justice in
The Hague for covert-operation to destabilize the Islamic regime,
according to a high-ranking Iranian official here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Judicial Chief Mohammad Yazdi said at a press
conference, "We have not filed a lawsuit against the United
States for allocating such budget."
</P>
<P>
While answering the question posed by Xinhua, Yazdi said,
"There are many cases between Iran and the United States, mostly
financial cases in the Hague international tribunal."
</P>
<P>
However, he explained, it is a new thing for Iran to file a
lawsuit against the United States for allocation of special
budget against his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the reason for abandoning the attempt for
lodging the lawsuit, he said "if we want to file a case against
the United States for this matter, we have to have a judge
familiar with international law on the issue."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have not taken any judicial action yet, up to
now."
</P>
<P>
But, he noted the covert-action by the United States against
the Islamic Republic is a violation of international law and a
state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal in accordance with the international law," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Of course, he went on, some political steps have been taken by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati declared in February
 that Iran will file a lawsuit against the United States and was
preparing it.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "The legal preparations for this is underway. At
the moment the legal department of the Foreign Ministry is busy
evaluating the lawsuit."
</P>
<P>
Iran's hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
announced earlier that Iran had earmarked a special fund for the
lawsuit against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Parliament has already endorsed a 20-million-dollar
budget as a tit-for-tat measure to fight back the United States.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said earlier at a press conference, "The budget
endorsed by the Iranian Parliament is to neutralize the plots and
conspiracies by the U.S., CIA and other organizations which are
related to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
He claimed "Iran is not interested in the resumption of ties
with the United States. But we are not interested in adding to
the tension either."
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that the blame for these tensions rests with
the Americans who make the provocations. Iran is not responsible
for the tension, nor for its intensification.
</P>
<P>
But as for the U.S. threat against Iran, he added, "we have to
say that the U.S. is not a threat to our revolution because the
revolution is much more serious to get harmed by such threats."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, "these threats do put pressure on the
country. Of course, this is not a one-way issue."
</P>
<P>
He said that after the success of the Islamic revolution,
Iran, too, has put a lot of pressure on the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spends its efforts against Iran and Iran, too, acts
in self-defense. They think that if Iran becomes successful in
its ideals, it will serve as a model to the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In effect, he said, they consider Iran a potential threat to
their illegal interests. Of course the Americans should change
their views so that they can have more realistic policies.

<HEADLINE> China's Deposits Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's individual deposits has
surged to 3.3296 trillion yuan, according to statistics released
by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, here today.
</P>
<P>
The deposits jumped by 358.93 billion yuan in the first quarter
of this year, 136.1 billion yuan more than the increase over the
same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents contributed 293.1 billion yuan to the total sum
of the new deposits, to which rural residents added 65.82 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that 94.6 percent of the new deposits are
at fixed terms, indicating that social public has a more stable
and balanced mind to face up the prospects of the possible price
rises.
</P>
<P>
China's banks suspended the practice of subsiding deposits at
over three-year term on April 1. In March the retail price index
rose by 7.7 percent, somewhat lower than at the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> China's Banks Issue More Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's state banks extended
loans totalling 87.72 billion yuan in the first three months of
this year, 42.8 billion more than during the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The increase is much more impressive as compared with the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Of the loans issued in the first quarter, 71.36 billion yuan
was arranged as working capital, 10.41 billion yuan for fixed
asset investment, suggest statistics released by the People's Bank
of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Of the working capital, 5.82 billion benefited the agricultural
sector, and 32.49 billion was set aside for the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic rise in the amount of loans has fueled moderate
economic growth by financing agricultural projects and ensuring
the smooth construction of key state projects.
</P>
<P>
The piling stocks, however, have led to slow circulation of
currency and fund dearth in enterprises, pressuring on the banks
to issue more loans.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Moscow's Nuclear Summit and Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Just eight weeks before the June
presidential elections in Russia, the leaders of seven leading
western countries gathered at the weekend in Moscow for a summit
to tackle nuclear security issues and gave, by this move, a boost
to President Boris Yeltsin in his struggle to keep power.
</P>
<P>
As a result of their one-day summit meeting held in the Kremlin
on Saturday, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations (or G-7) -- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan
and the United States -- and Russian leader Yeltsin adopted a
package of documents outlining their policies on the nuclear
security and safety.
</P>
<P>
The documents include a declaration, a program for preventing
and combatting illegal trafficking of nuclear materials, a
statement on comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and a statement
on supporting Ukraine in shutting down the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant, where occured the world's worst nuclear accident ten years
ago.
</P>
<P>
All these documents were designed to further nuclear
disarmament, consolidate nuclear safety, counter illegal
trafficking of nuclear materials and stop the production and
testing of new-type nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the summit, French President Jacques Chirac, who,
jointly with Yeltsin, chaired the meeting, described its results
as "extremely positive."
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to take an important step towards better
security for the world of tomorrow," he said at a news conference
following the meeting, noting that the nature of the discussions
and the documents signed mean "partnership between the three great
political forces -- the United States, Europe and Russia -- has
risen to a new level."
</P>
<P>
Sharing the same opinion, other G-7 leaders also offered a
further support to ongoing reforms in Russia, referring to
support for Yeltsin in his efforts to run for a second term of
office in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the results of the summit, Yeltsin told the same
news conference that "we were conducting our discussions as
friends."
</P>
<P>
Choice of Moscow as venue for such a meeting means "the status
of Russia as a great power has been recognized," Yeltsin pointed
out, noting that the meeting was the first "G-8", or Group of
Seven plus Russia, summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin wants Russia to be accepted fully into the group of
industrialized powers as a great power. But some members of the
G-7 hold that the real time has not come. The issue is expected to
be discussed at the next summit this summer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some differences still remain between the G-7 and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Prior to setting the summit agenda, for example, the G-7 sought
firm commitments from Russia that it would provide more
information about its nuclear inventories including military
ones. Russia only informed during the meeting about its nuclear
reactors of civil use, but refused to talk about its nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the break-up of the Soviet Union, the west's
concern has risen sharply over nuclear security in its former
constituent republics. The west is worried about Russia's lack of
technologies and effective methods to comply with uranium removed
from the dismantled nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and
to keep nuclear materials far from thefting.
</P>
<P>
Russia, however, used the Moscow summit as a platform to
demonstrate that it has not lost control of its nuclear weapons
and it had overcome safety deficiencies which led to the accident
at Chernobyl located in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"In the past four years, a big step forward has been made (by
Russia) in ensuring safety at nuclear power plants and putting
nuclear facilities in order," Yeltsin declared.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated here, his press service called the
summit "a unique event." It outlined three reasons for the
uniqueness: firstly, heads of the G-7 and Russia gathered to
discuss a key issue of global security; secondly, it was the first
extraordinary meeting of the G-7 and Russia; thirdly, the meeting
was held on Russia's soil for the first time.
</P>
<P>
It was decided by the leaders of G-7 and Russia to hold a
summit on nuclear security in Moscow at a meeting in Halifax last
fall.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made amid growing concern in the west about
the security of nuclear inventories in the former Soviet Union,
and, particularly, in anticipation of both the 10th anniversary of
the Chernobyl accident and the presidential elections in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we are hoping Yeltsin will benefit in his role as
statesman. We all want reforms to continue in Russia and we
believe Yeltsin is the best chance for that," a western diplomat,
who joined the preparations for the summit, said, adding that he
believes the meeting provided a boost to Yeltsin's image.

<HEADLINE> China Has Record of Foreign Exchange Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's
fourth largest nation in term of foreign exchange reserves,
according to official sources available.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve surged by 7.24 billion
US dollars from the beginning of this year to 80.83 billion US
dollars at the end of March, show statistics released by the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
This is attributable mainly to the fact that more foreign funds
have flown into China and some of last year's foreign trade was
cleared in the first quarter of this year, the central bank's
analysts explained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, non-trade income continued rising and the central
bank has bought more foreign exchanges than it sold out, they said.
</P>
<P>
The huge foreign exchange reserve has led to stable exchange
rates of Renminbi yuan against major foreign currencies. At the
end of March, one US dollar fetches 8.33 Renminbi yuan, almost the
same as that at the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardliners Defeat Liberals in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hardliners backed by
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has definitely won landslide victory
in the crucial parliament elections, according to latest run-off
results published here today.
</P>
<P>
Liberals supported by moderate President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani were defeated since they could have the possibility of
winning seven of 30 seats in Iran's capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the incomplete results of
various regions show that the right wing headed by hardliner
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri could have won 140-150
of 270-seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the analysts said that Iran would adopt much strong
hardline policy toward the West headed by the United States and
the economic reform and free economic policy by Rafsanjani
administration would face severe challenge.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the open rivalry is over, but the power
struggle behind the door would be getting even more intensified in
the political arena of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
According to late evening results, 22 hopefuls of the
conservative camp -- the Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC), six
from the moderate camp -- Group-6 are in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is a clear defeat for the
moderate camp head by the 62-year-old president for his economic
policy which lead to skyrocketing inflation and wide complain
from the people for deteriorating living standards.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the second round of the elections, Rafsanjani and
his government have come under attack for corruption, inflation,
for being anti-clerical and being soft on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had even joined in
criticism waged by hardliners against Rafsanjani. Khamenei had
indirectly attacked the moderate president for corruption twice
within a month.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani admitted that the two major factions were
in a "fierce" rivalry in the Parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the Parliament elections were held
nationwide on March 8. Only two candidates from Tehran,
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and Rafsanjani's daughter
Faezeh Hashemi secured the adequate number of votes to be elected
to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the run-off elections were held in 75
constituencies to determine the fate of 123 seats in the 270-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the election law in the initial stage of the
elections each contending candidate should obtain at least one
third of the votes cast in each constituency.
</P>
<P>
However, in the run-off elections any candidate who obtains
the relative majority will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that two major conservative factions
backed by Khamenei were expected to capture the majority of the
270 seats in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The two groups, Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) and
Association for the Defense of the Values of the Islamic
Revolution (ADVIR), were competing against the liberal modernist
faction known as Group-6 supported by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that this is the most important
parliamentary elections since the death of the architect of the
Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary elections are important because whatever
group wins in these elections, it will have a better chance in the
presidential elections of 1997," a political science professor at
Tehran University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Rafsanjani cannot run for a third
consecutive term in 1997. His nemesis, Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, is said to be SCC's candidate for the
presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests Killing of Jordanians in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Saturday lodged a strong
protest against Iraq over the killing of at least five Jordanian
nationals in Iraq over the past three weeks and recalled its
ambassador from Baghdad for consultations.
</P>
<P>
The development adds a new twist to the worsening political
relations between Jordan and Iraq in the wake of Jordan's calls
for an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people due to sanctions
imposed by the U.N. and criticism of the policies of the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Jordan News Agency, Petra, said Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti summoned the Iraqi ambassador to Jordan, Nouri Al Wayes
Al Tikriti, and asked him for an "official explanation for the
recent deaths of Jordanians in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, "expressing dismay and concern over the
criminal murders of several innocent Jordanian citizens," lodged a
"very strong protest" and demanded that the Iraqi government
ensure the safety of Jordanians living in Iraq, an unnamed
official today was quoted by the daily "Jordan Times" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, also Jordan's Foreign Minister, recalled the
Jordanian ambassador in Baghdad, Bassam Qaqish, "for
consultations," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The new message that was given to the Iraqi ambassador was
that Jordan will not, under any circumstances, accept any threat
against the safety of Jordanian nationals regardless of where
they are," said the official, adding "it is the responsibility of
the Iraqi government to ensure their safety."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qaqish is due home tomorrow (Sunday), said the
official. However, he noted the recall did not mean that the
ambassador was being withdrawn from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with Kabariti, the Iraqi ambassador told
reporters that he "conveyed to the prime minister the concern of
the Iraqi government" over the recent killings and "assured him
that Jordanians living in Iraq are treated like Iraqis."
</P>
<P>
At least five Jordanians were killed in Iraq over the past
three weeks, three of them in an accident. A sixth Jordanian was
reportedly shot dead, a local daily said.
</P>
<P>
The rash of deaths of jordanians in Iraq triggered speculation
that these could be Iraqi retribution for Jordanian criticism of
the policies of the Baghdad government.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Jordanian students and 500 plus Jordanian
businessmen and others live in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the Iraqi government had executed at
least one Jordanian student after accusing him of spying and
jailed dozens of others when Amman-Baghdad relations were at a
low ebb during the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
They also recalled that dozens of Egyptians were killed when
Cairo-Baghdad relations worsened at several points during the
1980s and 90s.

<HEADLINE> West Scales Down NATO Enlargement Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Western leaders are soft-pedaling
on plans of the eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union
in an attempt to help Boris Yeltsin win Russia's presidential
elections in June.
</P>
<P>
NATO has told countries in Central and Eastern Europe which
have long sought to join the alliance that their membership
applications are being put on ice partly in deference to bitter
Russian opposition.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that NATO has decided to admit only the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland at the end of the century. And there
will be no advance deployment of nuclear weapons or foreign troops
on the territory of any of the new member states.
</P>
<P>
Western leaders hope that this scaled-down plan for enlarging
NATO will win Yeltsin's approval and help to counter the growing
chorus of opposition in Russia to any closer security partnership
with the West.
</P>
<P>
"By showing Moscow that we intend proceeding very slowly and
very prudently with enlargement, hopefully the Russian leadership
will take a more positive stance towards a real co-operation
partnership with NATO," one western diplomat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has been bitterly criticized by nationalist and former
communist politicians in Russia for not blocking NATO's eastward
expansion plans when they were first laid down three years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the Russian president has adopted an
increasingly nationalist tone, rejecting NATO enlargement and
seeking to reforge a new confederal union linking Russia, Belarus
and other former Soviet republics.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sour: Empty City under Israeli Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOUR, LEBANON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- With electricity being cut
off, the southern Lebanese port city of Sour was in darkness
Saturday night, echoing to the roar of Israeli gunfire and
Iran-backed Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Sour, some 85 kilometers south of Beirut and only 18
kilometers away from the nearest point on the Israeli border, has
become an empty city. More than 80,000 of its 100,000 residents
have fled their homes due to Israel's continuous air raids and
bombardments on southern Lebanon since April 11.
</P>
<P>
Tension shrouds the city. Few people ventured far from home
and some journalists have draped their vehicles' roofs with large
sheets with "PRESS," in large capital letters, hoping the Israeli
helicopter gunships would not strafe them. Few shops were open and
in Elissa Hotel, only several foreign journalists were staying. In
another sea beach hotel, the windows were broken by Israeli
artillery.
</P>
<P>
This Mediterranean resort was now under tight security with
many posts on the road. When Xinhua correspondents drove passing
through a post in the outskirt of the city, two soldiers, with
automatic rifles and wearing anti-bullet vest, asked them to turn
off the headlights immediately, fearing the Israeli helicopter
gunships might attack the post.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, two soldiers of the Lebanese security
forces were killed, three others wounded when Israeli helicopter
gunships attacked a post in Mansour village, Nabatiyeh, some 60
kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israel Saturday fired artillery at almost all towns and
villages in southern Lebanon, wounding several Lebanese
civilians. The exchange of gunfire between Israel and Hezbollah,
or Party of God, was still continuing.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shelling can be heard Sunday morning near the Elissa
Hotel where Xinhua correspondents were staying.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, Israeli warships blocked the main road that
connects Beirut with the south. Traffic was disrupted most of the
day. About four cars were struck by the Israeli shells and several
people were injured, including one Lebanese security force officer.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security forces set up posts at the north-south
highway blocking the moving of vehicles for the sake of safety.
</P>
<P>
When Xinhua correspondents drove pass a post near Damour
Bridge, some 30 kilometers south of Beirut at 4:20 p.m. local time
(13:20 GMT) Saturday, more than 100 vehicles, including 30 trucks
carrying relief materials, have already been waiting there.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli warships were seen in the Mediterranean Sea,
firing artilleries sporadically.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Israeli shelling, some vehicles from the south
managed to pass through the road.
</P>
<P>
Amid Aboud, 41, said he saw one shell exploded just near the
road.
</P>
<P>
"I could feel the road was trembling," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Aboud, the father of five children, fled his home in the south
to Beirut a few days ago. More than 400,000 southerners have fled
their homes in the south.
</P>
<P>
At the post, some drivers who wanted to pass through the road
despite the Israeli shelling, quarreled with the soldiers who
devoted to their duties.
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 p.m. local time (16:30 GMT) Saturday, the road was
opened to traffic temporally.
</P>
<P>
Today is the twelfth day of the Israeli successive air raids
and bombardments on south Lebanon. More than 150 people have
been killed and 250 others have been wounded.

<P>
JINAN, Shandong Province, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda
scored their second away match victory, beating Jinan Taishan 1-0
in the second round of China's soccer league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian team, which finished third last season, proved that
they are serious contenders for this season's league title. They
enjoyed a good start of the season, beating Tianjin Samsung 3-0 in
the first round last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In today's match, the Jinan Taishan team gained an upper hand
over the visitors in the first 20 minutes. But the host team just
could not break the solid defense line of Dalian Wanda.
</P>
<P>
But the visitors, with two Swedish signings this season,
gradually took control of the midfield and pushed forward to make
most of the attacks of the match, especially in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played to a goalless first half and the sole goal
of the match came at the 80th minute as Jinan defender Li Ming
scored an own goal when he tried to block a shot.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Dalian Wanda on top of the league standings
with 6 points from two stright wins.

<HEADLINE> HK Macaques No Need for Ebola Test: Veterinarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Government veterinarians said
that there is no need to test the wild monkeys which roam freely
in parts of Hong Kong for a deadly Ebola-like virus found in
similar breeds in the Philippines, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to test the monkeys because there is no
evidence of the virus here and we do not import monkeys from the
Philippines," Hong Kong Agriculture and Fishery Department
veterinary officer Richard Rubira was quoted by the Hongkong
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong macaque is of the same breed of monkeys as that
found in the Philippines carrying the fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
In humans, the Ebola virus begins with flu-like symptoms,
followed by diarrhea and vomiting. Sufferers eventually
hemorrhage to death.
</P>
<P>
Those who have come into contact with the strain of virus
present in the monkeys have not shown any signs of sickness,
although it does kill primates.
</P>
<P>
The same virus was recently detected in two monkeys in Texas,
the United States. They were among the 100 imported from the
Philippines, which has since suspended their export.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Enhance Local Industries' Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
private industry leaders will formulate development strategies on
30 priority domestic-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
The move, according to the Board of Investments (BOI), is aimed
at enhancing the competitiveness of the identified domestic
industries through the creation of industry competitiveness
enhancement team for each industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a comprehensive strategy for the initial 10
industries will be implemented in September this year and 10
industries each for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the identification of these industries, the BOI will
have to set the criteria in the selection of these industries for
validation by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
BOI officials said that these industries which are already
exporting or on the verge of exporting are excluded as they have
been taken cared of by the Export Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Possible criteria could be those domestic industries, which
have a strong linkage with other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Another possible criterion is that the industry should have a
big economic multiplier effect.
</P>
<P>
Initially, BOI officials said, those may qualify include
packaging and fertilizer industries.

<P>
DAMASCUS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher left here this morning for Israel for talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Damascus, Christopher held talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad over the situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Christopher told reporters following the meeting that
U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked him to go to the Middle East
to urge the parties concerned to attain a ceasefire in Lebanon and
to make steps that are likely to restore calmness to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Syrian President al-Assad were good
and fruitful, and that they dealt with a collection of topics
chiefly on the great importance of securing a ceasefire in Lebanon
and reviving the 1993 Understanding Accord.
</P>
<P>
Christopher described his meeting with President al-Assad as
the "first step toward continuing this process as actively and as
effectively as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said that President al-Assad was interested in having a
ceasefire effected, adding that he would return to Damascus after
an interview with Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who arrived here Saturday afternoon for a visit to
Syria, also met with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette and
Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli at the American embassy
in Damascus. But the meeting did not include Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here think the U.S. wishes to play the key
role in effecting a ceasefire in Lebanon, without enabling France,
or the European Union or Russian to play such a role.
</P>
<P>
France had offered a plan to secure a ceasefire in Lebanon and
an initiative that was accepted by Lebanon, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this initiative, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara declared in Damascus Saturday night that "the French plan
intended to tackle the present state of affairs in Lebanon
involves several positive points worth consideration."

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks Out Again In South Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, April 21 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and 52 were wounded in a heavy fighting last night between
the militiamen loyal to Somalian warlord General Mohamed Aidid
and those of his major opponent Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
The five-hours clash began at about 10:00 p.m. last night and
lasted until about 3:00 a.m. this morning, according to citizens
living in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aloli Queybdid, the man in charge of Atto's militia forces,
said today that General Aidid's men had attacked Atto's two
strategic fronts and were met with firm resistance.
</P>
<P>
"With the lesson Aidid was given last night, he won't attack
us again," said Queybdid who spoke to reporters on the phone
after the fighting, adding that the general's militiamen had
experienced heavy losses during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Mogadishu came back to calm this morning while the
tension remains high.
</P>
<P>
It seems that General Aidid's men have retreated from their
original positions for what his supporters called "a reorganisation
of militia tactic."
</P>
<P>
There is no word yet from the government of General Aidid, but
his supporters keep vowing that Atto's men will be "erased
from the soil" of South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said if General Aidid continues this kind of fighting
without a tangible success, he will lose his reputation in his
clan and government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an was forced to a
2-2 tie by underdogs Yanbian Hyundai in the second round of
China's soccer league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The host team, which finished runners-up to Shanghai Shenhua
last season, might found the new league much tougher than the
last one as they had already suffered a 1-0 defeat to August
First team last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guo'an team took an early lead at the 29th minute as team
captain Cao Xiandong slamed home an accurate pass from Hu
Jianping.
</P>
<P>
One minute before the half time, the host team surged 2-0
ahead with a 30-meter shot from Deng Lejun which beat the Yanbian
Hyundai goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
The two-goal lead seemed enough for the host team to gain
three points and they relaxed in the second half and concentrated
only in defense.
</P>
<P>
But the Yanbian team refused to give up and led by captain Gao
Zhongxun, they launched fierce attacks at the host team's goal.
In a span of three minutes, they had as much as nine shots at the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts paid off at the 58th minute when Xuan Chunhao
narrowed the gap to 2-1 with a right-foot shot just inside the
area. Gao Zhongxun then hit in the equaliser at the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Yanbian Hyundai team had not lost to Beijing Guo'an since
1994 and today's tie was their second in the season. In last
Sunday's match, the Yanbian Hyundai forced hosts Guangdong
Hongyuan to a 1-1 tie.

<HEADLINE> Great Prospects for Sino-Russian Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Russian economic and trade
partnership has long been an important part of China's cooperation
with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian trade was up 50 percent, to 5.86 billion US
dollars' worth in 1992, and increased by 30 percent to 7.7 billion
dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
There was a downturn in trade in 1994, mainly because of
changing markets and a lack of direct links between companies, but
this trend was reversed in the second half of 1995, when
Sino-Russian trade rebounded to 5.46 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sino-Russian economic and technological cooperation
developed smoothly, with 562 contracts signed on various projects,
involving 356 US million dollars in value. In January and February
of this year, bilateral trade soared to 726 million US dollars,
23.3 percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
More are expected in future. During his visit to Russia in June
1995, Premier Li Peng agreed in principle with his Russian
counterpart V. S. Chernomyrdin to encourage big companies to make
direct ties and play a major role in economic and trade
cooperation. This has laid a sound foundation for further
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The two nations face both challenges and opportunities in the
21st century in developing their economies and raising the
standard of living. Therefore, closer Sino-Russian economic and
trade cooperation is of important significance to the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts here note that there are favorable conditions
for economic and trade cooperation. The two are complimentary
economically, and are quite familiar with each other's products,
and they have geographical advantages with their 4,300-km border
and easy transportation. But what is more important is the
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
Through efforts of the two governments and of economic and
trade circles, the cooperation is bound to reach new levels, and
President Yeltsin's upcoming state visit to China will certainly
give a new push to the cooperation.

Agriculture is the last important field in China that has not
been extensively developed, Liu said, adding that rural China,
with a population of 860 million, is a huge potential market.  It
is estimated that in the next five years, China will need about
seven billion U.S. dollars of overseas capital to develop its
farming sector.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the government's policy on agriculture means bright
prospects for development and opening to the outside world. About
two-thirds of China's farmland is low- or medium-yield, and has
great potential in improving unit production. The nation also has
a large amount of wild land, inland waters and tidal land that
need to be developed.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 billion people and rapidly growing industry sector also
provide a huge market for farm products, and a Hong Kong observer
remarks that the potential market and severe shortage of funds
mean abundant opportunities for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts here say that although agriculture is
widely regarded as a weak industry, even in developed nations,
there are areas where investors can make a large profit, such as
in farming materials and farm products processing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages overseas investment in
agriculture. Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun recently said that China
welcomes investment and co-operation by overseas investors. China
is expected to have preferential tax, tariff, land, and labor
policies for overseas capital entering the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, overseas capital in agriculture takes the
form of loans, direct investment, aid and compensation trade. The
Chinese government has designated processing of farm products,
comprehensive agricultural development, the upgrading of low- and
medium-yield farmland, the development of arable wasteland,
agriculture infrastructure, commodity grain bases, and
poverty-elimination efforts for the funds.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, has said that
the agricultural sector in China offers plenty of investment
opportunities, and that the prospects for Sino-U.S. co-operation
in agriculture are very bright.

<HEADLINE> US Official Admits Having "Hidden" Interests in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for South Asian Affairs Robin Raphel has admitted that there
are definitely hidden interests for the United States in
Afghanistan, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the local media, Raphel, who is
currently on a five-day tour of Pakistan and Afghanistan, said
America is first of all concerned about the humanitarian plight of
the people of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
What is also worrying is the ongoing political instability in
Afghanistan and its potential of spreading, which could be very
dangerous both for Central Asia and Pakistan, she said.
</P>
<P>
Economic opportunities that definitely exist in the region, she
added, are very much hampered by the instability.
</P>
<P>
There is now much speculation on the renewed U.S. interests in
the war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Raphel flew into Kabul on Friday to meeting Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his commander Ahmed Masood after a
three-day visit to Pakistan. She also visited the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar for talks with the Taliban student militia.
</P>
<P>
This is her first visit to Afghanistan in six months.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. always supported the UN missions which were
looking for ways to boost peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
On her visit to Afghanistan, Raphel said, "We are individually
talking to the parties urging them towards dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to the parties in the region and the outside
parties urging them not to support various factions but rather to
urge the factions to sit down on the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
She said there is growing awareness among the factions in
Afghanistan that the time is really coming when they need to sit
together, but compromise is a difficult thing for them.
</P>
<P>
But she said the U.S. will continue to urge and encourage them
as best it can.
</P>
<P>
Raphel arrived in Pakistan on Wednesday. She held talks with
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali and Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar.

Agriculture, the State Planning Commission, the State Commission
for Restructuring Economy, and the Investment Focus, a Hong
Kong-based company.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiang, China's Minister of agriculture, said that the
Chinese government sticks to its opening-up policy and
"Sino-foreign exchanges and cooperation in agriculture are
promising and have much room to grow."
</P>
<P>
Liu Congmeng, a senior official with the Ministry of
Agriculture, said that the "Chinese government will protect the
products and technology of foreign enterprises."
</P>
<P>
"We have put a major law on intellectual property rights into
effect and our agricultural departments are seriously acting in
accordance with the law," Liu, who is responsible for
international exchanges and cooperation, said, emphasizing that
the interests of foreign seed-breeders who have plans to introduce
refined seeds into China will be protected here.
</P>
<P>
"China has plentiful livestock and crop resources, and we have
to work to protect intellectual property rights in international
cooperation in this," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We have set up a special department in the Ministry of
Agriculture to study the matter of protecting intellectual
property rights, and in the near future we will draw up detailed
regulations in line with international practices."

<P>
HELSINKI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union
should be charged with implementing decisions made by the European
Union (EU) on crisis control, the foreign ministers of Finland and
Sweden said today.
</P>
<P>
In a jointly-signed article published in a local newspaper
today, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and her Swedish
counterpart Lena Hjelm-Wallen suggested that a clear and definite
relationship between the EU and WEU should be established at the
on-going inter-governmental meetings of EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
All EU member countries, including Finland and Sweden which are
not members of WEU, should have an equal say within EU on
making decisions on maintaining peace and controlling crises,
said the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that it is not the proper time at present for the
EU and WEU to merge. Such a merge does not conform to the policy
of military non-alignment pursued by their two countries, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, established in 1948 and changed to its present name in
1954 with the tasks of coordinating the defense policies of member
countries, now groups 10 Western European countries, namely
Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, Italy,
Portugal, Greece, Spain and Luxembourg.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today expressed grave
concern over the ongoing Israeli aggression against Lebanon, the
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Minister of Planning
Abdul Aziz Dakheel al-Dakheel told reporters after a cabinet
meeting that the Council of Ministers reviewed the outcome of the
urgent session of the Arab League, which was held Wednesday in
Cairo to discuss the Israeli barbaric aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reiterated Kuwait's supportive position toward
Lebanon and its call for implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which stipulates unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League foreign ministers at their urgent meeting
condemned the Israeli aggression against Lebanon and considered it
a violation of international laws, the U.N. Charter and Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who represented Kuwait at the Arab League
session, reiterated his country's solidarity and support for
lebanon's sovereignty, stability and security.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after his return from Cairo, Sheikh Sabah said
Kuwait's participation sprung from its commitment to the league's
Charter and its rejection of the use of force to achieve
political aims.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti chief diplomat said Kuwait has taken immediate and
concrete measures to help the Lebanese government deal with the
situation resulting from the displacement of some 600,000 lebanese
civilians.

ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto today expressed satisfaction with the economic
achievements of her government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony for a thermal
power project in Lahore, metropolis of Punjab province, she said
that due to her government's successful energy policy, the
memoranda of understandings (MOU) it had signed were being
converted into agreements.
</P>
<P>
The official Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Benazir as
saying that Pakistan is one of the ten emerging capital markets in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Instead of asking for more loans, she said, within a span of
three years of her government, Pakistan has progressed to a stage
of returning loans.
</P>
<P>
"This government has given back one billion dollars", she said.

<P>
Underlining her government's achievements, Benazir said
domestic borrowings have gone down and the growth rate is rising
above six percent.

She said mark-up rates for commercial loans have been lowered
to make them attractive and the inflation rate brought down from
13 percent to nine.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Railway Station Major Repair Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Railway Station, a
landmark and one of the original ten largest buildings in the
Chinese capital, is set for a renovation, and officials say that
the original style of the building will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Wu Haijun, deputy head of the station, told Xinhua that the
overhaul has the support of the Ministry of Railways and other
departments and the plan has been submitted to the Beijing Railway
Sub-Bureau for approval.
</P>
<P>
"The station will be entirely new, but will keep its original
style," Wu said, "it will have many new facilities and use a lot
of new technology."
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to make the station one of the best in the
country in three years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Passengers have already found that some minor renovation has
started. Toilets are being improved and computer ticket sales are
expected by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The station was opened in September 1959, as part of the 10th
anniversary celebrations of the People's Republic of China. It is
one of the top 10 buildings in the capital, along with the Great
Hall of the People and the Monument to the People's Heroes.
</P>
<P>
Construction work took nine months and cost 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"For 37 years, the station has been the landmark of the Chinese
capital," Wu said, noting that it has handled a total of 1.3
billion passengers in that time. In other words, the equivalent of
every Chinese visiting the station one time.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers visiting the station has risen in the
last decade, and daily passenger flow now stands at 80,000 people
even in slack seasons, although the station was originally
designed to handle 50,000 people. In 1986, it set a record by
handling 250,000 passengers in one day.
</P>
<P>
The pressure of the huge passenger flow on the station has been
tremendous, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Such crowding has of necessity accelerated wear and tear on the
station, and made doing any major repairs almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
But, the opportunity finally came when the price hike in
October of last year produced a large drop in the number of rail
passengers. The opening of the West Railway Station in January of
this year also diverted more than a third of the passengers to the
new station.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that 57.07
percent of China's elderly get money from their children and
relatives for daily expenses.
</P>
<P>
A second group, 24.83 percent, depend on themselves, while a
third, 15.82 percent, live on retirement pensions.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.22 percent of them who live on social security or
relief funds.

<P>
In urban areas, 49.31 percent rely on pensions, 34.53 percent
depend on their children and relatives, and 14 percent depend on
themselves.

In rural areas, 64.26 percent are supported by their children
and relatives, 29.06 percent depend on themselves, and 4.46
percent live on pension funds.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the reason for differences between urban
and rural areas is that the pension system is more popular in
urban areas and that farm work is more common among the elderly in
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Visits Israel on Mediation Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Both Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres and visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher advocated a comprehensive peace in a bid to achieve an
enduring solution to the current Israeli-Hezbollah crisis.
</P>
<P>
Peres and Christopher drew the conclusion at a joint press
conference here this afternoon. Christopher flew in Damascus
Saturday to start his 18th Middle East shuttle diplomacy and
arrived in Israel this morning and immediately went into talks
with Peres. He is scheduled to return to Damascus this evening.
</P>
<P>
Peres defended Israel's 11-day offensive in Lebanon, code-named
Operation Grapes of Wrath, saying that it was Hezbollah which
opened fire without any provocations at Israeli forces and
civilians. "We didn't have choice, but to do it. We were forced to
do so. In our eyes, it is an act of self-defense," he argued.
</P>
<P>
"I believe their purpose was to break the peace process and
prevent the continuation of the negotiations," said Peres, adding
that Israel was are trying to make it cleat that the peace process
will be continued on all fronts in order to reach a comprehensive
peace.
</P>
<P>
Peres said, "We are trying to reach a common ground and
understanding. We are in the middle of the doing and making of
such an understanding and all of us will continue to work very
hard and very seriously to prevent bloodshed and bring peace to
this region."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said his aim is "to try to seek a ceasefire and to
achieve an enduring understanding to prevent escalation of
fighting, most of all, to protect the lives of civilians on both
sides of the border."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the prime minister and he had dealt with some
difficult questions, but he felt confident that common goals
would be achieved. "I want to emphasize that a resolution to the
crisis must be followed by resumption of negotiations because a
comprehensive peace in the region is the only long-term solution
to the problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
On mediation missions made by the French and Russian foreign
ministers as well as a delegation of foreign ministers from the
European Union, Peres said that all Middle East peace agreements,
since the Camp David agreement, had been achieved by the good
offices of the U.S., stressing that Israel only trusts the U.S. and
more channels will be a total confusion.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Christopher said, "The U.S. feels a special
responsibility in view of our history and in view of our
responsibilities to lead in a situation and we shall continue to
do so."

<HEADLINE> Germany Prefers Using U.S. Spy Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany will freeze a costly plan
for jointly making spy satellites with France and instead use
those made by the United States, the local newspaper Bild am
Sonntag reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Klaus Rose, Chairman of Bundestag's
Defense Committee, as saying that Germany prefers using a
U.S.-made spy satellite as it can start using it later this
year at a cost of 600 million marks (about 400 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The German-French plan is expected to cost two billion Germany
marks (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars). In addition, the function
of the satellite under plan is still unknown and the date for
completion is far from decided, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Rose said that the use of spy satellite by Germany could
provide assistance to German troops in Bosnia and help curb
smuggling along the German borders.

<HEADLINE> Extra-Budgetary Funds Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will have a national
campaign to clean up and tighten supervision of extra-budgetary
funds between May and September, according to a meeting here.
</P>
<P>
It is to be jointly carried out by the Ministry of Finance, the
State Planning Commission, the Auditing Administration, the
People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Jin Lianshu, a senior official with the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, said at the
meeting that extra-budgetary funds have grown a great deal since
China launched its reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Jin quoted statistics as saying that the total amount of
extra-budgetary funds is 300 billion yuan (about 35.7 billion US
dollars), and said that "it's very important to soundly manage and
make good use of the funds."
</P>
<P>
"Because of lax management, illegal and irregular activities
have occured in the use of extra-budgetary funds," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, work units have used the funds to buy luxury
cars or houses or to speculate in real estate and the stock
market, Jin told the meeting, adding that what is even worse, some
of the funds have been embezzled.
</P>
<P>
"Such phenomena have raised havoc with financial order,
leaving consumption funds and investment in fixed assets to run
out of control," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, doing a good job in supervising the extra-budgetary
funds is of great significance in rectifying the economic and
financial order and carrying on the anti-corruption battle," Jin
said.

<HEADLINE> South China Wins Hong Kong's FA Cup Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's first-division team
South China defeated Golden 4-1 in the final to win the 1996 San
Miguel Football Association (FA) Cup tournament here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth Cup victory for South China, following those
in the 1984-1985, 1986-1987, 1987-1988, 1989-1990, 1990-1991
seasons. It tied the record of six wins in the Cup tournament by
Sing Tao, another senior Hong Kong club.
</P>
<P>
The victory helped South China one step closer to its ambitious
goal this season -- winning all the four titles which it failed to
gain any last season -- the first-division league, the FA Cup, the
Silver Shield and the Viceroy Cup. It was something it had badly
needed, a facelift and a moral boost.
</P>
<P>
The final match, which featured swift offensive and tough
interceptions, also produced a new star -- South China's
left-winger Chan Chi Hong, the top scorer with three goals. He
was crowned as the Cup tournament's Best Player.
</P>
<P>
After a 1-0 first half lead by South China, the Golden tried at
several occasions in the early stage of the second half to produce
a goal, only found the golden chances lost.
</P>
<P>
After another three goals by South China, including two from
its dazzling left-winger, in the first 37 minutes of the second
half, the Golden found their net in the 46th. C.U. Fairweather, a
substitute of the out-of-form defender Grab Anto in the first
half, scored Golden's sole goal of the game with a slam shot just
outside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
South China were awarded with the top prize of 220,000 HK
dollars (28,000 US dollars) and the runners-up, 80,000 HK dollars
(10,400 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In last year's Cup final, ulsports Rangers beat Eastern 3-0.

TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of students today staged

Israel's attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans "Death to the U.S." and "Death to Israel," the
protesters vowed that they would protect the oppressed Lebanese
people to the last drop of their blood.
</P>
<P>
Masood Farahanian, head of the Union of Iranian Moslem
Students Associations, condemned the Israeli recent attacks
against Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of Lebanese and forced
some 400,000 villagers to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Farahanian announced that Iranian students were ready to offer
any kind of help, including financial assistance, to the
oppressed people of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their rally, the students read a resolution
condemning those governments and international forums, Islamic
countries in particular, for their silence and calling for unity
among Moslem states to remove the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urged the Turkish government to reconsider
its military agreement with Israel singed by the two countries in
February.

<HEADLINE> Money Supply Down in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to meet its
inflation rate goal this year with a smaller increase in the money
supply in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28.37 billion yuan were put into circulation,
according to statistics released today by the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, and 230.94 billion yuan or 89 percent of
the 259.2 billion yuan put into circulation before the traditional
Spring Festival, which fell on February 19, have been withdrawn, a
record high for currency withdrawn after the festival.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, currency in circulation, or MO, totalled
816.91 billion yuan, up 12.4 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Narrow money, or M1, meaning currency in circulation plus
current business deposits, rose by 13.7 percent to around 2.39
trillion yuan, with the increase rate dropping 3.1 percentage
points from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Broad money, or M2, meaning currency in circulation and all
deposits, expanded by 28.4 percent to around 6.45 trillion yuan,
with a growth rate dropping by 1.1 percentage points from at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts with the central bank say the slower increase in
narrow money shows that China's relatively stringent monetary and
financial policy has effectively checked the increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment has been somewhat restrained. In the first
three months of this year, investment in fixed assets rose by 16.2
percent, 21 percentage points less than for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was also down. In March, retail prices were
7.7 percent higher than the same month last year, dropping 0.6
percentage points compared with the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Central bank analysts expect that China would achieve its goal
for this year's inflation rate by sticking to the current
macroeconomic controls. They also point out that banks are still
pressed to make more loans with the rapid increase in broad money.
</P>
<P>
The analysts believe that China, while continuing its tight
monetary policy, should improve its credit structure, and
implement macroeconomic controls more flexibly and pay attention
to new conditions in the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai team outscored
hosts Hong Kong 5-2 to win for the sixth straight time the
Shanghai-Hong Kong Cup women's soccer tournament here today.
</P>
<P>
The annual tournament inaugurated in 1991 is held in Shanghai
and Hong Kong by term.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai led the first half with a sole goal. But the Hong
Kong side came back strongly in the second, with ferocious
attacks in the early stage of the half.
</P>
<P>
Tougher and taller Shanghai players managed another three
within the first 17 minutes of the half before Hong Kong found
their form and scored.
</P>
<P>
Despite of a four-goal deficit, Hong Kong fought back
effectively and ended their scoring draught with two swift,
short-range shots which found the net within 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The relaxed Shanghai team had to gear up and mounted new
offensive waves upon the home side. A 30th-minute goal by
Shanghai's Chi Yi, which was her second of the game, sealed the
second half and the match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the show by our players," said Ma
Liangxing, the Shanghai coach, after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy since four of our team's backbone players are absent
from the team as they are with our national side training for the
Olympic tournament in Atlanta," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have much to learn, of course, but they are making
progress, step by step," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Educational Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will make nine-year
compulsory education more available and eliminate illiteracy among
the young and middle-aged people by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
These are two of the goals of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and long-term development plan for education up to
2010, released officially by the State Education Commission today.
</P>
<P>
The mid- and long-term development plan calls on colleges,
universities, and professional schools to use a "pay-to-learn"
system for students by the year 2010. Scholarships and student
loans, and a work-study plan will be in place by then. Students
from poor families will pay lower tuition or none at all.
</P>
<P>
More colleges and universities will be managed exclusively or
in large part by local governments, and the central government
will only oversee a few key universities or those without local
management.
</P>
<P>
Of China's 1,057 colleges and universities, 369 are under the
directly management of ministries or commissions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, China's nine-year
compulsory education will cover 85 percent of its population, five
to six years of primary school education will cover 10 percent,
and three to four years of primary school education, five percent
of the population. Big cities and economically advanced coastal
areas will try to make high school education more wide-spread.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate among people born after 1949 and above the
age of 15 would be dropped to be less than five percent in five
years. The rate is about seven percent at present, meaning that
more than 33 million young and middle-aged people in China cannot
read or write.
</P>
<P>
Some 145 million people 15 years or older are illiterate in
China, and it is estimated that another one or two million people
are added annually.
</P>
<P>
The number of students receiving higher education will be
around 6.5 million by the year 2000, and about eight percent of
all people between the ages of 18 and 21 will be enrolled in
colleges and universities at that time.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1,165 colleges and universities for adults.

<P>
As in previous years, Hong Kong and Macao businessmen
dominated, followed by those from the European Commission,
Southeast Asia, the United States, Japan, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that more deals are expected to be made at
the fair toward the end because of the increasing numbers of
businessmen who show up at the fair as it nears its finish.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Satisfied with Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton reached an agreement today that
NATO, at the request of Russia, will not speed up its eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference in the Kremlin, the
presidents expressed their satisfaction with their one-to-one
talks held in the Kremlin earlier today.
</P>
<P>
They noted that their five-hour talks, a little longer than
expected, focused on NATO's eastward expansion, the Chechen
crisis, nuclear disarmament and other bilateral and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Yeltsin said Clinton has promised
to influence "his comrades-in-arms" on refraining from speeding up
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the press conference that his stand on the
issue remains unchanged. However, his position does not affect
Russia in any way, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agenda of today's talks, Yeltsin said that
on the whole they were "a continuation" of Saturday's nuclear
summit attended by the Group of Seven industrialized nations (G-7)
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "discussed issues related to nuclear
disarmament and reaffirmed their readiness to make headway towards
ratification of the START-2 treaty and the conclusion of a treaty
on a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," according to the Russian
president.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Yeltsin also briefed Clinton of the
latest efforts made by Russia for a peaceful settlement of the
Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, stressed that Chechnya remains a part of
the Russian Federation. But he said his country has urged a
political solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States will continue to support the ongoing
reforms in Russia and hopes for "a strong and stable Russia" in
the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said, relations between Russia and the United
States will largely depend on the results of the forthcoming
presidential elections in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his confidence that he will win the June 16
presidential election. He also said that the two countries'
presidential elections will "have no impact on the policy" towards
their long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, Clinton suggested that He and
Yeltsin discuss Middle East problems, particularly the Lebanon
crisis, in the next two days and the Russian president agreed to
contact him by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president arrived in Moscow at the weekend for the
nuclear summit and the bilateral talks and is scheduled to leave
for home later today.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Held to 2-2 Draw in Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, Yunnan Province, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champions Shanghai Shenhua met a strong resistenece from the
August First team in the second round of the Chinese professional
soccer league, taking only one point from the 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai team took a 1-0 lead at the 31st minute when
captain Fan Zhiyi converted the penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
Xie Hui made it 2-0 for the visitors minute when he beat the
defenders and goal-keeper of the August First team at the 66th
minute.
</P>
<P>
The August First fought back in the second half and levelled
the score through Sun Xinming and Wang Rui at the 69th and 82nd
minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
The August First team chose Kunming, a high plateau city, as
their home venue, and that worked as they beat last season's
runners-up Beijing Guo'an 1-0 in the first round and forced
defending champions Shanghai Shenhua to the 2-2 draw in the
second.
</P>
<P>
The draw cost Shanghai Shenhua dearly as they had to settle
for the second place in the league standings after Dalian Wanda,
which beat Jinan Taishan 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda signed two Swedish players this season and are
regarded the favorites for the league title. They had a perfect
start to the season, winning two away matches. Last Sunday, they
beat Tianjin Samsung 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Samsung played a brave match in Chengdu, Sichuan
Province, forcing hosts Sichuan Quanxing to a 0-0 draw. Sichuan
Quanxing lost to Shanghai Shenhua 0-3 last Sunday and today's
draw earned them first point of the season.
</P>
<P>
In other matches played on Sunday, Guangdong Hongyuan drew
Guangzhou Songri 0-0, Shenzhen played to a 0-0 draw with
Guangzhou Apollo and Beijing Guo'an tied Yanbian Hyundai 2-2.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardliners Defeat Liberals in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hardliners backed by
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have definitely won a landslide
victory in the crucial parliament elections, according to the
latest run-off results published here today.
</P>
<P>
Liberals supported by moderate President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani were defeated since they got only nine of 30 seats in
Tehran, the political center of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry elections headquarters this afternoon
announced the final results for the Tehran constituency with a
total of 1,431,431 ballots.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that the conservative camp headed by
hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri won 21 seats
during the first and second rounds of elections.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the incomplete results of
various regions showed that Nateq-Nouri's faction could have won
140-150 of 270-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the analysts said, Iran would adopt much stronger
hardline policy toward the West headed by the United States and
the economic reform and free economic policy by the Rafsanjani
administration would face severe challenge.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the open rivalry is over, but the power
struggle behind the door would be getting even more intensified
in the political arena of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua that some independent
candidates would change their mind and join in the conservative
camp, the Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC), because of the
tremendous pressure from the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is a clear defeat for the
moderate camp head by the 62-year-old president for his economic
policy which has lead to skyrocketing inflation and wide complain
from the people for deteriorating living standards.
</P>
<P>
On the eve the second round of the elections, Rafsanjani and
his government have come under attack for corruption, inflation,
being anti-clerical and being soft on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei even joined in criticism
waged by hardliners against Rafsanjani. Khamenei indirectly
attacked the moderate president for corruption twice within a
month.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani admitted that the two major factions were
in a "fierce rivalry" in the parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the parliament elections were held
nationwide on March 8. Only two candidates from Tehran,
Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri and Rafsanjani's daughter Faezeh
Hashemi, secured the adequate number of votes to be elected to
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the run-off elections were held in 75
constituencies to determine the fate of 123 seats in the 270-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, in the initial stage of the elections
each contending candidate should obtain at least one third of the
votes cast in each constituency.
</P>
<P>
However, in the run-off elections any candidate who obtains
the relative majority will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that two major conservative factions
backed by Khamenei were expected to capture the majority of the
270 seats in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The two groups, Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) and
Association for the Defense of the Values of the Islamic
Revolution (ADVIR), were competing against the liberal modernist
faction known as Group-6 supported by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that this is the most important
parliamentary elections since the death of the architect of the
Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary elections are important because whatever
group wins in the elections, it will have a better chance in the
presidential elections of 1997," a political science professor at
Tehran University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Rafsanjani cannot run for a third
consecutive term in 1997. His nemesis, Parliament Speaker
Nateq-Nouri, is said to be SCC's candidate for the presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> Guardian Auction Brings In More Than 40 Million Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Guardian '96 Spring
Auction, which ended today, sold 61 percent of the artworks
available, for a total of 43.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
There were six categories of items: Chinese paintings and
calligraphy; jewelry and jadeite; rare books; curios; Chinese oil
paintings and sculptures; and stamps and covers.
</P>
<P>
A landscape painting by Zhang Daqian, a famous contemporary
artist, brought 1.21 million yuan, the highest price in that
category.
</P>
<P>
A piece of jadeite that a Qing emperor sent to his agriculture
minister became the most expensive piece of jewelry, selling for
1.48 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Certificates of appointment used by Dr. Sun Yat-sen some
seventy years ago were a special item in the rare books category,
bringing 352,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A softly-colored porcelain vase from the Kangxi emperor of the
Qing Dynasty, a period that contributed much to fine porcelain,
was sold for 825,000 yuan, a high price in that category.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive Chinese oil painting this time was one by
Chen Yifei of a girl a playing a violin.
</P>
<P>
A complete set of China's first pictorial prestamped envelopes,
one of the only seven in existence, topped the stamp and cover
category, selling for 180,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive articles, however, were still far from world
or domestic record holders for the amounts they brought.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the auction may indicate, in view of the
fact that there were no surprisingly high prices, that China's
fledging auctioneering business is headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Gan Xuejun, vice-manager of China Guardian Auction Co., Ltd,
says that more Chinese on the mainland are going to auctions, and
are becoming more knowledgeable in bidding and that their taste in
art is improving.

NANYANG, Northern Henan Province, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Wen Fan
of Sichuan Province surged to the leading position on the second
