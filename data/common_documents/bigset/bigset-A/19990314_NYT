KANSAS' WILLIAMS DENIES COACHING INTEREST AT UNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Fighting distractions: From the moment his team arrived in New
Orleans for the opening rounds of the Midwest Region, Kansas coach
Roy Williams has felt somewhat besieged.
</P>
<P>
   First there were the questions about Lester Earl, his junior
forward who was once the center of a scandal that landed LSU on
probation. Each time Earl stepped on the court in the Jayhawks'
first-round win over Evansville, fans at the Superdome booed him,
waving car keys and money.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory, Williams was then faced with the daunting
prospect of a second-round matchup today with Kentucky, a team that
defeated the Jayhawks in December, 63-45.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to preview that yesterday, Williams found himself
dealing with a rumor that he will soon replace Bill Guthridge as
coach at North Carolina, Williams' alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I love New Orleans,'' he said, ``but this has really
been tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all I can say about that is that Bill Guthridge is a
great friend and was once my coach, and I have no interest in his
job. I have an interest in North Carolina because my son just
graduated from there and my daughter is a student there, and I've
given them a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Guthridge even acts like he's gonna quit, I'm gonna
beat him up. Anyway, why would I want to work at a place where
someone in their own radio network can make something like that up
and turn it into a rumor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where I am. When I came to Kansas, I didn't even know
what a Jayhawk was, but now I love 'em.'' _Whit Canning
</P>
<P>
   Looking back: Regarding the December game with the Widcats,
Kansas forward T.J. Pugh said, ``It was just embarrassing _
especially the way we all felt in the locker room when we had been
outplayed so badly. But we were young then and had some injuries,
and I hope we're a different team now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said the Jayhawks (23-7) had struggled with their identity
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost some people like Raef LaFrentz and Paul Pierce, whose
mentality was simply that they were not going to be stopped,'' he
said. ``We have a lot of guys this year who were not really
comfortable with that role. We've become more of a team that
spreads the responsibility around and pays more attention to
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tradition of the two programs, Pugh said, ``They're
two of the best, but that's not going to make any difference in
this game. As far as Kentucky (26-8) is concerned, if this is a
`down' year, I'd say their program is in good shape.'' _Whit
Canning
</P>
<P>
   A marked man: In today's other matchup in New Orleans, Utah
coach Rick Majerus acknowledged that his team will throw everything
but the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at Miami of Ohio's Wally
Szczerbiak, who scored 43 points against Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, we'll run four guys at him, we'll play him big,
we'll play him small, we'll box-and-one,'' Majerus said. ``But he's
a smart player and he feeds the others. He won't fall into the trap
of trying to beat us alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, you could win the Szczerbiak battle and lose the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerus said the Utes will be at full strength, laying to rest
some fears that All-America point guard Andre Miller _ who suffered
a cut lip and a swollen hand Friday _ would not play. _Whit Canning
EAST
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a cure: Brandon Wharton is trying but he can't figure
it out.
</P>
<P>
   When fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-8) plays 12th-seeded Southwest
Missouri State (21-10) today in a second-round East Region game in
Charlotte, N.C., the Volunteers hope that the Missed-Shot Flu that
swept through this region Friday has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the 3-point line, teams relying on the three too
much,'' said Wharton, Tennessee's senior guard. ``Maybe it was the
tournament atmosphere and the first-game jitters. I really don't
know. I just don't think it can get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight teams who played in Charlotte on Friday combined to
shoot 37.3 percent. Take away Duke's 61 percent shooting and the
percentage plummets to 33.6 percent. Southwest Missouri State held
Wisconsin to an opening-round record-low 32 points. _Wendell
Barnhouse
</P>
<P>
   Better not do it again: Tulsa committed 25 turnovers and nearly
blew a 26-point lead in its first-round victory over College of
Charleston. The Golden Hurricane (23-9) is averaging nearly 18
turnovers per game and have had 10 games with at least 20
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Against top-seeded Duke (33-1) today, ninth-seeded Tulsa knows
it can't afford to be as sloppy. The Blue Devils force an average
of 18 turnovers per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnovers are a big key for Duke and some teams get scared of
Duke's pressure,'' said Tulsa sophomore guard Marcus Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said that injured guard Trajan
Langdon is expected to start. He'll replace freshman Corey Maggette
in the lineup. _Wendell Barnhouse
</P>
<P>
   Barnes not upset: Texas coach Rick Barnes yesterday did not
appear overly concerned about the contention of Purdue's Brian
Cardinal that Gabe Muoneke punched the Boilermakers player twice in
a second-half spill _ a contention Muoneke denied and one on which
replays cast doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said one East Region staff official told him it didn't
happen. A member of the media sitting behind the Purdue bench also
said he heard one of the game officials tell a Boilermakers
assistant that Muoneke didn't punch Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would look at a tape sometime after he returned
to Austin. The Longhorns flew out yesterday afternoon, and most of
the players went out to look around Boston during the morning. _
Mike Jones
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Teams from Temple and Cincinnati have played
seven times in the past six years. The Bearcats eliminated the
Owls, 77-71, in the NCAA first round in 1995 and 78-65 in the
second round in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that has any bearing at all,'' Huggins said. Mike
Jones
WEST
</P>
<P>
   Hood struggles: Derek Hood, Arkansas' leading rebounder, scored
nine points and grabbed nine rebounds in yesterday's 82-72 loss to
Iowa. But coach Nolan Richardson said the 6-foot-8 forward, who was
nursing a strained lower back, was little more than a shadow of the
player who averaged 12.5 points and 10.3 rebounds during the
Razorbacks' first 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hugged him after the game and we both cried,'' said
Richardson, who allowed Hood, a senior, to play 35 minutes in his
final college game. ``I don't think he should have played more than
20 minutes, the way he was grimacing out there. But every time I
brought him over to the bench, the first thing he said was, `I've
got to be in the game.' '' _Jimmy Burch
</P>
<P>
   Coaching carousel: New Mexico coach Dave Bliss confirmed he has
been contacted about the vacancy at Saint Louis, but declined
yesterday to discuss his interest, if any, in pursuing the
position. Published reports out of Iowa have identified Steve
Alford, the former Mavericks' guard who coaches Southwest Missouri
State, as the favorite to succeed Tom Davis, whose contract with
the Hawkeyes expires after the 1998-99 season. _Jimmy Burch
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' legacy: New Mexico center Kenny Thomas, a four-year
starter and All-America performer, cemented his legacy as an
underachiever in the NCAA tournament by scoring one point in his
final college game, a 78-56 loss to Connecticut. Thomas, who
averaged 15.7 points per game throughout his career, managed just
9.4 per outing in NCAA games, never leading the Lobos past the
second round of the tournament in any season.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, however, defended his 6-foot-8 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a reputation for something, it's tough to
shake,'' Bliss said. ``Kenny didn't play well, but ... you don't
choose how you end your career. Many people don't like things that
happen to them. But Kenny will bounce back from this and play great
at the next level. The past four years, we went to four NCAA
tournaments and won four games in those tournaments. Without Kenny
Thomas, we would never have had the opportunity to do a lot of
those things.'' _Jimmy Burch

SCRAWNY KID PUTS UP BRAWNY NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ You saw Scott Pohlman on the floor of the RCA
Dome Saturday and your first thought was how precious, they're
plucking kids from the nosebleed seats to try a midcourt shot as
part of some pregame promotion.
</P>
<P>
   How could you have had a clue what Pohlman was about to do? The
slightly built, mop-topped Pohlman looked about as ready for his
Hollywood close-up as the scrawny neighborhood kid who rattles by
your house every afternoon on his skateboard.
</P>
<P>
   If you squinted real hard, you could have pictured Pohlman maybe
doing a guest stint on ``Dawson's Creek'' someday. But NCAA
Tournament stardom right away? As if!
</P>
<P>
   Only later would you find out Pohlman had been in the spotlight
plenty before he singlehandedly carried Auburn to the Sweet 16 on
his spindly shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Practically every night when he was growing up, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be dark by the time he got done with dinner so Pohlman, a
self-described ``driveway rat,'' would turn on the outside light in
front of his family's suburban Atlanta house, switch on the radio
and the headlights of the family sedan and shoot baskets until well
past midnight _ or until the neighbors across the street crossly
hollered at him to cease with all that thumping. No more bass or
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   A million jumpers later, Pohlman stood in wholly unfamiliar
territory, blinking in front of lights as bright as a comet, the
unlikeliest of shooting stars in the Tigers' 81-74 win over
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the words to express how I feel right now,''
Pohlman said after pouring in a game-high 28 points in 32 minutes,
each basket seemingly bigger than his last.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the game's first shot, he made 11 of his next 16,
including 2 of 3 from beyond the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no hitch in my shot or nothing. Just one smooth
motion,'' Pohlman said, disbelief creeping into his voice. ``It's
just such a dream come true. All my life I've been watching players
(step up) in the NCAA Tournament. And today that was me in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   When the thermometer was turned up, he rose like heat. There was
the scintillating stretch late in the first half when Pohlman
outscored the Cowboys 11-0 all by his lonesome to turn a two-point
deficit into the biggest lead either team would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Until a Pohlman jumper with six minutes left in the game put the
Tigers up by 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the jumper Pohlman knocked down with 52 seconds
left, after Oklahoma State had trimmed the lead to a
cuticle-bleeding two points, and the two free throws he netted for
the game's final points.
</P>
<P>
   At the final buzzer, an Auburn player picked Pohlman up and
carried him a few feet. It was the least any of his teammates could
do, after the lift Pohlman had given the No. 1-seeded Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways Scott put this team on his back and we rode
him,'' said Auburn coach Cliff Ellis, who didn't even try to hide
his delight as he watched the unassuming sophomore field the
Tiger's share of questions afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just like to see guys succeed who have all that heart and
character and are in the underdog role,'' Ellis said. ``He was not
one of the Parade All-Americans that you hear so much about. He was
not highly recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Pepperdine was the only Division I
school courting Pohlman for the first seven months of his senior
year at Roswell High. He flew west for a recruiting trip that was
memorable for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beaches and girls,'' Pohlman said, blushing.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in L.A., Pohlman also attended a Clippers game,
which was more of a thrill than it sounds. He got to meet Dominique
Wilkins, then with the Clippers and the only player at the
University of Georgia to have his jersey retired.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman was all pumped to move west. He had his mind ``pretty
much made up'' that he was going to Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Then he scored 29 points in a Class AAAA state semifinal playoff
game against a player Auburn was recruiting and roused the interest
of the Tigers. That was in late March. In early April, the
19-year-old accepted Auburn's last available athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best situation I could have hoped for,'' said
Pohlman, who pined to play near enough to Atlanta to enable his
father, mother and sister to attend his games. ``Things work out
for strange reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman might as well have been an alien, so out of place did he
look when he arrived at Auburn. His new teammates didn't know what
to do, point him toward the nearest middle school or ask him to
fetch them a clean towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the manager or something,'' said senior
Bryant Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Doc Robinson gave Pohlman a cursory glance and smirked.
``Ain't no way he can play at this level,'' Robinson recalled
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Tigers started practicing and Pohlman, who is very
generously listed at 6-foot-2, almost instantaneously earned his
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week of practice he took over the intrasquad
games,'' Ellis said, ``and he never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman sheepishly admitted that he drew inspiration Saturday by
looking forward. He was determined to do whatever it took to get
out of next week's school exams. Even if that meant playing the
point for a bit _ in place of the foul-plagued Robinson _ and
banging the much bigger bodies inside for three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling myself I cannot take finals next week so we've
gotta win,'' Pohlman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I was thinking about out there.'' &QL;

NORTHRIDGE HASN'T LOST DANCE FEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was the nightmare. Then the honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   What next for the Cal State Northridge women? What can the
program do to top a season in which the Matadors won the Big Sky
Conference title and appeared in the NCAA Tournament for the first
time?
</P>
<P>
   CSUN headed home Saturday night, one day after being eliminated
by Colorado State 71-59 in the first round. It wasn't a long
postseason trip, but, as somebody told Matadors head coach Frozena
Jerro late Friday night: ``You got to dance a little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we knew all along we had the talent to be successful
in the Big Sky,'' Jerro said. ``Once we got through that first
round in the Big Sky and saw how we matched up against everybody,
we figured we had a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who finished 21-8, won't be satisfied with another
first-round exit. Jamilah Jones and Tina Greer punctuated the
postgame press conference at Colorado State's Moby Arena with
several rapid-fire observations of their loss to the second-seeded
and seventh-ranked Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a big difference between them and us,'' said
Greer, a sophomore transfer from Xavier who led CSUN in steals this
season. ``We just know that we have to battle next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a junior guard and team captain, said nobody in the media
expected the Matadors to compete with Colorado State, let alone
pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that believed in us was us,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Jerro interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see we're hungry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A partial list of CSUN's milestones this past season:
</P>
<P>
   _The Matadors came one win short of tying the school record for
victories in a season, 22. They went 13-3 in conference, by far
their best record in the Big Sky and the first time a CSUN team won
10 games in conference.
</P>
<P>
   _It was the first time CSUN advanced to an NCAA tournament since
1989, when it went to the Division II playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _Jerro became the first CSUN women's basketball coach to win 20
or more games in her first season.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are scheduled to return their entire roster. But
the challenge for Jerro in the coming weeks will be to cement the
status of CSUN's four foreign players who saw action this season:
starter Lynda Amari (France) and reserves Vivica Lof (Sweden), Neda
Milic (Serbia) and Daphne Verrept (Belgium).
</P>
<P>
   The foreign players all bonded with former coach Michael
Abraham, who resigned in November after being arrested for drug
trafficking. Any one of them could potentially transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Amari, a junior forward who was named All-Big Sky, said earlier
this season the presence of Abraham was the only reason she came to
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of an Amari transfer wouldn't leave the
cupboard bare. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time all-conference guard Edniesha Curry comes back. So do
starters Greer, Jones and center Keisha Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro, who was named the full-time coach the day after the
Matadors won the Big Sky Tournament, had a right to be upbeat after
the loss Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a disappointing loss,'' she said, ``but I told the
team `Let's put this disappointment past us . . . in some people's
eyes, we were the overachiever.''

TEXAS TECH WOMEN SEND SFA HOME
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Special to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ A year ago, the Texas Tech women walked off the
Lubbock Municipal Coliseum court wondering what might've been after
a second-round NCAA Tournament loss to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   That wound has healed over time, but not completely. Last night,
the sixth-ranked Lady Raiders began to purge the rotten taste of
that loss with their first-round game in the Midwest Region.
</P>
<P>
   Tech scored the game's first 13 points last night and never let
overmatched Stephen F. Austin get closer than 11 points en route to
a convincing 80-54 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Lady Raiders (29-3) will face North Carolina
State (17-11) at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stormed to the 13-0 lead in the game's initial five
minutes, with center Angie Braziel and guard Julie Lake each
scoring two early baskets. No. 15 seed SFA (17-12) didn't crack the
scoreboard until the 14:40 mark when Shawnta Johnson hit a hoop.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Lady Raiders were rolling,and even though the
Ladyjacks cut the deficit to 26-15 with 3:25 to go before halftime,
Tech was in control the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a great start, and that was a big key to the
win,'' Lady Raiders coach Marsha Sharp said. ``For the first five
or six minutes we made them chase us, and we were able to set the
tone for what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Tech wanted to do was make SFA run. The Lady Raiders did
that successfully and along the way hit 15 of 28 first-half shots
and forced 12 Ladyjacks turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   SFA made a bid late in the first half to make a move, but Lake
and Rene Hanebutt hit jump shots to fuel Tech's 10-3 run over the
final 3:14 before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   To remove any doubt, the Lady Raiders started the second half
with an 11-4 surge. Braziel and Lake picked up where they left off
in the first half with back-to-back baskets, and SFA never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to get a good shot because of the kind of defense
Texas Tech plays,'' Ladyjacks coach Royce Chadwick said. ``When we
finally did get a good look, it had taken so long that I think it
scared us. We started to press after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Braziel led the Lady Raiders with 21 points, while Lake scored
15, dished out a career-high 10 assists and grabbed 7 rebounds.
Anitra Davis led SFA with 14 points.

MAVS FIND SUCCESS VS. WOEFUL GRIZZLIES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Almost halfway through this abbreviated NBA season, a
modest Mavericks goal has crystalized:
</P>
<P>
   Become the best of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got to take care of our own business, not take
possessions off, not have lapses,'' point guard Steve Nash said
after Dallas' 91-74 drubbing of Western Conference have-not
Vancouver last night at Reunion Arena. ``Take care of ourselves
first, then teams like this, then we can worry about the better
teams and the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   The dividing line in the West seems almost carved in stone.
Above the line are eight obvious playoff contenders. And below the
line?
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of games,'' forward Samaki Walker said, ``give us
something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a numbing 1-8 start, the Mavericks have won seven of
their past 13. That's not enough to fuel legitimate playoff talk _
Michael Finley's proclamations of contention seem more a function
of his team captaincy than his skills as a prognosticator _ but in
success-poor Dallas, it counts for something.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (8-14) found the ideal victim in 4-17 Vancouver,
losers of 11 in a row. Fueled by the penetration of Nash (10
assists), Dallas stormed to an early lead of 21-6 before settling
for a 41-24 halftime edge. Those 24 points mark the third-lowest
first-half scoring total in NBA history and a Mavericks franchise
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense spoke up early, but it was there all game long,''
coach Don Nelson said. ``We were up to every challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive effort was led by 36-year-old A.C. Green, playing
in his 1,000th consecutive game. Green was matched against the
Grizzlies' Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who scored 21 points, tying
teammate Felipe Lopez and Finley for game-high honors. But Green
dominated play when it counted, holding Abdur-Rahim, Vancouver's
leading scorer at 24.2 points per game, scoreless until midway
through the second period and limiting him to six first-half
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C. gets the game ball, not just for his 1,000th, but for
sticking with \RAbdur-Rahim\S, who is a great player,'' Nelson
said. ``He was on him for 38 minutes and did a marvelous job.''
</P>
<P>
   With 2:31 remaining in the third period, Vancouver used a
three-point play by ex-Maverick Cherokee Parks to cut the lead to
three at 54-51, and what had been a 20-point lead at one point was
nearly gone. But the deficit initially created by Dallas' defense
and Vancouver's horrid shooting _ at one point, the Grizzlies
missed 11 consecutive shots while starting 5-of-29 (17 percent)
from the floor _ allowed the Mavericks enough cushion to hang on at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   When Vancouver sliced the lead to two with seven minutes left,
Hubert Davis (14 points) answered with a trio of 3-pointers for a
77-66 Dallas edge, sealing the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a game with everything the NBA has to offer,'' Nelson
said. ``We played great, played poorly, they made a run, we got the
win. What more can you ask for?''

VALDES SITS AS THIGH TIGHTENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ If it were up to the 25-year-old guy, he
would have stayed in and pitched. The manager, with 36 years of pro
baseball experience, said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes' third spring
outing ended in the third inning after his left thigh tightened on
him while covering first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt tightness in his left quadricep and we'll re-evaluate
(today),'' Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said. ``I have him
drinking water like crazy. That will tell us if it's a strain or a
cramp.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes experienced the tightness when he rushed to first after
Cleveland's Jim Thome hit a sharp grounder. First baseman Dave
Hansen fielded the ball and flipped to Valdes for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it a little bit on my left side when I went to sprint
over there,'' Valdes said. ``I agree with (manager) Davey Johnson.
You don't want to take chances. I could still pitch one or two
innings, but you don't know if it's going to get worse. If it's the
regular season or playoffs, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who allowed one run on three hits in 22/3 innings, said
he expects to make his next start, and also plans on completing his
between-starts work.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, Young pushed back: Todd Hundley's and Eric Young's
Grapefruit League debuts have been pushed back, with a new date not
yet known. Johnson said he made the decision on Hundley after
talking with the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some tightness in his arm,'' Johnson said. ``I'm going
to wait until he's fully healthy for him to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was supposed to catch his first game of the spring today
against the St. Louis Cardinals. Young, who is yet to appear in a
spring game, was slated to play second base.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley, recovering from reconstructive elbow
surgery, experienced the tightness because he's doing a lot of
wrist curls to strengthen his arm. When asked about being worried
about Hundley, he said: ``Not at this point. I'm not concerned,
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson said he's also pushing back Young's spring
debut because the seven-year veteran is still experiencing
stiffness in his lower back. Young has been fielding grounders and
taking batting practice the past few days. But Johnson said he
wants Young, like Hundley, to be perfectly healthy before playing
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown bashes toilet: Back at Dodgertown, right-handed pitcher
Kevin Brown took out some frustration by bashing a toilet with a
baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dodgers officials, Brown was showering when a
toilet was flushed. The plumbing setup at Dodgertown causes
extremely hot water to run through the shower when such an event
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Upset about being scalded by the water, Brown left the shower,
grabbed a baseball bat, and slammed it a few times against the
toilet, Dodgers officials said. The toilet was broken, but no one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Cora fractures hand: Light-hitting Alex Cora wasn't given much
chance to earn a backup infielder's job out of spring training, but
now he has no chance. Strasser said Cora will be out four to six
weeks after X-rays revealed a fracture in the fifth metacarpal on
his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, who played in 29 games for the Dodgers last season,
initially injured the hand when he was hit by a pitch March 7.
X-rays were negative, but Cora re-injured the hand on a swing
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson is keeping a keen eye on the
bullpen, and he said he saw progress in right-hander Mel Rojas' two
innings against the Indians, though he did yield a run. ``I want
him to load it up, get more tilt in there and use his fastball,''
Johnson said. . . . Oft-injured minor-league outfielder Kevin Gibbs
was taken out of the game after the first inning with what Strasser
called a ``twinge behind his right elbow.''

LEWIS ROBBED OF CLEAR DECISION OVER HOLYFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield marched into venerable Madison
Square Garden last night, singing along to one of his favorite
gospel songs like an Old Testament prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Just like some 3,000 years ago, Moses didn't reach the promised
land this time, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory on earth, power and strength to the Lord!'' Holyfield
sang. He could have used a little of that power and strength for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, cheered by more than 7,000 vocal Brits among the
sellout crowd of 21,284, rightfully should have become the
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world with a unanimous
decision over Holyfield. We forgot. This was a Don King production.
Incredibly, two judges' cards were split and the third had the
fighters even.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the first major heavyweight championship at the Garden
since Ali-Frazier 28 years ago ended in a shocking and disgraceful
draw.
</P>
<P>
   The official judges' scoring was: Larry O'Conner of Britain,
115-115, Larry Christodoulou of South Africa favored Lewis 116-113,
and Jean Williams of the United States had it 115-113 for
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The AP card favored Lewis 117-111.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the problem with boxing,'' Lewis' trainer Steward said
afterward. ``Every time we try to have a great fight and move the
sport forward, this kind of crap happens. \RLewis\S won the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who stormed out of the ring and slammed the door to his
dressing room before allowing TV cameras in for a quick interview,
said he didn't lose more than two rounds to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit him with my jab all night,'' Lewis said. ``He never hurt
me, not in the least. I can't believe this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should get an automatic rematch but I doubt he'll want to
fight me again. He looked like an old man in the ring tonight. He
was slow and missing a lot of punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield almost didn't know what to say when he was interviewed
by a skeptical TVKO analyst Larry Merchant in the ring after the
fight while boos from the crowd almost drowned him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen sometimes like that,'' a humble Holyfield said.
``There's always a next time. In six months, if he wants to get it
on again, we'll get it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the rematch. More money. More hype. More King.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost beyond a stench,'' Merchant said. ``I'm ashamed
as a boxing fan and as an American.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, me too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should be have a rematch if this kind of thing is going to
happen?'' a frustrated Steward asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the fluttering Union Jacks and the soccer-manic Brits got
under my skin but the biggest disappointment was that Holyfield,
the warrior, didn't go out with a war cry, but with a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hagler-Hearns, we got Charlie Brown vs. Lucy. You've
had tougher scraps in the backyard with your kid brother.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, noted as a counter-puncher, could never find a way to
successfully stay inside Lewis' long, measuring jab.
</P>
<P>
   By the fight's final rounds, an arrogant Lewis was mugging for
the crowd, dancing like Ali, dropping his gloves and daring
Holyfield to hit him. As he held Holyfield locked up in a clinch as
the last seconds ticked away in the 12th and final round, he waved
his hand at the cheering Englishmen in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, at times, looked as helpless as a baby. The man who
twice dispatched Mike Tyson didn't bother to throw even half as
many punches as his younger foe and, sadly, didn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Give the hulking Lewis, who outweighed Holyfield by more than 30
pounds, credit. He listened to Steward, never gave up on his jab
and carefully picked his spots to unload his big, jackhammer right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield started slow, pressed the fight a bit in the third _
that's when he predicted he'd knock Lewis out _ then settled back
again as Lewis mauled him with the left jab.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fighter ever seemed to be in real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if Holyfield, after trying to sucker Lewis with
the third-round prediction, was playing cat-and-mouse with the big
man, hoping he'd wear down, luring him closer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no web, no spider and no sting in Holyfield's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lewis gained confidence throughout the fight and showed
it by dropping his gloves and daring Holyfield to hit him, much to
the delight of the noisy British fans.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the fight that ringside celebrities like John F.
Kennedy Jr., Jack Nicholson, Patrick Ewing, Wayne Gretzky and wife
Janet Jones and Keith Richards expected.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a war. Instead, it turned into a long,
disappointing dance.
</P>
<P>
   A draw?
</P>
<P>
   Now why do I suspect the detestable King somehow has his slimey
fingerprints all over this?
</P>
<P>
   Track record, I suppose. When the cheese suddenly disappears,
it's just natural to blame the biggest rat in the house.

KINGS RESPOND TO CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Rob Blake spoke, and his teammates listened.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one game, but it was a small step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings are to make a move for a playoff berth in the final
five weeks of the NHL season, they will have to take many more
steps similar to the one they took Saturday night when they
defeated the Vancouver Canucks 3-1 before a Forum crowd of 14,348.
</P>
<P>
   A journey of what seems like a thousand points begins with a
single win, or something like that. Or maybe it began for the Kings
with Tuesday night's 4-2 victory over Detroit, followed by the
30-minute players-only meeting Blake called two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Jozef Stumpel gave the Kings a lead 1:42 into the
game, Donald Audette made it 2-0 with 1:42 remaining in the second
period, and Stumpel scored again with 4:02 to play after the
Canucks had drawn to within one.
</P>
<P>
   In goal, Stephane Fiset stopped all but one of the 20 shots he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   With their second consecutive victory, the Kings (25-36-5) made
some important headway in their bid to salvage their season by
grabbing a playoff berth, moving to within five points of Edmonton
and Calgary, which occupy the eighth and final postseason berth in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also just about killed any lingering hopes the Canucks
(20-36-11) might have had of making a late playoff rush of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson, on the request of Blake and alternate
captains Luc Robitaille and Doug Bodger, played the same lineup
he'd used against Detroit, and the Kings were effective from the
start against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver had most of its significant scoring chances in the
third period after mustering a mere 12 shots on goal in the first
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, on the other hand, kept Canucks rookie goalie Kevin
Weekes constantly busy for the first two periods, firing 34 shots
but only beating him twice.
</P>
<P>
   On the first goal, Yanic Perreault outworked defenseman Mattias
Ohlund for the puck behind the Vancouver net. Audette then picked
the puck up and gave it back to Perreault, who centered the puck to
Stumpel in the slot. Stumpel snapped the puck past Weekes, off the
right goal post and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second period on a power play, Audette gave the
Kings a crucial insurance goal when, from the high slot, he
deflected a shot from the left point by Philippe Boucher past
Weekes for his 14th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Naslund's power-play goal created some nervous moments
for the Kings, but Stumpel's goal _ which came after Craig Johnson
checked Ohlund off the puck _ sealed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Kings had numerous excellent scoring chances, they
still aren't capitalizing on many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 forwards who dressed for the Vancouver game, only
Audette comes close to being hot, with two goals in his last six
games. Stumpel's goals were his first in eight games, Olli Jokinen
has none in nine, Robitaille has none in seven, Craig Johnson has
one in nine, Nathan LaFayette has none in 13, Ray Ferraro and Glen
Murray have none in 11, Yanic Perreault has none in 16, Ian
Laperriere has one in 48, Russ Courtnall has one in 22 and Sean
Pronger has none in 11 games as a King.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, though, the Kings produced plenty of chances
against the Canucks, and they scored enough goals to advance their
playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   They probably will need to do a better job capitalizing on their
chances Monday night, however, when they play host to the Ottawa
Senators, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference.

   PHOENIX - Well, they couldn't afford to waste those two points.
</P>
<P>
   Playing their most important game of the season, a game that
might have held their head coach's future in the balance, the
Coyotes' rolled up their sleeves Saturday night and gritted out a
hard-fought, 1-0 victory over their arch rivals, the Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin came up with 27 saves to notch his seventh
shutout of the season, tying his own franchise record. Mike
Stapleton scored on an early second-period rush, firing a slapshot
from just inside the blue line to beat goalie Guy Hebert for the
only goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensemen were playing back, Teppo (Numminen) made a nice
move to get me the puck and I just wound up and shot it,''
Stapleton said of his sixth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Coyotes (32-24-10) to four points ahead of
the Mighty Ducks (30-27-10) in the battle for the fourth spot in
the playoffs and home-ice advantage in the first round of the
playoffs. Anaheim, which had an eight-game unbeaten streak snapped
Friday night in Dallas, could have pulled into a tie with Phoenix
had it gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes might also have save Coach Jim Schoenfeld's job _ at
least for the time being. Speculation intensified throughout the
organization leading up to this game that Schoenfeld, in his second
year with the Coyotes, might be shown the door, possibly as early
as today, if Phoenix had another putrid performance like the one
here Thursday during a 3-0 loss to visiting Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld still might not be out of jeopardy, which may explain
why he bolted from America West Arena before the nightly three
stars of the game were even introduced.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his Phoenix tenure, he left without saying
anything to his team or to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't account for what Shoney does after games,'' Stapleton
said. ``I'm sure he's happy with the way we played. I don't know,
maybe he just doesn't want to talk to you guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much talking you can do anyway. Sometimes,
it's like beating a dead horse. Maybe he just had a different
approach. Maybe he felt we needed to just be left alone, left to
breath a little bit and it worked, so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach John Tortorella said Schoenfeld went into his
office, grabbed his briefcase and asked him if he would mind
speaking to reporters instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a big deal,'' Tortorella said. ``I've seen
a lot of coaches do that.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith is not ready to discuss his coach's
fate publicly, however, meaning anything could happen. A vote of
confidence now could have easily killed many of the rumors. But
Smith apparently is keeping his options wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not saying anything right now. He wasn't available to
discuss the reported trade he apparently is trying to pull off with
Montreal for veteran center Vincent Damphousse, either.
</P>
<P>
   NHL sources, however, said the deal is getting closer after
Smith reconsidered what to offer the Canadiens in return for the
31-year-old Damphousse, whom the Coyotes are eyeing for one of
their top two lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who had dropped 11 of their past 13 prior to
Saturday, could have used him against Anaheim in what shaped up to
be a close, tight-checking, playoff-type game. But to their credit,
they stood their ground, stuck to their game plan, and kept up
their intensity from start to finish in handing Anaheim its second
straight shutout loss.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, meanwhile, rebounded in a huge way. After playing
one of his worst games of the season, which included giving up a
horrible flip-shot goal from the red line against the Canucks, the
Bulin Wall rediscovered his All-Star touch, turning away everything
sent his way during a brilliant, but heart-pounding performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a good game so I can feel better about
myself again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had to face the NHL's most-fearsome power play unit four
times, including a five-on-three advantage early in the game that
last 50 seconds. The Coyotes killed them all, though, and
Khabibulin didn't crak despite facing two of the league's most
leathal snipers in Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have had three goals tonight easy,'' said Selanne,
who took a game-high eight shots on goal. ``I hope I'm saving them
for when we meet them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton got a break when Anaheim's Ruslan Salei, who
high-sticked Stapleton badly in the face the last time the teams
met, fumbled the puck away on a line change. With open ice in front
of him and only Hebert in his sights, Stapleton ripped a slapshot
that sailed under the goalie's pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a pass in the middle that cost us the game,'' Salei
said. ``I should have gone up the boards with it, but I tried to
make a play up the middle and they made me pay for it.''

BICKLEY: ASU'S WHITE `ROBS' SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE - It's been a tough year for loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And so the athletic director at Arizona State is here, in the
stands, wearing an Ole Miss sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of Ole Miss is in Tempe, watching the games on
television. And the kid who had his coach stolen away by his father
_ the same kid who wears Sun Devils gear all over Mississippi _ is
dribbling out the clock, leading Ole Miss to its first tournament
win in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weird, weird situation,'' said Mike White, a 22-year-old
senior point guard, son of Kevin White, centerpiece of a bizarre
triangle. ``It's probably something that has never happened before.
Just very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want a glimpse of the future, take note of today's
second-round battle between Ole Miss and top-seeded Michigan State.
Because, for the most part, these are still Rob Evans' kids playing
Rob Evans' brand of basketball. A team that broke through in its
third consecutive NCAA appearance. And if March Madness ever
permeates Tempe, if Evans overhauls Arizona State the way he did
Ole Miss, the assist will forever belong to Mike White.
</P>
<P>
   A kid who feared alienation, put aside his own feelings and let
his father take away the best coach he's ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my dad, I've been around coaches and athletics all
my life,'' White said. ``And Coach Evans is one of the best in the
country. Top five, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga began four years ago, shortly after White committed to
Ole Miss. Once, Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said he could back
up Stephon Marbury, but he'd probably never see the floor. Same
deal with Andre Miller at Utah. But more than anything, White
wanted playing time, and so he and his father swallowed hard when
they showed up for the first game at Ole Miss, hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people came to games at my Jesuit high school,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked around and saw 300 people in the arena,'' his father
said. ``I said to myself, `Oh, my God. Did we make the right
decision?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple of months later, a phone call that planted the
seed:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Dad, this is a way that a program should be run.
He has everything under control. He has all these guys I didn't
think were anyone good playing at an unbelievable level,' '' White
said. ``I started the whole recruiting process.''
</P>
<P>
   The resurrection of Ole Miss is well-documented, a program that
became the hottest ticket in the Southeastern Conference, selling
out all of this year's games before the season started. But after
last year's tournament loss to Valparaiso, things got a little
sticky.
</P>
<P>
   The elder White had narrowed his list of candidates to two or
three guys. But he couldn't get away from Evans, or from the
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad checked with me many times last year,'' White said.
``He asked how it would affect me if Rob Evans was their guy. He
asked if I'd resent him. He asked if he should drop Coach Evans and
pursue him at another time. I assured him I wanted the best for
Coach Evans. If he wanted to be at ASU, if that's how he wanted to
reward himself, that's what he deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there wasn't sacrifice involved. Evans spent many hours
on the phone with his former players this season, and given the
circumstances, that was just fine with his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coaching two teams this year,'' Kevin White said. ``He
really was. It's funny, but Rob is still one of the most
intimidating men in my son's life, and he's thousands of miles
away.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger White, well, the alienation never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd take a lot of abuse,'' White said. ``People
saying, `What are you doing? You should've just gone with Coach
Evans.' I thought there would be a lot of anger. I'm real surprised
how well the student body has treated me this year. Then again,
maybe it would be different if we had a horrible team.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ole Miss has a chance to dethrone a No. 1 seed. A fan
base that wouldn't have known a basketball from a beach ball five
years ago is reveling in wild success. And as Kevin White watches
his son, there are twinges of jealousy and apprehension, a longing
for the day when he's sitting in the stands watching ASU winning a
tournament game in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming,'' White said. ``I smell it. I see it. You look at
Duke, Kentucky, Kansas, even Arizona. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm
intoxicated by all of this, but we can become one of those
programs. We have all the elements, all the demographics. We just
need the product, and it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Ole Miss, they're sleeping out for tickets. They'll be
doing the same thing at ASU in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets some top-notch players, it's over,'' Mike White
said. ``And when it does, I think Dad owes me a little
something.'' &QL;

CACTUS LEAGUE FANS HAVE PICK OF PARKS  
 8 SPRING TRAINING LOCATIONS RATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM WALSH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In Maryvale, Diamondbacks catcher Damian Miller signs
autographs for 10 minutes and savors Maryvale Baseball Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is beautiful, and I think this stadium in the best
in the Cactus League,'' Miller said. ``It would make me happy just
to stay out here all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tempe, children run around the grass berm while adults soak
up the sun and chat at Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like you can come here, sit on the lawn and have a
picnic. It's kind of cool,'' Stephanie Dorsett said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, Sammy Sosa sprints into right field as adoring fans
snap photographs of his trademark salute. Sosamania reigns at
HoHoKam Park.
</P>
<P>
   These familiar images are repeated almost daily each March in
glimmering Cactus League parks, where the warm weather and casual
pace appeal to baseball fans and non-fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   There are six parks in the Valley and two in Tucson, giving
spectators a variety of options. But if forced to pick only one
site for watching a game, which would you choose?
</P>
<P>
   That isn't an easy question to answer. The league has so many
fine facilities, it's hard to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to send a team of our own out to the ballparks to
survey the scene and talk with players and fans to determine the
best and the worst of the Cactus League.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close call, but Scottsdale Stadium was the favorite.
Its reconstruction in 1992 was the prototype for a wave of spring
parks financed by the Maricopa County Stadium District with rental
car taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale offers the best of everything: great sightlines, an
attractive setting next to Scottsdale Civic Plaza, a relaxed
ambiance, a great place to watch people.
</P>
<P>
   But Maryvale Baseball Park, Peoria Stadium, HoHoKam Park and
Tucson Electric Park are remarkably similar architecturally, with
only a few subtle wrinkles. None has bad seats. The biggest
differences come with ambiance and team loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson Electric Park was inspired by Peoria. Both are home to
two teams, have comfortable seats plus grass areas, and possess all
the amenities of modern parks.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to ambiance, HoHoKam and Diablo are in neighboring
cities but miles apart in identity.
</P>
<P>
   HoHoKam has the feel of a Midwestern reunion with the Cubs
faithful flocking from frigid Chicago to see their heroes. Retirees
predominate on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Diablo has a more youthful orientation, with its proximity to
Arizona State University. Rock music blares between innings.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional critics prove you can't satisfy everyone. They label
these new stadiums as antiseptic and yearn for the smaller, less
sophisticated parks they replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they built this Taj Mahal, it was intimate,'' said Phil
Mangiaracina of Chicago, during his annual visit to HoHoKam.
``This, to me, is not spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   If intimacy is what you seek, Hi Corbett Field in Tucson is the
place to be. This older but renovated home of the Colorado Rockies
gives fans the feel of being on top of the action. And those
fortunate enough to sit near the bullpens can almost reach out and
touch the players.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale Baseball Park is the league's overlooked gem. This
stadium, only 2 years old, offers excellent sightlines and the
Valley's best ticket availability.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale finished last in Cactus League attendance in 1998, with
63,625 fans _ compared with HoHoKam's league-leading 134,329 _
largely because the Milwaukee Brewers have the league's weakest
following.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Miller of Phoenix is a big fan of Maryvale's new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat this park for beauty, the peaceful feeling you
get sitting here and being able to sit most anywhere you want,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each Cactus League fan seems to have a preference, but the
comments used to describe most of the parks are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd definitely rank this one high,'' said Scott Brown, an
Anaheim Angels fan from Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., making his first
visit to Scottsdale Stadium. ``It's a nice-looking park.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Marich of Seattle loves Scottsdale Stadium, but Maryvale
Baseball Park and Peoria Stadium rank high on her list as well. And
she compliments Diablo for high accessibility to players.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Stadium ``is an excellent park,'' Marich said. ``This
park looks like an old-time ballpark, with the brick and iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Otto of Annapolis, Md., compares Scottsdale Stadium with
parks in the New York-Penn League, a Class A circuit in upstate New
York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of parks. This place gives me a lot of warm and
fuzzies like the minor-league parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing minor-league about Scottsdale Stadium's
prices, some of the most expensive in the league with $16 and $14
box seats.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale's $16 boxes are only eclipsed by the $18 VIP club
tickets at Peoria Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is free but not plentiful in the Scottsdale Civic Center
garage, and chances are you'll end up on one of the side streets
south of the park.
</P>
<P>
   A small fence atop the stadium's awning also captures foul
balls. The same fouls bounce off the press box and other offices at
Diablo and fall into the hands of happy fans.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the swanky club and box seats at Scottsdale and
Peoria, lawn seats cost only $3 at Diablo. During a recent
Diamondbacks-Angels game, lawn seats were popular, while closer
seats remained empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best $3 I spent today,'' said Jose Bennett of Mesa.
``I think this stadium has come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Mayland of Tempe said the lawn was best for families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kids. They can't sit in the seats,'' she said. ``Here,
they can run around and see professional baseball. It's cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Cactus League parks have lawn seating. The only exceptions
are the two oldest parks, Hi Corbett Stadium in Tucson and Phoenix
Municipal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Copeland of Seattle, also an annual visitor, said spring
games were more pricey and crowded than they were a few years ago,
but he and his wife, Linda, kept coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are more expensive, but heck, it's still great,'' Linda
Copeland said. &QL;

LOSS TO MEX ICO SHOWS U.S. GROWING PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Bruce Arena emphasizes that this is a work in
progress. And if the new coach of the U.S. men's national team was
disappointed with his first loss, he was equally enthused by the
improvements made thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Arena led a group of relatively young and inexperienced players
into U.S. Cup '99. Growing pains were evident. After dispatching of
underdog Guatemala, 3-1, in the opening match, the Americans took
on fierce rival and battle-tested Mexico in Saturday's championship
game at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Needing only a tie to claim their first U.S. Cup title since
1995, the Americans had just that until the 57th minute. Mexico's
Jose Manuel Abundis, who was a thorn in the U.S. team's side all
afternoon, followed in a header by Joel Sanchez off a corner kick
for the winner in Mexico's 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys played pretty well today,'' Arena said.
``We have some young players, and some of our inexperience showed.
This is another step in our development. We still have a lot of
work to do. Every time we go out there, we learn something else
about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making progress. I'd have to say that after five games
in '99, we've seen a lot of positives.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is 3-1-1 this year, and 3-1-2 overall under Arena,
who took over for Steve Sampson not long after the Americans
struggled in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has brought in several new players and has experimented
with different lineups, in part because many veterans have
commitments overseas and in part to revitalize an aging corps.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defender Eddie Pope said he thought the team was on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some fresh faces out there, and so far we've seen some
positive things,'' Pope said. ``All the new guys have done pretty
well, and that will help us in the long run. I think the more
players you have, the better off you'll be. You'll find that some
are suited for some situations, and some are suited for others.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.S. team was in a familiar situation, playing
in front of a decidedly pro-Mexico crowd of 50,324. The stands were
filled with red, white and green. Horns blared, firecrackers
blasted and all attempts to start chants of ``USA, USA'' were
quickly drowned out by ``Mexico, Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who had not beaten Mexico in the teams' previous
five meetings, fell behind early. Abundis took a pass off a quick
restart and tried to get a centering pass to Rafael Garcia. U.S.
defender Robin Fraser was a tad slow to get back, tripped in the
box and had the ball ricochet off his upper arm past a sprawled
goalkeeper Tony Meola in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Meola, who collided with Garcia, suffered a cut lip and damage
to one tooth. He had to leave the field and was replaced by Zach
Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first goal was just an accident all the way,'' Arena
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans got the equalizer in the 51st minute on a goal by
Frankie Hejduk. Fraser brought the ball out of the right corner and
fired a centering pass that bounced off Mexico's Salvador Carmona
and right to Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give our guys a lot of credit for coming back,'' Arena said.
``They really had to push hard to get that goal back, but it was
disappointing to see them give up that last goal so quickly after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still playing with some unknowns right now. We have
a bunch of players we still have to look at, and I think once we
get our full team together, we'll do well.'' &QL;

SUNS FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL  
 TIME RUNNING OUT IN SHORT SEASON  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With the Suns just five games from the halfway point
of a shortened season, it's time to think about midterm reports. A
grade?
</P>
<P>
   How about an S?
</P>
<P>
   As in survival.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is Coach Danny Ainge's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like survival right now,'' said Ainge, who has
heard ``S'' applied to some four-letter variations amid a growing
chorus of boos during his club's home-floor slide to a .500 record.
``A lot of teams are going through this. This is survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to the playoffs is no easy task. I think 10 teams are
capable of making it.''
</P>
<P>
   But only eight will. At this point, the Suns are the eighth and
final team. If this were the NCAA Tournament, the Suns would be a
bubble team.
</P>
<P>
   With a difficult schedule on the horizon, this bubble could
burst. There already are suggestions that things would be better
for the Suns if it did.
</P>
<P>
   With the their own first-round pick and a second first-rounder
acquired from Dallas in the Steve Nash deal, they could have two
picks (1 through 13) in the draft lottery. Isn't a roll of the dice
for a couple of young prospects better than being blown out in the
playoff's first round by, say, the Los Angeles Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to tell somebody as competitive as Jason Kidd or
Tom Gugliotta to lose?'' Ainge said. ``I can understand that from a
fan's perspective, but not from a player's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of a lot of teams, and I hope they lose to get a
higher draft pick. But I don't want to become part of something
like that. I don't want to develop that kind of an attitude. I'm
trying to eliminate the lackadaisical, lax approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The task doesn't promise to get any easier. After tonight's
visit with Charles Barkley and the Houston Rockets at America West
Arena, there's the road. The Suns play in four cities _ Milwaukee,
Charlotte, Atlanta and Houston _ in five nights. It looks perilous.
Then again, in this curious season, things aren't always as they
appear.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, in fact, might welcome a journey that in any other
year might be their undoing. On the road, they're 6-3. At home,
they're 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be homeless?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But history is full of markers that indicate the road will take
an inevitable toll at some point. For now, the difference between
home and road mystifies Ainge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, our play at home has not been as
passionate,'' he said. ``I don't have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of anything reasonable, Ainge can only search for
what he believes will eventually correct the course. From him, that
means hard-edged, candid comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge's playing days with the Boston Celtics during their
championship run in the mid-1980s is his standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Phoenix, everything was run very
professionally, but there wasn't the same approach and
discipline,'' said Ainge, who joined the Suns as a player in 1992
after stops in Sacramento and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, Boston's old level of discipline, commitment and
leadership is the mark he hopes his Suns will attain. Thus far,
they have fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who plays us knows we're not a disciplined team,''
he said. ``On a scale of 10, we're about a three to a four.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the playoffs, hopefully we could be a five or a six. After
the next training camp, maybe a seven. This won't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership, he said, is the key. In Boston, the mantle fell to
Larry Bird. With the Suns, the job has been given to Kidd, who has
taken on the responsibility in games and, perhaps more important,
in practice.
</P>
<P>
   During the Celtics era, Bird was known for being the last to
leave practice. He was forever working on some element of his game.
On Saturday, Kidd was still on the practice floor 40 minutes after
the workout had ended. This was on the day after he had played 43
minutes in a two-point loss to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of leadership through example is contagious,'' Ainge
said. ``Larry Bird was the reason there were so many in Boston. He
was always on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jason's leadership skills have gone from a two to six
in the last year. As a coach, I'm at about the same stage that he
is as player. We're still learning.''

PLAYERS BACK BELEAGUERED SCHOENFELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago this week, the Coyotes' front office hastily summoned
reporters to discuss the fate of their second head coach in as many
years. After days of deliberations, the team announced that  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Schoenfeld's &UR; job was safe, despite a second-half collapse.
</P>
<P>
   How do they feel now?
</P>
<P>
   After streaking to the best start in franchise history,
Schoenfeld and the Coyotes have hit rock bottom. They entered
Saturday night's grudge match with Anaheim having lost 11 of their
past 13 games, choking away what once was a 17-point lead over the
Mighty Ducks for the No. 4 playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim was in position to tie the Coyotes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Schoenfeld's fault? Some critics and some of the fans say
it is. They don't think he has his players motivated. They don't
like the way he repeatedly shuffles his lines. They think he's too
defense-oriented. They don't think he's getting enough out of his
players. They wonder why he still hasn't fixed the problem with the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   Valid points, all of them. But in Schoenfeld's defense, the
players are professionals and should be able to motivate
themselves. Coaches change lines all the time to find the right
match-up, change the flow, or simply because of ineffective play.
Too much emphasis on defense? Perhaps, but defense wins
championships and Schoenfeld' forechecking system creates offensive
chances in addition to excitement.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the power play stinks. That's a problem. But the biggest
problem of all would be if the players have quit on their coach,
which some people in the organization are starting to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld seems to have the players' support, however.
Publicly, at least, they're saying all the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is struggling, it's a lot easier to blame the
coach or fire the coach than it is to blame the players,'' veteran
center  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Corkum said. ``But the skid that we're in is not a result of
anything that Shoney or (assistants)  &UR; John (Tortorella) or  &UR; Gordie
(Roberts) have done. They've prepared us as well as I've ever been
prepared for games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it enough, that this slump is not their fault.
It's the players in the dressing room, and it has nothing to do
with the coaching staff. We've got to do it ourself and be proud
hockey players. I know there's a lot of talk about (a possible
coaching change), but I sure hope that doesn't happen because I
think Shoney's a stand-up guy and a good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he treading on thin ice, anyway? Certainly. Yeah, there have
been injuries. Lots of them. But nothing like last year's rash,
which gutted the team. Still, Schoenfeld managed to get the Coyotes
to a respectable .500 record, an accomplishment he feels the group
never got enough credit for achieving.
</P>
<P>
   Can he get them out of the funk they're in now? Not if he gets
fired, which could be right around the corner if the Coyotes
continue to stumble. Don't forget, Schoenfeld was a leading
candidate for Coach of the Year just a few short months ago. He
coached in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   But will he keep his job? Has he been given any advance warning
by General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith, who fired  &UR; Don Hay after just one
season specifically to bring in a coach like Schoenfeld?
</P>
<P>
   Smith hasn't exactly made himself available to discuss the
situation, which further clouds the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, though, shouldn't go down without a fight _ or
without his players fighting for him. He said it himself. The
players hold the key to whatever happens from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to take some responsibility for their own actions,''
Schoenfeld said a few days ago. ``There's only so many  &UR; Knute
Rockne speeches you can make, only so many times you can jump up
and down and break things. After a while, it all falls on deaf
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recapture our commitment as a team, as a whole.
Tactically, technically and emotionally. Until we do, we won't win
on a consistent basis. We're going to have a hard time winning,
period. I still think we have the foundation to bring us back. They
have to remember who they are, who they were. It's a matter of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to be the team we were? Or is it too much bother?
It's a decision they have to make themselves.'' &QL; 
Who's the boss?
</P>
<P>
   The whispers have started up in Detroit again regarding the
future of future Hall of Fame Coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman, the winningest
bench boss in NHL history. The gut feeling here is, Bowman will
call it a career after this season, whether or not the Red Wings
threepeat, or record the natural hat trick, as Stanley Cup champs.
</P>
<P>
   Expect either one of the two assistants,  &UR; Barry Smith or  &UR; Dave
Lewis, to take over the reins. Smith is sounding a little impatient
over the whole thing, although he has a valid reason. His contract
is up and he needs to know if he needs to start looking elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to read Scotty's mind about what he's going to do,''
Smith said. ``For us to be waiting, that's not fair. When's he
going to make his decision, late August? What are you supposed to
do, wait all summer long? It just can't happen that way.'' &QL; 
More coach talk
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're on the subject, the word in Chicago appears to
be that the Blackhawks might just keep interim Coach  &UR; Lorne
Molleken around for the long haul. After replacing the fired  &UR; Dirk
Graham, Molleken was seen as a temporary stop gap until a new big
name could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Molleken just might be the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk for all the guys, but I would be very glad to see
the whole staff come back,'' goalie  &UR; Jocelyn Thibault said. ``I
think most of the guys are really happy with the way things are
going right now. It was just a few weeks ago when everything was
kind of dark around here. We didn't see any light. But now, with
Lorne, we have some direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapped again
</P>
<P>
   We know times are tough in Tampa, where the bumbling Lightning
have just stunk up the NHL. But have you noticed what Team Tailspin
has been doing, lately? Take a look at their 10 most recent games:
</P>
<P>
   They beat the Coyotes, 4-2. Lost to Carolina, 3-1. Lost to New
Jersey, 3-2. Beat Philadelphia, 4-1. Lost to Washington, 10-2. Beat
Colorado, 2-1. Beat Montreal, 6-1. Lost to Ottawa, 9-3. Lost to
Toronto, 6-1. Beat Buffalo, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the weirdest team I've ever seen,'' Coach/General
Manager Jacques Demers said. ``I can't figure us out. We're like
yo-yos and it's just not acceptable.'' &QL;

WILL EGOS GET IN WAY OF LAKERS' FATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA's engraver has probably begun etching ``Los Angeles
Lakers'' on the  &UR; Larry O'Brien Trophy, which goes to the league
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Everybody else seems ready to concede a championship.
</P>
<P>
   And on paper, it sure looks as if the Lakers are the team to
beat now and for a long time to come with the deal that brought
them  &UR; Glen Rice from Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get bitter and (ticked) off,'' Milwaukee Coach  &UR; George Karl
said. ``The Lakers get stronger. The Lakers are a very, very
powerful team. And they've gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach  &UR; Pat Riley also said it was a great deal, noting
that forward  &UR; J.R. Reid, who also went to the Lakers, has been
Charlotte's best player this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jerry West, executive vice president of the Lakers, has shown
again why he's regarded as one of the best personnel men in the
game. He got rid of  &UR; Nick Van Exel and signed  &UR; Derek Harper, he
fired  &UR; Del Harris and hired  &UR; Kurt Rambis, he shored up the club's
rebounding deficiency by adding  &UR; Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Lakers already had a nine-game winning streak
going. And now, in Rice, he has a sharpshooter with a rattlesnake's
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our bottom line was that we just didn't feel that we
had anyone here that could make shots on a consistent basis,
particularly when the game was on the line,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   During a nine-year NBA career, Rice has averaged 20.8 points a
game. He has hit 41 percent of his three-point shots. There is no
more pure a shooter in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses now,'' center  &UR; Shaquille O'Neal said.
``We've got to play and not talk about it. I've got my thug
(Rodman), my shooter (Rice),  &UR; Kobe (Bryant). Put that team down on
a piece of paper and it looks pretty darn nice. Now we've got to
apply it to the hardwood. I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a couple of things to keep in mind before awarding
that trophy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Lakers still haven't won anything despite all of
their talent. This is O'Neal's seventh season in the league and
he's been to the Finals once.
</P>
<P>
   Second, why is Rice suddenly healthy?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play a game for Charlotte, which had refused to pay
him what he wanted in a new contract, after undergoing arthroscopic
elbow surgery in January. Yet he pronounced the elbow 100 percent
healthy after the deal, and as if to prove it in his debut Friday
night, he hiked up 21 shots against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, will everybody be able to get along?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wants the ball in his hands on the block. Bryant wants
the ball in his hands, creating off the dribble. And Rice wants it
in his hands behind the three-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Six hands, one basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen Rice is a great shooter, but he's a guy who needs the
ball,'' Orlando's  &UR; Nick Anderson told a reporter from the ``Orlando
Sentinel,'' echoing what many around the NBA are thinking. ``I
don't see how they're going to get enough shots for Shaq, Glen Rice
and Kobe Bryant.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rice, O'Neal and Bryant accept that, the engraver might
as well get started. &QL; 
Nick's not so quick &QL; 
At least to get to practice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Antonio McDyess wanted to play with Van Exel in Denver, and he
got his wish. But if the Nuggets made any assurances to Van Exel
about a new contract for his help in luring the Dice Man out of
Phoenix, you can bet the Nuggets are trying to figure out how to
fudge.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel has been late for two practices now, including one the
day after a loss to the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't come to practice late and stay out all night and
party,'' McDyess said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Van Exel, who is shooting 37 percent overall and 27.8
percent from three-point range, is supposed to be one of the
Nuggets' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He had the nerve to do most of the talking in a team meeting
about the club's struggles. Surely the Nuggets know by now that
they're dealing with a con man. But he's got the same agent as
McDyess,  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. &QL; 
Court vision &QL; 
 &UR; Sam Cassell, when asked about being traded just before he was sent
to Milwaukee in the massive deal that brought  &UR; Stephon Marbury to
New Jersey, wasn't worried: ``It doesn't bother me. . . . I can
play. I can hoop. Me and four blind (expletives) work.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not four blind teammates? With Cassell at point guard, they
would never see the ball anyway. &QL; 
See you in St. Pete &QL; 
 &UR; Charles Barkley, whose Rockets visit Phoenix tonight, told
reporters in Houston that when his Auburn Tigers make it to the
Final Four, he's going _ even if it means missing a game. And he's
planning on that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn is going to the Final Four,'' he said. ``I'm going to
skip a game if they go to the Final Four. I'm going to the Final
Four. I don't care if we're playing the Lakers or anybody, if they
go to the Final Four, I'm going to be there. It's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to win it all. We're the only team that
can beat Duke. The rest of them ought to just pack it in and let
Auburn play Duke. I have great admiration for Coach K  &UR; (Mike
Krzyzewski), but Auburn is spanking them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Rockets are off on March 29, the night of the
national final. &QL; 
How's that? &QL; 
March 23 marks the 20th anniversary of some quirky NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only time three players played for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it all started in November 1978 when Philadelphia beat
New Jersey, 137-133, in overtime. But a protest of the game was
upheld by then-Commissioner  &UR; Larry O'Brien. The game was resumed on
March 23, 1979 with 5:50 to play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers won the game, anyway, this time, 123-117. But in the
interim between the start of the game in November and the finish in
March, the Sixers traded  &UR; Harvey Catchings and  &UR; Ralph Simpson to
the Nets for former Arizona star  &UR; Eric Money and  &UR; Al Skinner. The
names of Catchings, Simpson and Money appear for both teams in the
official box score. Skinner never got into the game for either
team. &QL;

STACY HOT ON TRAIL OF EGGELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Hollis Stacy took a look around tournament headquarters
and noticed an oddity on the leader board of the Welch's/Circle K
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dale Eggeling was clearly out in front with a 12-under
total after three rounds. And, yes, Dottie Pepper was just 1 shot
back, tied with Michelle Redman.
</P>
<P>
   But where was Stacy's name? Had the three-time U.S. Open
champion been forgotten? Were observers discounting her chances
because she's 44 and has not won in eight years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still want me?'' Stacy asked innocently.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for her score and where she stood, Stacy just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 66,'' she said proudly. ``I'm 10 under.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes on the LPGA Tour, where manual leader boards often
can't keep up with the red numbers. Unbelievably, Stacy was 2 shots
off the lead after going 6 under over the last six holes, including
an eagle at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Such an oversight might miff some players. Not the easygoing
Californian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to be here. Thrilled!'' said Stacy, who closed
with four straight birdies. ``I got stuck in that wind tunnel on
Thursday and shot par, even though I double-bogeyed the 17th hole.
That (72), in my mind, was equal to my 66 (Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it goes. It's just such a luck thing with
tee times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Stacy's name finally was posted, it was
misspelled (Stacey).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stacy might end up being overlooked after today. She
is an aging veteran who might have a tough time against the likes
of these strong contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Eggeling is in her prime and always plays well in Tucson. She
has a runner-up finish in 1992, two ties for third and five top-10
finishes. She is ready to win, she just doesn't want to think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be really nice, but I have no vibrations, so to speak,''
said Eggeling, who carved out a 69 with five birdies and two
bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past (when leading), I've said to myself, `You've got
to do this, and you've got to do that.' So I'm not going to think
about a thing besides `swing slow and keep an even tempo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Those words typified Redman's game on a warm and sunny day that
saw her make eight birdies to offset a lone bogey. Her sizzling 65
tied her for the low round of the day _ and week _ with Scotland's
Catriona Matthew, who was 3 shots off the pace at 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   Also tied with Stacy at 10 under was Nancy Scranton, the
third-round co-leader who hung on for a shaky 71.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a favorite going into the final round, it's got to
be Pepper, who made save after save on her way to a 69. When the
heat is on, she usually is as tough as a junkyard dog. Plus, she
has tasted victory in Tucson, during the 1995 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've had my best round yet,'' she warned in the
way only Pepper can.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Se Ri Pak, the LPGA's 1998 Rookie of the
Year. The Korean, who seems to have broken out of an early-season
slump, got into the chase with a 69, leaving her 4 shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Four players were at 7 under, including defending champ Helen
Alfredsson (73) and Kelly Robbins (70), who has a victory this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stacy has to be the sentimental choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the eagle on 13, I knew I could use it to turn my
round around,'' Stacy said of the 3 she set up with a 7-wood from
210 yards that settled two feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't wait to get to the next hole and birdie it.
It's a lot of irony sometimes. When you're playing great, you can't
wait for the next hole. But when you're playing lousy, you can't
wait to get to 18 so the round will be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy even has a secret weapon working for her as she goes after
her 19th career victory: a new ball called the Bald Eagle. The
Taiwanese import, which is legal, has six small spots symmetrically
positioned around the exterior that don't have any dimples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see a difference with it,'' Stacy said. ``The launch is
different, and I'm making a lot of putts because it rolls pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has grown so much the past few years, you've got to be an
engineer anymore to understand the equipment.'' &QL;

STAPLETON GAINS A BIT OF REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The last time the Coyotes met the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, Phoenix center  &UR; Mike Stapleton nearly lost his left eye
when he was dangerously high-sticked in the face by  &UR; Ruslan Salei.
</P>
<P>
   Salei got away with it and wasn't suspended by the NHL, but
Stapleton got some justice of his own Saturday night, scoring early
in the second period to break a scoreless tie with his sixth goal
of the season. And Salei just happened to be one of the defensemen
who got burned on the play.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few things he and his teammates have had to
smile about in a while, considering the Coyotes' recent slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been just one bad day,'' Stapleton said, ``it's been
a month of bad days. We're just trying to pull ourselves out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton missed four games because of the injury, which
required more than 20 stitches, and he's had to wear a shield ever
since. &QL; 
Selanne's streak
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks' right wing  &UR; Teemu Selanne had a 17-game,
point-scoring streak snapped during Friday's 4-0 loss in Dallas. It
was the second-longest streak in the NHL this season, just one game
behind Philadelphia's  &UR; Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   The streak would have continued had a second-period rebound goal
by Selanne on the power play not been called back because
defenseman
 &UR; Fredrik Olausson had his skate in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke,'' Selanne said, noting Olausson's foot in no
way obstructed Stars goalie  &UR; Eddie Belfour. ``That rule is ruining
hockey. It's not because my streak was ended. It had nothing to do
with the play. I feel ashamed for hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's streak was the eighth-longest of the 1990s.  &UR; Mats
Sundin had a 30-game streak while playing for Quebec.  &UR; Adam Oates
had a 25-game streak with Boston,  &UR; Wayne Gretzy 21 with Los Angeles
and  &UR; Brett Hull 20 with St. Louis. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Former Coyotes enforcer  &UR; Jim McKenzie, now of the Mighty Ducks,
explaining his scrum Friday night with the Stars' Belfour, in which
both players traded a few shoves and cross-checks:
</P>
<P>
   ``I forechecked him and maybe bumped him a little. I didn' hit
him,'' said McKenzie, who was handed two minutes for slashing, two
minutes for cross-checking and a 10-minute misconduct. ``Then he
hit me and I hit him. Then he said something about Duke winning the
national title and I said it would be UConn and it escalated from
there.''

DIMAGGIO MISSED HEINZ BONUS BY 1 GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's passing of  &UR; Joe DiMaggio brought out countless
stories about the Yankee Clipper's life and baseball career. The
words of praise poured in from nearly all corners of the continent
for the player who many believe was the most graceful to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly every aspect of DiMaggio's life was covered in some
way, there were a few items that didn't surface last week.
</P>
<P>
   Below are some little-known tidbits about DiMaggio:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Clipper had a $5,000 bonus check awaiting him if he
hit safely in one more game during his record 56-game hitting
streak. Heinz (as in Heinz 57 sauce) was prepared to sign DiMaggio
to an endorsement deal for $5,000, which was an amazing figure,
considering that DiMaggio's pay in 1941 was $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   While his prowess in Yankee Stadium's gaping center field was
legendary, remember that DiMaggio had little help from his corner
outfielders back then.  &UR; Tommy Henrich and  &UR; Charlie Keller were
little more than human statues defensively who were in the lineup
because they could hit.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio told Diamondbacks managing general partner
 &UR; Jerry Colangelo last September, when the two spent hours together
in Chicago, that he would gladly throw out the first pitch at
Arizona's home opener April 12 against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, a three-time Most Valuable Player, hit .408 during his
record 56-game hitting streak. Ted Williams hit .406 for the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was tagged with the nickname ``Yankee Clipper'' when
then-Washington Senators radio broadcaster  &UR; Arch
 &UR; MacDonald described the Yankee center fielder moving with the grace
of a clipper ship gliding across the waves during a broadcast
sometime around 1940.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting sidelight that stood out during all the hours of
DiMaggio footage shown the day he died: Take a look at his upper
body without a shirt on. There were no built-up pecs or washboard
stomach. Yet he still managed to hit 361 home runs in a 13-year
career. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that  &UR; Cal Ripken's major league record consecutive games
streak ended at 2,632 late last season, name the player with the
longest current streak heading into the 1999 season. &QL; 
She may have a point &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta owner  &UR; Ted Turner tripped all over himself last month
with controversial comments he made during a speech to the National
Family Planning and Reproductive Association. While his comments
fall short of those by Cincinnati owner  &UR; Marge Schott, who once
said  &UR; Adolf Hitler had good ideas but went too far, Turner didn't
seem to stray too far away from the Reds' embattled owner.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure, Turner is in some hot water with baseball, the type
that could easily result in a fine and a mandate to take
sensitivity courses.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were Turner's comments on Feb. 16 when he urged Pope
John Paul II to ``get with it _ welcome to the 20th century'' and
suggested that adultery should be stricken from the Ten
Commandments. He also referred to his upraised foot as a ``Polish
mine detector.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig said he is taking the matter very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how Ted Turner can get away with what he
said,'' Schott told Cincinnati area reporters last week. ``I didn't
say anything or do anything worse than what he said.'' &QL; 
Young and relentless &QL; 
Pittsburgh first baseman  &UR; Kevin Young couldn't help but reflect on
where his baseball career has gone in the last few years recently.
After signing a four-year $24 million deal to remain with the
Pirates, Young recalled exactly how far he's come.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Young was cut from Pittsburgh's camp during the final
week of spring training in 1996 so Pittsburgh could keep utility
man  &UR; John
 &UR; Wehner. Young was later let go by Kansas City, of all clubs, at the
end of the same season. Now he's considered one of the top players
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but when I sat down in (general manager)  &UR; Cam
Bonifay's office to finish this contract, I was thinking it was the
same place where I had been released,'' the Ahwatukee resident
said. ``When I step back and think about it, it really is a nice
story. It's pretty amazing.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Baltimore teammate  &UR; Albert Belle has the longest current streak in
the majors at 366 consecutive games. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; The 1990s ballplayer: Toronto pitcher  &UR; David Wells recently
disclosed that he and former MVP  &UR; Kirk Gibson will co-own a jet
plane. Wells wants to take lessons and get his pilot's license so
he can fly when his playing days end.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The 1990s ballplayer II: While Cleveland outfielder
 &UR; Manny Ramirez decided to change his hair color back to black (it
was orange at the end of last season), Cincinnati pitcher  &UR; Denny
Neagle has gone from brown hair to platinum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Jim Walewander.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New meaning to the term  &UR; ``dead ball'': Maintenance crews
discovered more than 12,000 cubic yards (which we can only assume
is a very large load) of lead-contaminated soil where center field
will be at San Francisco's new Pac Bell Ballpark, which will open
in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Catcher  &UR; Todd Hundley, on whom Los Angeles is counting to be the
club's big run-producer, is scheduled to make his debut behind the
plate when the Dodgers meet St. Louis today. The big question, of
course, is how well Hundley's surgically-repaired elbow is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer  &UR; Yogi Berra disclosed last week how much he earned
in post-season money after winning six World Series championships
with the New York Yankees and losing two others. Berra said he
earned $43,000 for his eight World Series trips. The Yankees
individual full shares for winning last season's World Series were
$313,000.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming no one beats him to it,  &UR; Omar Daal's next shutout will
give him two and the all-time record in Diamondbacks' very short
history. Big deal? Well, the all-time record for shutouts by the
six-year-old Colorado Rockies is two, by  &UR; Roger Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Florida pitcher  &UR; Jesus Sanchez, a native of the Dominican
Republic, is planning to remain in the United States when this
season ends and he wants to run in the New York City Marathon.
Sanchez has won two marathons in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whitey Herzog, who managed six first-place finishes, on new
Detroit Manager  &UR; Larry Parrish: ``I have no qualms that he'll do a
good job. He's been around enough that he can evaluate his players.
And he won't have any silly rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the  &UR; Jose Guillen visa problem has been cleared up, it
can be revealed that the Pittsburgh Pirates summoned the help of
Pennsylvania's U.S, Senators,  &UR; Arlen Specter and  &UR; Rick
 &UR; Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Dodgers GM  &UR; Kevin Malone is throwing out signals that pitcher &UR; Dave
Mlicki may not necessarily be the pitcher the club plans to trade
this spring.  &UR; Ismael Valdez's name has not been eliminated from the
list of LA's available pitchers. Anaheim may be very interested in
Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota GM  &UR; Terry Ryan can deny it until he's blue in the
face, but other clubs are convinced Twins ace  &UR; Brad Radke, who will
be paid about one-sixth of the total payroll, can be had in a
trade, especially if the right prospects are dangled.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Joe Oliver looking like he's ready to assume Tampa Bay's
every day catching duties, the Devil Rays may be willing to trade
one of the other catchers on their roster,  &UR; John Flaherty or
 &UR; Mike DeFelice.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Bryce Florie looking very mediocre so far this spring,
Detroit is considering an almost  &UR; Dwight Gooden-like move,
promoting a pitcher from Class A to the majors.  &UR; Jeff Weaver, the
Tigers' No. 1 draft pick last summer, has impressed the Tigers to
the point that this idea is fairly serious.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Kevin Appier sweepstakes began in earnest last week when
the right-hander looked up to see 17 scouts in the stands for his
spring debut. If Appier remains healthy, look for him to be dealt
(with Cleveland a strong possibility) before the start of the
season. &QL;

BENES NOT WORRIED ABOUT ERRATIC START TO SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It's mid-March, so Diamondbacks pitcher Andy Benes
isn't too concerned he's yet to get his pitch limit beyond the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, in his third start this spring, gave up three runs on
three hits _ including a home run by left fielder Angel Echevarria
and a two-run double by leadoff man Curtis Goodwin _ against the
Colorado Rockies on Saturday at Tucson Electric Park. He walked
pitcher Brian Bohannon in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' said Benes, who walked two and struck out two.
``I'm in good shape. I was a little erratic today.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said he still thought Benes was ahead of
where he had been this time last year. Benes started last season
slow but finished strong, winning seven of his last nine decisions
to end 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making progress,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Benes said he couldn't remember where he had been last year at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is to be in good shape and to build up,'' he
said. ``Obviously, the results aren't what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes said he felt he had decent command of his fastball,
curveball and change-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four of the five curveballs were strikes,'' he said. ``It
wasn't real pinpoint, but it's not like I was all over the place. I
was maybe overthrowing at times. The good thing is that when I
missed, I missed down. My delivery wasn't the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett said Benes had ``good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spotting his fastball at both sides of the plate,''
Stinnett said. ``He was spotting his slider, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes will pitch again in four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a streak of two (innings an outing),'' he said. ``Maybe
next time, I'll get over that.'' &QL; 
On the side &QL; 
Closer Gregg Olson, bothered by tendinitis in his wrist, will join
the Diamondbacks in Scottsdale today and will throw on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he anticipated Olson being able to pitch in a
game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually run into a bout of tendinitis right about now,''
Olson said. ``I'll be all right. I just have to take care of it.'' &QL; 
Shortstops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks on Saturday had their nine-game winning streak
snapped by the Rockies, the team that last beat them March 4 in
their Cactus League opener.
</P>
<P>
   With today's game against the San Francisco Giants being
televised regionally by Fox Sports Net Arizona, Showalter said he
would likely bring his A team to Scottsdale Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams, first baseman Travis Lee, second
baseman Jay Bell and shortstop Danny Klassen will make the trip
from Tucson. Omar Daal will start on the mound, with Brian Anderson
expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   On utilityman Andy Fox, who played every position but catcher
and pitcher last season, Showalter said, ``I look at him as a
regular irregular.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he would likely go down to the wire before
picking his 25-man opening day roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we're at 30 once we're done with
the exhibition games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett earned the first Don &AMP; Charlie's Cactus
League Player of the Week award for March 4-11. Stinnett capped it
with a pair of three-run homers on Thursday. He gets a $100 gift
certificate from Don &AMP; Charlie's Restaurant in Scottsdale. &QL;

DELLUCCI PLANS TO PACE HIM SELF THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ David Dellucci is starting to realize that he doesn't
have to hit until his hands bleed, that he doesn't have to go to
bed wondering if he's going to be in the lineup the next day, that
he doesn't have to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   No stress, no duress. That's his motto this spring. He's taking
it into the batting cage, to the game, taking it home.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, trying to win an outfield position with the
Diamondbacks, where he made a sudden splash last season before
flaming out late during his rookie year, says , ``I've learned to
pace myself. It's going to make me stronger in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about just relaxing. If I'm going to take extra
cuts, maybe I'll just take 10 or 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dellucci would take his bat and hit endlessly in the
cage after an 0-for-4 game or after striking out in a pinch-hit
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a slump and realized how long a major-league season
was,'' he said. ``It got to where, if I had a bad game, I'd go in
the cage and take 400 swings after a game until midnight. I really
wore myself out before the season was even close to being over.''
</P>
<P>
   After a splendid start to his major-league career, after hitting
safely in 10 of his first 25 at bats, after chasing down flies and
making acrobatic catches in left field, expectations grew and the
25-year-old from Baton Rouge, La., began to press.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, who was recalled from Triple-A Tucson after 17 games
last year, lost his everyday job in left after Bernard Gilkey came
over from the New York Mets in an August trade. In part-time duty,
he had nine hits in his last 53 at bats. He end up hitting .260
with 51 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   There was confidence gained by his National League-leading 12
triples. He became only the second rookie since 1984 to lead the
league in that category and the first since Ray Lankford at St.
Louis in '91.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Dellucci isn't thinking of leading the league in
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal now is to make the Opening Day roster and work my way
in from there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough, even for a man of Dellucci's versatility (he
started all three outfield positions last year).
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks lost center fielder Devon White to free agency,
but added Steve Finley, Luis Gonzalez and Dante Powell. Tony Womack
is being turned into an outfielder and is penciled in as the
Diamondbacks' leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Gilkey, who is back, after having his vision
surgically corrected late last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David took a big step last year,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``He and Travis have that same mindset, that `I can
do this' mentality now.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed swinging Dellucci is showing that this spring,
while Womack and Gilkey have been out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He was hitting .500 (8 for 16) with three doubles and six RBIs
in seven Cactus League games. And he's struck out only three times.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in 416 plate appearances, Dellucci struck out 103
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appears more comfortable out there,'' Showalter said. ``He
hit stretches of challenges last year. You have to play at the top
of your game to compete at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after the season ended, Dellucci worked on the mental game.
He stopped thinking about baseball around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   An avid pro wrestling fan, he hung out with World champion Kevin
Nash, a Valley resident, and went back home to Baton Rouge, where
he worked out and read his name in trade rumors on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ever rule that out,'' he said. ``Until it really
happens, I'm an Arizona Diamondback. I love this team. I love the
coaches. I don't want to be anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a late-inning pinch hitter, or as a defensive
replacement, Dellucci says he doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult going from playing every day to coming
off the bench or playing every third or fourth day,'' Dellucci
said. ``That's tough. I'm really concentrating now on excelling in
maybe that ninth-inning pinch hit or any little thing I can do.''

ILL WINDS BREW ING UP TROUBLE FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA - Even when they should be sailing along with a gentle
breeze at their backs, the New York Yankees can't help but be at
the center of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off their 125 wins last season, which culminated with the
club's record-24th World Series championship, it would seem the
Yankees would be a sea of tranquility, especially since all the
core players were re-signed during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, swirling storms have surrounded the Yankees' Tampa
complex, providing enough riveting story lines to cover a full
season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are the Yankees, easily the game's most-storied
franchise. Nothing is ever simple and easy with this club. There's
no real reason for it all, except that the baseball gods seem to
have mandated that the Yankees remain the most intriguing and
newsworthy club in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider everything that has already occurred with the Yankees
in the month since pitchers and catchers reported:
</P>
<P>
   They started with a bang, setting the baseball world on its side
with the blockbuster trade that resulted with five-time Cy Young
Award winner Roger Clemens coming and David Wells, who had a Babe
Ruth-type body and a way of living that seemed to make him a
perfect Yankee, going.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, one of the greatest Yankees ever, returned to the
Yankees family after reconciling a 14-year estrangement from owner
George Steinbrenner. To add perspective to the magnitude of the
event, remember that Bernie Williams, who has been in the
organization since 1986, met Berra for the first time last month.
</P>
<P>
   The club, and baseball, suffered a huge blow when Joe DiMaggio,
a member of Yankee royalty, died last week. The club will wear a
No. 5 patch on their left sleeve throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter, who has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease
(imagine the irony there), came to camp to throw out the first
pitch for the exhibition season. He has been a beacon of courage as
he battles one of the most debilitating afflictions known. Already,
Hunter can no longer even raise his arm for a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   On the very day Darryl Strawberry returned from extensive
chemotherapy treatments to battle colon cancer, Manager Joe Torre
checked out of camp after he had been told he has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Torre's absence from the club he has guided to
two World Series titles in three years, the manager's office here
remains locked. Don Zimmer, the interim manager, refuses to even
walk into the office of one of his best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bizarre,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``You
see the door closed and all. We know we've got a good team, but
there have been some very bad things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is apparently leaning toward surgery, a more aggressive
approach to combating his cancer. It also could mean Torre will be
away from the club for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial and explosive-tempered pitcher Hideki Irabu, who
has had dark clouds surrounding him since he joined the Yankees,
has been basically the equivalent of a piece of furniture in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the sullen mood in and around the clubhouse, the
Yankees are preparing for a potential bombshell in the coming
weeks. Strawberry, who played for the first time this spring on
Wednesday, insists he's ready to go for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Yankees suffered the only two arbitration losses by
the owners (in Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera), giving the Yankees
a combined loss of $3 million. So, Steinbrenner is searching for
ways to pare the $88 million payroll and the looming $5 million
luxury tax payment.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be to keep Strawberry off the active roster as
long as possible. Even one month could wind up saving the Yankees
close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, these are emotional times around the Yankee compound.
But when it's all said and done, it's just a part of being
associated with the Yankees. &QL;

IOWA KEEPS DAVIS WORKING OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ What's the difference between a pit bull and Iowa Coach
Tom Davis?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the pit bull lets go.
</P>
<P>
   Not Davis nor his Iowa Hawkeyes, though. Not yet, anyway. Davis,
whose contract was not renewed by Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby at
the start of his 13th season, is supposed to be through as the Iowa
head coach as of their final game. The thing is, the Hawkeyes keep
putting it off.
</P>
<P>
   The end appeared imminent Saturday at McNichols Arena when Iowa
trailed the Arkansas Razorbacks by 13 points early in the second
half of their NCAA West Region second-round game. But in a
frantically played, fun-to-watch game of big runs by both teams,
Iowa ran last and ran best. The fifth-seeded Hawkeyes defeated the
fourth-seeded Razorbacks, 82-72, to advance to the regional
semifinals and a date with Connecticut on Thursday at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight, we dig down and find a way,'' said senior guard Kent
McCausland, who made 5 of 7 three-pointers in the second half to
lead the comeback after going 0 for 2 in the first. ``We have some
fight left in us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes outscored the Hogs, 23-6, over the last 7:20.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whose job has practically been handed to Southwest
Missouri State Coach Steve Alford, was moved nearly to tears after
the game, engaging in group hugs with his staff and players. Asked
to put his feelings and thoughts into words, Davis said, ``I don't
think I can do it justice. My focus all year has been to try to
involve myself with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we're doing the best we can. And I feel like we've
been doing it for 13 years at Iowa. I've just been giving it my
best shot. And if I fall short, I fall short. I'm just going to get
this team as well-prepared as I can and have as much fun as I can
and not worry about the bigger questions. The bigger questions I'll
try to answer when this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   That likely will be after the Connecticut game, but the way this
Iowa team is juiced, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emotions have been carrying us all year, there's no
question, and we'll play hard,'' Davis said. ``If we lose the game,
it won't be because we weren't busting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hawkeyes and Razorbacks were busting it, defying the
mile-high altitude and alternately seizing control at a frenetic
pace. Arkansas overcame a 19-10 deficit and led by seven at
halftime as its pressure forced Iowa into 16 turnovers in the first
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Walker, who had a game-high 22 points, hit one of his
six three-pointers (in 12 attempts), Arkansas led, 47-34, with
18:21 to go. Then it was Iowa's turn. With McCausland heating up,
the Hawkeyes ran off 16 points and 23 of the next 29 to go ahead,
57-53, with 11:24 remaining. Back came Arkansas, on a 13-2 run.
McCausland and Co. returned fire, scoring 12 straight to take a
71-66 lead with 4:35 left. Arkansas got within one on a Kareem Reid
three-pointer with 2:26 left, but Iowa closed the game with nine
straight points.
</P>
<P>
   McCausland and point guard Dean Oliver each had 17 points for
the Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was helter-skelter out there the entire second half,'' said
Iowa forward Jess Settles, a sixth-year senior. ``Half the time, I
don't think either team knew what defense they were playing.'' &QL;

UCONN'S FAST START DOOMS NEW MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - Before their game Saturday against Connecticut, New
Mexico players spoke of the Huskies with reverence, saying that it
was a privilege just to share the same court with the No. 1 seed in
the West Region of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But that privilege turned into a curse from the second the ball
was tossed in the air to start the game. Connecticut scored the
first 17 points and held New Mexico without a point for the first
7:12 and without a basket for the first 8:14. They followed that
with an 11-0 run to open the second half and coasted to a 78-56
victory in a second-round game at McNichols Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly feel better today than I did a couple of days ago
for two reasons,'' said Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun, who returned
to the sideline after missing Thursday's victory over Texas-San
Antonio because of a virus. ``Most of all because of how our team
played.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico (25-9) shot 26.3 percent from the field. Center Kenny
Thomas, the Lobos leading scorer this season, scored one point,
about 18 under his average, and managed just six shots. It was the
first time Thomas, a senior, had gone without a field goal in his
career, a span of 123 games. Lamont Long, the team's second leading
scorer, had 15 points, but missed 14 of 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played great defense, right down to a man,'' said
Calhoun, who earned his 300th victory at Connecticut. ``Even if we
don't shoot well today, we would have been awfully tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (30-2) will play fifth-seeded Iowa on Thursday in
the region semifinals at America West Arena. The players are on
spring break, so the Huskies were scheduled to fly to Phoenix
today.
</P>
<P>
   Two victories in Phoenix will put the Huskies in the Final Four
for the first time, even though this is the sixth time in the 1990s
that they've been seeded first or second.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut won its two games here by an average of about 24
points, prompting some to ask if the Huskies are trying to send a
message to Duke, the favorite to win the tournament. Calhoun
scoffed at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where Duke is operating right now, they can't hear the
rest of us,'' Calhoun said. ``They're too far away, not getting any
messages. Home alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton and point guard Khalid El-Amin
led Connecticut Saturday with 21 points apiece, but the Huskies
struggled offensively at times, shooting just 37.5 percent in the
first half. They made up for it with their suffocating defense.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has a history of poor performances in the NCAA tournament
and after a few misses Saturday, his interest seemed to wane,
leaving New Mexico without a low post game. Thomas downplayed his
performance, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had great games,'' he said. ``I had a great game before
this (20 points against Missouri on Thursday). Just because it's
UConn doesn't mean anything. I just couldn't make a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lobos opened in a 2-3 zone to try and slow UConn, but the
17-0 run forced them into man-to-man defense. It worked for a while
as they drew within 9 , but success was fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you draw up in the dirt doesn't always work when the
other team has better players,'' said New Mexico Coach Dave Bliss. &QL;

GATORS WIN, BUT WEBER STEALS SHOW

   SEATTLE _ Florida Coach Billy Donovan finally found a
show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a 2-3 zone defense midway through the second half to
try to frustrate Weber State forward Harold ``The Show'' Arceneaux,
who had 21 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Arceneaux went 3 of 11 from the field in regulation and 1 of 4
in overtime as the sixth-seeded Gators wore down the Big Sky
champions and won, 82-74, Saturday in an NCAA West Regional
second-round game at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (22-8) advances to a regional semifinal match-up against
10th-seeded Gonzaga on Thursday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switching to the zone got them to stand around a little bit,''
Donovan said of the 14th-seeded Wildcats. ``We knew their quickness
would cause us problems while they were fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had to play man-to-man the first 30 minutes to
set the pace and wear them down. You allow Arceneaux and (guard
Eddie) Gill to be fresh at the end, they are good enough to beat
you by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Arceneaux almost single-handedly beat third-seeded North
Carolina in the first round, getting 36 points, tying the most ever
scored against the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever nicknamed him `The Show' did him a disservice,''
Gators freshman guard Teddy Dupay said. ``He's the best player I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators used their full-court press to try to tire Arceneaux
and then rotated two or three defenders against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to limit his number of touches,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work in the first half. Arceneaux hit 8 of 12 field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to make some big money some day,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Gators went to the zone in the second half, Weber
State started standing around on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Florida rallied for a 58-53 lead and seemed to have the game in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not moving the ball,'' said Weber State Coach Ron
Abegglen, who apparently has coached his last game for the
Wildcats. ``We were not cutting players to the holes. We were not
aware of the shot clock.''
</P>
<P>
   During several of the Wildcats' possessions late in the game,
they had to throw up desperation shots because the shot clock was
about to run out.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with eight seconds left in regulation and
Florida leading, 68-66. But Gators forward Kenyan Weaks fouled
Wildcats guard Noel Jackson on a wild three-point attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made 2 of 3 free throws to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Jackson a lot of credit,'' Donovan said.
``He's a veteran guy, and, obviously, it was not an intelligent
play by Kenyan Weaks.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, the Gators took control from the outset. Center
Greg Stolt scored back-to-back baskets inside for a four-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State, 25-8, made only two field goals in overtime and was
forced to foul late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fatigued at the end,'' Abegglen said. &QL;

ILL WINDS BREWING UP TROUBLE FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA - Even when they should be sailing along with a gentle
breeze at their backs, the New York Yankees can't help but be at
the center of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off their 125 wins last season, which culminated with the
club's record-24th World Series championship, it would seem the
Yankees would be a sea of tranquility, especially since all the
core players were re-signed during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, swirling storms have surrounded the Yankees' Tampa
complex, providing enough riveting story lines to cover a full
season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are the Yankees, easily the game's most-storied
franchise. Nothing is ever simple and easy with this club. There's
no real reason for it all, except that the baseball gods seem to
have mandated that the Yankees remain the most intriguing and
newsworthy club in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider everything that has already occurred with the Yankees
in the month since pitchers and catchers reported:
</P>
<P>
   They started with a bang, setting the baseball world on its side
with the blockbuster trade that resulted with five-time Cy Young
Award winner Roger Clemens coming and David Wells, who had a Babe
Ruth-type body and a way of living that seemed to make him a
perfect Yankee, going.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, one of the greatest Yankees ever, returned to the
Yankees family after reconciling a 14-year estrangement from owner
George Steinbrenner. To add perspective to the magnitude of the
event, remember that Bernie Williams, who has been in the
organization since 1986, met Berra for the first time last month.
</P>
<P>
   The club, and baseball, suffered a huge blow when Joe DiMaggio,
a member of Yankee royalty, died last week. The club will wear a
No. 5 patch on their left sleeve throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter, who has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease
(imagine the irony there), came to camp to throw out the first
pitch for the exhibition season. He has been a beacon of courage as
he battles one of the most debilitating afflictions known. Already,
Hunter can no longer even raise his arm for a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   On the very day Darryl Strawberry returned from extensive
chemotherapy treatments to battle colon cancer, Manager Joe Torre
checked out of camp after he had been told he has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Torre's absence from the club he has guided to
two World Series titles in three years, the manager's office here
remains locked. Don Zimmer, the interim manager, refuses to even
walk into the office of one of his best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bizarre,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``You
see the door closed and all. We know we've got a good team, but
there have been some very bad things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is apparently leaning toward surgery, a more aggressive
approach to combating his cancer. It also could mean Torre will be
away from the club for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial and explosive-tempered pitcher Hideki Irabu, who
has had dark clouds surrounding him since he joined the Yankees,
has been basically the equivalent of a piece of furniture in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the sullen mood in and around the clubhouse, the
Yankees are preparing for a potential bombshell in the coming
weeks. Strawberry, who played for the first time this spring on
Wednesday, insists he's ready to go for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Yankees suffered the only two arbitration losses by
the owners (in Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera), giving the Yankees
a combined loss of $3 million. So, Steinbrenner is searching for
ways to pare the $88 million payroll and the looming $5 million
luxury tax payment.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be to keep Strawberry off the active roster as
long as possible. Even one month could wind up saving the Yankees
close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, these are emotional times around the Yankee compound.
But when it's all said and done, it's just a part of being
associated with the Yankees. &QL;

GONZAGA MAKES A NAME FOR IT SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Jesuit priest sitting on the end of Gonzaga's
bench compared the enormity of the event to the first time he
witnessed a cow-milking contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been so giddy since I was 6 years old and went to
the Illinois State Fair in Du Quoin, and that was 60 years ago,''
Father Tony Lehmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with the agricultural theme, Don Monson, father of the
Gonzaga coach, congratulated center Jeremy Eaton, the team's
resident cowboy, by saying, ``I bet this is even better than roping
steers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-seeded Bulldogs' 82-74 victory over second-seeded and
Pac-10 champion Stanford in the second round of the NCAA West
regional on Saturday at KeyArena sent them to Thursday's semifinal
round at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It also put Gonzaga (27-6) on the basketball map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long road for them to get recognition, for
people to learn how to pronounce `Gon-zah-guh,' '' Coach Dan Monson
said. ``People now know we're not just a freak show . . . This is
not a Cinderella story. It's about us being a good basketball
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Matt Santangelo, who scored a team-high 22 points, said
more than just the school gets mispronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows where Spokane is, or how to pronounce it,'' he
said. ``They said we were from `Spo-kanny' one time in Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, Final Four participants a year ago, led only once _ at
1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, the fourth and final Pac-10 team to be eliminated
from the NCAA tournament, caught the Bulldogs once in the second
half, but never slowed down their three guards _ Santangelo, Richie
Frahm and Quentin Hall, who combined for 51 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt coming to the tournament they were the team in the
bracket that was scary because a lot of people didn't know about
them, but I knew they were legit,'' said Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team ended its season at 26-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping Minnesota would beat them (in the first round).
We get caught up in the name game, but they have very skilled
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guards are very confident . . . The thing (the Bulldogs)
have to do is realize they're good. They play the way they did
today, they're capable of beating a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-taller Cardinal, one of the most physical teams in the
nation, was supposed to have the big edge inside. But Stanford was
outrebounded, 47-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most we've been outrebounded all year,'' Montgomery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, Gonzaga's 5-foot-8 point guard, had a team-high eight
rebounds. Only Stanford's Mark Madsen, a 6-9 forward, had more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known to rebound,'' Hall said, smiling. ``I'm about 6-8
when it comes to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, West Coast Conference champions, killed Stanford
with three-point shots, hitting 11 of 20. Santangelo, the best
Gonzaga player since Utah Jazz guard John Stockton, hit all three
of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford senior guard Arthur Lee, meanwhile, was only 6 of 18
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' Santangelo said. ``We're still
`John Stockton U.' We definitely have created our own identity, but
he's the best there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal was forced to foul in the final two minutes to try
to cut into Gonzaga's 10-point lead. But the Bulldogs hit 13 of 16
free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's players said they expected a big crowd to be waiting
for them when the arrived back in Spokane today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little different,'' Frahm said. ``We'll probably go
celebrate with a tall glass of milk.'' &QL;

WILDCATS: THE BEST AND WORST OF TIMES  
 HOPE, SENIORS' LEGACY SURVIVE UPSETTING FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ In final analysis, Arizona's basketball season was
better than expected at the beginning, but worst than expected at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Wildcats overachieved with a senior point guard
who never had started but became a first-team All-American, and
with five freshmen, three of whom started.
</P>
<P>
   It was anticipated that UA would take a step backward on the
national scene, perhaps being a top-20 team rather than the top-10
team it had been while winning the national title in 1997 and while
reaching the Elite Eight in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a rebuilding year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats reached the NCAA Tournament, keeping alive a
15-year streak _ the second-longest of all time _ with a 22-6
regular-season mark. They were the No. 4 seed in the Midwest
Region. Advancing to the Sweet 16 had become a reachable goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then the people most responsible for the overachievement, point
guard Jason Terry and senior center A.J. Bramlett, came up empty
Friday in a 61-60 first-round upset loss to 13th-seeded Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona wasn't alone. Twelve times in the opening 32 games, the
lower seeded team won, a tournament record for opening-round
upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.T. and I worked hard for this program,'' Bramlett said. ``I
don't think it's going to sink in for a few days that this was our
last game together. With all the inexperience, we really had a good
season for the team we had. We should have done more here in the
tournament, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry and Bramlett played on teams that went 11-3 in four years
at the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have relied on the two seniors to carry a tremendous
load,'' said UA Coach Lute Olson. ``It's a shame it had to end in
the first game in their last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the great things they did in their time here, the most
important is the legacy they leave with these freshmen _ and not
just in the won-loss records, but in leading with their work ethic
every day in practice. That is going to pay off for us in the years
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The five freshmen will be the heart of the team next year. A
sixth member of the freshman class, Luke Walton, was red-shirted
after suffering a fractured foot in preseason. He will move into
the class with incoming freshman guards Jason Gardner of
Indianapolis North Central High and Gilbert Arenas of Van Nuys,
Calif., Grant High.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (5-foot-11, 170 pounds) is regarded as the No. 1 point
guard prospect in the country by ``Prep Star'' magazine. He is
expected to step into Terry's position and start as a freshman, as
Mike Bibby did the year he took UA to the NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas (6-3, 193 pounds) is listed as the No. 4 shooting guard
prospect by ``Prep Star.'' He will challenge Ruben Douglas at
shooting guard.

   Walton (6-8, 229 pounds), son of basketball Hall of Famer Bill
Walton, returned to practice last month. Olson said Walton could
have played comparably with the other freshmen then, but he didn't
want to waste a season for Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luke is as dependable a guy as we've had here doing rehab,''
Olson said. ``He worked very hard. He doesn't look like he lost a
whole lot other than conditioning. He can still do the things he
had done so well up to the time he got hurt _ his passing, his
understanding of the game, setting backscreens, downscreens. It's
just amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on that, I might prescribe a couple of months off for a
couple of our other guys. It's obvious when he was on the sidelines
he wasn't counting light bulbs in McKale. He was paying attention
to what's going on. We were not going to use him, but he could have
played pretty quickly at the four and made up some ground on people
in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton said he had no pain in his foot for the first time in
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating year for me, but I'm sure it's going to
help me long-term to red-shirt,'' Walton said. ``I need to be
stronger and quicker. This year made me realize what I need to do
for next year. I was looking forward to playing with this freshman
class. It was a great class this year. It's going to be a great one
next year, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This might have been Olson's best freshman class. Power forward
Michael Wright, the Pac-10 freshman of the year, will be among the
top players in the conference next season and possibly an
All-American candidate. He has proven that he can get the tough
rebound and can score from the low post with proficiency. He will
be a go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is going to have a great career here,'' Olson said.
``He did not play like a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jefferson, who started at small forward, might be the
most athletic in the class. He will have to be a more consistent
scorer and defender as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a taste of what it's all about this year,'' Wright
said. ``I just feel bad for our seniors because J.T. and A.J. have
meant so much to our program. I wish we could have sent them out
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot from them, and we'll learn a lot from this
experience. I know we'll come back hungry next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-factor is center Loren Woods, a 7-foot-2 transfer from
Wake Forest who sat out this season. He will be a junior. Woods was
a freshman All-American and a member of the Atlantic Coast
Conference all-rookie team in 1997 when he was billed as the next
Tim Duncan. Whether he has the strength and work ethic to pick up
where Bramlett left off remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   This was a young UA team, but the next one will be even younger.
Joining the eight freshmen and sophomores along with Woods will be
forward Justin Wessel, a junior, and forward Eugene Edgerson, who
will be the only senior.
</P>
<P>
   If Gardner is anything close to being the next Bibby, as many
are touting him to be, the Wildcats will have a reasonable chance
of posting their 13th 20-win season and their 16th successive NCAA
Tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll still be regarded as being a year away. &QL;

AS USUAL, PARCELLS TO SKIP NFL EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Bill Parcells won't need a note from his doctor to
miss this week's NFL meetings at the Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   His pulse is OK. He doesn't have a desert hangover. The stress
from sipping cocktails around the pool won't be too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   It's on Parcells' schedule every spring to skip the league's
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine coaches and Coach  &UR; Al Davis of the Raiders show up
regularly, while Parcells, bigger than the league, almost always is
a no-show. He heads for his winter home in Jupiter, Fla., to get
some `R and R.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells always finds an excuse not to come and gets away with
it, just as he got his doctor to excuse him from last month's Pro
Bowl. He wasn't on his death bed. He just didn't want to take the
long flight to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Ahi gets away with it because the league refuses to force
him to attend.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Parcells doesn't find time to fit the league
meetings into his busy schedule. He misses some great
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Last time the owners met in Phoenix, four years ago,  &UR; Jimmy
Johnson and  &UR; Barry Switzer carried on a civil conversation. A year
earlier, Johnson, then coach of the Cowboys, stormed out of the
meetings in Orlando, Fla., after Dallas owner  &UR; Jerry Jones had his
own version of midnight madness, announcing to those in the bar
that 500 coaches could have won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Johnson bolted from the meetings and headed to his boat
in Florida, coaching his last game with the Cowboys. This year's
session could be just as lively.
</P>
<P>
   Will  &UR; Tom Cruise and  &UR; Nicole Kidman, both clothed rather than
how they dressed in their new film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' show up in
support of proposed Los Angeles owner  &UR; Michael Ovitz's &UR; bid for an
expansion team?
</P>
<P>
   Will agent  &UR; Johnnie Cochran roam the Biltmore's lobby to try to
drum up business for clients? Will Scottsdale resident  &UR; Fred
Goldman let him know that the Valley is too big for both of them? &QL; 
Teeing off &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect a lot of opposition at the meetings to the NFL
competition committee's recommendation to change kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, trying to boost kickoff returns, is proposing
teams take over on the 25-yard line instead of the 20 after
touchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   `You are rewarding teams that have poor returners,'' one NFC
executive said. `You will just let kickoffs bounce into the end
zone and take over on the 25. It also punishes teams who have
kickers with strong legs. I can't see this passing.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition committee also considered eliminating the
kicking tee, but that failed.
</P>
<P>
   Teams will experiment without a tee during the preseason. &QL; 
Sweet deal &QL; 
Former Cardinals offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown, who signed a
three-year $10.75 million deal with the Browns, said Cleveland
officials never promised him he would be the first player
introduced at the Browns' preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   Browns general manager  &UR; Dwight Clark concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lomas Brown turns out to be the first guy introduced, it
will be because it'll be the day the left tackle is introduced
first,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he never told Brown he would try to steer stadium
business to Brown's parking management company, an enticement that
could be a salary-cap violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lomas joked that, sure, he'd like to drum up business for his
company,'' Clark said. ``Lomas asked if he could bid on the parking
contract for the new stadium. I said, `Sure.' No promises were
made. You can't do that with a player. But bidding on it? I said,
`As far as I knew, yeah, he could bid on it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clark also said Brown wasn't offered a job in the organization
when his career was over as has been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about it &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please put the rumors to rest that the Cardinals are trying to
trade up with Cleveland for the first pick overall in the draft to
get Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one has the Cardinals trading four picks and running
back
 &UR; Adrian Murrell to the Browns. Then, there's the one in which the
Cardinals trade the eighth and 21st picks overall and Murrell to
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns aren't trading the first pick. They plan to use it on
a quarterback and have attended the workouts of  &UR; Tim Couch of
Kentucky,
 &UR; Akili Smith of Oregon and  &UR; Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Browns want to drop down to the Cardinals' pick at
No. 8? They could lose a shot at all three quarterbacks and
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals love Williams, but they have no interest in paying
for the first pick in the draft. They remember what it cost them
two of the past three years to sign defensive ends  &UR; Simeon Rice and
 &UR; Andre
 &UR; Wadsworth, both of whom were picked third overall. &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just wait until actress  &UR; Ali Landry, girlfriend of former
Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Stoney Case and selected as one of ``People
Magazine's'' 50 most beautiful people in the world in 1998, samples
the nightlife in Indianapolis. Cracker Barrel is big. Bob Evans is
bigger. They're not Spagos.
</P>
<P>
   The best wedding present former Cardinals linebacker
 &UR; Eric Hill, who got married this weekend in Houston, received was
his release from the St. Louis Rams. He never felt comfortable
there and was glad to be a salary-cap casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why the movement to have Turkey Day games in places other
than Detroit and Dallas won't fly: Do you wake up Thanksgiving
morning in eager anticipation of the Ravens-Saints match-up?
</P>
<P>
   There is no truth to the rumor the expansion Browns have offered
their next prospective free agent a discount on car washes near
their new stadium. But he'll get, along with his signing bonus, a
set of windshield wiper blades, two No. 2 pencils and a chance to
be the last player introduced at the preseason opener in Canton,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona welcome home to Rams owner  &UR; Georgia
 &UR; Frontiere, the Sedona resident who hopes her new magic crystals and
pet red rocks can help the Rams rally from being the NFL's
losingest franchise in the 1990s. &QL;

NFL LIKELY TO OK REPLAY  
 OLD CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Arizona Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill's eight-year
winning streak appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, who, along with the New York Giants, always has opposed
the use of instant replay, knows fewer and fewer owners are on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when instant replay is proposed at this week's NFL
meetings, which begin today at the Arizona Biltmore, the measure is
expected to pass for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we came so close,'' said Seattle Seahawks Coach
Mike Holmgren, co-chairman of the NFL competition committee that
has come up with the latest replay proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it has been close and it will be close again.
But this year I think we have a real chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the measure could be the biggest reason it passes.
Last season was marred by many controversial calls, including a
phantom, game-winning touchdown scored by New York Jets quarterback
Vinny Testaverde in a 32-31 victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of last season changed the minds of some teams who
traditionally vote against replay,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 21 owners voted for replay, two shy of passing. With
expansion Cleveland being added this year, 24 votes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and San Diego Chargers,
all of whom voted against replay a year ago, are expected to change
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Giants owner Wellington Mara is considering voting for a
plan this year that includes a challenge system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all about this new technology and everything,'' Mara
said. ``If I'm convinced they've done something to correct the
faults we had before (with instant replay), then there's a chance
I'll vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, Mara's close friend, doesn't enter the meetings as
open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the game on the field,'' Bidwill said. ``Don't interrupt
the flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, an ardent replay supporter, thinks the flow of the
game will not be adversely affected in the proposed system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a blend of two systems that have been used in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   For 56 minutes of the game _ all but the last two minutes of
each half _ coaches will be able to challenge calls. Each team will
be allowed two challenges a game.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes of each half, an official in the press
box will control the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The referee on the field will remain in control at all times. He
will view the replay and determine whether the challenge should be
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   If the challenge is not upheld, the team loses a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some coaches who felt funny about the timeouts,''
Holmgren said. ``Part of the problem about the timeouts was what if
you used all of your timeouts and then you don't have timeout for a
big play at the end of the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to get all of (the coaches) to vote on
something dealing with timeouts. But there are six timeouts in a
game, and you only have two challenges. You get the timeout back if
you win the challenge, so you can make a pretty good case the
challenges won't affect the timeout situation. Plus, by eliminating
the coaches' decision-making the last two minutes, I think we've
dealt with that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren thinks another selling point is that there will
90-second limit on challenges. When replay was used from 1986
through '91, teams complained about long delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that bothered people originally, like the pace of
the game, we've answered that,'' Holmgren said. ``No one wants to
disrupt the game the way it was disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said he always has been a replay supporter because ``I
think if you have a chance to correct play that's wrong, then why
not? No one wants a wrong play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People uncomfortable with someone up in press box making type
of decisions, we've answered that. The referee is going to make the
decision. We answered the idea we didn't want a challenge system to
be arbitrarily used for strategy at the end of the game. That can't
happen because the replay official in the booth initiates the
challenges in the final two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the technology that would be used hasn't been
determined. A handheld digit recorder is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches could make their challenges by hitting a buzzer or
throwing a flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get this thing through, we can wave flags,''
Holmgren said. ``I don't care what we do.''

A WEED GROWS IN THE GARDEN

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boxing's farcical nature reached dizzying new depths
here Saturday night when Lennox Lewis easily beat Evander Holyfield
across 12 one-sided rounds only to wind up with an undeserved draw.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis answered his legion of critics _ and Evander Holyfield,
too _ with a boxing masterpiece that should have returned the
heavyweight championship to Great Britain for the first time since
ol' Bob Fitzsimmons won it 102 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-5, 246-pounder dominated Holyfield throughout the fight,
as the computer punch stats had him landing 348 punches compared to
only 130 for Holyfield in a match that lacked drama until the
judges' scorecards were read by ring announcer Jimmy Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   The odor from this one smells so badly that I'm sure there once
again will be a passionate call for governmental regulation of
boxing _ with this scam of a fight serving as Exhibit A for those
who seek to have it put under control.
</P>
<P>
   The 21,284 Madison Square fans reacted with jeers and couldn't
believe what they heard when Lennon said a judge named Jean
Williams of New Jersey had Holyfield the winner at 115-113 and
another person with myopia, Larry O'Conner of England, had it even
at 115.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who put this fight in its proper perspective was
the arbiter from South Africa, Stanley Christodolou, who had it
115-113 for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   I had Lewis ahead on my scorecard by a 117-112 count, as I gave
him nine rounds to three for Holyfield in what has to be the
greatest American heist since the infamous Brink's robbery _ or at
least since that notorious draw Pernell Whitaker wound up with a
few years back against Julio Cesar Chavez in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   By the sheerest coincidence, Don King was the promoter of that
hoax, too, and was the promoter of Saturday's fraudulent rendering
that isn't that surprising since a Holyfield loss would have
eliminated King as a major player in the heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   You see, King still has the promotional rights to Holyfield, who
retains both his WBA and IBF titles because of this scandalous
outcome and would have been left with nothing had Lewis prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   King had has no options on Lewis, who might have not have
knocked Holyfield down, or even had him serious trouble but landed
enough bristling left jabs and straight right hands to deserve to
have his arm raised in victory for a most workmanlike effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who saw the fight knows I won,'' said Lewis, and
everyone did think he won except for perhaps the only two human
beings in the world _ Jean Williams and Larry O'Conner _ who saw it
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lennox Lewis is the undisputed world heavyweight
champion. At least he is to those who saw him torment Holyfield
throughout a fight in which his superior size, weight and jab were
simply too much for the overmatched Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect there will be the inevitable rematch, but why?
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to see it?
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield never came close to fulfilling his prefight prophecy
of a third-round knockout _ and was continually beaten to the punch
by his taller, stronger and more active opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, this time Goliath did slay David, except in the
backroom politics, where Don King gets the kind of outcomes
dictators do in those phony Third World country elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it wasn't like this when a fighter of Holyfield's
modest weight _ he came in at a mere 215 _ faced someone as large
as Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm sure you all recall, Jack Dempsey gave away 57 pounds to
Jess Willard when they met on July 4, 1919 in Toledo. All Dempsey
did before stopping Willard in the third round was break his jaw
and nose and knock out a few teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Louis was undeterred giving away 52 pounds to Abe Simon in
their first match in which he stopped Simon in 13 rounds. In their
second meetings, Louis, still out-weighed by 45 pounds, needed a
mere six rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's brother Max would knock down the 263-pound clownish
Primo Carnera 11 times on the way to an easy knockout, even though
he tipped the scales at only 209.
</P>
<P>
   And Holyfield himself constantly has faced heavier men like
Riddick Bowe and Buster Douglas, who had a 38-pound advantage on
him when they met on Oct. 25, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He lost two of three to Bowe, and took out Douglas in three
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was different.
</P>
<P>
   This time the big man was more agile, was quicker and far busier
than the little man.
</P>
<P>
   All Lennox Lewis, who earned $10 million for being swindled,
lost was the math count among the judges.
</P>
<P>
   The guy was never hurt, constantly kept Holyfield off balance
with a jab that kept finding its mark, and should today be
celebrating a most deserving victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why boxing stinks,'' said Emanuel Steward, Lewis'
trainer. ``This is why so many people think it's crooked. And
they're right. It was crooked tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen rotten decisions across the years in boxing, but never
quite one this ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield did nothing to deserve a draw, much less earn a
two-point edge on one judge's card. He was never in this fight, and
only managed to strike Lewis with a couple of solid punches in the
entire ghastly affair.
</P>
<P>
   He can still call himself champion, as a relieved Don King did
afterward in the post-fight press conference without a hint of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   But he's a counterfeit champion.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis is the heavyweight champion to me, no matter what a
couple of corrupt judges want to rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - OK, let's look at one of the worst drought years in
Arizona history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance of huge closures of Arizona's forests to
prevent wildfires. In 1996, the year before a dry spell ended,
large portions of the forests were closed to the public before
Memorial Day to prevent forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Wildfires were lower than the year before, mainly
because they were confined to lightning strikes, not human
campfires and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   This year the situation may be worse. This could be the worst
year ever. The forests this year could be closed to the public well
before Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening with wildlife issues?
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Game and Fish Department doesn't want to close
fishing at a bunch of mountain lakes. The decreased sale of fishing
licenses costs the agency a lot of money. Since it's not financed
by general fund taxes, those license fees are important to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through the process of seeing which lakes are most
desirable to the public,'' said Larry Riley, chief of fisheries for
Game and Fish. ``We have to see which waters won't be available to
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants the public to look for waters they don't usually use
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   If a number of mountain lakes close, he'd like the public to
look at Colorado River lakes, which got huge inputs of water from
heavy snowfall in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Lakes Powell and Mead have great potentials for fishing this
summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is in the process of predicting which mountain
lakes will go dry, which will be marginal and which can sustain
populations of trout.
</P>
<P>
   The department is prepared to stock trout at heavy levels _ and
early _ to avoid losing hatchery fish and to make fishing on other
lakes as successful as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't good for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The production of acorns was excellent last year because of the
rains. Everything from deer to bears profited from these
high-calorie, high-fat nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The female bears went into hibernation in great shape,'' said
John Phelps, furbearer biologist. ``Their cubs (about 4 pounds now)
are in great shape. But I expect by the end of summer that few cubs
will survive. It doesn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that because the lack of food from the dry year, bears
will cover much larger territories.

   ``They'll be active much longer in the day because food is
scarce,'' Phelps said. ``Because they'll run a larger range,
they'll have to work much harder. They're eating machines when they
come out of hibernation. By ranging wider, they're much more likely
to encounter humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps said that unlike bears, which are omnivorous, the
mountain lions are likely to suffer more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The are predominantly meat eaters,'' he said. ``They'll
sometimes scavage if necessary, but primarily they kill what they
eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that nothing starves to death with an
empty stomach. It'll eat a hubcap if it has to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lions will turn to dogs, cats, anything they can kill. The dry
weather reduces the prey base. The predator works harder. It'll
settle for less. Lions will settle for jackrabbits and skunks
(instead of deer). They'll take what they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, he said, lions aren't particularly aggressive toward
humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand,'' he said. ``bears are attracted to
people's food.''
</P>
<P>
   That means they'll invade camps and trash cans in the mountains.
It also means as they become accustomed to humans and lose their
fear of them, there could be some major confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite chance of confrontations this year,''
Phelps said. ``Until the monsoons come (in late summer), we'll have
definite problems.'' That also means that small mammals, a
dry-weather source of food for lions, foxes and coyotes, will be
scarce. Even the plants that black bears usually eat will be hard
to find. &QL;

GARTH WHO? HE'S JUST A `K' TO GIANTS' TAVAREZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If only  &UR; Puff Daddy had been batting . . .
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco pitcher  &UR; Julian Tavarez thought he was doing the
right thing when he struck out country singer  &UR; Garth Brooks
Thursday, and he found it odd that some of the 5,293 fans at Peoria
Stadium booed him.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Tavarez may be the one soul in the Valley who has
never heard of Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the guy,'' he said. ``The way he was swinging, I
thought he was a pitcher. I listen to rap.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough outing overall for Tavarez, who gave up five runs
and four hits in a 14-8 loss to the Padres. And it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   He later discovered that a teammate had put shaving cream in his
new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   If Tavarez thought he had it bad, how about Chicago Cubs batting
practice pitcher  &UR; Jeff Davenport, who felt bad enough about hitting
pitcher  &UR; Kevin Tapani in the wrist with a pitch during workouts
recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Cubs official, Davenport found a note in his
locker requesting a 9 a.m. meeting with General Manager  &UR; Ed Lynch,
``to discuss Kevin Tapani's X-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport panicked. It turned out Tapani was behind the stunt
and had Lynch's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brewers pitcher  &UR; Jim Abbott may lead the Cactus League
in interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who is attempting a comeback after taking off 1997 and
spending much of 1998 in the minors, has been interviewed by CBS,
NBC, ESPN (twice), ``USA Today,'' ``Baseball America'' and the
``Sporting News.''
</P>
<P>
   His solid start only makes his story more intriguing. He has
allowed one earned run and six hits in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard at Peoria Stadium recently:
</P>
<P>
   Fan to Mariners  &UR; Jay Buhner, who is coming back from  &UR; Tommy John
elbow surgery: ``Jay, how do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner: ``Aw, I feel terrible. My elbow's fine, but I feel
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Buhner, his rehabilitation is going so well he could
start in right field on opening day. At least ``he'' thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had him penciled in to start the season as a first
baseman/designated hitter, but he progressed so well they OK'd him
to play left, believing it might put less stress on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors think playing right might be pushing it, but Buhner
appears ready to make his best sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The first time San Francisco Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker met
then-Giants newcomer  &UR; Marvin Benard, the player was taking cuts at
a minor-league complex batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your name?'' Baker asked
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin L. Benard, sir,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Benard pointed out his initials to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.L.B. That means I was born to play major-league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the meeting was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle infielder  &UR; David Bell is the son of former major-league
third baseman  &UR; Buddy Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day: Colorado's  &UR; Larry Walker, on whether his $75
million contract will change him: ``I'll still be the same idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clairol might consider sponsoring the Cactus League. A rash of
players have dyed their hair. The latest is Colorado's  &UR; Dante
 &UR; Bichette, who ignored the popular trend of blond to go red.
</P>
<P>
   Position battle of the week: The Nos. 4 and 5 spots in Seattle's
rotation. Mariners coaches said they hoped to make a decision by
March 22 or 23.
</P>
<P>
   After  &UR; Jeff Fassero,  &UR; Jamie Moyer and  &UR; Ken Cloude, it gets
interesting.
 &UR; Bill Swift and  &UR; Butch Henry are among those in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners also are looking at  &UR; John Halama and  &UR; Freddy
Garcia, who both came from Houston in the  &UR; Randy Johnson trade and
have performed well. But are they good enough to start? Both also
are bullpen candidates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Seattle Post-Intelligencer,'' Henry has a
clause in his contract that he can terminate it if he is not named
a starter out of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth spot in the Angels' rotation appears to be a battle
among  &UR; Omar Olivares,  &UR; Jason Dickson and  &UR; Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   It's official: On the heels of an injury-plagued season,
Milwaukee outfielder  &UR; Marquis Grissom is back, in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a vote for  &UR; Darrin Jackson, one of baseball's nice guys,
to make the Chicago White Sox roster. At 35, the non-roster invitee
is hardly a shoo-in. &QL;

KINGS RESPOND TO CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Rob Blake spoke and his teammates listened.
</P>
<P>
   It was only one game, but it was a small step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings are to make a move for a playoff berth in the final
five weeks of the NHL season, they will have to take many more
steps similar to the one they took Saturday night, when they
defeated the Vancouver Canucks 3-1 before a Forum crowd of 14,348.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we have to play to win,'' said Blake, the Kings
captain, who had called a players-only meeting two days earlier to
try to spark his teammates for a last-ditch playoff run. ``We're
not talented enough not to work hard to win.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Kings (25-36-5) scored their goals was almost as
significant as the fact they won their second straight game and
moved to within five points of Edmonton and Calgary, which share
the final Western Conference playoff berth. On the first goal, 1:42
into the game, Jozef Stumpel scored after Yanic Perreault
outmuscled defenseman Mattias Ohlund for the puck behind the
Canucks' goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal was all Yanic,'' Blake said. ``The important
thing was Yanic was sticking up for himself. We want to see guys
with the care, the want-to-win. That's big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perreault said, ``The guys understand we still have a chance to
make the playoffs and we believe we have a good hockey team in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second goal, Donald Audette camped out in front of the
Canucks' net _ a place the Kings have often feared to tread _ and
deflected a point shot by Philippe Boucher past goalie Kevin Weekes
on a power play with 1:42 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   On the third goal _ with 4:02 to play and with the Canucks
(20-36-11) within one after a power-play goal by Markus Naslund
five minutes earlier _ Craig Johnson knocked Ohlund off the puck,
leading to another Stumpel goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in desperate times,'' Johnson said, ``and we're playing
desperate hockey. Everybody is starting to believe in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings outshot Vancouver 34-12 in the first two periods. They
became too passive in the third period for coach Larry Robinson's
taste but held on nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The players appeared to respond to Robinson's decision to heed
the request of Blake and alternate captains Luc Robitaille and Doug
Bodger, who had asked the coach this week to stick with the lineup
that had played in Tuesday's 4-2 victory over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to at least listen to the people working for you,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said: ``We had to get across the lines of communication.
I'll run the dressing room, I'll take that responsibility, but
Larry has got to respect what I have to say. That's the good thing
about Larry _ he's willing to listen. He doesn't see everything
that's happening in the dressing room. If I can relate that to him,
then everybody is on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if communication had broken down, Blake said: ``I don't
know if it was broken, but if you start losing, it's difficult.
With the team we have, we've got to play one way and that's the way
we've played the last two games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will have to play that way for the majority of the
remaining 16 games if they are to have a chance to make the
playoffs. But for the moment, a seldom-seen emotion _ optimism _
seems to have found its way into the Kings dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing,'' Blake said, ``is we've got to win some games
to give us a chance.''

HOLYFIELD, LEWIS DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bible says, ``Pride cometh before the fall.'' As
Evander Holyfield learned Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, it doesn't say anything
about ``Holyfield in three.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, however, it must say something about giving a
long-time friend a break when he needs it most, because that's what
the born-again heavyweight champion got Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield spent 12 rounds trying unsuccessfully to find a way to
get inside the long defense of World Boxing Council champion Lennox
Lewis and ended up with a most unpopular draw for his efforts, a
decision lustily booed by the crowd of 21,284.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Christoudoulou scored the fight 116-113 for Lewis,
Jean Williams had it 115-113 for Holyfield and the English judge,
Larry O'Connell, scored the bout a 115-115 draw. The Globe card had
Lewis taking a razor-thin 115-114 decision after giving away Rounds
8 through 11 by simply choosing not to punch and then coming on to
win the final round and the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Lewis won the last round on all three judges' cards as
well, but had he not he would have lost his third of the title
despite the crowd's opinion to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely close,'' admitted Holyfield's trainer, Don
Turner. ``I thought we won the last four rounds to win the fight
but I'm not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he wasn't for good reason, but his counterpart in
Lewis's corner certainly was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox controlled the fight,'' Emanuel Steward brayed. ``It
wasn't even close. This is what is killing boxing. It was a total
mismatch. Holyfield couldn't even be his sparring partner.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be a bit much, but certainly he couldn't knock Lewis
out despite having brazenly predicted he would in Round 3, claiming
he had been told by God it would end that way. Something must have
gotten lost in translation, however, because Holyfield won the
round but came nowhere near hurting Lewis either then or at any
other time.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis didn't really hurt Holyfield either, but he did rock him
several times, cut him on the bridge of the nose and under his
cheek, and successfully kept him at long range through most of the
evening, using his half-foot reach advantage to make it nearly
impossible for Holyfield to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got robbed,'' Lewis (34-1-1) said angrily. ``I controlled
the entire fight. I'm so disappointed. I wasn't going to leave here
with just one belt. I'm the undisputed heavyweight champion of the
world. What happened in there is what you call politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my time to shine and they ripped me off. He should give
me those two belts because he knows they're mine. Automatic rematch
next month, but I doubt he'll box me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Little happened in the first round beyond Lewis occasionally
landing his jab and a short uppercut while Holyfield (36-3-1)
picked Lewis up off the ground and put him on his shoulder when
Lewis tried to lean too heavily on him during a clinch.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis continued to throw his jab stiffy and hurt Holyfield
early in the second round and Holyfield looked a bit bothered by
the difficulty he was having finding any openings to get inside as
Lewis kept him at bay as the third round dawned.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no evidence in the first two rounds of an
impending knockout, but Holyfield suddenly began to press Lewis
early in that round and twice seemed to hurt him with left hooks
that forced Lewis to slide backwards, his chest heaving. In the
end, Holyfield was unable to come through on his bold promise but
for the first time he had made Lewis taste leather and the WBC
champion did not react well to it, slowing down and spending most
of the round trying to clinch and grab.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's reach continued to be a problem for Holyfield, however,
who kept looking for ways to get inside but couldn't find many. It
was at this juncture that a small cut opened along the bridge of
Holyfield's nose and although it caused him no problems it was the
first sign of the distress he found himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Clearer signs appeared in the fifth round when Lewis countered a
wild Holyfield left with a short right that hurt Holyfield and sent
him sagging into the ropes. Lewis tried to cautiously press that
advantage and seemed to have Holyfield in some trouble but was
unable to hurt him further and by the end of the round Holyfield
had scored with two flurries himself.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield then rapped Lewis with a left hook when Lewis dropped
his gloves early in the sixth round in disdain and Lewis's eyes
rocked along with his head, but he wisely grabbed Holyfield and
tied him up and went back to keeping his guard up and Holyfield at
long range as the first half of the fight ended with Lewis holding
a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The two got into another wrestling match as the seventh round
opened and both fell to the floor. When Holyfield got up his left
cheek was cut and he was clearly angry and Lewis used this
emotional response to pick him apart throughout the round with
several more big right hands and a right uppercut that shook
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old International Boxing Federation-World Boxing
Association champion seemed to be getting older by the minute (or
by the Lewis right hand), but when Lewis took most of the eighth
round off Holyfield managed to get close enough to finally land
enough punches to win the round, although he did little damage.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Briton continued in neutral in the ninth, 10th,
and 11th, and Holyfield didn't do much more to pick up the pace but
just enough to squeak out those rounds. But the conclusion was so
unsatisfactory that light heavyweight champion Roy Jones was left
shaking his head, saying, ``I'm ashamed of boxing tonight.''

RUIZ DOES HIS PART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Ruiz didn't get much of a workout
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, but he did get some extra television time.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea, Mass., heavyweight needed less than four rounds to
rid himself of Mario Cawley in the opening televised fight on
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight
unification match at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz knocked Cawley to the floor four times and sliced open his
foe's right cheek before their bout was stopped at 1:04 of the
fourth to firmly cement the World Boxing Council's No. 1 challenger
ranking he now holds. But Ruiz may have done more damage to himself
than he did to Cawley when he bruised his left hand in the second
round on Cawley's head.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fight that hand was swollen and discolored and
Ruiz spent a half-hour soaking it in a bucket of ice in the locker
room as he discussed his short night's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when he got up a couple of times,'' Ruiz
(34-3, 25 KOs) said. ``But I just kept trying to do my job. After
the second round I really couldn't jab any more because of my hand,
but at this point I have to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Do it he did, maintaining his position as the mandatory
challenger for the WBC title in the fall while gaining some
much-needed national exposure against the kind of opponent you
fight once you've reached that lofty station _ a guy with a good
record but no chance to beat you.
</P>
<P>
   Cawley's record fell to 21-2, but those losses both came by
early knockout and in consecutive fights. The first was when
Lawrence Clay-Bey stopped him a year ago, and he had not fought
again until Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Some would argue that he still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz dominated from the opening round with Cawley's most
successful strategy being looping one arm behind Ruiz and holding
him when he tried to punch. This limited Ruiz's ability to land
early, but by midway through the second round he had solved this
mystery, dropping him with a solid left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Twice more Ruiz drove Cawley to the floor in the third round and
then landed another perfectly timed combination to open the fourth
that sent Cawley sprawling with no apparent interest in getting up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the night, James Page (24-3) kept his World Boxing
Association welterweight title with a unanimous decision over Sam
Garr (25-3). The judges scored the bout 117-111, 116-113, and
119-108 . . . Fernando Vargas easily made the first defense of the
International Boxing Federation junior middleweight title when he
stopped England's Howard Clarke at 2:29 of the fourth round.
Vargas, who won the title last December from Yory Boy Campas,
dropped Clarke (26-11-2) four times in the fourth round before the
bout was mercifully stopped, bringing to Clarke's mind the old
adage, ``Better late than never.'' ``I couldn't get into it at
first because no one was here,'' Vargas (16-0, 16 KOs) said . . .
WBA flyweight champion Hugo Soto did not fare as well as Vargas in
his defense efforts however. After losing the second round, 10-7,
on all three judges' cards when he was dropped three times, Soto
walked out for the third round and was knocked cold in 33 seconds
when Leo Gamez (31-6-1, 23 KOs) unloaded on him with a string of
punches. ``He just caught me by surprise,'' Soto (50-6-2) said.

BRUINS DERAILED IN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The ``I Love New York'' bumper stickers the Bruins
stuck on their traveling bags Friday night, when they tap danced
triumphantly down Broadway, turned yellow, cracked, and peeled away
in the wind of western New York Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in a 3-1 loss to
the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft goals,'' said coach Pat Burns, mildly disgusted by the
performance of his Bruins. ``We've stunk the joint out against
Buffalo all year. And you can't win when you give up soft goals.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing outrageously bad about what the Bruins did
inside Marine Midland Arena, where a sellout crowd of 18,595 saw
their Sabres add a slightly tighter grip on their hold of seventh
place in the Eastern Conference standings. The goals were soft, in
the sense that they came with only mild resistance from the
defense. The Bruins made their moves, often were around the puck,
but too often didn't engage in enough of a fight to fend off
disaster. They were sparring. The Sabres were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Sabres 73 points _ 5 more than the
eighth-placed Bruins. Meanwhile, Florida edged Tampa Bay, 1-0, and
pulled within a point of the Bruins. It gets tighter by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's going to be the rest of the way, a total
dogfight for the last playoff spot,'' said Steve Heinze, who scored
Boston's lone goal _ his third strike in two nights. ``And when
it's this tight, minor errors kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three goals the Sabres scored, only the first, a pinpoint
Michael Peca wrister, was a work of beauty. As referee Bill
McCreary whistled a delayed call on Ray Bourque, the ever-digging
Peca broke into the right circle with a Vaclav Varada dish and
whistled his shot high over Byron Dafoe. The Sabres led, 1-0, with
4:06 gone in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there was some fatigue in our game, but I never use
that as an excuse,'' said Dafoe, whose own winning streak, the same
as the club's, was snapped at two. ``(Friday night) was such an
emotional high, you try to come in the next night and match that _
but the intensity wasn't the same.''

   In Manhattan, the Bruins pulled off a stunning 5-4 victory over
the Rangers Friday with four goals in the third period. Here, where
life clicks along at 33 1/3 RPMs to Manhattan's 78 (kids, your
folks will explain), the Bruins never got their game uptempo.
Worse, they too often found themselves a beat behind the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a mistake against them and it's costly,'' said Heinze.
``They don't make a lot of mistakes, so you can't. And when you do,
they capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the biggest of the mistakes arrived, however, Heinze
hammered home his 16th, set up nicely by Joe Thornton on the power
play. Jumbo Joe fed into the slot and Heinze, shooting from the
moment he left the hotel, drilled it past former UMass-Lowell
goalie Dwayne Roloson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept saying, `Get the puck on the net, get the rebounds,'
'' said Heinze. ``A lot of times (Roloson) didn't look pretty out
there, but he was making the saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1-1 tie carried into the third period, but disappeared only
68 ticks off the clock when Michal Grosek slipped his check and
knocked in a Miroslav Satan relay at the right post. Hal Gill went
on a chase to get Satan, Grosek moved into the open space in front,
and the 2-1 lead was behind Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:19, Brian Holzinger finished off the Black 'n' Gold,
trailing into the slot and knocking home a Geoff Sanderson feed.
The clever Sanderson made the play with a dazzling dash through the
middle, curling off the right post and feathering his velvet feed
to the onrushing Holzinger. Dave Ellett and Mattias Timander were
the victims on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never effort. It's never a lack of effort,'' said the
mildly peeved Burns, knowing that every point squandered could turn
into a festering mess here in the last month. ``It's concentration
things, and if you aren't prepared to battle, they'll take it away
from you.''

IOC APPROACHING DAY OF RECKONING 
</HEADLINE>
 MEETING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS AND MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have been warned by their septuagenarian leader to be ready
for pain _ and profound change. When the International Olympic
Committee meets this week in a special full session at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland, the members are likely to make more
significant and difficult decisions in two days than they have in
105 years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides expelling half a dozen colleagues beyond the four who
have already resigned amid the Salt Lake City bidding scandal, the
100-plus members also must put embattled president Juan Antonio
Samaranch to a confidence vote, decide whether to deny themselves
the right to pick future host cities, create an independent ethics
panel, and begin talking about radical structural reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do our best to respond to all the issues that
have been raised,'' says vice president Richard Pound of Canada,
``and see if we have to reinvent ourselves for the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rest of the world weren't watching, what the IOC
will undertake Wednesday and Thursday will be an extraordinary step
for a private organization that has always functioned as an
exclusive club answering to nobody but itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC is under enormous pressure not only from the
``Olympic family'' of national committees, international sports
federations, and corporate sponsors but also from skeptics _ from
US senators to English newspapers _ who doubt that it is capable of
reforming itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC must evolve with the society in which it lives,'' says
board member Jacques Rogge of Belgium. ``There is a need for
evolution, that is for sure. Everyone agrees on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what the IOC will do inside its headquarters at the lakeside
Chateau de Vidy in Lausanne may well fall short of what its
harshest critics are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Only one additional member, Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa, will be recommended for expulsion. Nine others, including
board member Kim Un Yong of South Korea, will be censured or
warned. Three others will be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the 78-year-old Spanish marquis who has been IOC
president since 1980, has been under pressure to resign since the
scandal broke in December. But his colleagues, four-fifths of whom
were appointed by Samaranch, are expected to give him a resounding
reaffirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote that I have confidence in him,'' says Francisco
Elizalde of the Philippines, a committee member since 1985. ``He
has done more for the IOC than all previous presidents put
together. It will serve no purpose for him to resign now.''
</P>
<P>
   And the members are almost certain to insist that they continue
to be the ones to vote on host cities after a smaller selection
committee narrows the field to two or three finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice for the Games should reflect universal values,''
says Rogge.
</P>
<P>
   Though the week's decisions may seem modest in the wake of the
worst scandal in modern Olympic history, they will have a seismic
effect on a body that has weathered two World Wars, three boycotted
Games, and the breakup of Europe's socialist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC will have forced out less than half of the two
dozen members implicated in the Salt Lake scandal, it will be a
traumatic act for a self-selected group that has not expelled one
of its own in nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC had hoped that the original nine disgraced members would
step down on their own and avoid a bitter and unseemly scene this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tender your resignations,'' Samaranch had urged in January,
when the executive board voted to suspended them pending expulsion.
``Do not wait to be expelled by the session. Put an end to this
ugly chapter in the history of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet only four members have resigned. The rest _ Agustin Arroyo
(Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir (Sudan), Jean-Claude
Ganga (Congo), Lamine Keita (Mali), and Sergio Santander (Chile) _
have vowed to defend themselves in person this week. And the
rank-and-file members, who normally rubber-stamp whatever the
executive board recommends, say they'll hear out their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to see everything,'' says Roque Napoleon Munoz Pena of
the Dominican Republic. ``I have to hear everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrenching and embarrassing as they may be, the expulsions and
censures have to do with the past. The IOC's most urgent and
important task here will be to change the bidding process that
created a junketeering culture built on lavish trips, expensive
gifts, and finally the cash payoffs that spawned the Salt Lake
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the executive board suggested taking selection
rights away from the members and giving them to a 15-member panel,
only eight of them from the IOC. But since most members claimed
that the change amounted to an indictment of their integrity, the
board has backed off.
</P>
<P>
   The members, though, have been banned from visiting any of the
six European cities bidding for the 2006 Winter Games, which will
be awarded in June. That has produced howls of protest from Turin,
the Italian city which is co-favorite with the Swiss resort of
Sion, a 2002 runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy IOC members visited Sion four years ago,'' says Marco
San Pietro, director of international relations for the Turin bid
committee. ``They know nothing about Turin. We will send them
documents and videos. But one thing is to go and see. Another thing
is to see a video.''
</P>
<P>
   Turin is an incidental casualty, San Pietro acknowledges, of an
ethical earthquake that has shaken the august IOC to its
foundation. The Lords of the Rings are under fierce pressure to
change the way they operate _ pressure not only from without but
within, from scores of members who resent being broad-brushed as
corrupt. The Netherlands's Prince of Orange, elected only last
year, has already stepped aside in protest and others are expected
to follow if the proposed reforms aren't adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger danger in all this is not that a few bad guys get
thrown out, but that the good guys will leave,'' says Pound, who
chaired the panel that investigated the Salt Lake scandal. ``If we
don't get that right, they're going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still ahead are the stickier issues of independence. Critics
have called for the IOC to open its books and allow outsiders to
choose many of its members. Though the IOC probably will create a
special commission this week to deal with structural change , those
reforms won't happen until the next meeting in June _ if then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things cannot be done in this session,'' says Philipp
von Schoeller of Austria. ``We can deal with the expulsion of
members and how to choose the 2006 city and vote on the president.
But much more will not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the IOC has a century's worth of decisions to make
and a tattered image to cleanse and repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to undo the damage,'' concedes Elizalde of the
Philippines. ``It will linger. Let's talk reality. Our image is
kaput right now.''

YANKEES WILL BE BOYS OF ZIMMER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Let's start by saying we hope Joe Torre makes a speedy
recovery from prostate cancer and gets back in the Yankees dugout
by next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a possibility that Torre may be out for a while. And
this means beleaguered citizens of Red Sox Nation may be in for
another one of those mind-blowing sights that have become a
chilling part of the New England sports experience.
</P>
<P>
   Try this on for size, Sox fans . . . Think about the prospect of
Don Zimmer taking out the lineup card to home plate when the world
champion Yankees first play at Fenway May 18.
</P>
<P>
   That's Yankee manager Don Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Bad enough we have to see Bill Parcells, Curtis Martin, and
the rest of the New England Jets beat the stuff out of the Patriots
twice a year. We've also got Mo Vaughn in Angel whites and Roger
Clemens with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Now Don Zimmer is the interim manager of the mighty Pinstripe
Gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll get me a few boos,'' Zim said as he stood around the
batting cage before managing the Yankees against Kansas City Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 20 years since Zimmer was the most maligned man in New
England. Zim's Boston woes started when he skippered the 1978 Red
Sox, the team that blew the 14-game July lead, then lost a one-game
(Bucky Dent) playoff to the Yankees at Fenway. He's still skewered
for running his veterans into the ground, going too long with Butch
Hobson, refusing to pitch Bill Lee in the Yankee massacres, and
sending Bob Bailey up to pinch hit in the playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember going up to home plate on Opening Day the
next year,'' said the 68-year-old baseball lifer. ``We had won 99
games and we were playing Cleveland in our opener. When I walked
out of the dugout, I got booed by 30,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was bad from then right up until he got fired at the end of
the 1980 season. There was no peace. He was hooted on a nightly
basis and remembers his daughter (who was then a grown woman)
crying in the back seat as he drove home over the Tobin Bridge.
Bill Lee called him a ``gerbil'' and Zimmer was one of the first
Boston managers/ coaches hounded by the growing monster that is
sports talk radio. Showing he was ahead of his time, he developed a
hatred for Glenn Ordway as early as 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Sully (former Sox co-owner Haywood Sullivan)
fired me,'' said Zimmer. ``He had never fired anyone before. He
came into my office about 10 days before the season ended. He was
pacing. I said, `Sully, for Christ's sake, we're friends. Lay it on
me.' He asked me if I was tired of the abuse. I told him, `You and
Buddy (LeRoux) took over from me. It's easy for me now.' He
couldn't do it. So a day later he called me and said there would be
a noon press conference. And that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer got another job immediately. He was manager of the Texas
Rangers in 1981, and the Rangers opened (where else?) at Fenway
Park. When he popped out of the dugout, the boos rained down on his
head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off my cap and tipped it in every direction,'' Zimmer
said, smiling. ``I think they cheered a little after that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Zimmer's 51st year in baseball and he is one of the most
likable people in the game. For the first 47 years he bragged that
he never received a check from anything other than baseball. But
after he retired from a coaching job with the Colorado Rockies in
1995, he told Social Security he was ready for the checks to start.
He got one check, cashed it, then took a phone call from the new
Yankee manager. Torre wanted Zimmer as his bench coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stunned me,'' he said. ``It was the furthest thing from
my mind when he called.''
</P>
<P>
   Zim accepted the job and told Social Security to cease. Three
years later, he's got two new championship rings and now finds
himself managing a squad that some consider the greatest baseball
team of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He's a reluctant skipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe called me and asked me to do this,'' he said. ``Then
George (Steinbrenner) called me. I don't want to manage under these
conditions, but somebody has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be run the way (Torre) wants. But I will not
use his office, and I will not sit in his seat on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee a week ago. He
discarded his crutches and uses a fungo bat for a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good team,'' he said. ``You can have a good team and
not always win, but we got a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Torre will be involved in all decisions whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so will George,'' Zimmer added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre won't be able to manage during the games. ``If I'm
managing, I'm going to be the one changing pitchers,'' said Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   He is managing. He might still be managing when the Yankees come
to Boston. And let's not forget the All-Star Game at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I had already been joking about that,'' said Zimmer.
``Imagine Roger Clemens starting the All-Star Game and Mo Vaughn at
first base. Joe said he'd make me take out the lineup card for that
one. I told him, `No way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. If Torre's recovery takes longer than expected,
Don Zimmer could be the All-Star manager. The possibilities are
endless.
</P>
<P>
   But right now he's just finding his way along, doing what comes
naturally, managing one of the greatest teams in the history of
baseball, and leaving the front seat empty out of respect for his
friend.

REPLAY MAKING NOT-SO-INSTANT COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Instant replay apparently has completed its seven-year
sentence in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in the face of popular opinion, the National Football
League owners have managed to keep an instant replay officiating
system out of their game since 1992, but a Globe survey of team
owners last week indicates that instant replay will be voted back
in this week.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's owners meeting, the vote was 21-9 in favor of
replay, two votes short of the support required. Last year's ``no''
votes came from Arizona, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
New York (Giants), Oakland, San Diego, and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego and Tampa Bay say they will definitely vote for it
this time, which should swing the tide. In addition, the Giants and
Bills, who have always voted against, say they are leaning in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to vote `yes' this time,'' says Chargers general
manager Bobby Beathard. ``This proposal is different than a year
ago. It is a compromise. We are not going all the way back to what
we used to have, but we can still get some things corrected that
should be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I have always been against it personally,'' says
Buccaneers GM Rick McKay, ``we are going to vote for it this time.
Instant replay's time has come. The coaches want it, the players
want it, the fans want it. Let's try it again and put the best
system we can in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be the panacea people make it out to be.
I think our game is well-officiated. We are not perfect, and replay
won't make it perfect. I think this system will help keep a good
pace to the game, and not get it too long. Some people will be able
to sleep easier at night.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland coming into the league as the 31st team this
fall, 24 votes will be neeeded to restore instant replay. Cleveland
has said it will vote in favor, which very well may be the
clincher.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal put forth by the Competition Committee is somewhat
different from the system that was used eight years ago. At any
point before the last two minutes, coaches would be allowed to
challenge calls twice per half but would give up a timeout when
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes of each half, a press box observer
chosen by the league would notify field officials if he spots
anything that might be deemed changeable. The referee would stop
the game, view the play on a TV monitor on the sideline, and decide
whether to change the call.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason why instant replay was defeated a year ago was that
two franchises were concerned that their coaches would be
intimidated into saving timeouts to challenge plays in the closing
moments of each half. The two-minute exception presumably provides
the remedy in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a good chance we will vote for it,'' said
Bills coach Wade Phillips. ``I've talked with (owner) Ralph
(Wilson) about it this week, and he wants to hear exactly what the
proposal is. We want to see what is going to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is reasonable,'' says Giants co-owner Wellington Mara,
``we could vote for it. I want to see what the system is and what
the new technology is. I hope we have something that can cure some
the defects we have. Right now the thing that bothers me most about
our officiating is the big gap in the way we call pass interference
(which doesn't come under replay). Some crews call it one way;
others crews call it differently. A couple of big calls on pass
interference can change the whole outcome of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other comments on the matter, from teams that voted against
replay last year:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona owner Bill Bidwill: ``We would like to see the game stay
on the field. We have always felt that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City general manager Carl Peterson: ``We are going to be
interested to see what the league is going to say. Our premise has
always been to devise a system that would not delay the pace of the
game, slow the flow of the game, or bring about too many technical
interruptions. Until that happens, we will vote against.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland owner Al Davis: ``I have some questions about this
proposal. I want to hear all of the arguments before I decide. What
if something happens with four minutes left and you are out of
timeouts, even though it is a serious mistake? We can't change it
because we can't challenge it. That doesn't seem right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati owner Mike Brown: ``I'm still against it. No matter
how much you tinker with it, you come out with the same problems.
There will be delays. There will be errors. It will cause
distractions. The focus will be on things that are negative. I am
so surprised that people are enamored with it. Last year we had
over 37,000 plays and of that number, only 77 of them would have
been reversible. That is less than one half of 1 percent. This is
more emotional than anything. I'm against it, but I think it is
going to pass this time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, a committee of four (coach Dick Jauron and three
front office types) said they would study the new proposal and then
decide which way to vote. The Bears have always been against
replay.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will be named the 32d franchise city in the league
this week, but with some reservations. The city will be given a
limited amount of time to come up with a stadium plan that will
please the NFL owners. If it doesn't, the franchise could be taken
back and awarded to Houston at a later date. Meanwhile, Houston
would become the so-called ``relocation'' city, meaning the next
team that wants to move, or sell, would have the opening to move
into that city. The NFL will try to make some kind of Cleveland
arrangement in Los Angeles. After the Browns left for Baltimore,
there was no owner in place when the league made a deal with
Cleveland to join forces to build a new stadium. When that was
done, the NFL conducted an auction and Al Lerner purchased the new
Browns for a record $530 million . . . Speaking of new ownership,
the owners are expected to vote down the bid of the Milstein group
to purchase the Washington Redskins and their new stadium. The new
group got the nod from the trustees of the estate of the late Jack
Kent Cooke, but it will not be approved this week unless it changes
its financial plan. The plan does not satisfy league rules on
purchasing a team. The potential owners have yet to produce the
required amount of cash, and they are using the team as collateral
for their $500 million loan, which is also against the rules.

   Former Patriots offensive coordinator Larry Kennan says that Tim
Couch of Kentucky can throw the deep ball as well as Drew Bledsoe.
Kennan has been working out Couch and UCLA quarterback Cade McNown,
getting them ready for workouts in front of NFL scouts. Because he
was in a quick-throw, short-pass offense at Kentucky, scouts
wondered whether Couch could throw deep. Kennan claims he can, as
effectively as anyone in the league . . . Former Pro Bowl guard
Walt Sweeney, the Cohasset native who had a 14-year career with San
Diego and Washington, has written a book, ``Off Guard,'' which he
is shopping to publishers. ``It's not an all-football book,'' says
Sweeney with a laugh. ``It's more about how I screwed myself up
playing football. It's supposed to be funny.'' Sweeney became
addicted to drugs and alcohol during his NFL days. His football
story became well-documented when he sued the NFL and Players
Association and won in court, only to have the finding overturned
on appeal. ``I played 14 years and my pension is $1,600 a month,''
says Sweeney, who now lives in Lake Tahoe, Calif. ``I have to pay
my first wife $400 a month, and some money back because of the
court case. It's not easy.'' . . . The owners will hear an update
in the next few days on what is happening in the San Francisco
49ers organization. The team's former owner, Eddie DeBartolo, has
been pushed out of the picture by his sister, Denise. Apparently,
Denise, who runs the DeBartolo Corp. and has been placed in charge
of the team by the league, is angry with her brother for not paying
back a reported $60 million loan given to him by the parent
company, which could cause further problems for the DeBartolo Corp.
if Uncle Sam decides to place a tax on the loan as
sister-to-brother ``gift.'' Denise has placed her husband, John
York, in charge of the 49ers, with former head coach Bill Walsh
coming back to run day-to-day football operations.

   If John Elway decides to retire, as close friends think he will,
he could become the third man in the booth on ``Monday Night
Football'' with Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason. Elway has to decide
whether to go for three straight Super Bowl victories or go out a
certain winner after a great final game. Elway doesn't need the
money. He will make his decision before the draft so that the
Broncos can act accordingly . . . The Giants left no stone unturned
in checking out Kerry Collins before they signed him for big money
in free agency. The Giants researched the troubled quarterback from
his high school days, talking to his coaches and teachers, through
his Penn State coaches and former teammates (who gave him high
marks), and people he played for in the pros, Carolina and New
Orleans. Collins admits he has been troubled by alcohol, and he is
trying to get his act together. The Giants felt he was the best
young quarterback available to them, and that he would turn out to
be worth the investment.

   BOSTON _ For a week that offered true New England winter
weather, there was an awful lot of golf on the menu, thanks to
back-to-back events put on by the Massachusetts Golf Association
and the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. The opportunity to play
wasn't there, but talking golf is a second favorite pastime for an
awful lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline is at
the center of most golf talk in this area. So it was only natural
that both the MGA and Ouimet group built their events around it.
Former European captain Tony Jacklin was at the MGA Spring
Conference Tuesday, while current US coach Ben Crenshaw was the
guest of honor Thursday night at the Ouimet Fund's 50th anniversary
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin was splendid, talking honestly and refreshingly about
his role in helping turn this Ryder Cup into the spectacle that it
is. There was a time, he said, when he thought his association with
the event would be over, back in 1981 when he was not selected to
the team. A former British Open and US Open champion, Jacklin was
truly hurt by the snub, so imagine his surprise when he was asked
to be the 1983 captain. He thought it over, and when his list of
demands (better clothes, better travel accommodations, a more
serious commitment to winning) was met, Jacklin found himself
leading the Europeans at PGA National Golf Club in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Wadkins's superb wedge shot into the 18th hole (``I can
still see (captain) Jack Nicklaus kissing the divot,'' said
Jacklin) stole that competition for the US, but Jacklin's teams won
in 1985 and 1987, then maintained the Cup with a 14-14 tie in 1989.
Jacklin stepped down as coach, but he has never really left the
Ryder Cup spotlight. He will be in Brookline in September, working
the corporate tents, watching as a fan, and doing some commentary
for television.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, Crenshaw was presented the Francis Ouimet
Award for Lifelong Contributions to Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to be associated with something as substantial
as this organization,'' said Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at the dinner had been publicized for months, but
what had not been made known was the designation of $50,000 to
establish a permanently endowed scholarship in the name of Charlie
Crenshaw, Ben's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kept it a secret from him,'' said the two-time Masters
champion. ``I can't wait to tell him when I get back home. No one
has had a better father than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Crenshaw accompanied his son to The Country Club in 1968
for the US Junior Boys' championship, the first USGA event for the
Texas youngster. He didn't win, but the event helped cement Ben's
love of classic golf courses in general and The Country Club in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an historic place,'' he said. ``But The Country Club is
anything but straightforward. Which is why I'm intent on getting
the players in here to know what it is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Crenshaw and Jacklin faced questions about the chance of
Europe having so many rookies on its team, as the current Top 10
features seven. While both conceded that first-time players are a
possible liability (``There is no way to prepare for your first
Ryder Cup,'' said Crenshaw. ``It's daunting.''), people should take
into consideration a couple of points before jumping all over this
aspect:
</P>
<P>
   1. We are only halfway through March, and there are nearly five
months _ and some 20 tournaments _ to go before the teams are
formalized. Heck, the 1999 European Tour season is just a few
events old and some stalwarts are just now starting to play
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   2. In 1997, Europe fielded a team with five Ryder Cup rookies.
Feel free to ask members of the US team if that made their week in
Spain any more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt US Ryder Cup loyalists took delight in the fact that
five members of Europe's 1997 championship team (Nick Faldo, Colin
Montgomerie, Jesper Parnevik, Ian Woosnam, and Lee Westwood) went
down to defeat in Round 1 of the recent World Match Play, but take
note that Duval, Davis Love III, Justin Leonard, and Jim Furyk _
players who figure to be on the US squad at The Country Club in
Brookline _ did not exactly stir memories of vintage Walter Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   Love (who lost in the first round to Steve Pate) and Leonard (a
second-round upset victim to Shigeki Murayama) were startling
disappointments in the 1997 Ryder Cup loss, as well as members of
the US Presidents Cup team that got slapped around in Australia in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Duval, a marvelous talent who talked for weeks
leading up to the event about his dislike of match play. It was
almost as if he was setting himself up to fail, which is what he
did in Round 2 against Bill Glasson. You can shoot 66 and lose in
match play, complained Duval, though he conveniently ignored
another match-play truism: You can shoot 74 and win.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be a bit disconcerting to Crenshaw to know one of his
top players has such an aversion to the form of play that will be
demanded of him come September.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Monterrey, Mexico, for this week's Nike Tour stop
will be a little more enjoyable for Pembroke's Kevin Johnson,
thanks to his strong finish a couple of weeks ago. The former State
Amateur and State Open champion had started the season without
status, which left him on that most difficult road _ Monday
qualifying. Johnson got into the Nike stop in someplace called Pass
Christian, Miss., then stormed to the 54-hole lead. Though he faded
to third, Johnson earned $20,625 to vault into 13th place on the
money list. ``I bet the folks up (in Massachusetts) thought I was
dead,'' said Johnson, 31, from his home in Florida. He was
laughing, still taking comfort in the knowledge that when the Tour
reshuffles its status list, he should be in good shape . . .
Johnson failed in his bid to get into last week's Doral Ryder-Open,
but he stayed to watch Geoff Sisk, his good friend from Marshfield
who is a rookie on the PGA Tour. Sisk made his second cut of the
year, finished in a tie for 19th, and earned $29,000. He continued
his fine play by making it into the weekend at the Honda Classic .
. . For those who are wondering about popular caddie Mike ``Fluff''
Cowan, now that he has been fired from Tiger Woods's bag, look for
the Maine native to return to Peter Jacobsen . . . Michelle McGann
is hoping a new approach to her diabetes will help her rebound
effort on the LPGA Tour. A seven-time winner who was no worse than
16th on the money list the previous eight seasons, McGann recorded
just one top-five finish a year ago as she had a freefall to 45th
on the money list. Her poor play continued into 1999, but she
seemed poised for a turnaround when she shared the lead going into
the final round of the recent Hawaiian Ladies Open. Not so fast.
The 29-year-old McGann put up four doubles on her incoming nine,
closed with an 81, and finished in a tie for 34th. In five events
she has earned just under $14,000. McGann revealed after the
tournament that she would take a break from the Tour while she
recovers from the installation of a pump that automatically adjusts
insulin levels . . . Not a bad stretch for Alison Nicholas at the
recent Australian Ladies Masters. She began the third round with a
pair of birdies, then holed out her second shot to the 470-yard
par-5 third. Certainly, Peter O'Malley would have loved such
results. He trailed by one as he played the 72d hole of the
Australasian Tour Championship _ and made a 10.

THIS STEAL SETS UP BIG LAKER SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don't you think it would be charitable for Lakers owner
Jerry Buss to order up a couple of extra championship rings this
year for Charlotte boss George Shinn and Hornets henchman Bob Bass?
As Alfred P. Doolittle would say, ``It's the right and proper thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Utah, Indiana, Miami, and maybe even Portland might
feel differently, but it's awfully hard not to concede the 1999
flag to the Lakers after last week's over-the-top deal for Glen
Rice. They might have won the whole thing if they didn't do
anything. Now, they've added the game's most selfless player in
Dennis Rodman and its most dangerous shooter to an already potent
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did LA major domo Jerry West extricate Rice, he also
got J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong, two older players to blend into
the youthful LA pot. And while they were salary-cap throw-ins
(Armstrong was immediately waived), Reid was quietly putting
together a very nice season amid all the tumult in Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn and Bass, you may recall, also bailed out the Lakers a
couple of years back on draft night. Not only did they take Vlade
Divac off West's hands so that West had more money to pursue
Shaquille O'Neal, they then turned around and sent him Kobe Bryant,
even-up, for Divac. (They chose Bryant for the Lakers to boot.) So,
directly or indirectly, skinflint Shinn and bottom-line Bass are
responsible for Bryant, Shaq, and now Rice hanging out in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure West will vote for Bass for Executive of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Rice, on paper, is frightening. He can get off a
shot with no room and he's terrifyingly accurate. You double-team
Shaq, you pay for it with a Rice bomb. You try to rotate to Rice,
you pay for it with a Kobe slash. You guard Shaq even-up, well,
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, it will be interesting to watch the Lakers
now that Shaq has been satisfied. There still is, at last count,
only one basketball, and opponents will hope the Lakers go the way
of the 1976-77 Philadelphia 76ers, who crashed and burned against
team-oriented Portland in the NBA Finals. Or, closer to home, the
way of the 1968-69 Lakers, who had West, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt
Chamberlain and still couldn't beat the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   So let's see if they can play together and check their egos at
the door. Let's see if Kurt Rambis is up to it and can match wits
with Jerry Sloan when it really matters. Let's see how the Lakers
react now that they are expected to go all the way. But you must
admit that you have to like their chances a lot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You also have to like what the Nets have done, unless you have
to sign their checks. The addition of Stephon Marbury is a
slam-dunk for Jersey, but also a depressing sign for the Minnesotas
and Milwaukees of the world. Are they forever going to be the Kents
and George Masons of the NBA? David Falk's fingerprints are, of
course, all over the Marbury deal, but so what? That's his job. Can
anyone say that Marbury isn't in at least as good a basketball
situation, if not better, than he was a week ago? He didn't want to
stay in Minnesota; that's his choice. He had a nice thing going
there, but he has a potentially great thing going in New Jersey
with Keith Van Horn, Kerry Kittles (both Falk clients, as well),
and the irrepressible Jayson Williams. And he's closer to home. The
downside, of course, is more of a leaguewide concern. It wasn't a
lack of resources or an unwillingness to pay by Minnesota. It just
wasn't sexy enough. But when the big-market teams like Jersey and
the Lakers can pay, pay, and pay some more, you have to wonder
about the mid-level guys. Los Angeles, for instance, could be
paying its Big Three an astonishing $40 million next season alone
(Shaq $17 million, Rice $14 million, Bryant $9 million) . . . In
all the major deals that transpired this past week, there was one
common factor: the ability to re-sign a player. Charlotte was
worried about keeping Rice, even though it could have not paid
top-dollar and still been able to offer him more than any other
team, by far. The Wolves wanted to re-sign Marbury, just as they
wanted to re-sign Tom Gugliotta. They couldn't do it. Milwaukee not
only might not have re-signed Terrell Brandon, it then got out from
under Tyrone Hill's big deal because he was threatening to opt out
if Brandon left. Cleveland didn't necessarily want to part with
Vitaly Potapenko, but it has shelled out $230 million to Shawn
Kemp, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Wesley Person, and Bobby Sura, still has
Brevin Knight and Derek Anderson to deal with, and, at last check,
was 25th in the league in attendance. The Cavs weren't willing to
add another $40 million for someone who was, in their mind,
dispensable, even though their only other center, Ilgauskas, seems
to have Bill Walton's feet . . . Kevin McHale did a nice recovery
job in getting Brandon to replace Marbury. It's the second time in
two months he has had to go to Plan B to restock his roster. It
would have been interesting to watch what would have happened had
McHale and Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor called Falk's bluff and
not made the deal. Would Marbury really have opted for a hideous
Chicago team over what he had in Minnesota? But the risk was simply
too great. Brandon, too, is a free agent, but his agent, Bill
Duffy, and McHale have all but chosen the living room furniture.
They were roommates in college and are still chums, so, provided
the Wolves open the vault, re-signing Brandon should not be a
problem. Milwaukee, meanwhile, gets a free look at the
disappointing Tim Thomas for the next year-plus and has Sam Cassell
locked up until 2002 at what is a reasonable NBA price.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the Celtics, there really is no downside to the Potapenko
deal, other than it gives Falk another client on the team (joining
Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, Walter McCarty, and, in
brotherhood, Rick Pitino). Unless you are worried about losing the
fourth, fifth, or sixth pick in what now looks to be an
irretrievably weak draft, then it's a no-brainer. (Right now, the
first three picks could be Lamar Odom, Elton Brand, and Steve
Francis.) Potapenko gives Pitino what he did not have, a sturdy
fellow in the post. The Celtics did not have to part with one of
their three young guns to do the deal. The cynic in all of us
wonders why Cleveland would do the deal with Ilgauskas's health
concerns, but the monetary issue was paramount. However, after
watching the Celtics stumble around the conference this past week,
it's obvious there are bigger concerns than just having a full slab
in the paint. Anderson has been awful; there's no polite way to
phrase it and he is the first one to admit it. He isn't getting the
ball up the floor quickly enough _ that was always a problem with
Chauncey Billups, too _ he's having trouble in the halfcourt, and
his shooting has been abysmal. He is the engineer on offense and he
simply hasn't been getting the train on the right track. We all
wondered whether Anderson could master the Pitino system, and
Pitino was confident Anderson could, saying the system would make
Anderson one of the top point guards in the league. Right now,
Anderson is the sixth-best point guard in the seven-team Atlantic
Division. One thing we thought we wouldn't have to worry about was
scoring. Add that concern to an already suspect defense, and you
can understand why Pitino has all but a stamp on this season . . .
The other problem is Walker. Is he any better now than he was last
year? Or even two years ago? In the last two games, he's played 71
minutes, taken 41 shots, turned it over nine times, and has one
assist. He is an undeniable talent, but he's also doing many of the
same, stupid things that drive us crazy. Chuck Person may not be
the most reliable witness on the subject of ``touches,'' but he was
adamant about Walker's too-dominating role in the offense, at the
expense of others. ``This is a difficult, young team to coach,''
Pitino said. By now, however, we should be seeing some progress,
and it's hard to find any other than the potential of Pierce and
Ron Mercer's occasional outbursts. Yes, the Celtics could be better
next year because they'll have a full training camp and be in
better shape. But so will everyone else. With the trading of Andrew
DeClercq, there is only one Pitino-signed free agent (Bruce Bowen)
still on the team. Gone are Chris Mills, Tyus Edney, Tony
Massenburg, Travis Knight, and now DeClercq, not to mention Eric
Williams, Billups, Roy Rogers, and John Thomas . . . We noted last
week that Mo Taylor was not rushing to sign an extension. Well,
there's a good reason: He can't. At least by the books he can't.
However, one of the wrinkles in the new collective bargaining
agreement allows teams out of the playoffs to negotiate with their
two-year rookies. That means the Clippers should get the go-ahead
any day now, although they did avoid total humiliation by beating
Sacramento . . . Dee Brown looks at Vince Carter and sees a young
Dominique Wilkins. ``He is so explosive,'' Brown says of the
skywalking Raptor rookie. ``Dominique used to be like that. He
could jump, take a hit, and still elevate. It makes me reminisce
about the days when I could play above the rim, although I could
never play like that.'' . . . The Knicks stooped to an unconscious
low against the Bulls Friday. They had 22 points at the half (5 in
the second quarter) and 33 after three. How could that happen?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the Clippers believed in moral victories, they
might have enough by now to qualify for the moral playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' said point guard Darrick Martin, who
doesn't think basketball has anything to do with pitching
horseshoes, ``all they want to know is did you win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, all the Clippers did was lose for the 18th time in
19 games.
</P>
<P>
   That anticipated Clipper roll turned out to be little more than
a noisy somersault.
</P>
<P>
   The big, bad Portland Trail Blazers terminated a pair of
one-game streaks by stomping into the Sports Arena and rallying to
defeat the home team, 106-96, in overtime in front of 9,484
witnesses. The Blazers, who had their eight-game winning streak
killed and league-best record twisted by the Utah Jazz in Portland
on Friday, trailed by as much as 17 points against the team with
the league's worst record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a gift,'' Martin said after outplaying Portland's
Damon Stoudamire almost as convincingly as he smoked Sacramento
rookie Jason Williams in Thursday's landmark first victory. ``They
(Blazers) know they got away with one.''
</P>
<P>
   They almost got away with it in 48 minutes, but Clippers center
Lorenzen Wright nailed a pair of free throws with .4 seconds on the
clock to tie the score at 91 and send the game into a lopsided
overtime. Wright, who established a career and 1999 league high
with 25 rebounds vs. the Kings, pulled in another 18 against
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   By taking advantage of Portland's press and making several open
shots, the Clippers led by as many as 15 in the second quarter.
Their lead slipped to three - 51-48 - at intermission, but an
11-point third quarter by Lamond Murray pushed the advantage to 17
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' hack-a-Blazer defense led to an 11-of-15 Portland
effort at the line and 27-15 margin in the fourth quarter. The
Blazers (16-4) completed the evening with 50 free-throw attempts;
the Clippers fired up a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just fouled too much,'' said Clipper forward Maurice
Taylor, who contributed 15 points and eight rebounds after
predicting a ``monster'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the monster role was assumed by Blazer Brian
Grant, the guy Taylor was assigned to check. Grant finished with 25
points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very active,'' Taylor said of Grant. ``Usually the guys I
go up against can't move around that well. I like their whole team.
They're big and strong and they have a great bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of those Blazer subs scored in double figures Saturday, led
by Rasheed Wallace with 21.
</P>
<P>
   Martin finished with 14 points, six steals, six assists and just
one turnover before fouling out in OT. Murray (18) and Eric
Piatkowski (14) combined for 32 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin: ``We're not nearly as bad as they project us to
be.''

LEMIEUX MAY BE BOXED IN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What first sounded farcical now appears, at the very
least, possible. Claiming he is owed some $32.5 million in past and
future pay, and with little or no chance of collecting more than
pennies on the dollar, ex-superstar Mario Lemieux now has a plan to
purchase the Penguins and, eventually, collect his cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux and all concerned parties _ suitors, sellers, and
pretenders alike _ met in NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's office
last week and continued to hash through the details.
</P>
<P>
   The Team Lemieux financial plan, which could be placed before
the bankruptcy court Thursday, is this: Working with a figure of
some $27.5 million (present-day value of the $32.5 million, some of
it originally deferred as far out as 12 years), Lemieux would
collect a lump-sum $6 million up front from his own group of
buyers. He then would fold $10 million, slightly more than 36
percent of what he's owed, into equity _ his personal ownership
position in the new venture. The balance of $11.5 million then
would be paid to Mario Magnifique over the next eight years, at an
interest rate of 6.75 percent (a note that would bring him some
$65,000 per month in interest alone).
</P>
<P>
   The Team Lemieux plan also asks the NHL to grant the Penguins
the same economic relief currently extended to small-market
Canadian clubs. Each year, if Edmonton, Calgary, and Ottawa reach a
ticket-sales plateau and various advertising sales levels, the
league will kick back up to $2.5 million. Imgaine how the likes of
Buffalo and Nashville, two small-market American clubs, will view
that proposed handout?
</P>
<P>
   Headed into the weekend, Lemieux's financial backer still had
not been made public. One wild rumor around Toronto had it that
former Bulls icon Michael Jordan, who shares Lemieux's passion for
golf, might be the mysterious money guy. One source believes the
backer could be Hollywood-based.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Boston attorney Harry Manion said his client,
Penguins co-owner Roger Marino, would surrender his share in the
team under two conditions: if he were repaid the $5 million loan he
made earlier this season to keep the club afloat, and if new
ownership pledged not to gut the roster (i.e. dump Jaromir Jagr in
a cash grab). If he walks away now, the Revere-born and -raised
Marino will have lost perhaps as much as $40 million in the
dreadful venture. Given what he could lose by staying on board,
that kind of loss looks like a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Lemieux, who couldn't wait to get out of the game,
suddenly so eager to get involved? According to those familiar with
the negotiations, it's simply because his contract, negotiated by
agent Tom Reich, didn't protect him against what has turned into
financial doomsday. The deal looked too good to be true _ and it
was. When it comes to fine print, no man, be he 66 or 9-to-5er, is
immune to being hoodwinked.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's only choice, in the end, is to jump into what is
becoming an increasingly risky _ some would say absolutely no-win _
financial venture. Lemieux's deal played a large part in ushering
the Penguins into bankruptcy and escalating salaries throughout the
league. Salaries have gone from the garish to the outlandish to the
vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic it might be for Lemieux, one of those who gained so
much from the system, now to sign on as owner and see his savings
sucked from his pocket overnight in an attempt to keep the biz
viable. A front-row ticket to the theater of the absurd. His only
way back then might be to sell the movie rights to Hollywood. He'd
have an in there with Penguins co-owner Harold Baldwin, who has
helped shepherd a few flicks to the silver screen. The circle of
debt, it goes 'round and 'round.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Lemieux plan doesn't fly? There is at least one
other key suitor, Harvey Gainey, a homegrown Pittsburgh guy who now
owns and operates Gainey Transportation, a Grand Rapids-based
trucking company. His point man in the operation, Chip Gesner (ex-
of Connecticut), said Saturday that race-car driver Chip Ganassi
also would be part of the Gainey bid, which will be placed with the
bankruptcy court in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for handouts,'' said Gesner, asked if his
group would seek the same ``small-market'' element eyed by Team
Lemieux. ``Let's get the team first and see where we stand then. We
think we can turn the team around with a lot of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesner helped put together the Pittsburgh Pirates ownership
group, and the Bucs, said Gesner, have gone from losing $18.5
million a year to turning a profit. If the Gainey group is
successful, chances of Lemieux seeing more than a token financial
handshake (amount determined by the court) would be virtually nil.

<P>
   What if, in the end, no one can get the deal done? There remains
the possibility, perhaps remote, that the franchise goes Chapter 7,
is forced to dissolve, and the players ultimately get placed in a
dispersal draft. Wouldn't you pay to see the Board of Governors sit
at a table and figure out who picks first in the Jagr draft?

   Colorado winger Valeri Kamensky is high on the
``most-likely-to-be-dealt-before-the-trade-deadline'' list. He'll
be an unrestricted free agent come July 1. The Sabres made a recent
inquiry, but word around Buffalo is that the Avalanche were looking
for 24-year-old defenseman Jay McKee (14th pick overall in '95) in
return. No deal. Not only can Kamensky go free this summer, he
turns 33 next month . . . Ex-Bruin Joe Juneau, recovering from a
concussion, is another likely trade prospect. He, too, will be
unrestricted this summer. When he doesn't have ex-Bruin Adam Oates
dishing him the puck, Juneau's effectiveness drops considerably.
But don't look for the Capitals to package the two in a deal. Oates
still has the skills that make those around him better and he's an
ideal tutor for Jan Bulis, the 20-year-old Czech who projects as
the franchise's pivot of the future . . . Rangers coach John
Muckler, on the rumor that his old pal, Glen Sather, was trying to
pry Matthew Barnaby, Martin Biron, and Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre from
the Sabres in a deal that would include Bo Mironov going to
Buffalo: ``If Slats can make that trade, he's the executive of the
year.'' Barnaby finally got dished to the Penguins for former
first-rounder Stu Barnes . . . Biron's work in relief of the
injured Dominik Hasek has been promising enough that it doesn't
make the idea of a Hasek trade totally absurd. Just a year ago,
following Hasek's Olympic heroics, such a thought would have been
ludicrous. But Hasek's trade value never will be higher, he is 34
years old, and the Sabres aren't a serious Cup threat. If someone
were willing to pay his $7 million-plus per year and send the
Sabres some real value in return, they would have to consider it .
. . Anyone else out there look at Hal Gill, all 6 feet 7 inches of
him, and wonder whether he might be able to play a forward's spot
on the power play? That size. That reach. Some things you just
don't know until you try them . . . John Ferguson, now a scout for
the Sharks, in his days as GM in Winnipeg and Ottawa drafted no
fewer than four players who became NHL rookies of the year: Dale
Hawerchuk (No. 1 in '81); Teemu Selanne (10 in '88), Daniel
Alfredsson (133 in '94), and Bryan Berard (1 in '95). ``It should
have been five,'' Fergie recently told the Ottawa Sun, ``because
Yashin should have won.'' Alexei Yashin, chosen No. 2 overall in
'92 with the Senators' first draft pick, was eligible for the
Calder in '94, won by New Jersey netminder Martin Brodeur.
Then-Oiler Jason Arnott, now a Brodeur teammate with the Devils,
was runner-up that season . . . Los Angeles team president Tim
Leiweke said last weekend that the Kings' coaching staff (Larry
Robinson, et al) will finish the season. The question remains,
though, whether Robinson will want to return. This is the end of
his fourth season there and, in all likelihood, the Kings are going
to miss the playoffs for a third time under his watch. The Kings
play to their talent level, not an inch beyond that, and the talent
pipeline holds little promise . . . Steve Yzerman's deal in Detroit
is due to run out next season, when he'll earn $5.18 million. Word
around the Winged Wheels is that he's ready to sign a three-year
extension, through 2003, that will bring him $21 million . . . Word
around Toronto is that the Vineyard's Mike Smith, the Leafs'
associate GM, could be scooped away for the GM job in Chicago (if
Bob Murray gets the hook, as expected) or for the same post in
Minnesota (the Wild begin play in October 2000). If Smith goes,
Anders Hedberg, now the assistant GM and director of player
personnel, would move a spot closer to team president Ken Dryden.
Smith was believed to be in the mix here in Boston prior to Mike
O'Connell being tabbed as Harry Sinden's eventual successor.

   When the Senators get around to talking contract with Yashin
(his deal goes through next season), don't be surprised if they
welcome free-agent bids from clubs south of the 49th parallel.
Reason: Ottawa can match any offer by a US club, and are only
obligated to pay in Canadian funds. The league would have to make
up the difference. By current exchange rates, a US offer worth,
say, $60 million would have the Senators paying the equivalent of
about $40 million US and the league handing over some $20 million.
We are reminded of the old Butch Cassidy line: ``That's bad
business. If he'd pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbin'
him, I'd stop robbin' him.'' . . . A source familiar with NHL
finances pegs the Stars' operating deficit at $100 million over the
last two years. A little perspective: That's double what it cost
for Tampa Bay and Ottawa to buy into the league at the start of the
'90s. Given the economic woes of the six Canada-based clubs and the
overspending tactics of some of their Yankee partners, the league
soon may be begging the Players' Association to reopen the
collective bargaining agreement, which isn't due to expire until
2004. There is only one way the union will go for that: Two or
three clubs will have to fail (remember, Pittsburgh already is in
bankruptcy) . . . Another sign of the times: There is a distinct
possibility that Canada's national team, based in Calgary, will
fold operations after this season. Team Maple Leaf used to shape
the country's Olympic and World Championship squads. But the Games
went pro in '98 (2002 remains a question) and the International Ice
Hockey Federation is tinkering with the World Championship format.
Meanwhile, lack of governmental funding has the national team
looking for private donations from team alumni. It takes slightly
more than $1 million a year to keep the operation going . . . Leafs
forward Alyn McCauley, crushed by a Sheldon Souray check 10 days
ago, began off-ice workouts last Sunday, after neurological tests
showed his reaction times were diminished by some 20 percent by the
blow _ his fourth career concussion. It could be another two weeks
or more before he is back in the lineup. ``It wasn't the glass that
gave,'' said McCauley, ``it was my head.'' McCauley needed more
than four hours to shake the initial grogginess.

   Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson took over the Lightning
less than two weeks ago for $100 million _ double the Bolts'
expansion cost, but $17 million below what Art Williams paid for
them just a year earlier. The front office trio of Cliff Fletcher,
Jay Feaster, and Jacques Demers remains intact, for now, but
Davidson can be expected to roll in his own crew over the next 2-3
years. Rick Dudley, signed as the Senators' GM last summer, would
be a likely candidate. He was rumored to have the inside track a
year ago, until Williams moved in as the surprise suitor . . .
Islanders GM Mike Milbury began the expected purge in Uniondale
Tuesday when he unloaded Scott Lachance on the Canadiens for a
third-round pick. Lachance was the No. 4 pick overall in '91 _
Peter Forsberg went No. 6 in that draft _ and never lived up to his
all-world potential on the Island. The Islanders now have dealt
away five of their first-round picks since 1991: Darius Kasparaitis
(No. 5 overall in '92), Wade Redden (2 in '95), Todd Bertuzzi (23
in '93), J.P. Dumont (3 in '96), and Lachance. Brett Lindros, the
No. 9 pick in the '94 draft, had to retire because of concussions.
Many more bodies are expected to be dumped, perhaps including
ex-Bruins Bryan Smolinski, Marius Czerkawski, and Craig Janney . .
. Years ago, upon exiting a September media luncheon at the Bruins
camp in Wilmington, Jeremy Jacobs, in from Buffalo for the day,
dashed through a pack of sportswriters as he made his way out the
Ristuccia Center's doors. ``Mr. Jacobs, do you have a minute?''
asked Dick Trust, then the beat writer for the Patriot Ledger.
``Not a second,'' said Jacobs, disappearing without another word.
During a recent stretch of self-imposed silence with the media on
Long Island, Milbury replied, ``Not even a second,'' when asked if
he had a minute for reporters. Imitation, the highest form of
flattery.

 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPOO, Finland _ What's the saying, out with the old and in with
the new? To get to Sunday's final of the Women's World
Championships, the US hockey squad decided to twist the adage a
bit: in with the old and, oh, what the heck, in with the new, too.
</P>
<P>
   Led by two goals from 15-year-old center Natalie Darwitz,
playing on her first national team, and a brilliant return by
27-year-old goaltender Erin Whitten, playing on her fifth, the US
beat Finland, 3-1, in Saturday's semifinal and will meet Canada
Sunday night for the fifth time in five World finals. Despite its
Olympic triumph, the US has yet to get past Canada for a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had a tougher-than-expected time in its semifinal but
outlasted Sweden, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Whitten, who gained fame by being the first woman to play an
entire men's professional hockey game, was busy from the first drop
of the puck, as Finland came out strong to outshoot the shaky
Americans, 10-7, in the first period. She almost made it to the
buzzer unscathed, but Kirsi Hanninen drilled one in from the top of
the slot with just two seconds left to put the US behind, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second period, with just 11 seconds left on a power
play, Darwitz took a feed from Cammi Granato and snapped in the
puck from just outside the crease to knot the game, 1-1, at 6:46.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting it in in a game this big was great,'' said Darwitz of
her first world championship goal. A 5-foot-2-inch freshman at
Eagan (Minn.) High School, where she has played on the varsity
hockey team since seventh grade, Darwitz was forced to sit out a
practice and miss some playing time after hurting her hip in
Monday's 10-2 rout of Russia in the first game of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can skate and have power with it, I'm fine,''
said Darwitz.
</P>
<P>
   If the first goal helped ease her pain, the second must have
made the entire team feel a lot better. With 3 1/2 minutes left in
the second, Darwitz put the US ahead to stay when Shelley Looney
found her in her favorite spot, the top of the crease, to give the
US its first lead, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Krissy Wendell, a 17-year-old from Brooklyn Park, Minn., also
making her national team debut, beat her defender to sneak one into
the right corner with exactly five minutes left in the game to seal
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   As exciting as the victory was for the newcomers, it may have
meant far more to the veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it was so important for me,'' said Whitten, who was
kept home from Nagano by youngsters Sarah Tueting and Sara DeCosta.
``After being cut from the Olympics, I really didn't know if I was
going to get another shot right away. I took a lot of time away,
and I think it did some good for me mentally. It took a lot of time
for me to build up the confidence again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for her, to get a game like this in a setting
like this,'' said coach Ben Smith, who nonetheless declined to
announce his starting goaltender for Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Finland game, it would be a surprise if it weren't
Whitten, just as it would be a surprise if Darwitz doesn't someday
list five national teams on her own resume _ even if she is still
in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still hard to believe I'm sitting next to Cammi Granato
or shooting pucks at Erin Whitten,'' she said. ``I have to pinch
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Whitten: ``She beats me every day in practice.''

NEW JERSEY FOCAL POINT OF FEDERAL PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A major shakeup in big-time boxing may have begun
quietly last week with the resignation of attorney Pat English from
Main Events, Dino Duva's New Jersey-based promotional company.
</P>
<P>
   It is the start of a move by Duva and his sister, Donna, to buy
out sister-in-law Kathy Duva, who along with her children controls
about 40 percent of the company trust started by her late husband,
Dan. As the family Duva began these negotiations, English opted to
resign from Main Events's board after a 17-year association because
he is also Kathy Duva's family attorney and would be involved in
the negotiations of a financial settlement, if one can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But changes at Main Events, one of the sport's biggest
promotional companies, may not be the biggest boxing story to come
out of New Jersey this year. A federal grand jury investigation
into the sport's often questionable business practices has begun
and may delve into the inner workings of the New Jersey-based
International Boxing Federation and its president, Bob Lee, sources
say.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's organization is not the probe's only target, however. Word
is, the government is asking questions about promoters Butch Lewis
and Cedric Kushner, fight manager Marc Roberts _ who ran a stock
deal that sold $10 million worth of shares in a management company
whose biggest asset was heavyweight prospect Shannon Briggs _ head
of the New Jersey state athletic commission Larry Hazzard, and
other boxing figures.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum has voluntarily testified in front of that
grand jury, although he denied Friday that he had cut an immunity
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to give me immunity,'' he said. ``I haven't
done anything. You make an immunity deal if you need immunity from
something. Other than that, I don't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum refused to discuss the investigation, but another boxing
insider said it was a far-ranging one and several others in a
position to know insisted that Lewis may make his own immunity deal
in exchange for testimony against Lee, with the hope that Lee
eventually will crack and give the government another shot at
indicting promoter Don King, who has defeated three efforts to
convict him on various charges.
</P>
<P>
   The issues under investigation reportedly involve extortion and
bribery surrounding the selling of rankings and the title shots
those rankings produce, a scenario not unlike the one in the famous
boxing film, ``The Harder They Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury reportedly is also looking into questionable
judging in New Jersey that appeared to favor certain fighters and
whether the managers of those fighters had financial connections
with boxing officials.
</P>
<P>
   Said a source, ``A lot of time and effort is going into this and
I think it will lead somewhere, although I don't think even the
feds know where yet. Without any question (Arizona Sen. John)
McCain is involved in this. Just how, I can't say, but I think his
committee has turned over a lot of information to these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. McCain has been trying for years to clean up the sport's
business practices and protect fighters from unscrupulous
promoters. He filed the Muhammad Ali Boxing Bill, which forces
state commissions to honor suspensions and rulings of other states,
and has has held several rounds of hearings on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, which included interviews with FBI agents involved in
an investigation of an unnamed boxing promoter that began more than
10 years ago, is nothing new for boxing. Managers and promoters
have had repeated run-ins with the government dating back to the
days when the Mob ran the sport at the behest of Frankie Carbo and
Jim Norris through an organization known as the IBC. In those days,
ratings were manipulated, fights were fixed in exchange for future
title shots, and the rackets controlled most everything that
happened in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Things may be more sophisticated as the dawning of the new
millennium looms, but boxing's address on the shady side of the
street seldom seems to change for long. If that is where it is
again, it won't be long before you'll be hearing about it from a
New Jersey courthouse.
</P>
<P>

   Boxing attorney Milt Chwasky was irate to learn that $20 million
in letters of credit King had to produce to insure the purses of
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis for Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's fight were
actually backed not by King's bank but by HBO. Chwasky, who
represents Lewis's promoters, felt King had not shouldered the
promoter's burden. ``If you're going to do it that way, why not
just let some homeless person promote the fight?'' Chwasky ranted.
``They could have put up as much money as Don did.'' At that King
laughed, claiming he was on the hook for more than $4 million of
his own money and contending that Chwasky was ``just one of those
guys in boxing trying to prove to somebody there's a reason to get
paid. I sold this fight in 156 different countries. This was the
fastet sellout in heavyweight history. It will gross more money
than any promotion in the history of the Garden. What else they
want from a promoter?'' . . . Arum and HBO executives will watch
closely the Lewis-Holyfield sales; the closer it comes to 1 million
buys, the more likely it is that Oscar De La Hoya will fight Felix
Trinidad this year. ``If it does 800,000-850,000 buys, it's likely
De La Hoya-Trinidad can be made,'' Arum said. ``If it doesn't, it's
much less likely. I know the fighters' demands, and nobody will put
up that kind of money if the pay-per-view business doesn't exist.''
No one believes a nonheavyweight fight will exceed the
Lewis-Holyfield sales, so it effectively becomes the ceiling for
the De La Hoya-Trinidad sales potential. If that ceiling is too
low, then the promoters would be unable to raise sufficient money
to pay them. Hence, no fight. ``De La Hoya-Trinidad can't be bigger
than Lewis-Holyfield,'' HBO Sports president Seth Abraham agreed .
. . A secondary, but no less intense, heavyweight battle went on
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night between the trainers of Lewis and Holyfield.
Emanuel Steward and Don Turner did little to mask their longtime
feud in the days leading up to the fight. A week ago, Turner
refused to go on a New York television show with Steward, saying,
``If I go on that show, I'm going to slap that (expletive) in the
face.'' Steward has repeatedly suggested that Turner is riding the
crest of Holyfield, while Turner countered by saying, ``I thought
Lewis was a good fighter after the (1988) Olympics. I still think
he's a good fighter. I just don't think he'll ever live up to what
I thought he might achieve. I just don't think he's improved much
since he turned pro.'' Turner also suggested that Steward tries to
steal not only the thunder from his fighters but fighters from
their managers and trainers, and he included himself as a past
target of such efforts. Other than that, it wasn't personal at all
. . . Industry sources said Time-Warner needed roughly 800,000
pay-per-view sales on TVKO to break even on Holyfield-Lewis . . .
HBO used the occasion of Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's fight to bring together
all of the promoters with whom it does business in New York and
make clear to them that the network is no longer willing to accept
unattractive challengers for its stable of world champions. ``We
told them all we are going to be far more stringent in the fights
we'll accept,'' Abraham said. ``We have momentum going in boxing
and we want to keep it going with good fights. I don't know if
they'll act on it, but these guys are smart, they have contracts,
and they understand HBO is their bank. Part of what's opened up
this dam has been our doing business again with Don King. The fact
is, if we make the best fights _ the ones people want to see, like
Lewis-Holyfield _ in the long run all these promoters will win.
Certainly they will lose an individual champion from time to time,
but in the big picture, they'll all win because the sport will
win.''

   Newly crowned World Boxing Association super welterweight
champion David Reid had his third operation on a droopy left eyelid
only days after defeating Laurent Boudouani last weekend to win a
world title in only his 12th professional fight. The sagging eyelid
limits his vision at times but it didn't prevent him from winning a
clear decision over the 32-year-old Boudouani and becoming the
third member of the 1996 US Olympic team to win a world
championship. Reid joined Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Fernando Vargas.
Just as important to him, he stretched to 13 his streak of HBO
boxing shows that produced a double-digit rating, the longest such
streak in network history . . . Mayweather, meanwhile, will get his
best exposure yet on May 22 when he defends the World Boxing
Council junior lightweight title for the third time against Goyo
Vargas underneath De La Hoya's welterweight title defense on HBO.
De La Hoya takes on Oba Carr while awaiting some sign that he will
land Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation champion, before
the end of the year. But as negotiations for that fight move along
at a snail's pace, word is that Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, has
begun talking about a rematch with either Pernell Whitaker or Ike
Quartey in the fall. The more likely is Whitaker because he looks
less dangerous at this stage of his career . . . Arum shook up his
operation last week by severing longtime East Coast matchmaker Ron
Katz, saying Katz no longer did enough shows to justify keeping
him. He will pay Katz until the end of the year . . . Roberto Duran
lost a 10-round fight in Argentina last week. He reportedly weighed
175 pounds. For the greatest lightweight I ever saw, that is a lot
of baggage to be dragging around a ring at age 47. Sadly, this will
go on as long as there are promoters willing to exploit old
champions and old champions who go broke at the end of the line.
There's always plenty of both . . . Trainer Teddy Atlas returns to
boxing's bigger stage Saturday when he takes heavyweight prospect
Kirk Johnson into the ring for the first time. Atlas, who last week
was called ``the Michelangelo of the gym'' by veteran New York Post
columnist Jack Newfield, took over Johnson's training after Johnson
suffered through an unexpectedly long night with former
cruiserweight champion Al ``Ice'' Cole in which he had 3 points
deducted for low blows and was in big trouble several times. That
led Kushner to seek out Atlas, who trained Michael Moorer and Mike
Tyson in his formative years. Atlas will get to measure his
progress immediately when Johnson meets Cole in a rematch next week
on ``HBO Boxing After Dark'' . . . Atlas has been busy. He not only
trains Johnson at Marciano's Gym in Jersey City six days a week but
also is preparing 19-year-old Elvir Muriqi, a 1998 New York Golden
Gloves champions whose father is a guerrilla in the Kosovo
Liberation Army. When not in the ring, Atlas has been an analyst
for ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights,'' done radio interviews to
promote Lewis-Holyfield for TVKO, and awaits a call from movie
director Ron Shelton, who is writing a part for Atlas into his
latest film, about the fight game . . . Efforts toward a Roy
Jones-Reggie Johnson match were successful after an initial
breakdown made it seem likely Jones would make a mandatory defense
against Gianfranco Rocchigiani in June instead of trying to unify
the 175-pound title against the IBF champion. Jones's promoter,
Murad Muhammad, has agreed to a Jones-Johnson unification fight
June 5 in Las Vegas . . . Showtime has penciled in Sept. 19 as the
date for a likely return to the ring by Tyson. He should be out of
a Maryland prison by June and free to train in a work-release
program that will allow him to travel outide the state to fight.
Arguments continue over his next opponent, however. Showtime wants
someone ``live.'' Manager Shelley Finkel wants something along the
lines of a creampuff.

ROSE WORKING TO PUT INJURY BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROSE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Want a clue about how Red Sox righthander
Brian Rose looked in his second outing of spring training? Well,
the first two batters he faced in Saturday morning's ``B'' game
against the Minnesota Twins were hit by pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't completely by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he was out there trying to hit anyone,'' said
manager Jimy Williams. ``But for a pitcher to be effective, he has
to establish inside. And sometimes it gets pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the start, he threw freely. The important thing is that
he feels good. If he's not healthy, he can't pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams squeezed in the 10 a.m. game _ before the regularly
scheduled 1 p.m. exhibition against the Twins _ for a chance to
keep tabs on Rose, who a year ago as a rookie was Boston's starter
in the Fenway opener but now is simply trying to make the roster
following offseason elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rose gave up two runs and one hit in two innings of work. The
first run was scored without a hit, the second was unearned, coming
in thanks to an error with two out. In a game Boston rallied to
win, 5-4, Rose had no walks or strikeouts, which is not unexpected
at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw some good, quality pitches today,'' said Rose. ``And
that is what I needed to boost my confidence level. I just want to
progress every time out there, build up my arm strength, and try to
get guys out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is to get back to where I can help the ball club.
In Boston or Pawtucket, I have to help out the ball club. But to do
that I know that I have to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might surmise, Rose has already seen the writing on the
wall. The Red Sox have penciled in five starters: Pedro Martinez,
Tim Wakefield, Bret Saberhagen, Mark Portugal, and Pat Rapp. All
are veterans who are throwing well this spring. Portugal, in fact,
was the winner in an 8-2 victory in the afternoon game.
</P>
<P>
   Rose understands that unless one of those pitchers fails to hold
a spot in the rotation, Rose will start his season in Pawtucket.
Perhaps even lower in the system.
</P>
<P>
   But Pawtucket would not be the end of the world for Rose. In
1997, he was 17-5 with a 3.02 earned run average there, and was
named International League Most Valuable Pitcher and Rookie of the
Year. Rose showed such promise _ good control and an ability to
change speeds _ that the Sox felt they could let go of Carl Pavano
in the Martinez trade with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rose is trying to hone those tools again. And the more he
pitches, the better he should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put it in any time frame,'' he said. ``But my
elbow feels free. If I can do that, then I'll have a pretty good
chance of getting guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Rose happy Saturday was that he was able to make
adjustments from his first start. It took just one sideline session
with pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on Wednesday and found a couple of mistakes,'' said
Rose. ``I was breaking my hands and rushing. I wasn't throwing
downhill; I was throwing flat. Today, I was able to carry it out
there. I want to build, day by day, and hopefully things will work
themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, said Rose, maybe he can pitch a little later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the earliest game I can recall pitching,'' he said,
``if you don't count some of those 9:15 a.m. starts in early minor
league spring training camp. It's good to wake, get up, and go.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly gave the first two Minnesota batters a wake-up
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time, I was just trying to get the ball to change plane
levels,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, they cut in and hit the batter.
Still, I threw it in an area where I wanted, and that's all that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what matters most at this point is that Rose stays
healthy. Coming off a bone spur and fracture in his pitching elbow
that limited him to eight starts last season, Rose feels he's spent
enough time out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that it was my first injury to overcome, and
that was a lot,'' he said. ``I don't like to sit on the sidelines
and watch games. I'd rather be out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit out and watch a whole season go by was very
frustrating.''

RPI SQUARES SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ It's back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a third and final game in the ECAC quarterfinal
series between Harvard and Rensselaer after the Engineers got a
pair of power-play goals from freshman left wing Matt Murley as
well as strong netminding from junior Joel Laing (35 saves)
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night to earn a 4-0 decision over the Crimson,
necessitating Sunday night's tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   RPI, which finished off the win with a pair of empty-net goals,
finished 2 of 6 with the man advantage, Murley's first tally coming
7:19 into the second period with Harvard's Mark Moore in the
penalty box for holding. Murley scored off a feed from the left
point from Danny Riva. Murley buried his second _ and 16th of the
season _ with Steve Moore off for tripping at 15:58 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt played very well,'' said RPI coach Dan Fridgen. ``He's a
kid who could well be the ECAC Rookie of the Year. He's been very
valuable all season.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Laing, the senior who notched his fifth
shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was (Laing),'' said Harvard coach Ronn
Tomassoni, whose team has been blanked twice by Laing this season.
``He had an outstanding game. We put a lot of rubber on him but
probably he had too many clean looks, especially on the power play.
We have to do a better job of screening and a better job on the
second and third chances. He just played one of those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard sophomore goaltender Oliver Jonas, playing for the
injured J.R. Prestifilippo (separated shoulder) was strong again,
denying 26 shots, 11 in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it was a 1-0 game,'' said Tomassoni,
whose team finished 0 for 8 on the power play. ``When it got to
2-0, it didn't matter whether it was 3-0 or 4-0. All we had to do
was tie it and we had to try (pulling the goalie).''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close at the end with RPI finally taking advantage of
its power play,'' said Harvard captain Craig Adams. ``In the third
period, we took it to them but the bounces just didn't go our way.
As far as the empty-net goals, I'm not worried about them. RPI's
goalie played well.''
</P>
<P>
   RPI carried over its strong third period Friday night into
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no time when we were flat,'' said Fridgen. ``We were
totally focused. It was great that our power play went for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday night's rubber match?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of those low-scoring games and that
favors us,'' said Adams. ``We're going to clog it up and we're
going to keep it close. I have a lot of faith in our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a heck of a series,'' Tomassoni said. ``This is what
you play for. It's the deciding game. We played well Friday as well
as (Saturday &UR;  &LR; night) and I expect that we'll play a heck of a game
(Sunday night) as well.''

 COLLEGE-OHIO STATE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Sometimes just being asked to the dance is
not enough. You have to get your best clothes out, put on your best
performance, and hope that you're still standing _ and your partner
isn't _ by the end of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Boston College women's basketball team is still
standing. The No. 8 seed Eagles defeated No. 9 Ohio State, 72-59,
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night before 11,190 at Tennessee's Thompson-Boling Arena
in the first round of the East Regional. BC is making its first
NCAA Tournament appearance in the 27-year history of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles will meet top-seeded Tennessee, which routed
Appalachian State, 113-54, in Monday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message all week was, `Don't be happy just to be here, come
to win,' '' said BC coach Cathy Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Eagles did, led by 6-foot-1-inch freshman
forward Becky Gottstein, who came off the bench to contribute a
career-high 23 points and 12 rebounds. Gottstein, who suffered a
high ankle sprain in BC's loss to Seton Hall in the Big East
tournament two weeks ago, only returned to practice two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also shining for BC (22-7) was Alissa Murphy (22 points, 11 for
12 from the line) and freshman guard Brianne Stepherson (11
points).
</P>
<P>
   But most of the heroics were absent in the first half, as the
Eagles hardly looked ready to play with the top 64 teams in the
country. After an initial layup by 6-4 center Whitney Steele and
two free throws by Murphy, BC would go on a six-minute scoring
drought as Ohio State took off on an 11-0 run. The Buckeyes took a
13-4 lead behind three baskets by senior Marrita Porter and a
3-pointer by 5-4 guard Jamie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were plagued by sloppy ballhandling. The Eagles had
turned the ball over eight times in the first eight minutes,
forcing Inglese to call a timeout. But after some substitutions,
the Eagles changed direction.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by Gottstein _ taped ankle and all _ the Eagles went on
a 9-point surge to tie the score at 15. When BC took a 19-15 lead,
the Buckeyes had gone 4 1/2 minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the hot-shooting of Gottstein, who finished the
half with 13 points and four rebounds, could keep the Eagles in
front. With 4:45 left in the half, Ohio State went on an 11-3 run
to take a 34-31 lead at intermission. Ohio State had turned the
ball over 15 times, BC 17.
</P>
<P>
   But Inglese saw signs that her team would come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident at halftime, because there were some
things in the half that we just weren't executing,'' she said. ``I
knew we'd be successful if we got the ball to Alissa and really cut
down their post play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles jumped on the Buckeyes in the second half _ behind a
3-pointer by Murphy and three consecutive layups by Gottstein _ to
take a 43-39 lead. Ohio State tried to come back behind
high-scoring junior forward Michaela Moua (16 points), Porter, and
Lewis (14 each), but it was too late. With five minutes left the
gap was 13, 63-50.
</P>
<P>
   Three more baskets by Ohio State, including two Lewis
3-pointers, didn't make a difference as BC made 12 trips to the
line and was successful on 11 of them.
</P>
<P>
   As Murphy dribbled downcourt, the clock ticked down and the BC
fans stood and cheered. The Eagles can savor their win, for a day,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this is the biggest win,'' Inglese said. ``We've had a
lot of big ones this year, but this is the biggest.''

KEADY, PURDUE FIRST CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stop the next 1,000 self-proclaimed sports fans you see
on the street and ask them which Big Ten basketball team is the
only one to have won three consecutive league regular-season
championships in either the '80s or '90s, and I will bet you an
autographed picture of Cazzie Russell the preponderance of guesses
will either be a) Michigan or b) Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, three-second breath. The answer is Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Purdue has won or shared more Big Ten basketball
titles period (21) than anyone, and I'll wager my autographed
picture of Rick Mount you didn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you reside in West Lafayette, Ind., or your name is
Mrs. Gene Keady, Purdue is not in your thoughts when the subject of
great basketball powers comes up. And when they talk about the
A-list of coaches, not many casual fans would include the name of
Gene Keady. He is an industry phenomenon, more Gene Hackman (and
when I closed my eyes while he spoke Saturday, I heard the final
locker room scene in ``Hoosiers'') than Tom Hanks. But I've spent
enough time around college basketball people to know that when the
people who really know talk about year-in, year-out solid programs
and coaches who make a habit of putting out teams whose whole
exceeds the sum of their parts, the name Gene Keady tumbles readily
from their lips.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a great Purdue team. It is a 20-12 10th seed that
has already given itself a successful season by defeating
seventh-seeded Texas in a tense and intriguing contest Friday night
at the FleetCenter. I doubt if anyone other than the West
Lafayette/Mrs. Keady crowd thinks they'll advance themselves to the
East Regional by defeating second-seeded Miami Sunday afternoon at
the Fleet, but things far more improbable than a Gene Keady team
winning an important game have transpired in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue is a notably fine university that has given us men who
have walked on the moon (Neil Armstrong), US senators (Birch Bayh),
snack food moguls (Orville Redenbacher), authors (Booth Tarkenton),
ultimate basketball legends (John Wooden, and is that exalted
enough for you?), not to mention countless engineers and assorted
technical whiz-bangs among its 300,000 alumni, but which somehow
has no national cachet when stacked up against the likes of Big Ten
compadres Michigan and Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of that ``other'' Big Ten school
located precisely 108 miles to the south of West Lafayette. NCAA
championship tally: Indiana 5, Purdue 0. Larger-than-life coaching
personalities: Indiana 1, Purdue 0.
</P>
<P>
   It is constitutionally impossible for us to comprehend what a
thing like Indiana-Purdue is all about, but take BC-BU in hockey to
about the 20th power. That might be a start.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world doesn't realize that Keady has beaten Knight
more than Knight has beaten Keady. It's part of being Purdue. There
isn't much they can do about it, except, to borrow a hockey
analogy, go out and skate their wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why the university can have such a great
program and Coach Keady can be such a great coach and people don't
think of us being in the upper echelon of the college basketball
world,'' said junior forward Brian Cardinal, a banger in the finest
Purdue frontcourt tradition. ``All we can do is go out and play as
hard as we can, and, hopefully, Purdue and the coach will get the
recognition they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Keady took the diplomatic high road when asked if he were in any
way upset that his team's accomplishments have been so amazingly
overlooked. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I really don't worry about
it. I hear people say I do, but I've never said that. The answer is
to win bigger. Go to the Final Four. Win the national title.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that he has never had the resources to go all the
way. Final Four? Sure, that was reasonable. But the classic Keady
teams have been the ones picked third or fourth that scrap, hustle,
and defend past more highly-regarded Big Ten teams. That's not to
say he hasn't had anybody. He did, after all, beat the world to
Glenn Robinson's door. But a more typical Keady pro is Steve
Scheffler.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is in Round 2 of the NCAAs, with a team that has had
a great struggle to get where it is. Winning that game the night
before last on Cameron Stephens's improbable jumper was the
culmination of much blood, toil, tears, and sweat for the
Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That picture in the paper this morning of our kids jumping and
pounding each other was something the coaching staff waited all
year to see,'' Keady said, alluding to the wonderful Dominic Chavez
shot on Page G1 of the Globe's final Saturday edition. ``All year
long we've been asking these kids to have fun and enjoy themselves.
Finally, we saw it all with that picture. Hopefully, it won't be
short-lived.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes up Sunday against a man who respects him very much. He
and Miami mentor Leonard Hamilton go back two decades to the time
when Keady was an assistant at Arkansas and head coach at Western
Kentucky and Hamilton was a talent-hunting star at Kentucky.
Hamilton is a paid-up member of the Gene Keady Fan Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always admired the toughness Gene's teams play with,''
said Hamilton. ``His kids are kind of like him. They play like
little Gene Keadys. They are very competitive youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years we haven't,'' sighed Keady. ``Maybe in the
early '80s and '90s. The last few years I've accused them of being
soft, although I realize that with this generation that's not a
particularly good reference to make.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who thinks a coach has a broader responsibility to
his kids than devising a way to better defend the pick-and-roll.
The Purdue kids have been to the JFK Library and have seen Old
Ironsides. The world ought to know more about Gene Keady. There's
more to life than getting to the Final Four. I guess what I'm
saying is maybe we press folk could have been doing a better job.

UCLA WOMEN ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LaCresha Flannigan isn't the most-known player on
the UCLA women's basketball team, just the second-leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   She played her role perfectly again Saturday night, scoring 16
points to Maylana Martin's 18 in the No. 3-seeded Bruins'
hard-fought 76-69 victory Saturday night over No. 14
Wisconsin-Green Bay in an NCAA Women's Tournament first-round game
in front of 2,390 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (24-7) will host No. 6 Kentucky, a 98-92 victor
earlier Saturday against No. 11 Nebraska, Monday at 9 p.m. The
Wildcats and Bruins played earlier this season, with UCLA winning
64-54 in a Hawaii tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime a UCLA opponent tries to create a game plan, it first
must figure out what to do with Martin, the Pacific-10 Conference's
player of the year and the Associated Press third-team
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   That was foremost on Green Bay coach Kevin Borseth's mind, too.
But then he worried about Janae Hubbard because of her size
advantage (6-foot-4) against the Phoenix (19-10).
</P>
<P>
   Flannigan, with a 14.3-point scoring average, sort of fell
through the cracks, under the general strategy ``contain the
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Borseth should have thought more about Flannigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, she can get up,'' Borseth said. ``She's got hops. She
really likes the baseline crossover on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Flannigan scoring five straight points to give the Bruins
a 10-7 lead early. She also got involved in a 12-4 first-half run
that put the Bruins ahead 22-13 with 8 minutes, 40 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Her most important contribution, however, came in the second
half, when she scored seven points in a 9-0 run that put UCLA ahead
60-46 with 8:52 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Her output Saturday was her 14th straight game in double figures
and 20th in her last 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows she's quick and can take anyone to the basket,''
UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said, ``and when her shot is falling, she
can get out. Erica (Gomez) loves looking for her on the break. She
gets us going defensively and is one of the reasons for our win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins needed all of Flannigan's points because the Phoenix
(19-10) refused to quit. Led by Cheri Nordgaard, UWGB's AP
honorable mention All-American, the team went on a 22-9 second-half
run and turned an 18-point halftime deficit into a five-point game,
51-46, with 10:24 remaining. Nordgaard scored 21 of her game-high
27 points in the second half, including 13 of the 22 in the run.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA earned its big halftime lead with a 13-0 run over the final
3:08. Hubbard scored four, Gomez completed a three-point play, and
Michelle Greco, Martin and Melanie Pearson chipped in with a basket
each.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez finished with 15 points and Hubbard had 12 points and 12
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin-Green Bay also got 12 points from Melanie Tilque.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky 98, Nebraska 92: Six players scored in double figures,
led by guard Erica Jackson's 18 points, to lead the Wildcats
(21-10) over Nebraska (21-12). Nicole Kubik led the Huskers with 32
points.

   EDs: The Palm Beach Post has a three-day package for Saturday,
March 13, Sunday, March 14, and Monday, March 15, on the business
of smuggling aliens; why the U.S. Border Patrol, the INS and the
federal court system cope poorly with it in Florida; and why
Florida employers are able to hire hundreds of thousands of illegal
workers each year. Here are the budget lines for the third day in
the series. STORIES HAVE MOVED. FOUR PHOTOS AND FOUR GRAPHICS ARE
AVAILABLE.
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-WORKSITE _ It's unlawful to hire non-citizens. But
Florida is still the land of opportunity. An estimated 350,000
illegal aliens reside here. Most work in the vegetable and citrus
farms. Many keep the tourism industry booming as waiters, hotel
maids, etc. Some work on landscaping and construction crews. But
the INS cannot go into the agricultural fields and doesn't have the
manpower to do much other worksite enforcement because it has to
focus attention on alien smuggling. Farmers hire scores of illegal
workers and escape liability by paying licensed farm labor
contractors provide crews. They also argue that workers today carry
counterfeit documents. The INS says they don't expect growers to be
document experts. Migrant worker advocates argue that farmers use
their political clout to handcuff the INS. For example: in 1990,
the INS sanctioned 38 employers in Florida for hiring illegals.
That dropped to 16 in 1991, 6 in 1992 and 2 in 1993. In 1994, 1995
and 1996, it was a dozen or fewer. Only in 1997 did it get back up
to about 20-25 employers. (Kane/Holland, Palm Beach Post). 60.

 &HT;    Vietnamese refugees still helping themselves
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From Tom Brokaw's book, ``The Greatest Generation,''
to Newsweek's cover photo last week of an American Marine in
Vietnam, the end-of-the-century recounting of wars that shaped
America has begun. But one aspect of war that gets little attention
is what happens to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, refugees of the Vietnam War are adding cultural
dimension to a city historically identified as black and white. In
suburban Chamblee's Asian Square, I enjoyed a bowl of Vietnamese
noodle soup recently with Xuan Nguyen-Sutter, who helped found the
national Refugee Women's Network. It's based in Atlanta but has
offices in 18 states.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Sutter took time off from a lucrative job as a
financial analyst to help Vietnamese refugees. She never went back.
``I couldn't find happiness in that work,'' Sutter said. ``I love
my country, and I wanted to help my people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter grew up in a well-to-do family in Saigon, studied
economics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and received
her master's degree in business from New York University. She met
her husband, a Swiss doctor, now on the staff of the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an Indonesian
refugee camp, where both were working for international
organizations. Sutter felt particular compassion for female
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture,'' she said, ``woman is the pillar of the
family. When Asian women cannot be the pillar, they are
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Asians come to America, often the men get jobs and the
children go to school _ but the women are left behind. They
struggle to translate their skills in a strange culture. ``Look,''
she said, pointing out the female manager of the restaurant as an
example, ``these are smart, talented women.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter, whose Vietnamese name means ``young spring,'' is so
passionate about her work that I can't imagine her crunching
numbers or plotting business strategy in a corporate office. But
her analytical acumen shines as she pieces together the patchwork
of resources that aid refugee women.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the network, funded by government sources and
private foundations, is leadership training for refugee women. Many
of them later initiate projects for families in their communities.
Soon the network will start a newsletter to further link refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter introduced me to some of her Amerasian friends, Nga and
Minh Vo, who have the same mother. They and two other children of
American servicemen and the same Vietnamese woman have created a
home together in Chamblee for their combined families _ eight
adults and nine children. They rent a house with four bedrooms, one
for each family. They arrange their work shifts (Nga and Minh have
factory jobs) so they can rotate child care. They hope to pool
their money to buy a house soon.
</P>
<P>
   A full-time job and caring for three children hasn't allowed
31-year-old Nga time to attend evening English classes like her
older brother, who's been in America for two years. Nga came to
America eight years ago, but Minh stayed in Vietnam to care for his
grandmother until she died, a traditional responsibility of the
oldest child or grandchild. There were five Vo children, and Nga
recalls sadly the hard times when her mother, before her death,
sold small bottles of gasoline alongside a road to earn money for
food. Both remember the hurt of hearing others say their American
fathers were murderers. Amerasians whose fathers deserted them
haven't been accepted very well by Vietnamese or Americans, though
the U.S. government paid for them to come to this country after
passage of the Amerasian Homecoming Act of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter's assistant at the Refugee Network is Nguyet Lam, also
Amerasian. Like Minh, her father was African-American. She and Minh
and other black Amerasian children suffered particularly vicious
taunts.
</P>
<P>
   Lam says the Vos are success stories. Some Amerasians never
recover their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Minh is glad to to be in the land of his father. ``If you
work hard in America,'' he says, ``you can get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter says she lost her country in the war, but she has found
peace of mind in her work. Not long ago, she visited with some
friends from college. ``My classmates are all vice presidents of
such and such businesses,'' she said with a laugh. ``I say to them,
'Look, I am just a poor social worker.' But they say to me, 'Xuan,
you are the happiest of all.'''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A golden boy's suicide in progress
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ What Glenn remembers is the ``purple boy'' _ whose
chin he'd yanked against the wall, holding him at eye-level, which
meant the boy's feet were dangling. Purple is no natural hue. It's
the color of one whose windpipe is being crushed.
</P>
<P>
   What does Glenn remember next? A chair slamming against the back
of his head. The purple boy, being questioned as a snitch,
scampered from death's clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn came to sore and angry. Now he acknowledges whoever swung
that chair may have saved two lives. Amazing, the forms heroism can
take. Amazing, the forms madness can take.
</P>
<P>
   This was the night he drank paint. No misprint there, though I
had to ask him to repeat it. He and his friends were getting good
and soggy from fumes in spray-paint-filled soda bottles. At some
point, so lathered, he tilted his bottle skyward. Gold lacquer
flowed into him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick your poison'' goes the barroom line. Gold paint is his,
although he's tried all sorts of poisons.
</P>
<P>
   He huffed his first paint when he was 9. Mostly it's been
shoplifted from security-lax retailers. He tried gasoline fumes
once, but returned to paint, ``'cause it doesn't kill you that
fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold paint kills you slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Why paint?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I can't do weed.''
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he has to undergo urinalysis under terms of a probation.
Pot shows up in a urine sample, but not paint. That's stone-free.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is not his name but we'll use it. He's been several months
without any killer poison in him. He's on a waiting list for drug
treatment at the Vernon State Home. Every time a vehicle cruises by
you wonder if he'll make it.
</P>
<P>
   When you have his attention, he'll zero in on you with
intensity. But it takes nothing to dislodge his attention. The honk
of a horn. The chime of a popsicle truck.
</P>
<P>
   His mother has seen his reactions slowed, and those of his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not dead, praise God, but they can't carry on an
intelligent conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son is lean and freckled. His close-cropped hair gleams like
a colt's mane. He speaks of devotion to his mom and a will to live,
for her if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being sober is so good, like a soda when you haven't had
none for five days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet you worry that the next sound of a motor idling on the
street will lure him away from the vow that would save what's left
of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's mother says huffing is an epidemic where she lives in
Bellmead, and that parents of her son's peers seem either oblivious
or are acting as outright enablers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellmead Police Chief Robert Harold said police have received
several reports about huffing but never catch it in progress. In an
average year, McLennan County juvenile authorities are able to
prosecute no more than 15 or 20 inhalant cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of makes me angry,'' said Harold. While Glenn's mom is
trying to do something about the problem, he said, other parents
``are leaving it up to law enforcement to take care of something
that should be taught at home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been screaming the longest,'' he said. ``Nobody wants to
do anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   How innocent it must seem, boys and girls and spray paint. Nine
years ago a 17-year-old Waco boy who was huffing paint in a creek
bed smashed a 15-year-old's skull on one of so many unsupervised
nights, killing him in a fit of brain-blown insanity.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Glenn was about to do the purple boy until a blessed
chair cracked him on the skull. Thanks. He needed that.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll be there to save kids with paint in their veins tonight?

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: Britney Spears limps along while album soars
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that's been able to stop teen pop star Britney
Spears is dislocating her knee, which she is now nursing at her
Louisiana home.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears' sales are another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As we call her for the sixth interview she's doing today, the
17-year-old has just learned that her first album, ``... Baby One
More Time,'' is No. 1 for the fourth week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   During her time off, we asked the singer to tell us what it's
like to go from ``Britney Spears, who?'' to ``Britney Spears,
star!'' in just over a month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that right after you hurt your knee, you wheeled into
Cartier and tried on an $80,000 ring. What is it like to be able to
afford things like that now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scary. I didn't buy it though. I was just window-shopping,
like I did before I had a record deal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that you've wanted to be a star since you were 4
years old?
</P>
<P>
   A: I took dance lessons then, but the press has kind of been
getting that wrong. I didn't really know until I was in the fifth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Then you went to New York.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, my mom moved with me for a year. It was really
different, coming from a small town (Kentwood, La.) and all. But I
did an off-Broadway play and some commercials. Then I got the
``Mickey Mouse Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You were there when two members of 'N Sync and (`Felicity'
star) Keri Russell were doing it? Could you see them being who they
are now?
</P>
<P>
   A: We saw it in everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you're back home, how do your friends see and treat
you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The same. We still argue and act stupid and goof off and act
like sisters. If they didn't, I would kick their (butts).

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: ``Star Wars'' prequel to come early
 &HT;    By Theresas Walsh-Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luke, mark your calendar for May 19 _ the Force will be arriving
sooner than expected. ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''
will open in theaters two days early, according to George Lucas,
the film's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work on the film has been going extremely well. We're going to
be able to release it on Wednesday, May 19, in hopes that we can
give the fans a head start and families can see it on the
weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film goes back in time to explain how Luke Skywalker's
father, Anakin Skywalker, became the evil Darth Vader. Lucas is
planning to release ``Episode II'' in 2002 and ``Episode III'' in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Some movie industry experts believe the movie will break
box-office records set last year by ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman for president?
</P>
<P>
   Republican Elizabeth Dole has formed a group to explore her
chances of becoming president of the United States in the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being known as the wife of Bob Dole, a 1996 presidential
candidate, Elizabeth Dole has held many offices of her own.
</P>
<P>
   She is a former secretary of labor and transportation. Plus,
she's been the president of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Two other women have recently pursued presidential politics.
Democrat Pat Schroeder made a short-lived run for president in
1988, and Geraldine Ferraro was a vice presidential nominee on the
Democratic ticket in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble's in trouble
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts will rush to the Hubble Space Telescope this fall to
fix part of its guidance system. The mission was scheduled for June
2000, but will be broken into two parts _ one this October and the
second by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than was
budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had waited until June 2000, there is a very reasonable
chance that we could lose three, four or even more months of
science,'' said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science program.
``This is a rather good insurance policy we're buying here.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, which are needed for stability,
have failed since the astronauts' last service call in 1997. And a
third gyroscope suffered a partial breakdown recently. Gyroscopes
are wheels mounted in frames that spin. They are similar to toy
tops.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct
observations throughout the universe.

<P>
   VIENNA-PHILHARMONIC-WOMEN (New York) _ For 156 years, the Vienna
Philharmonic was a male-only preserve. But early in 1997, bowing to
pressure from women's groups abroad, the orchestra voted to open
its ranks to women. But a change in its membership policy will not
soon change the makeup of the Vienna Philharmonic, as the eerie
sight of one lone female, Anna Lelkes, a harpist, amid a stage full
of white males during the Shostakovich symphony made abundantly
clear. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-SHOWDOWN (Hollywood) _ Two of the heavyweight moguls in
the entertainment business, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of
Miramax, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-owner of Dreamworks, have been
locked in a not-too-subtle clash over Miramax's aggressive efforts
to win the Academy Award for best picture for ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' or, possibly, ``Life Is Beautiful.'' By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA-ORCHESTRA (Undated) _ During its centennial, the
Philadelphia will offer its subscribers only those works composed
during the orchestra's lifetime, which exactly encompasses the 20th
century. This pertains only to the subscription series, but still,
its regular subscribers will face a season of music from this
century, a programming concept that no other American orchestra has
ever tried. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-BURIAL-MEMORIAL (New York) _ When the federal building
at 290 Broadway was completed in 1994, one thing was missing: the
memorial the government promised to build marking the 18th-century
African Burial Ground unearthed during the excavation for the
building. Monday, the federal General Services Administration plans
to announce the five teams of architects and historians who will
compete to design and build a 2,000-square-foot Interpretive
Center. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTOROW-COLUMN _ E.L. Doctorow writes about the effect of
filmmaking on the practice of literature in the ``Writers on
Writing'' column.
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-CONNECTIONS (Undated) _ As appreciations of the director
Stanley Kubrick continue after his death, with paeans to his icy
brilliance and his meticulous artistry, one of his major characters
is being neglected, and I don't mean Dr. Strangelove or HAL or
Lolita. I mean music. The Connections column, by Edward Rothstein.
</P>

   BETTY-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Ben Brantley reviews ``Betty's
Summer Vacation,'' an ecstatically angry new comedy by Christopher
Durang.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CMGI-WETHERELL (Undated) _ David S. Wetherell, the 44-year-old
chairman and chief executive of the investment firm CMGI Inc. is
holding his cards close to his vest in a gamble that could become
the first hostile takeover battle in the short history of Internet
commerce. By Evan I. Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSQUATTERS (Washington) _ Though often labeled hijackers,
pirates or extortionists, ``cybersquatters'' is the most common
term for investors who seek popular names, book titles or
celebrity-related words to add to their stockpiles. For an
investment of just $70, they can secure two-year rights to a name.
In return, they can reap handsome rewards from companies eager to
protect products or trademarks. By Jeri Clausing.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-SHYSTERS (Undated) _ While many consumers have worried that
Year 2000 computer problems will cripple the banking system,
bankers and law-enforcement officials have been warning that the
bigger financial risks may come from scam artists and thieves
playing on such fears. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFET-REPORT (Undated) _ Accounting gimmicks and
misrepresentations to investors have become so commonplace at
public companies that it has prompted Warren Buffett, in his annual
report to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to make an
extraordinary attack on many of his fellow chief executives, who he
says have worked purposefully ``at manipulating numbers and
deceiving investors.'' By Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-BUSINESS (Coding varies.)
</P>
<P>
   PAPERBACKS-MEDIA (New York) _ Since 1995, the number of
mass-market paperbacks sold in the United States has declined by
almost 9 percent, falling to 484 million copies last year, about
three times the percentage loss in consumer books overall. And the
immediate future offers little comfort; the book industry's
research arm, the Book Industry Study Group, is projecting
continued slight annual declines for the paperback market over the
next several years. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   VANITYFAIR-MEDIA (Undated) _ At Vanity Fair's Oscar party last
year, Morton's restaurant became so choked with people that at
midnight the Los Angeles fire marshalls stormed in and took action.
That annual party has come to embody the magazine's happy symbiosis
with Hollywood. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKSELLERS-MEDIA (New York) _ Facing intensifying competition,
the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is
creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off
fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. By
Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   WEATHER-CHANNEL-MEDIA (Undated) _ Reaching 70 million homes and
offering programming that may cost less to produce than almost
anything this side of C-SPAN, the Weather Channel is ``a cash
machine,'' in the estimation of Jessica Reif, a media analyst at
Merrill Lynch. By Geraldine Fabrikant.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLYNDAVIS-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The Advertising column: As
imaginary advertising characters go, Carolyn Davis, who pitches
products in the pages of Reader's Digest magazine, is no Betty
Crocker. But Davis is now starting to get around. By Seth Schiesel.

   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CHINA-MILITARY (Undated) _ The revelation that China
appears to have stolen the design of America's most advanced
miniaturized warhead has promted new debate in Washington over
whether China's small nuclear force could become a far more potent
arsenal that could rekindle the kind of fears that shaped the cold
war. Most experts say that Chinese authorities are clearly seeking
to modernize their nuclear forces, but despite continuing evidence
of Chinese espionage abroad, they doubt the country intends to
fundamentally change its nuclear strategy, which has been largely
defensive. By David E. Sanger and Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ENTREPRENEURS (Beijing) _ On Monday, China's Parliament
will tip its hat to the country's emerging entrepreneurs, amending
its Constitution to declare private business ``an important
component of the socialist market economy.'' By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BOMBINGS (NOVO SELO, Yugoslavia) _ Both Albanian and
Serbs in a village not far from where attacks killed six on
Saturday say that they hope the latest round of talks in Paris will
bring peace and that they trust NATO troops to insure any accord.
By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TALKS (Washington) _ American officials expect little
from the latest round of talks over Kosovo. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-MASSACRES (Shanker Bigha, India) _ In one of India's
poorest and most populated states, a series of massacres have been
aimed at keeping low caste Indians in line. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND-ABORTION (Dublin, Ireland) _ The dispute over Ireland's
virtual ban on abortion accelerates as four members of the European
Parliament _ all women _ accused the government of delaying a
statement of its policy on issue. By James F. Clarity.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-UNCERTAINTY (Istanbul, Turkey) _ With a national election
approaching, Parliament in open rebellion against the political
establishment, murderous terror attacks being launched against
civilians and the trial of a hated Kurdish guerrilla leader
approaching, Turkey suddenly finds itself facing deep
uncertainties. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-CONSERVATIVES (LONDON) _ The principal challenge these
days for William Hague, who heads Britain's depleted and dispirited
Conservative party, is simply trying to matter. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   ARMY-REFORM (Fort Irwin, Calif.) _ Struggling to stay relevant,
the Army considers changes in the way it organizes divisions and
trains them to fight. Out here at the Army's premier training base,
the Army is still training to fight the Warsaw Pact, taking on an
enemy no one expects it to confront, in a way no one expects will
happen, with tactics no one expects to prevail. By Steven Lee
Myers. With art.
</P>
<P>
   With: ARMY-CASPIAN (Washington) _ The Army's wargamers devise a
scenario for the kind of messy intervention the United States is
more likely to see: protecting Caspian Sea oil. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-SAFETY-LOCK (Undated) _ There is little question that some
of the 1,500 accidental shooting deaths that occur annually could
have be prevented if gun are safely stored or put away unloaded.
But a look at how firearms companies have approached the use of one
device _ a safety lock that disables a semiautomatic handgun when
the magazine is removed _ provides a portrait of an unregulated
industry, one that apparently neither seeks independent answers
about important safety issues nor is capable of reaching consensus
from within. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN-FISH (Conneaut, Ohio) _ Call it nostalgia. Or
sentimentality. Or call it an uncanny prescience. Jim Anthony
himself is not exactly sure why he kept a a blue pike in his
freezer for 37 years, carefully rewrapping it every so often and
making sure his wife did not let the fish thaw out every time she
defrosted the freezer. Now, nearly four decades later, the pike has
become the central clue in a compelling scientific detective story,
sleuthing that some scientists are hoping will lead to an
extraordinary result: the return of an extinct species. By Pam
Belluck. With art.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-2000 (Austin, Texas) _ How does a politician with little
experience beyond his own state educate himself so he can run for
president _ or even be president? Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
established an unusually systematic approach, where hundreds of
experts are voyaging to Austin to educate him. We look inside those
meetings. How are they run? What do they talk about? And we look at
how some of the participants are already angling for big roles
should Bush get elected. By Richard Berke and Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY-INTERVENTION (Undated) _ Programs that seek to reduce
violence, drug abuse, pregnancy and other dangerous or unhealthy
activities among adolescents are notorious for doing too little too
late and at too great a cost. But a new study has shown that by
starting early _ in grades one through six _ to foster an interest
in school and learning among children and to enhance their
self-esteem, many of these risky behaviors can be averted and
school performance and attendance can be improved through high
school. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-COMPUTER-INJURY (Undated) _ In the rush to bring 21st
century technology to every child in the nation, experts say that
there has been virtually no discussion of health or safety to
insure that children have appropriate equipment and furniture and
proper training in posture and keyboard technique. While no one is
predicting a nation of crippled children, there is widespread
concern among physicians, physical therapists and ergonomists that
a tide of injury is inevitable as youngsters spend more time on
computers, both at school and at home. By Jane Gross. With art.

<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-OSHA-WHISTLEBLOWERS (Washington) _ After finding that
workers who complain of health and safety hazards are often
dismissed from their jobs, the Clinton administration will soon
propose sweeping new protections for such ``whistleblowers.''
Republicans are receptive to the idea. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-GAYS-HARASSMENT (Washington) _ Group representing gay
men and lesbians in the military says in a report that cases of
harassment have doubled in the last year, leaving service members
in a bind, since complaining often begins an investigation into
their sexuality. By Steven Lee Myers.

   EXCLUSIVE-CHINA-MILITARY (Undated) _ The revelation that China
appears to have stolen the design of America's most advanced
miniaturized warhead has promted new debate in Washington over
whether China's small nuclear force could become a far more potent
arsenal that could rekindle the kind of fears that shaped the cold
war. Most experts say that Chinese authorities are clearly seeking
to modernize their nuclear forces, but despite continuing evidence
of Chinese espionage abroad, they doubt the country intends to
fundamentally change its nuclear strategy, which has been largely

   GUNS-SAFETY-LOCK (Undated) _ There is little question that some
of the 1,500 accidental shooting deaths that occur annually could
have be prevented if gun are safely stored or put away unloaded.
But a look at how firearms companies have approached the use of one
device _ a safety lock that disables a semiautomatic handgun when

making sure his wife did not let the fish thaw out every time she

   EARLY-INTERVENTION (Undated) _ Programs that seek to reduce
violence, drug abuse, pregnancy and other dangerous or unhealthy
activities among adolescents are notorious for doing too little too

starting early _ in grades one through six _ to foster an interest

school performance and attendance can be improved through high
school. By Jane E. Brody.

   KIDS-COMPUTER-INJURY (Undated) _ In the rush to bring 21st
century technology to every child in the nation, experts say that
there has been virtually no discussion of health or safety to
insure that children have appropriate equipment and furniture and
proper training in posture and keyboard technique. While no one is
predicting a nation of crippled children, there is widespread

KATZENBERG AND WEINSTEIN: A COUPLE OF OLD PALS WRESTLING FOR AN

   HOLLYWOOD _ It's Harvey versus Jeffrey!
</P>
<P>
   Two of the heavyweight moguls in the entertainment business,
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
co-owner of Dreamworks, have been locked in a not too subtle clash
over Miramax's aggressive efforts to win the Academy Award for best
picture for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' or, possibly, ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' Miramax itself has turned Academy Awards campaigns
into an expensive art, heavily promoting films as varied as ``The
Piano,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The English Patient'' and winning
Oscars in some top categories.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dreamworks film ``Saving Private Ryan'' remains the
leading contender for the Oscar, the comedy ``Shakespeare in Love''
seems to be gaining. Katzenberg and his Dreamworks partners, Steven
Spielberg and David Geffen, are not only upset but also pointing to
magazine and newspaper articles containing allegations that
Miramax, which is owned by Walt Disney, has been bad-mouthing
``Saving Private Ryan,'' their World War II epic. Weinstein
vigorously denies this.
</P>
<P>
   With the Academy Award ceremonies next Sunday, Weinstein and
Katzenberg, who are old friends, got on the phone together the
other afternoon with a reporter to try to make it plain that
whatever the bad feelings about the Oscar race, they still liked
each other very much. Sort of. Complicating the relationship is the
fact that Katzenberg, while chairman of Walt Disney Studios, played
a role in Disney's purchase of Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the conversation, Katzenberg made it clear he was
displeased that Dreamworks was forced to spend millions more on its
Academy Award campaign for ``Saving Private Ryan'' because Miramax
had upped the ante with ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' Studios routinely promote their films in Variety and
The Hollywood Reporter to persuade the 5,000 members of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to select their movies. (The
others films nominated for best picture are ``Elizabeth'' and ``The
Thin Red Line.'')
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``The reason we're doing this is to show the town and
the world at large that there's a unity between the companies. I
have tremendous admiration for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Even though Miramax has brought Dreamworks to its
knees, we're not taking it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``Actually there'll be a series of benefit concerts
with Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to raise money for
Dreamworks' additional expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Which we graciously accept. Send the check. Harvey
had spent between seven and eight billion dollars. That's a B.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein (ignoring him): ``We spent $800,000 on the
post-nomination campaign for `Shakespeare in Love''' in the
Hollywood trade papers. ``We'll probably spend $10 million
post-nomination to market the film nationally. Of that we bought
consumer newspaper and spot television advertising in New York and
L.A. for $1 million. And that has blurred some of these figures
being tossed around about our academy campaign; $800,000 is not an
unseemly figure for an academy campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``They spent $3 million on the trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: `` `Life Is Beautiful,' we actually spent $550,000 _
tops $600,000. And that's because the majority of the seven
nominations are for Benigni so we can do ads for Benigni that
include all his nominations in the same ad. The overall campaign
from beginning to end for `Shakespeare' is $30 million. It's a bit
less than the overall campaign for `The English Patient.' I'm not
doing anything different to market these movies this year than any
other year. We began the movie with a small release. Went wide. Got
to the academy. And the blitzkrieg was really in support of the
commercial release of the film. `Shakespeare in Love' was $38
million at the box office before the nomination. It's $66 million
now. And it'll be $75 million by the time of the awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg was asked if he had increased his budget for the
Oscar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Yes, we've increased it. They have run a very
aggressive and competitive campaign. To run a competitive campaign
is certainly Harvey's right, although one of the things I know is
that you can't influence academy voters. I believe it. We have not
yet decided to forgive Harvey for it. But it's his right to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein started to speak, but Katzenberg interrupted: ``Before
his retort let us both agree that if Harvey turns himself into a
victim, you've got to give me a moment to get some Kleenex. It's
going to be a sad story.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``No victim! I agree. You can't influence academy
voters. The trade campaign in `Shakespeare' was, in some ways, for
people who made sacrifices. It was made for $38 million, and four
and a half of that was because of a false start in 1992. A lot of
people made sacrifices. The trades can help your technicians,
production designers, others, raise their salaries. It's sort of an
IOU for them. It can never influence best picture or any of the
other major categories. You know who outspent everybody? `City of
Angels.' They spent the most money pre-nominations. And it wasn't
nominated in any category.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were asked how they would characterize each other's
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``It's been brilliant on Jeffrey's part. All I do is
defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Here we are. The victim speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``But really.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``It's a sad song, Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``I have said to every newspaper in the country, I
have said how much I respect `Private Ryan,' and I've said this
from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Tell the truth, Harvey. He told me he voted for
`Private Ryan.' Admit it, Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``No, no, no. I can't say that. But I voted for
`Schindler's List.'''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``I loved `Ryan.' My dad was a combat veteran. He
would never watch World War II movies because the violence was too
cartoonish. When I saw `Private Ryan,' it solved a mystery for me.
My dad passed away when I was 20. I called Steven to congratulate
him. I told Mrs. Clinton that the movie was a masterpiece and she
should see it, and Mrs. Clinton has an aversion to films with
violence. She and the president loved the movie. So this charge is
scurrilous and an effort by people to ruin long-standing
friendships. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``Who are the people, Harvey? Tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein (laughing): ``I don't know. Look, we want to take this
as constructive criticism and take it to heart. There will be less.
We've diminished our whole approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``We've redoubled ours.''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``It's been an incredibly good year. The five movies
nominated are really pretty brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``I adored all five films. Anyone that wins, I'll be
happy about.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were told that despite everything they still seemed
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``Seriously, these are my friends. Jeffrey, Steven
and David. I would never hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg: ``What a beautiful story.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein: ``He brought me into the company. Ever since he
brought me in to Disney, I've had to follow him around. I'm his

SALMON GAIN FEDERAL PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One hundred years ago this year, a Smithsonian
Institution biologist visited the Pacific Northwest and marveled at
the plentifulness of the fish that has come to symbolize the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quantities of salmon which frequent these waters is beyond
calculation,'' said Richard Rathbun, ``and seems to be so great as
to challenge human ingenuity to affect it in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last century, human ingenuity in the form of
homebuilding, logging, farming, dam-building, fishing and other
activities has managed to significantly affect those very same
salmon runs of which Rathbun spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in an attempt to reverse the course of history, the
federal government plans to formally announce that nine salmon and
steelhead groupings in Washington and Oregon are headed for
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling salmon runs are throughout the Northwest, from
Ozette Lake on the Olympic Peninsula to the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette rivers. By the end of the day Tuesday, virtually every
watershed in Washington state will be subject to the strictures of
the federal Endangered Species Act, which makes it a crime to harm
endangered and threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come. In June, another federal agency plans
to list coastal Puget Sound bull trout _ another type of salmon _
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the focus will be on the wild Puget Sound chinook,
prized by fishermen for their large size, but now numbering about
one-third of their historic peak. The chinook spend part of their
life cycle in rivers and streams that extend throughout the same
part of the Northwest most densely populated by human beings _ the
central Puget Sound counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish, home to
3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The listing of four groups of chinook as threatened _ meaning
they are at risk of becoming endangered _ will post a major test of
just how far this country is willing to go in protecting endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 702 species of plants and 477 species of
animals listed for protection under the 26-year-old Endangered
Species Act. But most of those species live in sparsely populated
rural areas. Never before has the government demanded protection of
a species whose habitat so completely suffuses one of the nation's
large metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   By declaring the species eligible for protection under the
federal Endangered Species Act, the government will be calling for
changes in a wide variety of practices by farmers, fishermen,
builders, businesses and homeowners. These groups are thought to be
harming the salmon either directly, by catching them or blocking
their passage, or indirectly, by polluting or altering the waters
the fish call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got problems with water quality and water quantity in
many parts of the state, habitat destruction from agriculture and
timber and development, hydropower and harvest and hatchery
impacts,'' says Curt Smitch, salmon adviser to Gov. Gary Locke.
Smitch says changes could be required in all of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine species to be listed for protection Tuesday, seven
are in Washington state, and two are in Oregon. The National Marine
Fisheries Services has decided to postpone for six months decisions
on whether to list for protection four other species in California
and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message of the listings is that salmon and the need
to recover salmon has landed squarely in the urban areas of the
Northwest, and not just the countryside,'' said Bill Bradbury,
executive director of the Oregon-based group For the Sake of the
Salmon, a coalition of governments, industry and environmental
groups working to conserve salmon. ``That was already true, or
becoming true, in Portland, but clearly with major listings in the
Puget Sound, salmon have come to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the announcement will be gradual _ at first, only
federal actions will be affected, and it will take some months
before federal agenciesspell out the rules that place new
restrictions on activities on state and private lands.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments hope to retain a large degree of
control over salmon conservation measures, but ultimately, the
federal government and any activist can ask the courts to force an
end to behavior that harms the threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of next year, the changes are likely to affect
many of the residents and businesses of the central Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilding will be more difficult along the region's many
waterways. Disposal of agricultural and industrial waste will be
more closely scrutinized. The already sharply-restricted commercial
and sport fisheries in Puget Sound may be even more restricted.
Small dams could be bypassed or removed. Homeowners may be asked to
pay higher fees for stormwater storage and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is going to be some pain involved in this,''
said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries
Service. ``We're not going to go back to the middle of the 19th
Century, but we're not going to ignore the fact that critical,
vital salmon habitat has been destroyed and is being destroyed,
and...that's going to be a violation of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are hoping they can protect the salmon
without choking off the region's remarkable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a challenge to grow much more wisely, in a
smarter fashion than ever before,'' said Gov. Gary Locke.
</P>
<P>
   The diet of Northwesterners, however, is not likely to be
impacted. Most salmon sold in area supermarkets is either caught
wild in Alaska or is raised in pens in Canada, Chile and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest has grappled with the Endangered Species
Act before. The listing of the northern spotted owl for protection
in 1990 caused tremendous bitterness in the region, pitting
environmentalists against timber communities and ultimately helping
to spur unsuccessful efforts to overturn the law.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, Oregon began a costly and failed battle to prevent
the federal government from listing coastal coho for protection.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's listings, which will remain in place until the
salmon runs recover, are dramatically different. Conservatives in
Congress have given up any effort to weaken the Endangered Species
Act, and local officials aren't even considering mounting a
challenge to the declaration that salmon are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon _ because of their iconic status in the Northwest _ seem
to enjoy greater public sympathy than the rarely seen owl. And
although the salmon listing is likely to affect more people than
the spotted owl listing, the effect is likely to be more diffused,
with few communities suffering the sharp economic damage
experienced by logging towns a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken last summer by Elway Research found that most
residents are willing to spend money to save salmon, and most do
not believe a listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act
will directly affect their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that there is public sympathy for the salmon because
their plight, in some ways, echoes the plight of human residents of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this region are tired of the direction we're going,
as far as quality of life,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director
of the Washington Environmental Alliance for Voter Education. ``The
salmon are an indicator of environmental problems we're having in
the Northwest...Whether it's sitting in traffic, the loss of open
spaces, declining drinking water -- this is kind of a wake-up
call.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the Endangered Species Act aims to protect the
endangered animals. It is likely to be decades before anyone really
knows whether the measures forced by Tuesday's listing which
actually lead to restoration of the salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new here _ we have been worried about the
decline of salmon and trying to do something about it for over a
century, but we keep trying the same kinds of things the same
ways,'' said James Karr, a professor of fisheries and zoology at
the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement is going to cause a lot of activity, but
sadly, a substantial portion of that activity will be wheelspinning
unrelated to restoring salmon, and as a society we should be up in
arms about that because it's our resources that are being wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very large number of these runs are going to be brought back
to vitality,'' said Denis Hayes, a leading environmental advocate
and president of the Bullitt Foundation. ``I am enough of a realist
not to believe they all will, but this is a region that from the
governor to the clerk in the grocery store shares an objective to
make this happen...We'll just pull up our boots and get to it.''

TALK RADIO COPES WITH LIFE AFTER LEWINSKY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's romantic travails and legal entanglements
proved both a boon and bane to talk radio over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who tuned in to hear titillating discussions about
Oval Office trysts lifted ratings of most radio talk shows last
spring and summer, radio executives say. However, by fall, as the
scandal shifted to constitutional questions, the sobriety of
impeachment hearings put off some listeners more entertained by
tales of sex, lies and telephone tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite renewed interest in Monica Lewinsky as she took her turn
in the spotlight during a promotional book tour during the last two
weeks, radio hosts and program directors say they are eager to move
beyond the left-right debates that characterized their shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so glad it's over,'' said Mary June Rose, program
director for Chicago's top-rated news-talk station, WGN. ``The
public said, `We're sick of hearing about it.' It will force talk
show hosts to work for their paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   More people tuned in to the nation's 1,200 news-talk stations
last spring and summer when talk radio ratings on average increased
to 14.8 percent of the total listening audience for radio, up
eight-tenths of a percentage point over 1997 figures. Also there
was a smaller-than-normal drop-off from the winter, according to
the ratings service Arbitron. (Generally, listening declines after
winter when news about the weather is less crucial.) Later, in the
1998 final quarter, talk radio drew 15.3 percent of listeners,
compared with 15.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Call-in hosts like Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, who thrive
on political discussion, made the most of the scandal. But interest
gradually waned. Richard B. Wood, director of WOR Radio Network,
which syndicates 10 programs, including the Bob Grant talk show, to
400 stations, said: ``Talk radio ratings went down in the fall.
People were so tired of Bill Clinton and this one story.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether radio will suffer life-after-Lewinsky doldrums came up
at a recent talk radio conference, but was not a focal point, said
Al Peterson, an editor for Radio and Records, a weekly trade
publication. ``It was the same thing after the O.J. trial,'' he
said. ``The overall sense was, there's always a new topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh, who declined through a spokesman to be interviewed,
regained his position as the nation's most-listened-to host in the
year's last half, according to a ranking to be released Tuesday by
Talkers magazine, a trade journal about talk stations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the magazine said Limbaugh had tumbled to No. 3
behind Dr. Laura Schlessinger and Howard Stern, a ranking Limbaugh
disputed.

WEATHER CHANNEL'S LOW COSTS AND LOYAL VIEWERS CREATE A CABLE TV
SUCCESS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ohio, Miss., Fla., Va., Alaska, Ill., Tenn., Nev.)   (ms) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He may not know it, but Elmer Gruber is a ``weather weenie.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the affectionate nickname people at the Weather Channel
use for their most devoted viewers. And Gruber is a true devotee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of days the entertainment programs are so bad, I just
turn on the Weather Channel and watch,'' Gruber, 80, said in a
telephone interview from his home in suburban Cincinnati. ``We
watch the local weather on the 8's _ 8 after, 18 after, 28, 38 and
48 after,'' he said, the other half of ``we'' being his wife,
Eugina. ``Five- and seven-day forecasts are on at 20 after,'' said
Gruber, a retired surgical appliances executive, who estimates that
he watches the Weather Channel at least an hour every day. ``And
some days more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Weather Channel has not become one of the cable
industry's most widely distributed and profitable programmers on
the ratings of retirees alone. The ``weather involved'' _ another
of the company's labels _ includes people whose work requires them
to keep tabs on the elements.
</P>
<P>
   One is Joe Dier, head of media relations for the Mississippi
State University baseball team. (``If we know it will rain in the
third inning, the coach's strategy might change.'')
</P>
<P>
   Another is Steve Bruce, a floor broker for grains at the Chicago
Board of Trade, who watches the Weather Channel from the trading
pit. (``If there is a hurricane expected to hit New Orleans it
plugs up the river system; that's a problem.'')
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there are the voyeurs who are simply
fascinated by the weather, particularly when nature displays its
telegenic fury. These are the types that the Weather Channel
celebrates in its popular TV ads, which feature weather fanatics
who hang out at a fictional place called the Front and carry on as
if they were fans in a sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Dier might fit right in at the Front. He grew up in
hurricane-prone Florida, moved to typhoon territory _ Okinawa,
Japan _ and then lived in Alaska, land of weather extremes. ``I
went into public relations, but I might have ventured toward
meteorology,'' said Dier, who once sent fan mail to his favorite
Weather Channel weathercaster, Vivian Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching 70 million homes and offering programming that may cost
less to produce than almost anything else this side of C-SPAN, the
Weather Channel is ``a cash machine,'' in the estimation of Jessica
Reif, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The financial figures are not reported, because the channel is
privately held, owned by Landmark Communications, a
family-controlled company in Norfolk, Va., whose other media
holdings include The Virginian-Pilot, The Roanoke Times, KLAS-TV in
Las Vegas, and WTVF-TV in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But a person familiar with its finances said that the Weather
Channel generated about $100 million in operating profits in 1998
on revenue of $200 million that came primarily from advertising, as
well as from fees paid by cable operators. With a remarkably high
profit margin of some 50 percent, the service could probably
attract a buyer willing to pay as much at 15 times cash flow, or
about $1.65 billion, according to Derek Baine, a cable analyst at
Paul Kagan Associations, the media consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Battan family, Landmark's owners, reportedly has no plans to
sell the Weather Channel, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 50 percent margins, why sell it?'' Ms. Reif said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The operation is run out of a sleek eight &UR; - &LR; story office
building just outside Atlanta. There, 80 meteorologists analyze
weather data provided primarily by the National Weather Service,
supplemented by other sources that include military weather feeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of any 15-minute segment, a Weather Channel viewer
can get national, regional and local coverage that includes maps,
charts and other data. The national weather programming,
transmitted by satellite, appears on all local systems. For local
forecasts, cable operators have hardware and software systems that
can sift out the relevant information from the Weather Channel's
data feed, to present the local weather in text and graphics during
local breaks in the national program.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, many of the 30 on-camera meteorologists have become
celebrities in their own right. Cheryl Lempke, for example, is
about to be featured in a fashion shoot in Mirabella magazine.
</P>
<P>
   With so many meteorologists, the Weather Channel can have
specialists, like John Hope, the channel's 79-year-old hurricane
maven, who works only during tropical storm season, from June to
November. His is a popular beat with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to talk to me all the time,'' Hope said, ``but I
can't take all the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1982 and profitable by 1985, according to the Weather
Channel's president, Michael Eckert, the meteorological service is
able to repackage its material for other media. The channel, for
example, provides weather reports to 250 radio stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel's weather maps are also sold to 52
newspapers _ including The New York Daily News, The Detroit Free
Press and The San Francisco Examiner _ through a distribution
arrangement with Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to go global, though, were a washout. After opening a
network operation center in London in late 1995, the Weather
Channel began offering service in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany
and Italy. But with many of the European cable systems already
filled, or nearly so, the Weather Channel had trouble making its
way into enough households to create an advertising base. The
European experiment ended early last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, with 95 percent of the Weather Channel's
revenue and profit coming from the cable channel, the company is
exploring other media outlets. Its Internet site, Weather.com,
ranked 21st among all Web sites in January, with 6.2 million
different visitors, according to the measurement company Media
Metrix Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On the ad-supported site, visitors can order books, make
suggestions for the service, monitor snow conditions in ski country
and check out weather reports by city.
</P>
<P>
   Other technologies are beckoning. ``We are looking at new
platforms, new ways to generate revenues _ Palm Pilots, pagers, all
of these new technologies that let consumers receive weather
information,'' Eckert said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also testing interactive weather data with Wink
Communications Inc., a company that works with cable operators to
offer services that let individual viewers select information from
a variety of options. The Weather Channel is now testing a Wink
service with viewers in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Weather Channel is almost totally dependent
on its regular cable business. And with the channel already
available in 98 percent of the nation's cable households, there is
not much room for growth in that medium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the network has one key advantage over many cable
channels: it does not have to worry about its programming going out
of style. Many viewers seem unable to get enough weather news _
even if the Weather Channel's forecasters are not infallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's raining outside,'' Dier, the baseball publicist,
complained during a telephone interview from his home in
Starkville, Miss., last week. ``The Weather Channel said it was not
going to rain. They were wrong this morning. This is the one time
they were wrong.''

AMID MOUNTING TURMOIL, TURKEY FACING DEEP UNCERTAINTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With a national election approaching,
Parliament in open rebellion against the political establishment,
murderous terror attacks being mounted against civilians and the
trial of a hated Kurdish guerrilla leader approaching, Turkey
suddenly finds itself facing deep uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chaos is now awaiting Turkey,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said Saturday. ``This is a totally new situation. We will have to
think about it and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit spoke after a group of disgruntled members of Parliament
broke the pre-election recess and managed to convene an
extraordinary session. They voted to meet again later this week,
possibly to consider postponing the April 18 election and debate
other measures abhorrent to the political and military elite.
</P>
<P>
   As the parliamentary session was underway Saturday in Ankara,
three men sped past a crowded Istanbul shopping center and hurled a
fire bomb through a window. Thirteen people perished in the
inferno. No one took responsibility, and there were no immediate
arrests. It was the third fatal act of terrorism in Turkey this
month.
</P>
<P>
   A Maoist faction seriously wounded a provincial governor,
killing a 14-year-old girl and two others in the attempt, in a car
bombing near Ankara on March 5. One of the alleged assailants was
arrested, and information he provided led the police to raid a
house that was found to contain an arsenal of guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two bombs exploded in Istanbul, one of them killing a
taxi driver. As in Saturday's shopping center attack, there was no
claim of responsibility, but speculation centered on groups angered
by the capture of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is being held at an island prison 35 miles southwest of
the capital. He is reportedly cooperating with his interrogators,
and according leaked accounts of his purported testimony, has
expressed repentance for his group's violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   As Ocalan's admirers seek to decide how to proceed without him,
however, at least some have apparently decided to commit acts of
urban terror. Such acts have been rare in Turkey's western cities,
which lie far from the southeastern provinces where the Kurdish war
is being fought.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish authorities have announced that they will try
Ocalan, probably within the next few months. He has been charged
with treason, which can carry the death penalty, and may also be
charged with responsibility for a series of fatal attacks launched
by his guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disturbing combination of things happening at the
same time,'' said a foreign diplomat posted in Istanbul. ``You've
got a potentially very important election coming up, Parliament is
in upheaval, and now this rash of bombings. If the attacks spread
to tourist areas, the problem is going to become economic as well
as political. All in all it's quite a messy moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislators' session on Saturday was organized by a group of
deputies angry that their party leaders had dropped them from lists
of candidates for re-election. They want the election postponed,
and are supported by one party afraid that if elections are held
next month, it will fail to win the 10 percent of votes necessary
to enter Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some deputies from the Islamic-oriented Virtue party also voted
for the successful motion to convene another parliamentary session
later this week. They don't much care when the election is held,
but have an agenda of their own, one that deeply angers Ecevit and
other secular politicians and generals.
</P>
<P>
   These deputies want to repeal a law that allows parties to be
banned if they are deemed to be challenging the secular Republic.
They are also seeking to overturn a court under which their most
prominent leader, former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, was
found to be introducing religion into politics and forbidden to run
for Parliament or participate in politics for the next five years.

INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS PLAN TO OPEN ONLINE STORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade
association for independent booksellers is creating its own
national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition
from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   The online venture, which is scheduled to open for business this
summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of
countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American
Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered
fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book
market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition
from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store
owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are
under siege. The electronic bookstore and a planned national
marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an
ordinarily disparate group of independents. The goals is to compete
against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to
about 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to knock off the Goliaths _ I don't want to
look naive,'' said Hut Landon, a bookstore owner in Mill Valley,
Calif., and the executive director of the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association, which developed the pilot
concept last year. ``All we're trying to do is retain our market
share. We recognize that we've got to do this in this day and age.
We can't just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking
how the kids are.''
</P>
<P>
   The association already has organized a series of 12 customer
focus groups along with the development of the electronic
bookstore. In its initial stages, the store will feature all the
standard functions of popular online sites, including a search
engine, a stock of 1.5 million titles, credit card fulfillment,
gift wrapping, distribution services and a best-seller list. But it
will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect
their individuality with store reviews and features.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do is find the different ways that
we can do what our competitors are doing,'' said Michael F. Hoynes,
the association's newly hired marketing officer. He said initial
interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have
been asking for a collective approach.
</P>
<P>
   The booksellers' association, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will
begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book
Sense brand, which in some ways is inspired by the example of the
independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True
Value label.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend about $2 million to develop the
electronic bookstore and about $2 million more on the marketing
campaign _ money that comes in part from its half-share of $25
million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a
dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail
bookstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, where there is a strong and active group
of independent booksellers, the regional association has also spent
about $100,000 to promote a common identity under the name Book
Sense. The brand and a slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for
Independent Minds,'' are appearing in newspaper advertisements and
on decals, posters, and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area,
where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the
pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective approach envisioned by the national
association is broader in scope, conceivably allowing customers to
order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at
any participating Book Sense store. The association is already in
discussions with a national wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor, to provide
distribution services, a critical element for an online service
that caters to customers with swift delivery. It is also
considering expanding the electronic title base to include
out-of-print books.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the pricing system still is being determined,
although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to
offer discounts on their templates, said Len Vlahos, the
association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, the association will start signing
up members to participate in the electronic project, which would
cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range
from $175 to $450.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several technology analysts said that the move was a vital step
to protect the booksellers eroding turf, and noted that the
independents may be able to capitalize on strengths in ways that
Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble cannot.
</P>
<P>
   David Brodwin, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting who
follows electronic commerce, said the Book Sense venture would draw
on the loyalty of customers who prefer local bookstores over
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents will feature locally relevant information _
travel, restaurant guides, local history _ with a degree of
sophistication and connoisseurship that the nationwide players may
have trouble matching,'' Brodwin said. He cautioned, though, that
associations often move slowly. That could present problems for
success in electronic commerce, which requires decisiveness and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, the director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research company, said that
independent booksellers had no choice but to act because customers'
shopping habits were changing.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester projects that almost $1.2 billion in book purchases
will be made online this year, she said. Spending will rise in 2003
to almost $3 billion, or about 18 percent of the book market, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book lover in me is thrilled to hear about this for the
independents,'' Ms. Delhagen said. ``Banding together and forming a
network is the only way. This is a huge opportunity for them to
survive, because long term, they're getting eviscerated. There is
an option now rather than shuttering their stores. This development
presents them with an opportunity to say, `I'm sticking around, and
we're not letting Amazon and Barnes &AMP; Noble run us out of town.'''

UPROAR OVER USA NETWORKS-LYCOS DEAL MAY LEAD TO RETHINKING OF
PORTAL CONCEPT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not shareholders ultimately bless or curse the
proposed merger of Lycos with Barry Diller's television shopping
company, USA Networks, the deal may well have catalyzed a
long-overdue rethinking of the business of Internet portals, those
launching pads from which millions of Web surfers rocket onto the
Internet each day.
</P>
<P>
   Until the announcement of the USA Networks-Lycos deal sent the
stock of both companies plummeting, Internet portals _ most of
which used to be known by the more nerdy term ``search engines'' _
had been the darlings of Internet-happy Wall Streeters,
stratospheric in their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   But even with most portal stocks holding their value, the
leaders of some of these companies now say their business needs
redefinition.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea was that the sheer numbers of visitors to
portals would draw advertisers, who needed to drive traffic to
their sites so that they, in turn, could sell advertising based on
traffic. As demand for ad space outstripped the available number of
Web pages at their sites, portal companies started bulking up with
news and contests, stock quotes and product promotions, shopping,
custom home pages and free e-mail _ just about anything they could
think of that would both create advertising space and keep the
largest number of users coming back.
</P>
<P>
   But now many portal executives are afraid the portal may become
the ``network television'' of the Internet by appealing to the
lowest common denominator. As a result, they are beginning to
question the value and the proper roles of content and services as
audience magnets. Some are also beginning to agree with early
critics who predicted that advertising would not be a viable
long-term business strategy for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are even stepping up early to narrow the grandiose
expectations that electronic commerce _ like portals, part of a
long lineage of solutions in search of a problem _ will finally
kick the Internet into the high-gear global money machine we keep
waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines were of inestimable value in the early days of
the Web because they were the only way to find anything on the
Internet. Everybody used them; virtually all were free and heavily
trafficked.
</P>
<P>
   The portal concept was born, says Chan Suh, the chief executive
of Agency.com, when ``America Online did this brilliant thing _
they got Internet access and content, but all the links led to
things inside AOL.'' Opening a door into America Online, instead of
onto the global network, created a huge, measurable audience for
advertisers in search of eyeballs and made America Online the most
valuable commercial real estate in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But Suh now asserts that portals have already seen their best
days.
</P>
<P>
   Like Suh, at least one portal executive believes that the
business is beginning to veer perilously close to the ways of a
dying medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear is becoming like TV networks, a commodity,''
George Bell, the chief executive of Excite Inc., said at a recent
industry conference. ``How do we avoid being seen as a commodity
distributor? How do we become more than a little bit of
everything?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're taking generic content and reorganizing it''
under Excite's brand, but that idea is certainly not proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it proving particularly valuable to users, said Linda
McCutcheon, president of Time Inc. New Media. ``We're describing
assets, not consumer benefits,'' Ms. McCutcheon said of most
portals' attitudes about content. ``It's like getting in your car
and saying, `Honey, it's a beautiful day. Let's drive through the
Lincoln Tunnel.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If questioning the value of content were not heretical enough,
some portal purveyors are also sure that advertising itself, as it
is practiced today, is on its way out as a significant revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising won't carry the freight, because there's no reason
it should,'' Bell said. ``The Web does something different. It
interacts, and interactivity begets data. We should focus on direct
marketing, driven by personalization and away from the retail
chain.''
</P>
<P>
   This may prove trickier for portals like Excite, which does not
own anything it can sell, than it has been for sites like Time
Inc.'s Pathfinder and Viacom's MTV Online. Through the eyes of
these companies, which sell their own products through their
portals, it is even clearer that traditional Web advertising may
have seen its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the audience is there, we will be able to monetize them,''
said Matt Farber, president of MTV Online, using one of today's
favored buzzwords for turning a customer relationship into cash.
``Advertising becomes E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Suh said, is that ``portals are dead.'' Search
engines and generic advertising and content, he said, are nearly
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a lot of people had in the beginning of the Web
revolution is finally starting to gel a little bit,'' he said.
``People are inventing their own content. On discussion boards,
stock chat areas, family picture and discussion sites _ they've
invented content in ways they couldn't have before, and that is
going to be the most important thing for portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Web is in fact not a mass medium, but a medium
for the masses, who are already well along in the process of making
it their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell, Diller and many others are already devising new
marketing stratagems to take advantage of this shift, it will be
fascinating to see who is willing to participate. Will people
inventing their own content welcome personalized marketing? Or will
most folks simply say, ``Monetize this''?

QUICK CUTS: THE NOVEL FOLLOWS FILM INTO A WORLD OF FEWER WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is an article in a series in which writers explore literary
themes. The series began on March 1 when John Updike, writing as
his character Henry Bech, considered the relationship between an
author and his alter ego.)

(DW) 
 By E.L. DOCTOROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The effect of a hundred years of filmmaking on the practice of
literature has been considerable.
</P>
<P>
   As more than one critic has noted, today's novelists tend not to
write exposition as fully as novelists of the 19th century. Where
the first chapter of Stendahl's ``Red and the Black'' (1830) is
given over to the leisurely description of a provincial French
town, its topographic features, the basis of its economy, the
person of its mayor, the mayor's mansion, the mansion's terraced
gardens and so on, Faulkner's ``Sanctuary'' (1931) begins this way:
``From beyond the screen of bushes which surrounded the spring,
Popeye watched the man drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century novel minimizes discourse that dwells on
settings, characters' CVs and the like. The writer finds it
preferable to incorporate all necessary information in the action,
to carry it along in the current of the narrative, as is done in
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are 19th-century works, Mark Twain's ``Tom
Sawyer,'' for example (`` `Tom?' No answer.''), that jump right
into things, and perhaps American writers always have been disposed
to move along at a snappier pace than their European counterparts.
But the minimal use of exposition does suppose a kind of filmic
compact between writer and reader, that everything will become
clear eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the rise of film art is coincident with the
tendency of novelists to conceive of compositions less symphonic
and more solo voiced, intimate personalist work expressive of the
operating consciousness. A case could be made that the novel's
steady retreat from realism is as much a result of film's expansive
record of the way the world looks as it is of the increasing
sophistications of literature itself.
</P>
<P>
   Another crossover effect has to do with film's major device, the
instantaneous reposition in space and time: the cut. Writers today
derive all sorts of effects from scanting the interstitial
explanations or transitions that get their story from one character
to another, or their characters from one place to another, or from
yesterday to next year. More daring uses of discontinuity have
occurred from violations of the grammatical protocols of person or
tense.
</P>
<P>
   But after a hundred years or so, it may be that movies can do
nothing more for, or to, literature than they already have done. By
now film has begun to affirm its essentially nonliterate nature and
to make of its conventions an art form detached and self-contained,
like painting.
</P>
<P>
   Movies began in silence. The early filmmakers learned to convey
meaning apart from the use of language. For the most part the title
cards of the silent films only nailed down the intelligence given
to the audience nonverbally. (Young couple on porch swing at night.
He removes a ring from his vest pocket. He gazes into her eyes.
Title card: ``Milly, will you be my wife?'')
</P>
<P>
   In the modern audible feature film, especially as made by
Hollywood, spoken dialogue tends more and more to function as the
old title cards of the silents. The genre of the film is indicated
with the portentous opening credits. The beginning shots site the
film and identify its time period. A given scene is lighted, and
the camera is positioned to create mood or inform the audience as
to how it is to regard what it is seeing, how serious or unserious
the story may be, how objectively we may regard the characters, how
intimately we are being asked to share their adventures.
</P>
<P>
   The film stock is color coordinated with its subject. The actors
are dressed, and their hair is cut or coiffed, to indicate age,
economic class, social status, education and even degree of virtue.
They're directed to demonstrate their characters' states of mind
with bodily attitudes, gestures, facial expressions and the
movements of their eyes. Given all this, the weight of the scene is
carried nonverbally. What is seen and felt is a signifying context
for any words actually spoken. In some of today's film dramas, 95
percent of a scene's meaning is conveyed before a word is uttered;
98 percent if you add music.
</P>
<P>
   Of course recent filmmakers _ Eric Rohmer, for example, or Louis
Malle _ have made highly verbal films. As a generalization, the
assemblage of visual effects that make of dialogue a capstone is
less true of comedy. The art of the television sitcom, for example,
is highly verbal. Its standing sets, and its inclination to
celebrate character, provide the impetus for wordplay, gags and
verbal economies that can verge on the aphoristic. On the other
hand the sitcom's mostly interior scenes and its limited scope for
camera setups suggest it is closer to a filmed stage play than it
is to movies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s and 40s, when stage plays and books were a major
source of film scripts, the talkies were talkier (as adaptations of
Shakespeare are still). Films of that period were, by comparison
with today's products, logorrheic. Even action films, the Bogart
film noir, the Errol Flynn swashbuckler, abounded with dialogue.
Now, after a century of development, the medium of film generates
its own culture. Its audience is as schooled in its rhythms and
motifs and habits of being as Wagnerians are in der Nibelungen.
Films work off previous films. They are genre referential and can
be more of what they are by nature.

 UNDATED: by nature.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Literary language extends experience in discourse. It flowers to
thought with nouns, verbs, objects. It thinks. That is why the term
``film language'' may be an oxymoron. Film de-literates thought; it
relies primarily on an association of visual impressions or
understandings. Moviegoing is an act of inference. You receive what
you see as a broad band of sensual effects that evoke your
intuitive nonverbal intelligence. You understand what you see
without having to think it through with words.
</P>
<P>
   What shall we make of this? Today, at the end of the century,
film is ubiquitous. There are more movies than ever. They are in
theaters, on television; they are cabled, videotaped, CD'd and
DVD'd. They are sent around the world by satellite transmission;
they are dubbed and translated and available from all their periods
for consumers to choose as books are chosen from the library. Their
enormous popularity reaches all classes and all levels of
education. Their primary producers are major entertainment
conglomerates that put lots of money into them and expect even more
money in return.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that great and important films will no longer be made.
But one can imagine a merger of film esthetics and profit-making
incentives that, apart from the efforts of this or that serious and
principled filmmaker, effects a culture of large, beautifully
dressed, tactically pigmented, stimulating and only incidentally
verbal movies that excite predetermined market tastes and offer
societal myths that slightly vary with each recycling: films
composed artfully from the palette of such basic elements as car
drive-ups, interiors, exteriors, faces, chases and explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant for the culture of the future may be the
declining production costs of computerized, digitally made movies.
It is not hard to understand the lure to the creative young when
making a film will be as feasible as writing a story.
</P>
<P>
   That pictograms, whether corporately or privately produced, may
eventually unseat linguistic composition as the major communicative
act of our culture is a prospect I find only slightly less dire
than global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most thoughtful if not ingenious criticism written
today is written by critics of film who, often as not, address
themselves to work that is hardly worth their attention. The most
meretricious or foolish movie will elicit a cogent analysis. Why?
It may be a film's auspices that obligate the critics. But it may
be that, however unconsciously, they mean to reaffirm or defend
print culture by subjecting the nonliterate filmgoing experience,
good or bad, to the extensions of syntactical thought.

KUBRICK AND BEETHOVEN, A MARRIAGE MADE IN HELL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As appreciations of the director Stanley Kubrick continue after
his death, with paeans to his icy brilliance and his meticulous
artistry, one of his major characters is being neglected, and I
don't mean Dr. Strangelove or or Lolita. I mean music.
</P>
<P>
   For Kubrick music is not just background. It has all the
lineaments of a very complex and literal character, playing a
particular role, affecting the films' other characters, altering
our perceptions. The music's fate, particularly in ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' reveals much about the peculiar nature of Kubrick's moral
and political universe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, what happens to Alex, the sadistic thug
in ``Clockwork,'' when he is being reconditioned by the government.
Alex is brought into a movie theater and is forced to watch films
of grotesque violence. He can't turn away from the gushing blood
and brutal beatings. He is physically prevented from blinking or
closing his eyes. Instead of experiencing the thrill of ecstasy
such images once brought him, they become associated with nausea
and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, we are meant to think. We know exactly how he feels
strapped in that chair, for we have just gone through the same
experiment. During the first half-hour of the film , as Alex and
his friends stomp and kick and rape for the sheer pleasure of it,
there are few viewers who do not want to turn away in disgust and
fury and either return the videotape or exit the theater.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other way in which we end up feeling some empathy
for this monstrous being strapped in a straitjacket. The films used
to brainwash Alex are accompanied by background music from
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Alex's favorite composition. By the
time the conditioning is over, not only does the thought of
violence churn his stomach, so does the sound of that music.
</P>
<P>
   But Kubrick has done audiences the same favor earlier in the
film. Some of the musical allusions are just jokes: the doorbell of
Alex's victims chimes out the theme from Beethoven's Fifth. The
association of Beethoven with violence is unrelenting. The Ninth
Symphony, traditionally considered an ecstatic celebration of
transcendent brotherhood, is inextricably knit by Kubrick into the
way we experience Alex's imaginings of sadistic rape and massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``O, bliss, bliss and heaven,'' he thinks as he listens, ``I
never knew such lovely pictures.'' Rossini's effervescent overture
to ``La Gazza Ladra'' (``The Thieving Magpie'') becomes the
balletic score for a vicious gang rape and rumble inside an
abandoned theater.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Kubrick's legacies is the way he sullied certain
compositions by completely inverting their familiar associations.
So much so perhaps that there may be music lovers who never escape
the director's reconditioning, any more than listeners of a certain
age can avoid thinking of the monolith in ``2001'' when hearing
Richard Strauss' ``Also Sprach Zarathustra'' or of a gracefully
turning space station when hearing the ``Blue Danube'' waltz.
</P>
<P>
   The music in ``A Clockwork Orange,'' as in some of Kubrick's
other films, is not incidental to the work but is at its center. By
the middle of the film, as Alex's horrific acts fade into memory
and it becomes ever more clear how venal, shallow and creepy many
of his victims and persecutors are, we are meant to begin to feel
some sympathy for him.
</P>
<P>
   We object to the psychologists' forced associations of Beethoven
with violence and nausea. Our old love for the music as noble and
transcendent is meant to kick in. Alex becomes a state-programmed
victim, at sea in a world without music's comforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alex's earlier association of Beethoven with violence and
rape, Kubrick seems to suggest, is partly a product of a world
where beauty is violated: sexual graffiti mark up a classical
mural; an opera house stripped of seats is the scene for a gang
rape.
</P>
<P>
   So music is a wronged innocent. Surrounding Alex is a world of
vulgarity. His parents have velvet kitsch on the walls. One of his
victims has her walls covered with erotic kitsch; a writer and his
wife decorate their home as if it were a rejected stage set from
``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alex loves higher things, even keeping a bust of Beethoven
in his prison cell. Alex is an enlightened victim in a heartless
world, and his sins reflect that world, although his tastes show a
greater authenticity and promise.
</P>
<P>
   This vision of Alex as ``authentic'' is ugly as well as
sentimental. But Kubrick wants to go even further. He seems to
suggest not just that Alex's dystopian society has corrupted
beauty, but that there is something latent in the classical
tradition that has caused the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Alex, as well as his tormentors, have it right in their
associations between the classical world and violence. Beauty has
nothing to do with morality. Opera houses may not stage such
gruesome rapes as Alex and his pals perform, but they are home to
dramas that reek with inhumanity. (Even Rossini, in ``La Gazza
Ladra,'' puts his characters through extensive traumas for the sake
of a joke about a bird that steals silverware.)
</P>
<P>
   Great art holds the seeds of great horror. Alex is finding in
Beethoven what other listeners have found, for example, in
associating Wagner with Nazism. Some of these ideas have even been
raised in recent years by musicologists who seek to determine the
political meanings of music. (One musicologist has even associated
a Beethoven symphony with images of rape.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the soldiers in ``Full Metal Jacket'' wears a peace
symbol along with a helmet proclaiming ``Born to Kill.'' When asked
why, he replies: ``I think I was trying to suggest something about
the duality of man, the Jungian thing, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick also wants it both ways in many of his films, admiring
the ideals of classical art (even in his filmmaking) while
condemning them, scorning unholy violence while suggesting that its
origins and ultimate responsibility lie elsewhere, demanding that
human beings be judged as moral animals but not finding them free
enough to ever make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Alex's forced programming, which links music
with nausea, is undone in the movie, allowing him to enjoy freely
his earlier associations. But Kubrick never releases his audience.
One departs unsettled, hung over with hints of nihilism.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, almost without fail, David Wetherell played
poker with friends on the first Thursday night of each month. Two
years ago, as his Internet investments started taking more of his
time, he had to give up poker. But the 44-year-old chairman and
chief executive of the investment firm CMGI Inc. is holding his
cards close to his vest once again _ this time in a gamble that
could become the first hostile takeover battle in the short history
of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of moves meant to disrupt the pending merger of the
Web ``portal'' Lycos Inc. with the Internet holdings of Barry
Diller's television company, USA Networks Inc., Wetherell resigned
from the Lycos board last week. He then promptly hired Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter to seek other buyers for Lycos, in which
Wetherell's firm holds 18.5 percent, the largest single stake.
Potential acquirers might include CMGI itself, which has invested
in scores of Web start-ups over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties may have contributed to a selloff of both
companies' stocks on Friday _ along with investor disappointment
that CMGI did not announce a hoped-for stock split when it reported
second-quarter earnings late Thursday. In a stampede of apparent
profit taking, CMGI's shares fell $18.125, to close at $164 in
Nasdaq trading, while Lycos shares fell $10.375, to close at
$98.625.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is over a company that Wetherell himself founded. In
1994 Lycos was a noncommercial Web directory _ a site for
conducting searches _ based on software developed at
Carnegie-Mellon University. Through CMGI, Wetherell bought the
technology for $2 million and hired a former Wang Laboratories
salesman, Robert Davis, as the first employee of Lycos Inc., which
is now based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who soon became the chief executive, took the company
public in April 1996. At that point, Wetherell got out of the way
and watched Lycos mushroom into a company with a share price of
$127.25 and a market value of nearly $6 billion, just before the
USA Networks deal was announced on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, when Davis and Diller announced their plan to
merge Lycos with the Internet operations of USA Networks, it
completed an ideal cycle for a venture capitalist like Wetherell _
from start-up, to successful public stock offering, to a merger
with a potentially complementary media-company partner. The
agreement, a complex stock swap, valued Lycos at $6.6 billion. That
meant CMGI's initial modest investment was now worth about $1.2
billion. And at first, Wetherell said he supported the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But when investors turned cold on the complex terms, which
seemed to many to favor Diller, the Lycos stock price plunged more
than 31 percent in two days, to $87.25. That reduced the company's
market value to $4.42 billion. Wetherell began wavering, soon
called for a renegotiation of the merger pact, and, then, last
week, took more drastic steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its present construct, I am opposed to the deal,''
Wetherell said in an interview last Thursday. ``As far as I know,
in the history of acquisitions, no stock of an acquired company has
gone down by that much so soon. And the more I've analyzed the
deal, the more I've found difficulties with pieces of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that a number of options are open to him, including
CMGI's trying to trump the USA offer by coming up with a counterbid
to buy back the rest of Lycos, perhaps with the assistance of a
giant media or technology partner. ``We're taking a fresh
approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Lycos is now in play. And if Wetherell resumes
control of it, he does not rule out significant changes in
management and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock market value of Lycos now down to $4.2 billion, a
CMGI takeover is certainly more affordable than it would have been
in early February. Yet, by the same measure, the value of the
original deal _ even after the initial two-day stock slump _ now
looks a lot better than it did at the time. But people who know
Wetherell say the motives here may not be purely financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking at the numbers, but it's also about the
people,'' said Margaret Heffernan, chief executive of Zinezone.com,
an online lifestyle magazine in which CMGI is the majority owner.
Ms. Heffernan and others who know Davis and Wetherell say they have
watched the relationship deteriorate over time.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to comment last week, but the company issued a
statement saying that ``Bob Davis and Lycos remain committed to the
transaction with USA Networks.'' As for the CMGI chairman's
resignation from the board, the statement said, Davis and Lycos
``appreciate David Wetherell's contribution to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Davis struck an agreement with Diller, it was widely
discussed that some sort of major Lycos deal was imminent _ rumors
that were swapped on bulletin boards on most of the major online
investment sites. Driven by such speculation, the already
stratospheric stock of Lycos doubled again in a matter of weeks in
early 1999, soaring as high as $145. As a result, by the time Lycos
and USA Networks announced their deal, an already sizable takeover
premium was built into the price _ bolstering Diller's reluctance
to offer a big premium in the merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Wetherell insists that price is not the only issue. He said
it was a mistake for Davis to concede majority voting rights in the
combined company to Diller's company, and he no longer thinks that
USA Networks is the right partner strategically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Disney's model with the Go network,'' Wetherell
said, referring to Walt Disney Co.'s new Web service, which Diller
and Davis have cited as a competitive factor in their wanting USA
Networks to team up with Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC News can drive traffic to ABC.com, and ESPN can drive
traffic to ESPN.com,'' Wetherell continued. ``But USA doesn't have
the same reach. How much traffic can USA Networks drive to Lycos?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diller, to the extent that he has been willing to address
Wetherell's moves in recent interviews and speeches, has tended to
dismiss them as maneuvers motivated more by stock valuations than
by long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   So who is David Wetherell, this executive whose name until
recently was little heard outside the Internet investment world but
who is now taking on one of the media industry's best-known
entrepreneurs?
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell grew up in Connecticut and Florida, before attending
Ohio Wesleyan University, where he majored in mathematics. By his
own account, he has a ``facility with numbers.'' And colleagues are
often awestruck by his ability to work complex financial models in
his head during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Wetherell was an obscure software industry executive
when he engineered a leveraged buyout of a 20-year-old company
called College Marketing Group, which rented out mailing lists of
college professors. He took the company public as CMG Information
Services Inc. in 1994, by which time it was throwing off enough
profit to finance other investments. These included Lycos, as well
as a little company called Booklink that Wetherell scooped up for
$900,000 and sold 10 months later to America Online for about $70
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We then had more money than we knew what to do with,''
Wetherell recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He soon had inquiries from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.,
which each bought 4.9 percent stakes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, CMG Information Services (which changed its name to CMGI
last December) was an active investment company, setting up At
Ventures, the investment arm of CMGI that attracted hundreds of
millions of dollars in fresh venture capital and led to big hits _
like CMGI's approximately $6 million investment in Geocities, a
popular online community Web site that is in the process of being
sold to Yahoo, netting CMGI a profit of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is now in the process of selling one of its operating
companies, CMG Direct, for $24 million to a New York marketing firm
called SMGI. At that point, CMGI will more closely resemble a pure
investment company _ a characteristic that could prompt the
Securities and Exchange Commission to consider reclassifying CMGI
as a mutual fund concern. That change would have a significant
impact on its financial reporting requirements and potentially
negative tax consequences for its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to avoid that,'' Wetherell said. The company has
until October to tell the SEC how it plans to clear up the
ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's stock, which was trading around $8 a share in January
1998, has been on an Internet surge in the last 15 months. Last
Monday alone, it rose $47.50, to close at nearly $200 before giving
up most of those gains as the week's events unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell said he expected to invest in two new Internet
companies every month and bring perhaps two dozen or more of his
investments public within a couple of years. Among the attributes
he looks for when choosing among the thousands of Internet business
plans he reviews each year is whether a company would have
``synergy'' with the rest of the CMGI portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, this synergy is extremely hard to achieve.
Wetherell contends that he runs his portfolio of start-up firms
somewhat like a Japanese keiretsu, an amalgamation of firms with
interlocking investments and business relationships that help each
other in the marketplace. But there have been many instances of
friction and outright rebellion among CMGI's offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build companies this way, you have to hire
entrepreneurial people,'' Ms. Heffernan said. ``It's the nature of
the model that companies are going to want to break away.''
</P>
<P>
   This appears to be exactly what happened with Lycos. In an
attempt to control his own destiny, Davis of Lycos held
negotiations with many giant media companies in the months leading
up to the USA Networks deal. Davis was ``flying solo on this,''
Wetherell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Lycos showdown may come down to the cards that
Wetherell is holding in his hand. Many Wall Street analysts predict
that if Diller responds by renegotiating the terms, then Wetherell
will turn back to supporting the merger. By that reckoning,
Wetherell's sharp criticism and his hiring of an investment banking
firm are part of a bluffing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Diller has said that he will not budge.
</P>
<P>
   But as any experienced poker player knows, the most difficult
bluff to call is one from a player with a winning streak and a
hoard of cash. And Wetherell has both.

<P>
   It says everything about John Laroquette's new sitcom that he
plays a cranky innkeeper whose last name is Payne and whose first
name is, no kidding, Royal. Outside the hotel is a sign that reads:
``Whispering Pines _ a Payne Inn,'' and though that line virtually
dares critics to trash the show with more bad puns, why descend to
its level?
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to say that this remake of John Cleese's hilarious,
farcical ``Fawlty Towers'' has been given a hackneyed Hollywood
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whispering Pines'' might as well have been called ``Cliche
Central.'' Playing Royal's flamboyant yet commonsensical wife,
Connie, Jobeth Williams is given orange-red hair and costumes that
are heavy on leopard prints.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's premiere we discover that Royal is cheap.
Having forgotten their anniversary he gives Connie a diamond brooch
that turned up in the lost-and-found, only to have the pin's owner
return in search of it. There is an average of one laugh in each
episode. Monday night's laugh comes after the pin is accidentally
tossed into a pot in the kitchen. Royal swoops through the dining
room, hovering over his guests and surreptitiously searching for
the brooch on their full dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   Laroquette shows some flair in that scene, but usually he's
reduced to delivering hideous lines, describing Connie as ``an
emotional kidney stone.'' When the show lands in its regular time
slot with a new episode on Wednesday, Connie and Royal flirt with
other people, though in the end the Paynes realize they are made
for each other. Viewers also may think these dull-witted characters
deserve each other.
</P>
<P>
   With his ability to make craven characters likable, Laroquette
certainly deserves better material. With the exception of his
stunning guest turn as a genial sociopathic killer on ``The
Practice'' last year, he has built a career on being better than
his shows, including ``Night Court'' and ``The John Laroquette
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between ``Payne'' and ``Fawlty Towers,'' of
course, is Cleese, whose Basil Fawlty was a sly combination of
physical comedy and bone-dry wit. Basil's crankiness was
window-dressing, while Royal's is the very premise of the show. It
doesn't take a comparison with ``Fawlty Towers'' to make ``Payne''
look bad, though; the new show does that all on its own.

   FROZEN-FISH (Conneaut, Ohio) _ Jim Anthony himself is not
exactly sure why he kept a a blue pike in his freezer for 37 years,
but now, nearly four decades later, the fish has become the central
clue in a compelling scientific detective story, sleuthing that
some scientists are hoping will lead to an extraordinary result:
the return of an extinct species. By Pam Belluck. With art.

<P>
   NY-TWO-SLAYINGS (New York) _ They did not know each other, but
Amy Watkins and Marvin Watson were both young archetypes of the New
York newcomer. She was the Midwest idealist come to the big city,
he was the striver from Jamaica. Both were stabbed to death in
Brooklyn this year, and while Ms. Watkins's death has attracted
national attention, Watson died anonymously. Yet if both killings
were treated differently, they each touch on fears held deeply by
many New Yorkers, even as crime has fallen in the city. By Jim
Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-COMPUTER-INJURY (Undated) _ There is widespread concern
among physicians, physical therapists and ergonomists that a tide
of injury is inevitable as youngsters spend more time on computers,
both at school and at home. By Jane Gross. With art.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-FED-DEATH (New York) _ When Tabitha Walrond, a
19-year-old welfare recipient, gave birth to her first child, she
did what new mothers rich and poor are urged to do these days: She
breast-fed her baby. But her two-month-old son died in her arms of
malnutrition. And Ms. Walrond is now charged with recklessly
causing the death by failing to nourish her son adequately and by
failing to obtain prompt medical attention when his condition
became dire. The case is extremely unusual because while some
nursing mothers have problems producing enough breast-milk, it is
rare for a baby to die as a result, and rarer still for the mother
to then be prosecuted. By Nina Bernstein.

<P>
   NY-PARADE-GAYS (New York) _ The first St. Patrick's Day parade
in the Bronx in 70 years has, in the last few days, become
embroiled in the same political turmoil over gay marchers that has
troubled the St. Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan since 1991. By

   FLEET-BANKBOSTON (Undated) _ Fleet Financial Group plans to

By Timothy L. O'Brien.

   PAPERBACKS-MEDIA (New York) _ Since 1995, the number of
mass-market paperbacks sold in the United States has declined by
almost 9 percent, falling to 484 million copies last year, about
three times the percentage loss in consumer books overall. And the
immediate future offers little comfort; the book industry's
research arm, the Book Industry Study Group, is projecting
continued slight annual declines for the paperback market over the
next several years. By Doreen Carvajal.

`A MOM'S LIFE': MOTHER'S WORK IS NEVER DONE, NEVER DONE ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She begins her day in a chenille bathrobe and envies
her husband the luxury of taking an uninterrupted shower. Her day
is an endless medley of dressing children, undressing them, taking
one to school, picking him up, mediating their arguments, sprinting
when they try to run into the street and generally responding to
the call ``Mommy!''
</P>
<P>
   Her sons, Isaac and Gideon, are 7 and 3, and Isaac already
enjoys telling her all the things she's doing wrong as a mother.
(``You are such a breaker of promises.'') Just when she thinks she
might escape for a grown-up lunch with a friend because her husband
has volunteered to take the boys to the park, Daddy has ``one of
those unexpected meeting days,'' as Mom explains, and all is lost.
</P>
<P>
   In Kathryn Grody's satisfying one-act, one-woman show, ``A Mom's
Life,'' it adds a little celebrity zip to know that the work is
autobiographical and Daddy is Mandy Patinkin. But having a famous
actor-singer husband apparently does not excuse her from the trials
of the average Upper West Side parent. Ms. Grody captures the
never-ending, energy-sapping, sleep-depriving, brain-snatching,
no-coffee-breaks-ever experience that modern motherhood seems to
be. She does great impersonations of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grody wrote and first performed ``A Mom's Life'' in 1990, so
her sons are now 16 and 12, but her memories of their early
childhoods are vivid. She is funniest and most endearing when she's
right on the edge, which is often.
</P>
<P>
   When she suggests that if a child says ``It was a accident'' one
more time, she may snap. When she asks her husband, on the phone,
between gritted teeth, ``Did you ever read that book `Wife Kills
Self and Kids'?'' When she reads the bedtime story in record time,
without taking a breath. There may not be any new insights into the
human condition here, but sympathetic audiences probably won't
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Mom's Life,'' expertly directed by Jack Hofsiss, is at the
Arclight Theater on Sundays and Mondays only. I wonder if Ms. Grody
thinks of those as her days off.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT IRWIN, Calif. _ Out in the rough ochre hills of
California's high desert, Staff Sgt. Joseph W. Burris of the 4th
Infantry Division clambered from his M1-A1 tank, dusty and tired,
and explained how the enemy had knocked him out of the day's
wargame.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the enormous tank battle that helped rout the
Iraqis in 1991, Burris said the Army had nearly replicated the
experience of actual battle here at the National Training Center _
from the ``minefield'' he dodged earlier in the day to the two
``shells'' he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty close to the real thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But is it the right thing? Here at Fort Irwin, where the
nation's combat brigades prepare to fight the next war, the Army is
still, by and large, training them to fight the last one.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the end of the Cold War and eight years after the
heady triumph of Desert Storm, the units that come to this
sprawling desert base take on an opposing force designed to look
like some Warsaw Pact behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   It is an enemy no one expects them to face, in terrain no one
expects them to encounter, with tactics no one is certain will
prevail in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to fight us like that anymore,'' said Gen.
John N. Abrams, commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine
Command, referring to Iraq's attempt to confront the American-led
coalition with Soviet-era methods and weapons. ``They all watched
CNN. They know what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing that reality, the Army is now moving to change the way it
organizes its units and trains them to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Army announced plans to create a ``strike
force,'' able to move more quickly than the Army's heavy armored
divisions, but still carry significant punch. The Army is also
devising new technologies, relying on satellites and computers to
give soldiers an advantage in battle. That, the Army says, will
help it adapt to 21st-century warfare, which is far more likely to
involve missile threats and guerrilla tactics than set-piece tank
battles.
</P>
<P>
   But military experts and reform-minded critics, some within the
Army itself, say the service has moved far too slowly to transform
a force that, although smaller, looks much as it did when the
United States prepared to slug it out with the Soviet Union on the
plains of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer is: No, the Army is not doing what it needs
to do,'' said Rep. William M. Thornberry, R-Texas, who sits on the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Nor are the other services.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he and others argue, is that bureaucracy, tradition
and history have bound the Army to the status quo. ``After all, we
won the Cold War,'' Thornberry said. ``There is not the incentive
to change as there would be if they had lost the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously doubts the U.S. Army is still the
best-equipped, best-trained force in the world today. As it
approaches the turn of the century, however, it is seen as the
armed service having the most difficult time making the transition
from the Cold War to this new, ill-defined and unpredictable era.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the difficulties are inherent to the Army. It is the
largest of the four major services and, at a time when most
American military action occurs in faraway places, the least
mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the Army has shrunk by 40 percent _ from
780,000 soldiers to roughly 470,000 today. It once had 18
divisions; it now has 10, six ``heavy'' armored divisions and four
``light'' infantry or airborne divisions. At the same time, the
Army is as busy as it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States was able to pull back in Europe in the
1990s, the Army still needs 30,000 soldiers in South Korea to repel
any invasion from the north. The Army is also relied upon more and
more to carry out peacekeeping and other missions _ from Somalia to
Haiti, Bosnia to hurricane relief in Central America _ that the
other services are less equipped to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army is having a nervous breakdown,'' said Stephen Peter
Rosen, a professor of government at Harvard University and a former
official at the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment. ``It's being
asked to fight a lot of little wars and to prepare itself to fight
the next big war.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of finding a balance falls to officers like
Abrams, whose headquarters at Fort Monroe, Va., oversees all of the
Army's training and warfighting experiments, including the effort
to create what the service calls the Army After Next.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, son of another four-star commander, Gen. Creighton W.
Abrams, the former Army Chief of Staff, said the Army recognized
the need to adapt. he said it had already begun to incorporate the
hard realities of the post-Cold War era, including lessons learned
in missions like the disastrous assault in Somalia in October 1993,
which left 18 Americans dead.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, more needed to be done in devising new tactics
and highly technical weapons, some of them still just figments in
industry's imagination, like a new generation of ``light tanks''
more powerful, but smaller than the current Abrams tanks (named, as
it happens, after his father).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just apply new world variables to a Warsaw-based
doctrine,'' Abrams said. ``In my mind, that is not enough for us to
keep our edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the heaviest brigades, he added, now had to prepare for
``asymmetric threats,'' like missile strikes, that are more likely
than ever before to succeed in combat. ``The Iranians, the Iraqis,
the North Koreans _ all of them are making adjustments,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here at Fort Irwin's training grounds, spread over more than
600,000 acres not far from Barstow, the Army has begun to make its
own adjustments. Trainers devising war games now stage terrorist
bombings at base camps and place hostages in the middle of the
battlefield. Commanders encounter civilian protesters and even
hostile journalists in the heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with senior officers during a visit here, Abrams said
the base needed to build an urban center to fight in _ not a
cut-out town in the open desert, but a ``city'' in one of the
craggy canyons that rend the terrain here. His idea of the most
likely enemy the Army will face is ``a hostile force using a human
shield in an urban area that is a sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you defeat our technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. John D. Rosenberger, commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry
Regiment, which serves as the opposing force at Fort Irwin, said
his ``op for'' was already shifting its tactics from the strict
``mass and momentum'' style of the Soviets. Now his forces wield an
array of ``capabilities'' soldiers can expect to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more unpredictable than we've ever been,'' Rosenberger
said, standing atop a hill overlooking the day's battle, which his
side, with 11 tanks, easily won against a much larger force of 84
tanks from the 4th Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts believe the Army is moving too slowly,
clinging to old ways. They point to last year's redesign of the
Army's heavy divisions, which trimmed the number of troops and
armored vehicles, but otherwise left the structure intact. To
critics, the new name said it all: the Conservative Heavy Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake, Napoleon created divisions,'' said John
Hillen, a former Army captain and now a senior fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, who supports radically
restructuring divisions into smaller more mobile units.
</P>
<P>
   Like other critics, Hillen says the Army has also skewed its
budgetary priorities, planning billions for a new helicopter for
attacking tanks, the Comanche, and a mobile cannon, the Crusader,
rather than devoting more resources to lighter weapons better
suited for the new kind of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' he said, ``the Army is going to change very
little over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams defended the Army's approach, saying there was ``a
reformation'' underway, but a deliberate one. ``The deliberate
approach is what keeps us on solid footing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' he added, ``an institution that's conservative by
nature.''

   NEW YORK _ At Vanity Fair's Oscar party in West Hollywood last
year, Morton's restaurant became so choked with people _ balding
billionaires, actresses with plunging necklines and
silicone-enhanced poitrines, studio heads and their entourages,
gawking advertisers trying to look nonchalant and the ephemeral
characters who circumnavigate Hollywood society _ that at midnight
the Los Angeles fire marshalls stormed in and took action.
</P>
<P>
   The marshalls commandeered the guest list and became the de
facto bouncers for the rest of the evening, pushing back the
hundreds of spectators packing the sidewalks of Melrose Boulevard,
moving the 200 members of the press clustered hungrily outside on
the driveway, and allowing guests like Matt Damon and Minnie Driver
into the party _ one by one, like regular folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a crush at the door,'' Graydon Carter, the
magazine's editor, said a year later. ``It did get a bit `Day of
the Locusts' out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it simply a sweaty celebrity scrum, but Vanity Fair's Oscar
party _ held for the last six years on the night of the awards at
Morton's _ embodies the magazine's happy symbiosis with Hollywood.
It is a relationship so strong that not only does Carter celebrate
Hollywood, but the day before the Oscars, Barry Diller _ the
chairman of USA Networks and one of Hollywood's premier movers and
shakers _ celebrates Carter, by hosting a lunch for him on the
beach at his estate in Malibu. (If it rains, the invitation
specifies, the lunch will be held at Diller's Beverly Hills house.)
Regular guests include the billionaire media kingpins Ronald
Perelman and Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive of Seagram Co.,
which owns Universal Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The adoring back-scratching fest is a perfect metaphor for the
three-way love affair between Vanity Fair, the movie industry and
advertisers. Everyone benefits. Fledgling stars get free publicity
by appearing on the cover; readers, in turn, are drawn to the
magazine, thinking that they are witnessing the birth of the next
big Hollywood supernova. (And who could resist when the woman in
question is swathed in little more than gauze or a skimpy strip of
fur?) Advertisers share space with glossy movie stars; by
association, the stars receive the affirmation of some of the
country's wealthiest advertisers. To top it off, more than two
dozen Vanity Fair articles have been optioned by Hollywood in the
last few years, most of which have been or are being made into
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Carter took the reins at Vanity Fair from Tina Brown in 1992,
and the following year filled the social vacuum left on Oscar night
by the death of the legendary agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to take over, and I figured it might as well be
us,'' he said in an interview in his office, two weeks before
departing for Los Angeles with the 25 Vanity Fair factotums who put
the finishing details on the evening. (Lazar's decades-long
tradition of hosting Oscar-night parties at Spago died with him.
And Carter said that in at least one departure from Lazar's style,
he does not go around screaming at people to stay in their seats.)
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan International is taking advantage of Vanity Fair's
glamour-soaked image this month. The company has produced a
128-page stand-alone insert, shrink-wrapped with the magazine's
annual Hollywood issue. Originally timed to coincide with the
opening of the Donna Karan flagship store in Manhattan, the booklet
is one of the largest single advertisements ever to appear
associated with a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Fox, Vanity Fair's publisher, said that the profit
margin is slim on such a mammoth stand-alone insert but that the
magazine benefits ``when a prestigious company like Donna Karan
chooses us to convey its largest single communication ever,'' he
said. Donna Karan, chairman of Donna Karan International, said she
would not have produced the ad _ which cost her company more than
$1 million _ if Vanity Fair had not been interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there was no choice but Vanity Fair, which reaches a
huge audience of men and women,'' she said. ``And the Hollywood
issue is a particularly powerful issue. The magazine stands for
everything the clothes are about: personality, eclecticism,
glamour, timelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Timelessness? Glamour? Carter has come a long way since the
shirtsleeve days when the transplanted Canadian edited Spy
magazine, the satiric and sometimes cruel monthly he founded with
Kurt Andersen in 1986 and edited until 1991. When Spy was at its
peak in the late 1980s, it made fun of people who used words like
``glamour'' and ``timelessness'' with any gravity: Frequent targets
included Donald Trump, the gossip columnist Liz Smith, and S.I.
Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, which owns
Vanity Fair's publisher, Conde Nast Publications. Now Carter
lunches with Trump. He enjoys a close friendship with Ms. Smith.
And Newhouse _ who was once portrayed in a cartoon in Spy
blindfolded, holding a fistful of darts, standing before a
dartboard littered with the names of Conde Nast editors _ is now
Carter's boss.
</P>
<P>
   Carter thinks of Vanity Fair and Spy as kindred spirits, and now
says that ``Vanity Fair is Spy, with money.'' And the Spy days are
clearly water under the bridge for Newhouse, who is said to spare
no expense when it comes to the magazine, the success of which has
conferred a ducal status upon Carter in the ranks of Conde Nast
editors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Carter and the Vanity Fair staff photographer Annie
Leibovitz recently renegotiated her salary. When Carter reported to
Newhouse that he was hesitating over the small matter of an extra
$250,000 for a five-year contract, Newhouse reportedly told Carter
not to ``nickel and dime'' Ms. Leibovitz. Vanity Fair writers are
also well paid; Carter would not confirm the salaries of some of
his higher-paid writers, but he said they exceeded $400,000, and
wriggled his eyebrows dramatically to emphasize the fact that no
Vanity Fair writer was getting, well, nickel and dimed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's success is not based on its Hollywood coverage
alone; it does depart from the Hollywood air-kiss formula.
Sebastian Junger, author of ``The Perfect Storm,'' spent a month in
Kosovo and wrote an article about the conflict there in the July
1998 issue. A profile of Terry Lenzner, the Washington private
investigator who has worked for President Clinton, appeared in the
same issue as an essay on the origins of Billie Holiday's song
about lynching, ``Strange Fruit.'' James Wolcott delivers the kind
of soul-withering criticism that sends novelists screaming into
other careers.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade when hype and infamy seem to sell magazines better
than sweepstakes promotions or centerfold pinups, Vanity Fair has
managed to attract the kind of press attention that sells covers,
warms advertisers and cultivates what can best be described as a
kind of palatable notoriety. When the magazine showcased Monica
Lewinsky in a series of lush photographs by Herb Ritts in its July
1998 issue, for example, few people criticized Vanity Fair for its
lack of decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the network news anchors who led their broadcasts with
the story, cable-television pundits and newspaper editorial
cartoonists blamed Ms. Lewinsky and her lawyer for their
questionable taste. (And Carter's discretion was praised for his
decision to put Ronald and Nancy Reagan on the cover instead of Ms.
Lewinsky.)
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love that Teflon reputation, which adds sizzle
without harmful controversy. The magazine's relationship with
advertisers is close. Last year, Vanity Fair hosted promotional
parties for Nautica Enterprises and the Gap's Banana Republic
chain, then displayed pictures of grinning marketing executives at
the front of the magazine similar to the magazine's regular party
pages.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Vanity Fair ran an article by an anonymous author
praising the Gulfstream V jet; a few pages away, Gulfstream
Aerospace Corp. ran an ad showing Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft
Corp.'s chief technology officer, posing with a Gulfstream. And
when it turned out, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, that
Myhrvold was the author of the article extolling the virtues of the
jet, a magazine spokeswoman defended what looked like shameless
back-scratching as coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream is a new advertiser with the magazine, as are
companies as varied as the crystal maker Baccarat and Kinko's, the
chain of copy shops. More than 100 new advertisers flocked to
Vanity Fair last year; the magazine packed in 1,882 ad pages in
1998. Ad pages and revenue have increased steadily since 1994 and
revenue topped $109 million in 1998, according to Publishers
Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Total paid circulation was down _ by less than 2 percent _ for
the second half of 1998, at 1.08 million. But the minor circulation
decline does not seem to have affected advertisers, who covet the
reader demographic: The median age of the Vanity Fair reader is 37,
the average household income is $58,000, and 70 percent are
college-educated, according to Mediamark Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the near-middle-age median, Carter is focusing more and
more on downy young movie stars. Vanity Fair's covers are now seen
as a first critical step toward stardom, rather than a juicy reward
at a career peak. Leslee Dart, a co-owner of PMK, a public
relations firm that represents dozens of movie stars, calls the
Vanity Fair cover ``the brass ring on the Hollywood
merry-go-round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it can also backfire,'' she said. ``I think it is all
about timing. If you don't have the product that shows your
client's talent and prominence, then they shouldn't be on the
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is proud of the fact that few of the subjects on the
April Hollywood cover are recognizable to a non-Hollywood person.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start getting old when they stop going to movies,'' he
said. ``Movies synthesize the Zeitgeist in a way that newspapers
can't, and that magazines try to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these young kids,'' he said, pointing to his April
cover. ``They change the culture. When you get over the age of 35,
you don't want the culture to change, you want it to stay exactly
the way it was when you were, say, 33. But if you do that, you get
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wiatt, the co-chairman of International Creative Management,
the talent agency in Los Angeles, said movie stars were pleased to
be blessed by the advertising community, which plays an
increasingly important role in the film industry. ``They are the
most sought-after covers for a young star,'' he said. ``And Vanity
Fair gives them validation from a couple of worlds. They have been
anointed by publishing, by the magazine and by definition by
advertisers, too. That can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vanity Fair's lust for celebrity and scandal seems to have
exhausted another city where the magazine hosts an
attention-getting party: Washington. For the last five years, the
magazine has hosted a party after the White House Correspondent's
Dinner, a black-tie affair held in late spring by the White House
Correspondents Association, to which the president is invited.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Powell, the current president of the association, said
Vanity Fair was partly responsible for a ``celebrity-zation'' of
the dinner that he does not encourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern in the ranks of the correspondents that the
Vanity Fair party gets a lot of coverage, and we don't know that
it's the kind of coverage that underscores the purpose of our
effort, or that Washington needs right now,'' he said. And what if
Ms. Lewinsky _ who has said she will attend this year's Vanity Fair
Oscar party _ is a dinner guest, courtesy of Vanity Fair, this
year?
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on the good judgment of our colleagues to select
guests who would be comfortable at a dinner where the agenda is
really to honor the president,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hitchens, the magazine's flamboyant political
columnist, at whose apartment the party was held the first two
years, sniffed at the criticism: ``That dinner was in danger of
dying on its feet,'' he said. ``It was dismalness defined, mediocre
in every way possible. You'd find yourself at the end of the
evening standing in a light rain wondering why you had bothered to
rent a tuxedo. If anything, we saved it.''

THE VIENNA PHILHARMONIC RETURNS, STILL VIRTUALLY A MALE BASTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As usual there were sold-out houses at Carnegie Hall
for the series of three concerts by the Vienna Philharmonic, under
the conductor Riccardo Muti, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. As
usual the playing of this esteemed orchestra, with its
distinctively warm sound and its palpable connection to a renowned
musical heritage, was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a privilege to hear the performances of symphonies by
Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Tchaikovsky over three nights.
Thursday night's account of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony was
extraordinary, perhaps because the music is the least closely
associated with the orchestra and consequently was the most
unusual. The way the Vienna Philharmonic's mellifluous violins and
plaintive woodwinds caressed the music's spare, grieving melodic
lines made this elusive work seem newly powerful: Shostakovich
takes us to deep, painful places here, but the Vienna Philharmonic
was there to hold our hands and make it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Also as usual when this orchestra comes to town, some protesters
from the National Organization for Women stood outside the hall
distributing leaflets that castigated the Vienna Philharmonic for
sexism and misogyny. In previous years the NOW contingent has been
larger. This time there were just a handful of women keeping up the
fight, perhaps because the orchestra has taken some steps, at least
officially, to change its ways and is now a harder target.
</P>
<P>
   For 156 years the Vienna Philharmonic, Austria's pre-eminent
cultural institution, was a male-only preserve. But early in 1997,
bowing to pressure from women's groups abroad as well as Government
officials at home and dismayed over the bad publicity that the
protests overseas was generating, the orchestra voted to open its
ranks to women. As a first gesture Anna Lelkes, a harpist who had
played with the Vienna Philharmonic for 25 years on an adjunct
basis, was made its first official female member. Another harpist,
Julie Palloc, has been hired full time, although she did not
participate in the Carnegie Hall concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The other charges that have dogged the orchestra, which the NOW
protest leveled again, concern xenophobia and racism. Over the
years some outspoken players have lent credibility to these
accusations through public statements about the need to protect the
orchestra's national character, and with other code words. In a
1996 article in The Journal of the International Alliance for Women
in Music, the orchestra's principal flutist, Dieter Flury, was
quoted as saying: ``If one thinks that the world should function by
quota regulations, then it is naturally irritating that we are a
group of white-skinned males who perform exclusively the music of
white-skinned male composers.'' But, he added, for the sake of the
orchestra's incomparable pedigree, ``it is worthwhile to accept
this racist and sexist irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   At least officially, Flury's position has lost out. The reasons
long given by the old guard for barring women _ that they will
cause disorder and create competition among the men, that they play
with a different character than men, that their pregnancies would
disrupt scheduling _ seem laughably antiquated. Such notions
conjure up images of women as temptresses and harken to times when
the sight of a cello between a woman's legs was considered
unfeminine.
</P>
<P>
   But a change in its membership policy will not soon change the
makeup of the Vienna Philharmonic, as the eerie sight of one lone
female, Ms. Lelkes, amid a stage full of white males during the
Shostakovich symphony made abundantly clear. Bringing more women to
the orchestra will take a huge dose of something akin to
affirmative action, a policy that is dreaded in conservative
Austria and that is controversial most everywhere else, and that
will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even many critics who deplore the male domination of the
Vienna Philharmonic are wary about advocating quick fixes, for
there is something indisputably worth preserving here that goes
beyond the orchestra's technical excellence and musical
sensitivity. In terms of precision and virtuosity there are
orchestras that surpass it. Wednesday night's all-Mozart program
concluded with an ebullient performance of the overture to ``Le
Nozze di Figaro.'' But the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James
Levine performed the work this fall with comparable grace and even
fleeter dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   What the Vienna Philharmonic players achieve to an uncanny
degree is unanimity of musical purpose. This is not just a product
of the orchestra's famously cultivated sound: the vibrant, warm
strings, the plangent brass, the poignantly reedy woodwinds, the
incisive but never intrusive percussion. It is a product of shared
thinking and a willingness, even an eagerness, to work toward
mutual ends.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the fact that since World War II the orchestra has been
run essentially by the players themselves, without a permanent
music director, is one reason for the solidarity. The musicians
essentially hold down two jobs: they are hired by the Austrian
government into the ranks of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra and
run the Philharmonic as an independent enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the players work often and closely with guest
conductors whom they respect, Muti among them. This might seem a
curious choice at first for a player-run ensemble, given Muti's
strong-willed, meticulous approach to conducting. But when he takes
the helm of this orchestra he is a deferential and calming captain.
</P>
<P>
   His performances of Mozart's ``Linz'' Symphony, ``Prague''
Symphony and Symphony No. 40 in G minor allowed no interpretive
funny business. This was vigorous, clear-headed Mozart. Tempos were
lithe but never rushed. Menuetto movements were hearty but never
forced. The early music movement seems to have passed Muti and the
Vienna players right by. But these full-bodied performances had a
transcendent kind of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumann Symphony No. 2, notorious for its thick-textured
orchestration, was played with such uniformity of sound and
largeness of conception that the music became an organic river of
swirling, restless harmony and counterpoint. Yet the magisterial
sweep and impressive structure of the work never seemed more
daring.
</P>
<P>
   Tchaikovsky's seldom-heard and terribly difficult ``Manfred''
Symphony, not one of the six numbered symphonies, is essentially an
oversize tone poem. The music is often unwieldy: the composer
begins a fugue with a cumbersome theme in the last movement, but
wisely abandons the idea fairly soon. But Muti, a commanding
presence, had it sounding like the most cogent and inevitable music
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   This Italian conductor also knows when to stay out of the way,
as he did, charmingly, in the affable trio section of the minuet of
Schubert's youthful Symphony No. 3: he cued the beginning of each
phrase, then stood with his arms at his sides, just keeping an eye
on things.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the performance that was the most emblematic of the
orchestra came at the beginning of the first concert, when the
players, without a conductor, offered Mozart's short and
consolingly sad ``Maurerische Trauermusik'' in memory of Judith
Arron, the director of Carnegie Hall, who died in December.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the unanimity of purpose that the Vienna Philharmonic
has achieved is a precious thing and you can understand their fear
of diluting it. But what accounts for this quality? The maleness of
the players? Maybe that was so in a time when women routinely were
oppressed, but it makes no sense any longer. More likely the
special cohesiveness comes from a shared commitment to a revered
heritage. Why should fine female musicians not be able to embrace
this heritage and work ethic as well as men? Over the decades many
sons have followed their fathers into this orchestra. Cannot
daughters do the same?
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the orchestra always has sought young players. At
auditions no one over 35 is selected. Looking at all the youthful
faces, I kept wondering what these men must think about the
orchestra's history of prejudice against women. Do they approve?
Are they go-along, get-along chauvinists or closet feminists
waiting for the old guard to pass away?
</P>
<P>
   If more women join its ranks, the orchestra certainly will
change. But why should that not be an enriching change? The players
already have a weighty tradition to uphold. It must be tiring to
also cart around all that manhood.
</P>
<P>
   As the players walked onstage to take their places on Thursday,
a friend who had come with me, a woman whose feminist convictions
were offended by the orchestra's male domination but who was
vanquished by the music making, sighed and said, ``All those men
look so lonely up there.'' They need not be.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Snow will fall across parts of New England and the northern
Middle Atlantic states Monday as vigorous low pressure moves toward
Cape Cod. Heavy accumulations, over ten inches, are likely in a
narrow swath from eastern Pennsylvania to interior Maine, including
the western side of New York City and Boston. Near the coastline,
brisk ocean winds will import slightly milder air, allowing a
mixture of rain, sleet and snow to fall. As a result, just a few
inches of accumulation are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, mixed precipitation will end as a period of snow
in interior Maryland and northern Virginia as chilly breezes
develop in the storm's wake. A few light showers will fall across
the Carolinas as the disturbance aloft supporting the ocean storm
moves by.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather will occur from the Great Lakes states to the
lower Mississippi Valley due to high pressure crossing the region.
It will remain chilly in much of the South, however, where cool
breezes from the north will keep temperatures in the upper 40s and
50s despite the abundant sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, breezes from the southwest and sunny skies will
promote warm readings over the western Plains. High temperatures
will rise 15 to 20 degrees above average in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rain showers and very cool weather are expected in southern
California as a pocket of cold air aloft drifts over the region.
Snow levels will be quite low, with several inches expected in the
mountains above 3,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest will be generally dry before a weak storm
system arrives Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Perplexing Forecast
</P>
<P>
   From St. Louis to Columbus, Ohio, residents wondered why the
weekend snowstorm never materialized. However, just an hour drive
south of both cities, heavy snow fell. The computer simulations
predicted a 200-mile-wide swath from Missouri to Ohio, where the
equivalent of ten inches of snow would fall; instead, 15 inches
fell in a much narrower band, only 100 miles wide. On Monday, the
computer forecasts show a similar pattern for the Northeast coast,
leaving the densely populated region from New York to Boston with a
perplexing problem of exactly how wide an area will see a heavy
snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Thursday: The East will be noticeably warmer as high
pressure off the coast circulates mild, dry air into the region.
Clouds and scattered showers will accompany a cold front moving
from the Great Lakes into the northern Appalachians. A disturbance
developing in Texas will produce some snow in the southern Rockies
and an expansive area of clouds in the southern Plains. The
Northwest will become damp and rather cool.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Saturday: The Northeast will turn brisk and cooler as
high pressure builds into the region. Flurries will linger over
northern New England. A large but weak disturbance moving northeast
from Texas will cause plenty of clouds and patches of mainly light
rain. There could be a few thunderstorms in the Gulf states. Warmer
weather will return to the eastern Rockies, but a cold front will
bring rain and snow to the Far West.

BUFFETT DEPLORES TREND OF MANIPULATED EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The executives who run companies for Warren Buffett know that
few things are as sure to anger the legendary investor as
dishonesty about how their businesses are performing. So, too, has
Buffett always promised the people he works for _ the shareholders
of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. _ nothing less than total candor.
</P>
<P>
   But accounting gimmicks and misrepresentations to investors have
become so commonplace at public companies that it has prompted
Buffett, in his annual report to shareholders, to make an
extraordinary attack on many of his fellow chief executives, who he
says have worked purposefully ``at manipulating numbers and
deceiving investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many major corporations still play things straight, but a
significant and growing number of otherwise high-grade managers _
CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for your children or as
trustees under your will _ have come to the view that it's OK to
manipulate earnings to satisfy what they believe are Wall Street's
desires,'' Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 report, which
was posted on the company's World Wide Web site over the weekend.
``Indeed, many CEOs think this kind of manipulation is not only OK,
but actually their duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshire report, eagerly anticipated every year by
individual investors and professionals alike, provided few
surprises about Berkshire's holdings or Buffett's investment
outlook. It shows that he added slightly to holdings in American
Express, now the company's second-largest equity investment after
Coca-Cola, and that he trimmed holdings last year in Wells Fargo,
the Walt Disney Co. and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   He also sold much of what at year-end 1997 had been a nearly
$1.3 billion stake in the Travelers Group, which later acquired
Citicorp to form Citigroup. Shares of Citigroup fell 8 percent in
1998, but the company is not listed among Berkshire's equity
investments worth more than $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett criticizes himself for selling shares of McDonald's,
which rose more than 60 percent last year. All in all, Berkshire
sold about $4.9 billion in shares and other investments last year
and bought about $1.9 billion, according to Berkshire's cash-flow
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portfolio actions I took in 1998 actually decreased our
gain for the year,'' he wrote. ``In particular, my decision to sell
McDonald's was a very big mistake. Overall, you would have been
better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies
during market hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He also kept quiet on whether Berkshire still owns the enormous
silver hoard it disclosed last year and certain other nonequity
investments, except to say, ``We have eliminated certain of the
positions discussed last year and added certain others.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Buffett would like to make another big
acquisition, similar in size to the $22 billion purchase last year
of the General Re Corp. He has raised Berkshire's acquisition
criteria considerably: Buffett is now seeking companies with pretax
income of at least $50 million _ it was $25 million last year _ at
prices of up to $20 billion, twice as large as the uppermost limit
he suggested last year. And there is plenty of money on Berkshire's
balance sheet to pay for such purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really leaps off the page is the increase in
cash to $15 billion, and the fact that management is clearly
looking at much larger acquisitions,'' said Alice D. Schroeder, an
analyst at Paine Webber. Buffett also says that although ``cash
never makes us happy,'' he and his partner, Charles T. Munger, have
not found any big acquisition candidates that fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   With a single, big acquisition having become more important for
Berkshire, Buffett's ire is rising at the accounting tricks
increasingly used in mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These managers often say that their shareholders will be hurt
if their currency for doing deals _ that is, their stock _ is not
fully priced, and they also argue that in using accounting
shenanigans to get the figures they want, they are only doing what
everybody else does,'' Buffett wrote. ``Once such an
everybody's-doing-it attitude takes hold, ethical misgivings
vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that one estimate of the tally for special charges and
write-downs reported during 1998 exceeded $70 billion, Buffett
lauded the efforts of Arthur Levitt, the Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman, to end the practice of ``earnings
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, corporate financial results have no more
credibility than bogus golf scores. This is no different, he
continued, from a golfer reporting an atrociously high score for
his first round _ say, 140 _ and then shooting 80s for the next few
rounds by drawing down against the ``reserve'' established in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wall Street,'' he remarked, ``they will ignore the 140 _
which, after all, came from a `discontinued' swing _ and will
classify our hero as an 80 shooter (and one who never
disappoints).''

FISH FROZEN FOR 37 YEARS MAY HELP SOLVE MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Minn., Pa., Tenn., N.Y., Canada)  (lb) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNEAUT, Ohio _ Call it nostalgia. Or sentimentality. Or call
it an uncanny prescience.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Anthony himself is not exactly sure why he kept a certain
fish in his freezer for 37 years, carefully rewrapping it every so
often and making sure that his wife did not let it thaw when she
defrosted the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Anthony, a 63-year-old barber in this working-class
town on the shores of Lake Erie, had a feeling when he caught the
fish, a blue pike, back in 1962, that someday somebody might be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling my wife it was more valuable as time went on
and that's why we needed to keep it,'' Anthony said. ``It's hard
for me to explain, but that blue pike meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, nearly four decades later, Jim Anthony's blue
pike means a lot to other people, too. It has become the central
clue in a compelling scientific detective story that some
scientists are hoping will lead to an extraordinary result: the
return of an extinct species.
</P>
<P>
   Blue pike, native only to Lake Erie, were once so ubiquitous
there that they spurred a booming commercial fishing industry in
the 1930s and 1940s, catering to demand for the mild, meaty taste
of the bright blue fish. But in 1975, blue pike were declared
extinct, a casualty, scientists say, of pollution, overfishing and
habitat changes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, fishermen have occasionally reported seeing what
looked like blue pike in smaller lakes in Canada and elsewhere.
Some Lazarus-like resurrection? More plausible was the theory that
during the blue-pike heyday, people transferred small batches of
fish from Lake Erie to smaller lakes and they never died out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fish biologists generally assumed that those blue fish
were really a type of walleye, a common fish in Lake Erie, and not
the true blue pike. But they could not be sure. They could find no
specimens of blue pike preserved in such a way that DNA could be
extracted and compared with the DNA of other fish.
</P>
<P>
   And they were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find and verify the survival of the blue pike,
then we could restock them in Lake Erie,'' said Dieter Busch, a
fishery biologist who helped spearhead the research as chief of the
Lower Great Lakes Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said the blue pike had been sorely missed, both for
environmental reasons (it filled an ecological niche as one of the
few Lake Erie fish to spawn in deep water) and for economic reasons
(he estimates that blue pike at their previous levels would add
more than $150 million to the lake's fishing industry).
</P>
<P>
   ``The species was such a valuable species,'' Busch said, ``it
was worth getting an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Research was going slowly. Scientists had blue pike from
museums, but they were preserved in formaldehyde, which makes DNA
hard to extract. Scientists also had scales from blue pike used in
unrelated earlier studies, but that DNA was disappointing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for science, Anthony, while snipping hair, chatted
to customers about ``the blue-pike generation.'' That was the
golden age of blue pike, when Anthony's father sold piles of them
from his fish markets in Conneaut (pronounced KAHN-yaht) and
popularized the ``fish sandwich without bones.'' After school, Jim
pulled on rubber boots and got down to scaling and cleaning fish.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, a burly, self-effacing man who worked as a fisherman
for his father until the blue-pike population started to dwindle in
1957, told his barbershop customers about the 15-inch blue pike he
caught with a simple hook, line and night crawler in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he knew the fish was rare, and he kept it alive in a
bucket while contacting state wildlife agencies. He offered them
the fish but they declined. One agency suggested he release it into
the lake, and he tried, but it was already too weak and died.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's wife, Mary Lynn, accepted the fish-preservation
routine graciously, realizing that it was important to her husband.
Sometimes while defrosting the freezer, she either moved the fish
to another freezer or piled frozen foods on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my customers knew I had a blue pike in my freezer,''
Anthony said in his white ranch house not far from the great lake.
``They thought I was nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last year a customer brought him a local newspaper
article about scientists trying to determine whether any blue pike
still existed. Anthony called one of the scientists, Carol Stepien,
an ichthyologist, or fish zoologist, at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland and offered his fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't look bad for 30-something years in the freezer,''
Anthony said. ``Except for a little freezer burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien was more concerned with what was inside.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, ``It has great DNA,'' she said. The research
``would be very difficult without his fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien's crew is proceeding systematically, first trying to
determine whether the original blue pike is in fact a separate
species from the walleye. If the two fish are too closely related,
then the walleye might have interbred with the last of the blue
pike, making it unlikely that any original blue pike still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien says she will not disclose her conclusion until a
scientific conference in May. Busch, however, who now works for the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, is bolder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that blue pike are a separate species,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Busch said, is searching for ``suspect blue
pike'' in various lakes (so far, there have been rumors of blue
pike in Ontario, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Tennessee). Fishermen
have sent putative blue pike to Dr. Stepien and to the Fish and
Wildlife Service, but the DNA of those fish will not be tested
until the first phase of the project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Busch even has a fish that someone sent him eight years ago,
which he says has telltale blue-pikeness: a pointy nose, large eyes
and smaller size than a walleye.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I unwrapped it, my stomach jumped,'' Busch said. ``I have
seen hundreds of walleye and this was different.''
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists find living blue pike, they will focus on ways
to reintroduce them to Lake Erie. The lake is cleaner now, but
there would have to be an adequate food supply _ the lake herring
that blue pike ate tapered off decades ago and Busch said they
might have to restock that, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of this is somewhat controversial with some fishery managers
and the fish and wildlife agencies in the states with a border on
Lake Erie: Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. They are concerned that
before any fish are reintroduced, there should be solid proof not
only that the fish are blue pike but that they will not interbreed
with walleye or invade the walleye's habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have them back, but we want the original
ones, and that's the key,'' said Roger Knight, supervisor of the
Sandusky Fish Research Unit of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. ``You
can build false hopes and there may be pressure to stock blue fish
in Lake Erie, even if we're not sure they are the original blue
pike. We're not about to introduce another strain of walleye into
our lakes where our walleye are doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony knows the investigation could take years, but he is
hopeful it will show that the fish of his childhood is still around
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He winces to recall the waning years of the blue pike, when the
fish his father's workers caught contained no eggs, or eggs that
were deformed.
</P>
<P>
   After he caught his blue pike in 1962, the year after his father
died, he tried to conjure up ways to keep the breed from
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd meet a politician, I'd say `Just get me
permission to set a net and catch some blue pike and try spawning
them in holding tanks,''' said Anthony, who could no longer set
nets, because he had given up his commercial fishing license.
Later, Lake Erie commercial fishing was banned for a while because
of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they didn't think blue pike was really going to die
out,'' Anthony said, ``but I couldn't understand why they weren't
doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he bequeathed his frozen blue pike, Anthony has visited
Dr. Stepien's lab a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound corny, but I had a lot of feeling in that fish
_ it's a part of my life,'' he said. ``Now, they call it the
Anthony fish. I like that.''

FLEET FINANCIAL SAID TO BE BUYING BANKBOSTON FOR $16 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I.)   (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group plans to acquire the BankBoston Corp. for
$16 billion in a deal that will create the eighth-largest bank in
the country and the pre-eminent bank in New England, executives
involved in the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank, which is to be based in Boston and will be called
the FleetBoston Corp., will have such a stranglehold on consumer
accounts in states like Massachusetts, according to lawyers
specializing in banking law, that federal antitrust law will
require large sales of bank branches there and elsewhere in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will most likely involve a significant number of
job cuts and layoffs throughout New England, anywhere from 2,500 to
5,000, according to people involved in the deal, though the exact
number of job cuts could not be determined. Fleet and BankBoston
employ about 50,000 people combined.
</P>
<P>
   If shareholders and regulators approve the deal, the merged bank
will still lack the heft necessary to join the ranks of the
nation's new banking titans that have been created by a wave of
mergers. With about $178 billion in assets, the new FleetBoston
will remain a quarter to half the size of Citigroup, BankAmerica
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bank One Corp. That raises the
possibility that the new bank could be involved in another big
merger in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to be announced Monday. The boards
of both banks approved the deal after meeting Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The banks renewed discussions about a merger about six weeks
ago. Earlier talks fell apart last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet will exchange 1.1844 of its shares for each BankBoston
share, valuing BankBoston at about $53 a share, or about a 15
percent premium above BankBoston's closing price on Friday of
$46.9375 a share. Shares of Fleet rose 12.5 cents on Friday, to
$44.75.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares have been trading well below their 52-week
high of $59.0625 because of investor concern about the bank's heavy
exposure to volatile economies in Brazil and Argentina. BankBoston
executives have repeatedly noted that the bank turned in a record
performance in Latin America last year and that they expect to make
a substantial profit in the region this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a combination with Fleet will further insulate
BankBoston from financial problems related to any economic
downturns in Latin America. Last year, Fleet had operating earnings
of $1.6 billion on revenue of $7.14 billion. BankBoston posted
operating earnings of $792 million on revenue of $4.4 billion in
1998. The merged bank will have about 20 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution issues aside, this might be a terrific deal,'' said
Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``They have
strengths in divergent areas, and if they combine correctly they
could have significant opportunities to boost revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Murray, the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of
Fleet, is to be chief executive of the merged bank for the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Charles K. Gifford, the 56-year-old chairman and
chief executive of BankBoston, will succeed Murray as chairman of
the merged company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fleet, which grew rapidly through a series of mergers from its
original base in Providence, R.I., has 1,200 consumer branches
reaching as far south as New York and is the country's
sixth-largest commercial lender. It is also one of the biggest
mortgage lenders in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet also owns Quick &AMP; Reilly, the nation's third-largest
discount brokerage firm, and provides investment management
services for both individuals and institutional clients, with more
than $74 billion in assets under management. It also own the AFSA
Data Corp., one of the largest processors of student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fleet bought a large credit card portfolio from the
Advanta Corp., but recently sued Advanta, contending that Advanta
overstated the value of that business. Fleet says that Advanta did
not disclose coding errors that resulted in excessive interest
charges of at least $3.9 million, which Fleet had to repay. Advanta
has said that the lawsuit has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's mix of businesses has been criticized by analysts and
advisers as something of a hodgepodge, but the bank has focused
more closely recently on performance and turned in strong results
last year, when many other banks had difficulty meeting earnings
goals. Its credit card and commercial lending businesses did
particularly well last year.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which has a blue-chip, Brahmin lineage, has a
well-regarded management team and has been praised as a friendly,
supportive company for employees, with relatively little turnover
among its work force. It has also established a strong record on
community outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, was a difficult one for BankBoston. It was
buffeted by trading losses, the untimely and expensive acquisition
of the Robertson Stephens investment banking firm and a financial
scandal involving millions of dollars stolen from its private
banking division. The downward pressure on its stock had made the
bank a more vulnerable takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has a charter dating from 1784 and once numbered Paul
Revere among its clients. The bank is an unusual hybrid of
old-fashioned banking, corporate lending and stock underwriting,
married to extensive Latin American operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of BankBoston's profits come from its Latin
American operations; the bulk of the bank's profits, about 67
percent, come from its corporate banking and regional banking
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's consumer banking business has been hobbled by
problems related to the acquisition of Baybanks three years ago, a
situation that Fleet and BankBoston must avoid if they want to
integrate their operations successfully.

(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the name of sanity, can someone please stop that
noise? All those chuckles, titters, giggles, guffaws: They are so
much scarier than the usual shrieks, groans and clanking chains.
Such are the diabolical, synthetic sounds of amusement that plague
the sunny but definitely haunted beach house of ``Betty's Summer
Vacation,'' an angry new comedy by Christopher Durang that suggests
that Western civilization is ending not with a bang but with a
laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Horrendous acts from rape to dismemberment occur in this
relentlessly fierce, relentlessly funny story of a summer rental
for which the word ``nightmare'' is gentle. But the truly
unpardonable crime in this world of the comedy, which opened Sunday
night at Playwrights Horizons in a heavenly hell of a production
directed by Nicholas Martin, is silence, which means boredom. The
unseen spirits of the laugh track, who can find plenty of amusement
in stories of incest and wife beating, don't like it when things
get quiet. Fortunately for them, that doesn't happen very often.
That's fortunate for us, too.
</P>
<P>
   Please welcome Durang back to the ranks of America's liveliest
living playwrights. This influential dramatist, who steered the
suburban domestic comedy into dark and uncharted waters in the
1970s and '80s, has himself been mostly silent in the past decade.
When last heard from several seasons ago, it was with the shrill
and petulant ``Sex and Longing,'' a screed of a play that died
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Vacation,'' however, Durang is in fighting trim, an
anarchic moralist with a mission to entertain us while pointing out
how pathetically addicted we are to being entertained. The way that
grating laugh track often blends with the laughter of audience
members can be a trifle disconcerting and even embarrassing as it
seems to include us in the play's general spirit of condemnation.
It should be noted that in previews some people were stalking out
at (and even before) intermission. Believe me, it was not because
they were bored.
</P>
<P>
   Stated baldly, the premise of ``Betty's Summer Vacation'' is
sitcom simple: Take a group of wildly incompatible people, mix them
together into one small house and watch the fur fly! For the first
minute or two, you may think you've wandered onto the set of a
pilot for the Fox network, although Thomas Lynch's inspired
shell-decorated interior is a bit too pastel for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The evening begins with the entrance of two housemates to be,
the ever-so-perky Trudy (Julie Lund) and the more sensible Betty
(Kellie Overbey), who just wants a little time to herself but seems
doomed not to find it. Trudy, you see, can't sit still (watch her
play with her legs as though they were newfound toys), can't keep
her mouth shut and can't begin to stay on one subject. She is a
classic television cutie pie cum kook who has been pushed just one
notch over the top into a vivacity that verges on the nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   That also describes the atmosphere in which the show takes
place: a heightened, jittery and all-embracing brightness through
which swim a quartet of obsessive-compulsive characters of
diversely caffeinated sensibilities. In addition to Trudy, there
are Trudy's mother, Mrs. Siezmagraff (Kristine Nielsen), whose
vitality makes her daughter seem zombielike, and Buck (Troy
Sostillio), a young macho strutter who requires sex at least 20
times a day. Keith (a delectably furtive Nat DeWolf), the quiet
one, arrives with a shovel and a hatbox and can occasionally be
spotted wearing bloodied rubber gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, there are also those darn displaced voices, which seem
to be coming from the house's ceiling and which can find something
to laugh about in practically everything. That's true even when the
talk slides, as it does quickly, into the kind of confessional
conversation found on ``Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Mrs. Siezmagraff, still as chirpy as a
flight attendant, describing her relationship with Trudy: ``We
don't talk much because her father incested her when he was drunk,
and I never did anything about it because I was co-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing compared with what happens once Mrs. Siezmagraff
brings home an elderly drifter (Guy Boyd) whom she picks up on the
beach and who wears nothing but a raincoat. Things go from the
merely perverse to the apocalyptic in a route that (be warned)
includes scenes involving the whereabouts of a severed penis, a
homage to Durang's artistic ancestor Joe Orton.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the voices obligingly explain to anyone who
asks exactly what they find funny and why. When Trudy yells
bitterly, ``I'm glad you're dead, Daddy,'' the voices roar in
delight, offering the analytic footnote, ``It sounded corny.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly the idea that life imitates and blurs into television
in a country where attention deficit disorder is the No. 1 disease
is not exactly startling. It is the conceit behind movies like
``The Truman Show'' and the forthcoming ``EdTV,'' as well as more
earnest studies like Neal Gabler's recent book ``Life the Movie:
How Entertainment Conquered Reality.'' And perhaps in the reading,
Durang's text, whose topical references are well worn, would seem
like just one more preachy (although still funny) variation on a
very familiar theme.
</P>
<P>
   But theater, praise be, can still go where other forms of art
cannot. What Martin and his crack cast and production team provide
is a pure physical charge of pathological energy that comes from
highly animate human presences. Aside from something expressly
athletic like ``Stomp,'' it is hard to think of a theater piece in
which the performers sustain such a level of vigor and adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   The exhilarating abrasiveness of ``Vacation'' comes not so much
from its taboo-baiting sensationalism as from the hyped-up
intensity of the actors. All of them are terrific, but it is Ms.
Nielsen who provides the evening's touchstone performance. The body
of this Siezmagraff is in perpetual vibration, as though her
muscles were made of gelatin and infinitely sensitive to all
cultural tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Swigging vodka in her hideous hostess clothes (the dead-on work
of Michael Krass), propelling everyone else into the funniest game
of charades seen on a stage since ``Hay Fever,'' she is a one-woman
millennial New Year's Eve party. Even if you are among those who
take offense at Durang's portrait of societal offenses, you would
be a fool to leave before the second act because that is when Ms.
Nielsen enacts an entire ``Court TV'' trial by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Overbey acquits herself appealingly as the sole straight
woman in a land of demonic cutups, while drolly humanizing a role
that is just a shade too righteous. (She is also a gifted
screamer.) It would be unfair not to mention the exquisitely
synchronized work of Jack Ferver, Geneva Carr and Godfrey L.
Simmons Jr., though it would also be unfair to explain what they
do.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that those involved in ``Vacation'' realize that
today's audiences need more than mere dialogue to remain engaged.
Accordingly, the production has come up with two genuinely
startling special-effects demonstrations, one of which gives new
piquancy to Neil Postman's notion of ``amusing ourselves to
death.''

   TOP:
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CHINA-MILITARY (Undated) _ The revelation that China
appears to have stolen the design of America's most advanced
miniaturized warhead has promted new debate in Washington over
whether China's small nuclear force could become a far more potent
arsenal that could rekindle the kind of fears that shaped the cold
war. By David E. Sanger and Erik Eckholm. With map.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-OSHA-WHISTLEBLOWERS (Washington) _ After finding that
workers who complain of health and safety hazards are often
dismissed from their jobs, the Clinton administration will soon
propose sweeping new protections for such ``whistleblowers.''
Republicans are receptive to the idea. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TALKS (Washington) _ American officials expect little
from the latest round of talks over Kosovo. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   NY-TWO-SLAYINGS (New York) _ They did not know each other, but
Amy Watkins and Marvin Watson were both young archetypes of the New
York newcomer. She was the Midwest idealist come to the big city,
he was the striver from Jamaica. Both were stabbed to death in
Brooklyn this year, and while Ms. Watkins's death has attracted
national attention, Watson died anonymously. Yet if both killings
were treated differently, they each touch on fears held deeply by
many New Yorkers, even as crime has fallen in the city. By Jim
Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   REEFER:
</P>
<P>
   FLEET-BANKBOSTON (Undated) _ Fleet Financial Group plans to
acquire the BankBoston Corp. for $16 billion in a deal that will
create the eighth-largest bank in the country and the pre-eminent
bank in New England, executives involved in the talks said Sunday.
By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BOTTOM:
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN-FISH (Conneaut, Ohio) _ Jim Anthony himself is not
exactly sure why he kept a a blue pike in his freezer for 37 years,
but now, nearly four decades later, the fish has become the central
clue in a compelling scientific detective story, sleuthing that
some scientists are hoping will lead to an extraordinary result:
the return of an extinct species. By Pam Belluck. With art.
</P>
<P>
   PAPERBACKS-MEDIA (New York) _ Since 1995, the number of
mass-market paperbacks sold in the United States has declined by
almost 9 percent, falling to 484 million copies last year, about
three times the percentage loss in consumer books overall. And the
immediate future offers little comfort; the book industry's
research arm, the Book Industry Study Group, is projecting
continued slight annual declines for the paperback market over the
next several years. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-COMPUTER-INJURY (Undated) _ There is widespread concern
among physicians, physical therapists and ergonomists that a tide
of injury is inevitable as youngsters spend more time on computers,
both at school and at home. By Jane Gross. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE BOX:
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-UNCERTAINTY (Istanbul, Turkey) _ With a national election
approaching, Parliament in open rebellion against the political
establishment, murderous terror attacks being launched against
civilians and the trial of a hated Kurdish guerrilla leader
approaching, Turkey suddenly finds itself facing deep
uncertainties. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-PRISON-REPORT (Undated) _ The Justice Department, in a
report released Sunday, said the number of American adults in
prison has more than doubled over the past 12 years, reaching its
highest level ever last year.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-FED-DEATH (New York) _ When Tabitha Walrond, a
19-year-old welfare recipient, gave birth to her first child, she
did what new mothers rich and poor are urged to do these days: She
breast-fed her baby. But her two-month-old son died in her arms of
malnutrition. And Ms. Walrond is now charged with recklessly
causing the death by failing to nourish her son adequately and by
failing to obtain prompt medical attention when his condition
became dire. The case is extremely unusual because while some
nursing mothers have problems producing enough breast-milk, it is
rare for a baby to die as a result, and rarer still for the mother
to then be prosecuted. By Nina Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PARADE-GAYS (New York) _ The first St. Patrick's Day parade
in the Bronx in 70 years has, in the last few days, become
embroiled in the same political turmoil over gay marchers that has
troubled the St. Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan since 1991. By
Katherine E. Finkelstein.

NEW PROTECTIONS PLANNED FOR WORKPLACE WHISTLE-BLOWERS

(lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After finding that workers who complain of health
and safety hazards are often dismissed from their jobs, the Clinton
administration will soon propose sweeping new protections for such
whistle-blowers, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The law that created the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration prohibits employers from retaliating against people
who report unsafe or unhealthy working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general of the Labor Department, Charles
Masten, said such reprisals often occur, and Charles Jeffress, the
assistant secretary of labor in charge of OSHA, said the Clinton
administration would soon recommend changes in the law to increase
the protection of workers who expose health and safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employees hesitate to exercise their rights for fear of
losing their jobs, these rights are meaningless,'' Jeffress said.
``Too many employers feel they can retaliate against
whistle-blowers with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers file more than 2,000 complaints a year contending that
they have been dismissed, demoted or penalized for reporting health
and safety violations to employers or to the government. But,
Jeffress said, the existing federal law is ``too weak and too
cumbersome to discourage employer retaliation or to provide an
effective remedy for the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans in Congress who have harshly criticized OSHA
say new protections are probably needed, because workers have been
punished for complaining about conditions that lead to illness and
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Such conditions include exposure to toxic chemicals; the use of
dangerous machines, which can crush fingers; the use of
contaminated needles, which expose workers to the AIDS virus, and
the strain of repetitive hand motion, whether at a computer
keyboard or in a meat-packing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Masten, the inspector general, scrutinized cases in which
employees said they had been punished for reporting health and
safety violations, and he concluded: ``Workers, particularly with
small companies, are vulnerable to reprisals by their employers for
complaining about unsafe, unhealthy work conditions. The severity
of the discrimination is highlighted by the fact that for 653 cases
included in our sample, nearly 67 percent of the workers who filed
complaints were terminated from their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, workers who believe they have been dismissed
or punished for reporting workplace hazards may file complaints
with the Labor Department within 30 days of the action taken
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The department will investigate, and it is supposed to file suit
against the employer in a U.S. District Court if it concludes that
the employer's action was illegal. Under the law, the court may
order ``all appropriate relief,'' including the rehiring or
reinstatement of an employee with back pay.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said the Labor Department rarely filed
cases in court on behalf of whistle-blowers, even when OSHA found
strong evidence of retaliation. In 1998, the department says, it
received 2,474 complaints from workers who said they had suffered
discrimination for reporting health and safety violations, but it
filed only 14 cases in court. In 1997, it received 2,124 such
complaints and took 18 cases to court.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department task force that studied the issue said such
cases typically involved small amounts of money and were not a high
priority for government lawyers or for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they would ask Congress to
give workers six months, rather than 30 days, to file complaints of
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   To provide more rapid assistance to workers, the White House
will propose that cases be tried before hearing officers known as
administrative-law judges. The administration will ask Congress to
authorize punitive damages in cases where an employer has falsified
records or disregarded the requirements of federal law in a
particularly brazen or egregious way.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will also propose legislation allowing workers
to take their claims to a federal appeals court if they are
dissatisfied with the decisions of an administrative-law judge.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current federal law, the secretary of labor decides
whether to seek help for an aggrieved employee, and workers have no
right to seek relief on their own if the secretary does not file
suit on their behalf. Federal courts have repeatedly held that
individual workers do not have a right to sue under the existing
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the administration wants Congress to require each
employer to post a notice in the workplace explaining any
settlement agreement or ruling in favor of a whistle-blower. In the
absence of such notices, other workers often conclude that they
will be punished for reporting health hazards, since the person who
filed the original complaint frequently goes to work for another
company.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to increase the protection of whistle-blowers are being
drafted by lawmakers as diverse as Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., and
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. Ballenger is chairman of a House
subcommittee responsible for occupational safety and health;
Wellstone is the ranking Democrat on a similar Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions welcome the administration proposals. ``Many
employers feel free to fire or harass workers who report an injury,
especially if the workers are not in a union,'' said Eric Frumin,
the health and safety director at the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Eide, manager of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said the proposals would ``open the floodgates to
meritless charges'' by workers and their lawyers. ``Plaintiffs'
lawyers are all too willing to sue an employer with no intention of
getting a verdict, simply to blackmail the employer, to force him
to pay off the plaintiff,'' Eide said.

</P>
<P>
   The regional office of the Labor Department covering New York
and New Jersey said it had secured a total of $211,000 in back pay
for 41 workers who were dismissed or otherwise penalized by
employers in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Dyno Nobel, which makes explosive devices, agreed
to pay $8,367 to a man dismissed as safety manager of its plant in
Port Ewen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gaffney, the supervisor of industrial relations at the
plant, denied that the company, a unit of Dyno Industrier, a
Norwegian corporation, had retaliated against the employee. But he
said, ``It was easier to settle the case than to get into a legal
battle with the government.'' Gaffney said the company had
increased safety precautions since two workers died in an explosion
at the plant in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, James E. Fisher, a 37-year-old mechanic, said he
was dismissed from his job in December after reporting safety
hazards at a factory that produces small motors for automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are laws to protect people like me who raise
safety issues,'' Fisher said in an interview. ``I'm supposed to be
protected under those laws, but it seems that I'm not being
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA found 24 violations, including exposure to excessive
amounts of copper dust at the plant, which is owned by DCM
Manufacturing, a unit of Dreison International. The company
negotiated a settlement calling for $15,210 in penalties, but did
not admit wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he was still out of work. Christopher Berger, a
senior executive of Dreison, denied that Fisher had been dismissed
for reporting health hazards. ``It would be absurd for any company
to retaliate against an employee for reporting OSHA violations,''
Berger said.

IRISH GOVERNMENT CALLED NEGLIGENT FOR DELAYING ABORTION POLICY
STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The dispute over Ireland's virtual ban on
abortion accelerated Sunday as four women who represent the country
in the European Parliament accused the government of negligence in
delaying a statement of its policy on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The women, among Ireland's 16-member delegation to the
parliament in Strasbourg, France, said on national radio that they
had voted in favor of a European Union measure that would permit
abortion in cases of rape and where the life or health of a mother
is endangered. One Irish male member also voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   The women emphasized that the measure's provisions could not be
forced on this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. But they
called for a debate in the Irish parliament and for the government
to issue a report on its abortion policy, and possible legislative
changes, that was supposed to have been released nine months ago.
Politicians wanted to avoid the issue, they added, because of its
volatility, which stems from vehement and categorical opposition to
abortion by the church.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is constitutionally legal here only when a women's life
is threatened, but there are no clinics here for such procedures.
Rape, incest or harm to the health of a woman, as distinguished
from her life, are not legal grounds for abortion. About 5,000
Irish women have abortions every year in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the issue flared up when a group of anti-abortion
militants, including about 40 Americans, forced their way into the
Dublin office of the Irish Family Planning Association and occupied
it for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   A judge issued an indefinite ban on the militants' picketing or
trespassing at the office, which gives information on the
availability of abortion in other countries, but is not allowed to
advise women to have the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who is visiting
the United States and is expected to meet President Clinton at the
White House on Wednesday, St. Patrick's Day, did not comment
immediately. Nor did the leaders of the pro-life campaign which has
been pressing for a new referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is expected to be one of the main issues in the
campaign this June for seats in the European Parliament, considered
important, prestigious and well-paid jobs. Sunday, the four women
said in the radio interviews that the government was trying to hide
from the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all voted for what we think is right,'' said Patricia
McKenna, who represents the Green Party. ``It is up to the
government to determine what the Irish people want and to give it
to them after a proper debate. These things are not very clear in
Ireland. The government is negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Malone, who represents the Labor Party, said she voted
for the measure because it permits abortion ``in cases of rape and
when the life and health of the of a mother is interfered with.''
Niall Andrews was the only male member of the governing Fianna Fail
party's European delegation to vote for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   He was quoted in The Irish Times as saying, ``Because I have a
daughter who is pregnant, if I thought she was going to die, you
would have to make a choice. I also have a daughter-in-law who is
pregnant.''

WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO WILLIAM HAGUE IS MATTERING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The big issue of the day was a Labor-Conservative
dispute over reform of the House of Lords, and Baroness Jay, leader
of the peers, was scheduled to appear on a Sunday morning talk
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that Hague was doing the David Frost show right before
me,'' she recounted that January night, ``so I rang No. 10 and said
they needed to watch it and let me know what he'd said so I'd be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide from 10 Downing St. called her just before she entered
the television studio. ``You don't need to know,'' he told her.
``He said zero, nothing. He doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to matter is the principal challenge these days for
William Hague, 37, now nearly two years in the job of heading up
the depleted and dispirited Conservative party, once Europe's
mightiest election machine.
</P>
<P>
   He is less than consequential not just to people like Jay, a
member of the Labor government, but more crucially to his own
constituents, members of the party that has dominated British
politics for most of this century but now finds itself at a
continuing loss since suffering its worst defeat in 165 years in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated predictions of imminent stirrings of recovery,
poll numbers continue lower than the already dismal levels when,
with John Major leading the party, the Conservatives attracted only
31 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Hague continually have counseled the growing number
of critics of his leadership to wait until the government
inevitably blunders. But Tony Blair has confounded those theorists
by standing tall in the public's estimation longer into his term of
office than any prime minister in British history.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas, personal rivalries produced feuds in the
Cabinet, and four of Blair's principals, including Peter Mandelson,
his closest confidant, were forced to resign. It was the kind of
disarray that had brought the Major government into disrepute, and
it seemed that the much-awaited stumble had arrived on the
Conservative doorstep. But Hague didn't seize the moment, and Blair
emerged unbruised.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking on the imposing title of Leader of the Opposition
in June, 1997, Hague doggedly has tried to reshape his party's
fortunes and his image. He has put on jeans and a baseball cap and
gone to ethnic culture festivals, he has traveled the country on a
campaign he titled ``Listening to Britain,'' and he has countered
Blair's fashionable ``Third Way'' with his own upbeat ``British
Way.'' He has even freshened the wallpaper and removed the pictures
of Major and Margaret Thatcher from the entrance hall of party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he ventured yet another approach, saying the party
should own up to past mistakes, acknowledge it was ``crushed'' in
the last election and get in touch with everyday people by
practicing something he called ``kitchen table Conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a party gathering, Hague pledged to do better by
teachers, doctors, nurses, public service workers, married couples
and others the party may have neglected in its pursuit of efficient
economic management. ``We must choose to be free,'' he told
delegates, ``we have to let go of arguments we have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He faces a dilemma in attacking New Labor. Does he fault them
for being Old Labor in disguise or accuse them of being copy cat
Tories? There is little convincing evidence to support the former
and little gain for the Conservatives in arguing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   A canny debater since his days as president of the Oxford Union,
he has had noted success against Blair only in the weekly question
time encounters in the House of Commons. But even that has not
produced dividends for him or the party in a country where
presidential-style leadership is leaving Parliament itself less and
less relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, Labor presented the latest annual
budget. Although Hague was able to point up significant failings
and posturings in the government's presentation to Parliament,
complete with soundbite barbs about ``stealth taxes'' and
``pickpockets'' in the Treasury, headlines the next morning
celebrated the fact that for the first time in history a Labor
government had reduced the basic rate of income tax.
</P>
<P>
   There will be tests of Conservative voter appeal this May and
June with elections to local councils, the new Scottish and Welsh
legislatures and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is the one issue where Hague has succeeded in drawing a
line between his party and the government. He has insisted that
Britain will not adopt the euro for at least eight years. But this
position has disenchanted some key members of the party and served
to remind voters of the party's divisive past.
</P>
<P>
   Prematurely bald, crisp and concise in his comments and clearly
most comfortable in a business suit, Hague doesn't appear as
youthful as he is and settles easily into the rational and
considered modulations of the McKinsey &AMP; Co. management consultant
that he once was.
</P>
<P>
   He is the youngest party leader since 24-year-old William Pitt
led the Tories in 1783. But he is a more experienced observer of
British politics than his age and his stint of only three years in
Major's cabinet would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 15 in his South Yorkshire home he busied himself
reading parliamentary reports, learned speeches by Winston
Churchill by heart and memorized the names and districts of all
Tory members of Parliament. The pin-up on his wall was Mrs.
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   He burst upon the scene a year later when, as a mop-haired
student, he took the podium at the annual Conservative party
conference and fired up the faithful with a call to arms in defense
of Tory principles.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, he became a member of Parliament from the toney South
London suburb of Richmond. He joined the cabinet as the secretary
for Wales, and last year he married Ffion Jenkins, who was his
Welsh language teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He won the leadership by appealing to the dominant Euroskeptic
wing of the Conservatives in Parliament who were determined to deny
the prize to the candidate who ran best among party members across
the country, former chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke.
Clarke remains the favorite of the rank and file, but his positive
view toward Britain eventually adopting the euro makes him
unacceptable to the Conservatives in Parliament, who control the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The most formidable alternative in the party with the needed
antipathy towards the euro, former Defense Minister Michael
Portillo, cannot bid for the leadership because he lost his seat in
Parliament in the 1997 Labor rout.

KING-SIZED LEGEND CARRILL ENJOYS NBA LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The visitors' locker room looked like the wardrobe tent on the
set of ``Reefer Madness II.''
</P>
<P>
   To the left sat Chris ``Tangled'' Webber. Parked on the right
was ballyhooed rookie point guard Jason ``White Men Can Get On
SportsCenter'' Williams. The near corner had been annexed by Vernon
``Slap A Fan'' Maxwell. Barging into the far corner was Vlade ``The
Inhaler'' Divac, who - unlike the aforementioned trio - had built
his smoking reputation on nothing riskier than tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting among these reclamation Sacramento Kings was 68-year-old
Pete Carril, who seemed as incongruous to this scene as Gandhi at a
cockfight.
</P>
<P>
   But Carril appeared to be the most relaxed guy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's off me,'' he said before Thursday's
Kings-Clippers game at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   When L.A. hoop fans last thought of him, Pete Carril had just
coached the Princeton Tigers to a stunning upset victory over
defending national champion UCLA in the first round of the 1996
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   His Ivy League Tigers had no scholarships. No hamburger
All-Americans. To slip past the mighty Bruins, Carril had to lead
them through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the ol' back door, just one option in Princeton's wicked,
man-to-man offensive scheme, made Carril something of a household
name for about two days.
</P>
<P>
   The win over UCLA was his last at Princeton. He retired from the
head-coaching grind to join former Princeton star Geoff Petrie in
Sacramento. Petrie, who is the Kings' vice president of basketball
operations, hired Carril to be an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the variables, this is not unlike hiring Martin
Scorsese as technical adviser on the next ``Rambo'' flick.
</P>
<P>
   Carril appears to be enjoying this role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' he said of teaching young players without
obligations of a head coach. ``I don't have the headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the game itself, Carril said recent grumbling about the
quality of NBA action is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's missing is training camp,'' he said in
explaining why this season looks more like abstract art. ``But I
think the league and the sport is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't hurt the NBA to bring in more teachers such as
Carril, whose 525 college victories were rewarded two years ago
with a spot in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Carril, who still would appear to be more at home in a
collegiate atmosphere, hasn't lost his interest in March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think four Big Ten teams are gonna get beat in the first
round,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Big Ten-Plus One was 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   All this proves is that Pete Carril never coached at UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Legends of the Falk
</P>
<P>
   Now that Stephon Marbury is the third client of superego agent
David Falk to join its starting lineup (Kerry Kittles and Keith Van
Horn are the others), the team just west of the Lincoln Tunnel
should be known as the New Jersey Gross.
</P>
<P>
   And the Meadowlands can be redefined as the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
   It should be interesting to see if Marbury - who forced
Minnesota to unload him because he was jealous of teammate Kevin
Garnett's lockout-inspiring contract - can help the Gross win
enough games to devalue that first-round draft pick New Jersey
surrendered in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's action, the Gross had the league's
second-worst record, a run of incompetence that's quickly gathering
lottery Ping-Pong momentum. The Timberwolves could chose to use
that pick in the 1999 draft, which may include intriguing prospects
such as point guards Baron Davis (UCLA) and Steve Francis
(Maryland), along with playmaking swingman Lamar Odom (Rhode
Island). However, the Timberwolves expect to sign point guard
Terrell Brandon, acquired in the three-team Marbury deal, to a
multi-year deal. In doing so, Brandon would be backpedaling from a
recent guarantee of testing the free-agent market this summer
before settling his future.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) More bricks with Jay
</P>
<P>
   One day after claiming their first victory of the season, the
Clippers took on ``The Tonight Show'' and Jay Leno. A ticker-tape
parade led to seats in the studio audience, where three Clippers -
Lamond Murray, Darrick Martin and Lorenzen Wright were included in
the show's ``You Make The Call'' routine.
</P>
<P>
   All three lost.
</P>
<P>
   (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Laker Dennis Rodman
</P>
<P>
   can avoid further elbow discomfort by alternating hands when
gulping kamikaze shots. ... Three NBA scouts contacted this week
said Arizona's Jason Terry
</P>
<P>
   will be a better pro point guard than ex-teammate and current
Vancouver rookie Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   Two different NBA scouts said the other three NBA scouts are
insane. ... With the NCAA Tournament in full swing Friday, six of
the nine scheduled NBA games were played to sellout crowds. ...
During a break in Tuesday's Lakers-Clippers' game at the Sports
Arena, the listed answer for a message-board trivia question was
``Elgin Taylor.''

CONTEST FOR MEMORIAL AT BLACK BURIAL GROUND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va., Ga., N.J.)   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the federal building at 290 Broadway was
completed in 1994, one thing was missing: the memorial the
government promised to build marking the 18th-century African
Burial Ground unearthed during the excavation for the building.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the U.S. General Services Administration plans to
announce the five teams of architects, historians and other
professionals who will compete to design and build a
2,000-square-foot Interpretive Center in the building explaining
the historical and cultural significance of the lower Manhattan
site. Each team includes at least one prominent African-American,
though that was not a requirement of the government's request for
proposals, which was issued in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Interpretive Center, which is expected to cost about $1.7
million, will be accompanied by an exterior memorial at the site of
the 415 colonial-era graves, which has been designated a National
Historic Landmark. The GSA is conducting a competition on its
design and is scheduled to announce the finalists in that contest
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The center and the memorial are parts of a $15 million project
that also includes scientific research at Howard University on
skeletal remains to determine the origins and ways of life of those
buried at the site, as well as a public information and education
program. Once the studies at Howard are concluded and the exterior
memorial has been installed, the remains will be returned to the
site and reinterred.
</P>
<P>
   Before awarding the contract for the Interpretive Center next
January, the GSA plans to hold two forums to allow members of the
public to comment on the proposals, details of which were not
released. The forums are scheduled for April 8, one at noon at the
federal building, the other at 6 p.m. at the Mariner's Temple
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The government anticipates opening the Interpretive Center in
the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The teams with some of the principals for this project are:
</P>
<P>
   Design and Production Inc., Lorton, Va., whose team members
include Roberta Washington, an architect; James Oliver Horton, a
historian at George Washington University and director of the
Afro-American Communities Project of the National Museum of
American History, and Theresa Singleton, an anthropology professor
at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Duckett and Associates/H.J. Russell &AMP; Co., Atlanta, with Lee
Baker, a professor of African-American studies and anthropology at
Columbia University; Craig VanDevere, an architect, and Warren
Barbour, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   IDI Construction Co., New York, with A.J. Williams-Myers, a
history professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz;
Jacqueline Hamilton, an architect, and Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Promatech, New York, with William E. Davis Jr., a former member
of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; John K.
Samuels III, an architect, and Gayle T. Tate, chairwoman of the
African studies department at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Studioworks UAI, New York, with Tony Shitemi, an architect;
Margaret Washington, a history professor at Cornell University, and
Baker.

</P>
<P>
   In later life, Menuhin used hearing aids on both ears but
continued to conduct. He had given up playing the violin in his 70s
when his technical ability no longer met his own high standards.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt no desire ``to spend hours working away again at
something which I myself in the past and other people can play far
better than I can now. I don't see the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jewish, he followed no particular creed, calling himself
``an ardent neutral.'' He considered himself neither an optimist
nor a pessimist.
</P>
<P>
   He last visited San Francisco in May 1997, when he was awarded
an honorary degree by San Francisco State University. He used the
occasion to honor his parents. His mother, Marutha cq &LR;   &LR; Menuhin,
had died recently at her home in Los Gatos at the age of 101.
</P>
<P>
   There was some embarrassment in 1996 when no musical institution
in this city had done a single thing to honor Menuhin's 80th
birthday, and the San Francisco State event was seen as a way to
make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   His last performance in the Bay Area was in 1995, when he
conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at Davies Symphony Hall
during the commemoration of the United Nations' 50th anniversary.
He had played the Beethoven Violin Concerto here exactly half a
century earlier to celebrate the signing of the U.N. Charter in the
War Memorial Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a wonderful city, and it's right that it
should have been the host to the first U.N. meeting,'' he said in
an interview with The Chronicle for the 50th anniversary. ``It's
still a city which is basically liberal, basically committed to so
much voluntary action that's good, the soup kitchens, music in the
schools ...'`
</P>
<P>
   The names he was closely associated with throughout his life
form a roster of legendary musicians.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, they included Louis Persinger and Alfred Hertz
of the San Francisco Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, they included Romanian violinist and composer
Georges Enescu and German conductor Fritz Busch and his brother,
violinist Adolf Busch, English composer Edward Elgar and Hungarian
composer Bela Bartok. Violinist Nigel Kennedy was one of his
pupils. He played with sitarist Ravi Shankar and with jazz
violinist Stephane Grappelli.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin left San Francisco at age 10 for Paris, hub of his
international career. He later made his permanent home in England,
where he became a British subject while retaining American
citizenship. He received an honorary knighthood in 1965 and became
a lord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin married Nola Nicholas in 1938. They had a son, Krov, and
a daughter, Zamira. After a 1947 divorce, Menuhin married Diana
Gould, a British ballerina and actress with whom he had two sons,
Gerard and Jeremy.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's pianist sisters, Hephzibah and Yaltah, were born in
San Francisco, as was son Jeremy, also a pianist, who played as
soloist under his father's baton. Hephzibah, his most frequent
recital partner, died in 1981. &QL;

a San Francisco Symphony young people's concert.
</P>
<P>

   While many consumers have worried that Year 2000 computer

law-enforcement officials have been warning that the bigger
financial risks may come from scam artists and thieves playing on
such fears.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, news reports and rumors began emerging of the kind of
problems the authorities had in mind. Frost National Bank in San
Antonio sent a warning to other banks after it learned of an
incident that sounded like the opening gambit of a fraud scheme. A
spokesman for Frost said a man had phoned the bank to report
receiving a call in which he was told it would be necessary to move
his money to a special ``bond'' account as part of the bank's work
to prepare computers for the Year 2000. He was then asked for
personal information, including account numbers, which he declined
to give.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Bankers Association said it had received reports of
similar episodes from several provinces in the last week. And the
Bank Administration Institute, a industry research group in
Chicago, said that a Nebraska bank it declined to identify reported
that an employee at the bank's advertising agency got a call almost
identical to the one received by Frost National's customer.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reports were posted on the Internet, and one such
recounting was picked up and widely circulated last week in
corporate and police e-mail networks. According to that Internet
tale, the unidentified consumer used caller identification to trace
the call to the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother would believe this, so beware,'' urged Judy N.
Gilleland, a Frito-Lay Year 2000 expert, in an e-mail in which she
passed on the Internet posting to all of the snack food giant's
information technology employees.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the reports tell of a consumer falling for the
scam. The reports say the unidentified callers have hung up when
asked which bank they are calling from or for other verification of
their identity. Banking officials say that the general rule _ never
give out personal or account information over the phone to a
stranger who calls you _ holds for Year 2000-related calls.
</P>
<P>
   Other Year 2000 financial scams are also emerging. Barry
Elliott, a detective in charge of the Phonebusters hot line of the
Ontario Provincial Police, which monitors telemarketing scams, said
the hot line had been getting reports from Canadians saying they
had received suspicious calls from people identifying themselves as
agents of Visa International, the credit-card group.
</P>
<P>
   According to these accounts, the supposed Visa agent says that
the card organization needs to confirm credit-card numbers as part
of its Year 2000 work.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said that telemarketers are also apparently trying to
obtain credit-card account numbers by calling with offers of
insurance against false billing or loss of credit-card account
information as a result of the Year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   Visa itself has not received reports of such attempts to gain
access to credit-card numbers, according to Ryan Nicollaset, a Visa
spokesman.

FLEET FINANCIAL TO BUY BANKBOSTON FOR $16 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I.)  (Eds: SUBS lede, overline with companies confirming merger, SUBS
5th graf, The boards ..., to drop that transaction was to be
announced Monday; SUBS 10th graf, ``I think ... to fix Glossman

<P>
   Fleet Financial Group plans to acquire the BankBoston Corp. for
$16 billion in a deal that will create the eighth-largest bank in
the country and the pre-eminent bank in New England, the companies
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank, which is to be based in Boston and will be called
the FleetBoston Corp., will have such a stranglehold on consumer
accounts in states like Massachusetts, according to lawyers
specializing in banking law, that federal antitrust law will
require large sales of bank branches there and elsewhere in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will most likely involve a significant number of
job cuts and layoffs throughout New England, anywhere from 2,500 to
5,000, according to people involved in the deal, though the exact
number of job cuts could not be determined. Fleet and BankBoston
employ about 50,000 people combined.
</P>
<P>
   If shareholders and regulators approve the deal, the merged bank
will still lack the heft necessary to join the ranks of the
nation's new banking titans that have been created by a wave of
mergers. With about $178 billion in assets, the new FleetBoston
will remain a quarter to half the size of Citigroup, BankAmerica
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bank One Corp. That raises the
possibility that the new bank could be involved in another big
merger in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both banks approved the deal after meeting Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The banks renewed discussions about a merger about six weeks
ago. Earlier talks fell apart last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet will exchange 1.1844 of its shares for each BankBoston
share, valuing BankBoston at about $53 a share, or about a 15
percent premium above BankBoston's closing price on Friday of
$46.9375 a share. Shares of Fleet rose 12.5 cents on Friday, to
$44.75. Both issues trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares have been trading well below their 52-week
high of $59.0625 because of investor concern about the bank's heavy
exposure to volatile economies in Brazil and Argentina. BankBoston
executives have repeatedly noted that the bank turned in a record
performance in Latin America last year and that they expect to make
a substantial profit in the region this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a combination with Fleet will further insulate
BankBoston from financial problems related to any economic
downturns in Latin America. Last year, Fleet had operating earnings
of $1.6 billion on revenue of $7.14 billion. BankBoston posted
operating earnings of $792 million on revenue of $4.4 billion in
1998. The merged bank will have about 20 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, execution issues aside, this might be a terrific
deal,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
``They have strengths in divergent areas, and if they combine
correctly they could have significant opportunities to boost
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Murray, the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of
Fleet, is to be chief executive of the merged bank for the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Charles K. Gifford, the 56-year-old chairman and
chief executive of BankBoston, will succeed Murray as chairman of
the merged company.
</P>

<P>
   Fleet, which grew rapidly through a series of mergers from its
original base in Providence, R.I., has 1,200 consumer branches
reaching as far south as New York and is the country's
sixth-largest commercial lender. It is also one of the biggest
mortgage lenders in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet also owns Quick &AMP; Reilly, the nation's third-largest
discount brokerage firm, and provides investment management
services for both individuals and institutional clients, with more
than $74 billion in assets under management. It also own the AFSA
Data Corp., one of the largest processors of student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fleet bought a large credit card portfolio from the
Advanta Corp., but recently sued Advanta, contending that Advanta
overstated the value of that business. Fleet says that Advanta did
not disclose coding errors that resulted in excessive interest
charges of at least $3.9 million, which Fleet had to repay. Advanta
has said that the lawsuit has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's mix of businesses has been criticized by analysts and
advisers as something of a hodgepodge, but the bank has focused
more closely recently on performance and turned in strong results
last year, when many other banks had difficulty meeting earnings
goals. Its credit card and commercial lending businesses did
particularly well last year.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which has a blue-chip, Brahmin lineage, has a
well-regarded management team and has been praised as a friendly,
supportive company for employees, with relatively little turnover
among its work force. It has also established a strong record on
community outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, was a difficult one for BankBoston. It was
buffeted by trading losses, the untimely and expensive acquisition
of the Robertson Stephens investment banking firm and a financial
scandal involving millions of dollars stolen from its private
banking division. The downward pressure on its stock had made the
bank a more vulnerable takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has a charter dating from 1784 and once numbered Paul
Revere among its clients. The bank is an unusual hybrid of
old-fashioned banking, corporate lending and stock underwriting,
married to extensive Latin American operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of BankBoston's profits come from its Latin
American operations; the bulk of the bank's profits, about 67
percent, come from its corporate banking and regional banking
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's consumer banking business has been hobbled by
problems related to the acquisition of Baybanks three years ago, a
situation that Fleet and BankBoston must avoid if they want to
integrate their operations successfully.

   SHANKER BIGHA, India _ This hamlet on the edge of a lush,
palm-fringed field lay quiet on the moonlit night of Jan. 25. But
as the villagers slept, more than 50 upper-caste men, members of an
outlawed landowners' army, crept toward them through rustling
spears of wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The men fanned out in the dirt lanes, flinging open the doors of
mud huts and shouting: ``Kill them! kill them!'' Guns blazing, they
massacred 22 people in just a few minutes, among them a 3-year-old
boy and his baby sister who were crying as they huddled in their
grandmother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   This massacre of farm workers and their families _ untouchables
at the bottom of Hinduism's hierarchical social order _ was
numbingly similar to dozens of others committed over nearly three
decades in the eastern state of Bihar.
</P>
<P>
   The state is blessed by mineral wealth and fertile soil but
cursed by the nation's highest rates of illiteracy and poverty.
Almost nine out of 10 of the state's 100 million people live in the
countryside and more than half are very poor. The untouchables, who
make up 14 percent of the population, are the poorest of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bihar is now in the midst of an upheaval that has seen the
middle castes depose the upper castes from the seats of political
power. The untouchables _ now called Dalits, which means ground
down in Hindi _ have not yet gained an independent political voice,
but they have begun grass-roots organizing.
</P>
<P>
   And as they have banded together under various leftist banners
to agitate, sometimes violently, for higher wages, a share of land
and an end to the sexual exploitation of Dalit women and other
humiliations, both middle- and upper-caste landowners have struck
back with terror tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the American South after the Civil War, the lynchings of
blacks were aimed at curbing their uppitiness,'' said Ashutosh
Varshney, a political scientist at Columbia University. ``India
never had slavery, but the Dalits are as close to slavery as you
can get. The massacres are aimed at checking their uppitiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Successive governments, dominated by the upper and middle
castes, have failed since the 1970s to stop the carnage or to
address the harsh social and economic inequalities between the
landed and the landless that persist in Bihar and in most of north
India. But this time, the massacres got caught up in a power
struggle between the upper and middle castes.
</P>
<P>
   The blood letting here in Shanker Bigha and another massacre of
12 untouchables on Feb. 11 in the village of Narayanpur set off a
crisis that rocked the state's political establishment, humbled the
national governing coalition and, for a time, riveted public
attention on the violence that has raged here like an intermittent
fever.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which draws most
of its support in Bihar from the upper castes and which leads the
national coalition government, maintained that the massacres
justified its dismissal of the middle-caste state government,
widely seen as corrupt and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   But even after central rule was imposed last month, the violence
continued. Retaliating for the massacres of untouchables, a squad
of leftist militants gunned down seven people on Feb. 14,
apparently for no reason except their upper-caste status, human
rights workers said. Four more upper-caste men were slain on March
2.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they arrested 47 members of the landowners' militia,
the Ranvir Sena, for involvement in the two massacres, as well as
dozens of members of leftist groups. Human rights groups say the
police, dominated by upper castes, have in the past cracked down
much harder on the leftists than on the landowners' armies.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, the central government, unable to get its takeover
of Bihar ratified in Parliament, took the humiliating step of
reinstating the dismissed state officials.
</P>
<P>
   While political intrigues have swirled in New Delhi and the
state capital of Patna, the mourning has continued in Shanker
Bigha, an isolated hamlet of 300 to 400 Dalits.
</P>
<P>
   The village has no electricity, no phone, no school, no clock,
no car, no scooter and no health clinic. The villagers are
illiterate, and their children go to work in the fields at a young
age. When asked how old they are, the men and women, their faces
weathered and prematurely aged, look blank. They do not know.
</P>
<P>
   There is no road leading into Shanker Bigha, only a dirt pathway
through a glorious, rippling field of wheat, the same one used by
members of the Ranvir Sena. Itwaria Devi saw her son, who was about
20, gunned down as he reached the door of her hut to warn her of
the danger. The husband of Pyari Thakur was fatally shot in a lane
as he rushed to her from the men's sleeping quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sona Dhari, a young mother whose eyes are pits of sorrow, had
left her mud hut to go to the bathroom just before the armed men
arrived. She told her husband, who was in the men's quarters, to
come keep an eye on their 3-year-old son and 9-month-old daughter.
By the time he got there, gunfire and screams echoed through the
lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children started weeping, so I gave them to my mother,''
said Raj Kumar Paswan, who hid himself while his mother and
children cowered on their straw pallet.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife made it back to the tiny, windowless hut, she
fainted at the sight that confronted her: the bodies of her
mother-in-law, toddler son and baby girl torn apart by bullets and
sprawled akimbo on the blood-soaked pallet.
</P>
<P>
   Once the killing was finished, the men shouted, ``Long live
Ranvir Sena!'' Then with three sharp whistles, they melted away
into the field.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no reason why Shanker Bigha was singled out
for attack, other than its identity as a Dalit settlement. Police
and the villagers say there was no dispute between the landowners
and the farm workers who labor in the fields for 50 cents a day,
less than the widely ignored state minimum wage of almost $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it difficult to fill our stomachs,'' said Paswan, a
slender young man in a loincloth and tank top. ``But we were always
afraid we'd lose our jobs, so we never raised our voices.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   None of the leftist groups organizing Dalit farm workers in
central Bihar had ever visited the hamlet before the massacre,
though they have come since. Most of the villagers said they have
never voted. The survivors of the massacre say they recognized some
of the killers as familiar residents of Dhobi Bigha, an upper-caste
village within plain sight of Shanker Bigha, just on the other side
of the wheat field.
</P>
<P>
   Dhobi Bigha is filled with sturdy brick houses inhabited by
landowners from the Bhumihar caste, which makes up 3 percent of the
state's population. Residents said the village solidly supports the
Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   By Western standards, Dhobi Bigha's residents are far from
wealthy. Bhumihar landowners in central Bihar own from two to 50
acres of land. But by Bihar's standards, they are the rural elite.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk, Shrikant Singh and Kameshwar Singh, Bhumihar
landowners, stood talking next to a towering haystack. Both men
have sons charged with taking part in the massacre _ charges the
fathers deny.
</P>
<P>
   Dhobi Bigha itself was deserted. The men said the other
residents had fled, fearing more arrests.
</P>
<P>
   After India gained its independence from the British in 1947,
land reform was supposed to bring justice to farmers who had been
exploited for hundreds of years by the colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   Like states across India, Bihar in the 1950s abolished a system
that had operated through absentee landlords known as zamindars.
The British had given the zamindars land, and in return the
zamindars had leased the land to farmers and paid revenues to the
colonial power.
</P>
<P>
   After the reforms, land was distributed to people from upper and
middle castes who had been tenants of the zamindars. But the Dalits
got virtually nothing. They were pariahs so politically powerless
they were unable to assert their right to a share, said Anand
Chakravarti, a sociologist at Delhi University.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalits continued sowing and weeding and harvesting,
providing cheap, pliant labor for the landowning castes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, leftist radicals began organizing the Dalits
to strike against certain landowners and enforced blockades on
their land to prevent them from cultivating crops, often with
threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The landowners responded with violence. The massacres of Dalits
date back to 1971, researchers say. And by 1979, various landowning
castes were organizing private armies of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranvir Sena is only the most recent of the armies. It was
founded in 1994 in the Bhumihar village of Belaur in central Bihar
and has since committed numerous massacres. The worst was in
Laxmanpur-Bathe, where its members killed 61 Dalits on Dec. 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shivanand Tiwary, a maverick Brahmin in the state assembly who
represents a district that is a Ranvir Sena stronghold, said he
sympathizes with both the oppressed Dalits and the landowners. He
understands that the Dalits want to be treated like human beings,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't approve of the way the Ravir Sena takes revenge,''
he said. ``This is a sick mind approach. But what would anybody do?
Those with small holdings are forced to leave their fields without
crops for several years and that is their only source of income.
What will they do?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Sitting under stirring photographs of the young Mao
Tse-tung, Chen Jinfei relaxes in the plush 35th-floor offices of
his billion dollar corporation and reflects on the love-hate
relationship between China's Communist government and private
businessmen like himself, who have helped pushed China's economy
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private entrepreneurs run counter to the ultimate aim of the
party _ which is to eliminate the exploitation of man by man,'' he
says, adding with a grin: ``But I think there's a tension here
between ideology and reality in our changing society. And I don't
expect I'll be eliminated any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, China's Parliament will tip its hat to the new
entrepreneurs, amending its constitution to declare private
business ``an important component of the socialist market
economy.'' The Parliament will also pass an amendment incorporating
the rule of law into the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   To Western ears, the official elevation of the private sector
sounds like a declaration of the obvious. But to China's
fast-growing business class, the change brings a new sense of
legitimacy and protection in a country where businessmen still
often face significant political, economic and social
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only now will we have any political and personal status,''
said Chen, chairman of the Beijing Tong Chan Investment Group, who
has lobbied for the change.
</P>
<P>
   At a practical level, businessmen say the change could help end
a vast array of discriminatory business practices that make it hard
for them to buy land, for example, or get loans. They hope too that
it will at least indirectly safeguard their property rights _ a
looming fear in a country that nationalized all business less than
40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the official recognition will give us better
opportunities and more space to develop,'' said Zhang Lifan, whose
company designs computer networks. ``As a businessman and as an
individual, I appreciate the amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Zhang, son of a famous Shanghai businessman who was
demonized by Mao, is a living testament to how much things have
changed. His father, Zhang Naiqi, served as a government minister
in the very early years of the Communist republic, but was later
dismissed by Mao and lived in poverty until his death 20 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, the family
home was ransacked and later confiscated by Red Guards. The father
was tortured. ``I had a very unhappy childhood, discriminated
against by teachers and students,'' Zhang Lifan now recalls, at his
office's polished conference table in an elegant
turn-of-the-century building.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, businessmen here have made vast inroads in the last
10 years. They have even started moving into the fringes of
official politics.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 36, is a member of China's People's Political Consultative
Congress, an advisory body, as well as a representative to the
Beijing National People's Congress, the city's main governing body.
But in the whole country there are still only 64 private
businessmen on such high-level political bodies, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 1988 change in the constitution had already upgraded the
status of businessmen somewhat. The 1954 constitution said that
capitalists must be ``used, restricted and taught,'' which was
later changed to ``guided, supervised and managed.''
</P>
<P>
   But businessmen are forever kept out of the country's most
exclusive political club, the Chinese Communist Party, and they
lack the contacts that membership confers. Party members who go
into business are supposed to renounce membership and ``private
entrepreneurs are fully aware that they should not even apply,''
said Chen, whose company is involved in real estate, building
materials and restaurants, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   And while much admired by today's college students, private
businessmen are still looked down upon and despised by many
Chinese. Said Zhang: ``Westerners say, `God helps those who help
themselves,' and work hard to get rich. But many Chinese still have
a more revolutionary idea and want to kill rich people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But China's businessmen today care less about status than the
impediments that a society laced with communist ideology throws
their way.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen say they have a hard time getting loans from
state-owned banks, while public enterprises are generously funded.
Private companies are banned from many sectors, including real
estate and telecommunications, although entrepreneurs often gain
access by partnering with state companies.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman add that, in practice, factory managers and
local governments often balk at buying goods or services from the
private sector for fear they will be criticized for not supporting
the state. And, until last month, private businesses were totally
forbidden from exporting their products, but had to sell them to
government trading companies for export. China now allows 64
companies to export on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work a lot harder than the state-owned enterprises
to survive,'' said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitutional amendment does not specifically address
any of these practices, nor does it specifically protect private
property _ a change many entrepreneurs had hoped for. Still, many
businessman say it has laid a good foundation for such change, and
they now feel more secure doing their capitalist work in a
socialist world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of businessmen have acquired status as a resident of
a foreign country, just in case there's a rustle here,'' said Chen,
whose company has offices in Paris and New York. ``I haven't. I
think I can have a good relationship with the government and can
handle things here.''
</P>
<P>
   But all this talk seems rarefied and theoretical to people like
Zhou Dashan, a more ordinary Chinese businessman, who owns a small
shop selling lamb, snacks and sundries in an alley in west Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou, a wrinkled man with a blue Mao cap and an fake IZOD
windbreaker, has been in the trade since 1981, when he took early
retirement from a factory job he'd had for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is glad for the change in the constitution, of
course. ``The change is very good. Why, when I first started we
didn't dare speak out about anything since we were told to `cut the
capitalist tail.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he, like many small businessmen, has more immediate
concerns: taxes, too much competition on a street now lined with
indistinguishable stalls, and a local crime wave that has forced
him to sleep on his store's chopping board to guard against
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   And he worries that the new constitution will not change the
behavior of some neighborhood officials, who disparage local
shopkeepers and insist on taking food for free. ``Of course we
support this amendment,'' he said. ``But however big the leaders'
hands, they can't reach every corner.''

PRISON POPULATION REACHES RECORD 1.8 MILLION, REPORT SAYS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of inmates in the nation's jails and prisons rose
again last year, to a record 1.8 million, though crime rates have
dropped for seven straight years, the Justice Department reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans behind bars increased 76,700, or 4.4
percent, well below the average annual increase of 7.3 percent
between 1985 and 1998, suggesting that the dramatic growth in
incarceration has at least begun to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1.8 million total means that the incarceration rate has
more than doubled since 1985, to 668 inmates per 100,000 residents
in 1998, from 313 per 100,000 in 1985, according to the Justice
Department. And the total inmate population is almost six times the
figure of 330,000 in 1972, before the prison boom started.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a
branch of the Justice Department, and was based on the number of
inmates on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists and law-enforcement officials generally agree
that the substantial growth in the number of inmates has helped
reduce crime, at least by keeping more violent criminals off the
street. But they believe it is difficult, if not impossible, to
measure that impact precisely. There is growing concern that the
prison boom has taken on a life of its own, with a built-in dynamic
that will keep the inmate population growing for years even if
crime continues to fall, forcing cities and states to divert scarce
resources to building ever more jails and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study of the factors in the continued expansion of the
number of prison inmates, Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at
Carnegie Mellon University, and Allen J. Beck, a prison specialist
at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, calculated that 40 percent of
the growth was attributable to increases in the number of people
actually sent to prison per arrest and 60 percent to longer time
served by inmates. The study is to be published this year by the
University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein said the increase in commitments to prison per arrest
was the result of tougher attitudes toward criminals by both
prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   The longer time served by inmates, Blumstein said, is the result
of several things: tougher sentencing laws, longer sentences,
greater reluctance by parole boards to grant early release and the
increased likelihood that once prisoners are released they will be
re-arrested for parole violations, often technical violations like
failing a urine test for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the increase in the number of inmates is the outcome
of better police work, making more arrests per crime, or a growth
in the number of criminals being sent to prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional factor driving the number of inmates up even as
crime seems to fall, Blumstein said, is that drug arrests are not
counted as part of the national crime rate reported by the FBI.
That rate includes the violent crimes of murder, robbery, rape and
assault and the property crimes of burglary, larceny and automobile
theft.
</P>
<P>
   But drug offenses accounted for the greatest share of the
increase _ 29 percent _ in state prisoners of any single crime from
1980 to 1996. By comparison, the crime that produced the next
largest increase in state inmates was rape, 11 percent, and then
murder and assault, each at 10 percent. But all the violent crimes
together were responsible for 43 percent of the growth in state
imprisonment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new Justice Department report found that there were
1,277,866 inmates in state and federal prisons last year, an
increase of 4.8 percent from a year earlier, and 592,462 people in
local city and county jails, a rise of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were wide regional variations in imprisonment, as in
crime, with the Southern states generally having the highest rates,
and the states in northern New England and the northern Midwest
having the lowest. Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate,
709 inmates per 100,000, followed by Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi
and South Carolina. Minnesota had the lowest rate, 117 inmates per
100,000, followed by Maine, North Dakota, Vermont and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks made up 41.2 percent of the jail inmates in 1998, almost
identical to the share by whites, 41.3 percent, the report said.
But relative to their proportion of the population, blacks were six
times more likely than whites to be held in jail, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women in state and federal prisons in 1998 rose
5.6 percent over 1997, compared with a 4.7 rise in the number of
men in prison. But women still accounted for only 6.4 percent of
the total of prisoners nationwide in 1998.

 &HT;    Duke by 41 _ again
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C._ After watching his team lose by 41 points and
being helpless to stop it, Tulsa coach Bill Self was asked if he
had seen anybody who could beat No. 1 Duke.
</P>
<P>
   He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indiana Pacers,'' he said. Another pause. ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (34-1) used a 30-5 burst in the middle of the first half
and went on to thoroughly destroy the Golden Hurricane from the
Western Athletic Conference 97-56 in the second round of the NCAA
East Regional. But the Blue Devils' second consecutive 41-point
victory in the tournament still did not convey the degree of
dominance they displayed at the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better than advertised,'' Self said. ``And we thought
they were great coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke advances to the regional semifinals Friday in East
Rutherford, N.J., to play 12th seed Southwest Missouri State, which
beat Tennessee in Sunday's second game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, who beat Florida A&AMP;M 99-58 in Friday's first
round, became the first team in NCAA history to win consecutive
games in the tournament by 40 or more points. The victory continued
a string of dominating performances for Duke, which extended its
school-record winning streak to 29 games. Since an eight-point
triumph at Georgia Tech on Feb. 6, Duke has won its past 11 games
by an average of 31.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made up our minds that we were going to play every
possession today like it was 0-0,'' said Augusta's William Avery,
who scored a team-high 19 points for Duke. ``And that's exactly
what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke welcomed the return of guard Trajan Langdon, who had missed
the past three games with a foot injury. With Langdon back, coach
Mike Krzyzewski had enough players to really turn his defense
loose. As a result, the Blue Devils held Tulsa to 33.9 percent
shooting (20 of 59) and forced 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The hyped matchup between Duke center Elton Brand and Tulsa's
Michael Ruffin, the school's career leader in rebounding and
blocked shots, never materialized. Ruffin had eight rebounds but
was held scoreless. Brand had 17 points and six rebounds in only 23
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Elton's defense today was the best he's played all
year,'' said Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (23-10), which ended a 25-game winning streak by the
College of Charleston in Friday's first round, trailed 9-8 at the
first TV timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a few well-chosen words by Krzyzewski, Duke kicked
its game into high gear. The Blue Devils blitzed the Golden
Hurricanes for 13 consecutive points and led by 30 at halftime. The
lead grew to as much as 42 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys were ready to play, and we were convinced we could
get to the second half and hang with them,'' Self said. ``But once
the dam burst, there was nothing we could do.''

 &HT;    Holyfield vows to return
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The face looked familiar. It was the look of a former
champion who had just had his face drilled repeatedly by the crisp
jab of a young contender named Riddick Bowe in 1992, a look that
told many this warring heavyweight had fought one too many wars and
should consider a new past-time _ like gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield knew the look. After taking one shot after
another to his face from Lennox Lewis, leaving massive welts on his
forehead and by his left eye, he knew he hadn't looked this bad
after a fight since losing the unified heavyweight championship to
Bowe. Only Saturday night against Lewis, he lost everywhere but on
the scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I did after the Bowe fight _ I came back,''
Holyfield said after being the recipient of a fortunate draw with
Lewis before 21,000 booing fans at Madison Square Garden. ``I'm not
a quitter and I'm not ashamed of my face. I still believe I was
supposed to get him in three rounds. Unfortunately I didn't. But
that doesn't mean I don't get him in three next time.''
</P>
<P>
   So that should take care of the retirement question.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who looked every bit of 36, admitted going into the
fight that he ``had no Plan B,'' and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   He had vowed a third-round knockout over the larger, younger
Lewis, believinghe could get past the Brit's perceived mediocre
jab, then unleash an avalanche of body punches and uppercuts to
make it a short night and unify the three title belts.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis didn't cooperate. He had a career night as a boxer,
consistently punishing Holyfield with the jab. Holyfield said leg
cramps plagued him and prevented him from ducking inside the jab
quicker. When Holyfield leaned against the ropes and covered his
head, hoping to get Lewis to charge in so he could nail him with
counter shots, Lewis didn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to fall for any sucker,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said Lewis ``gave up his power
to use his savvy. He refused to gamble. He was always a step ahead
of Evander where he could move out of the way when Evander got
close to him. He fought a lot different than I thought he would.''
</P>
<P>
   After showing little respect for Lewis in the weeks leading up
to the fight, Holyfield said afterward, ``The man sure is smart. I
was thinking if I can't get him out of there, let him come in here
with those lumberjack uppercuts. But I didn't have no springs in my
legs. But I don't take nothing away from a man's victory.''
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as Holyfield came to conceding defeat. But he
somehow won on the card of one judge, 115-113, and was even on
another 115-115. Lewis won on the other 116-113. Lewis won the 12th
round on the cards of all three. If he hadn't, Holyfield would have
won an even more unpopular decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said, ``I was robbed.'' His trainer, Emanuel Steward,
said, ``This is what's killing boxing,'' and called Holyfield a $20
million ``sparring partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said only, ``I fight, I don't judge fights,'' adding,
``I don't feel beaten. I feel bruised up.'' Don Turner, his
trainer, knew Holyfield was in trouble late and told him before the
eighth round, ``You've got to win the rest of the rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The ego took the biggest shot, particularly with the ill-fated
third-round prediction. Holyfield would not second-guess himself on
that, except to say, ``I was wrong,'' in his forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Before the round, Holyfield told Turner, ``This is it. This is
the round I'm gonna get him.'' So did it deflate him when Lewis was
still standing three minutes later?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spent a little bit,'' he said. ``But I've been wrong
about myself a lot of times. I just thought, `Maybe it ain't
coming. Maybe I'm supposed to get him on another day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could not resist taking a shot in the post-fight news
conference, saying to Holyfield, ``Where was that third round?''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield responded, ``When we fight again, I've got another
chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his face swollen and his stiff lower back being massaged by
a camp member, Holyfield already was looking ahead to the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great day. My day wasn't too great,'' he said. ``I'm
just waiting on my great day. It's coming.''

 &HT;    Hustled by unanimous decision
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What was advertised to be the ``undisputed,
unadulterated, unmitigated heavyweight championship of the world''
_ Don King's very own blather _ of course fell immediately into a
swamp of dispute, adulteration and mitigation. Just when it seemed
that boxing had run out of cons, it pulled one of its biggest
stings yet.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted a unified title. A little bait and switch and,
presto, you get the same old unfinished puzzle, with the piece that
always goes missing.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but wait until Holyfield-Lewis II. That will set everything
right. Start searching the couch cushions and cutting back on the
kids' lunch money now for that next $49.95 pay-per-view show.
Really. Honest. Trust them.
</P>
<P>
   I think King waited until after the three ringside judges handed
in their strange draw Saturday night to begin his braying for an
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis rematch. Although I can't be sure of
the timing, one promotion running so directly into the next.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is the smell of something rotten, there is King. He
stood up straight and proud at the news conference following
Saturday night's charade, with a wide, satisfied smile.
Unapologetic. Unashamed. Here clearly was the man determined to
keep his grip on the heavyweight division and Holyfield a part of
it well past the point of a dignified retirement. ``No, we're not
going to let anybody get away with this. The question still hounds
us, who is the best? We've got to resolve this thing,'' King
spewed.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone did seem to know who was the best Saturday night,
except two of three judges. Lewis won the fight, completely keeping
Holyfield at jab's length. Punch stats are not always reliable, but
it must mean something when one man is purported to have landed 218
more punches than another. Only try to make sense of the judges'
cards if you are also capable of reading ``Alice in Wonderland''
backward.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was the decision? One member of O.J. Simpson's defense
team, Robert Shapiro, was overheard leaving Madison Square Garden
complaining about the verdict's blindness.
</P>
<P>
   It was up to Lewis's trainer, Emanuel Steward, to speak the
truest words of the night. ``I can't laugh about this,'' he said.
``People paid a lot of money for this fight. It was supposed to be
a heavyweight unification bout in Madison Square Garden. You can't
just say, `That's boxing.' That's disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   He also went on to call for federal regulation of the sport. But
this activity is beneath even government. As much as it pains me to
say, there is no cure for boxing short of ignoring it to death.
Sooner or later, won't it have to run out of sheep to shear?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will be OK. He'll enjoy the role of wronged champion while
awaiting another big payday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Holyfield, his association with King has taken another
sorry turn. Wrongly, his boxing reputation will be smudged. He'll
be marked by the suspicious draw long after the swelling has
subsided. It is impossible to be near the electric-haired promoter
without getting some of him on you.
</P>
<P>
   And when you hear Holyfield answer a question about how many
fights he has left with a quick ``as many as it takes to unify the
title,'' you know King has set the hook.
</P>
<P>
   This fight wasn't even good enough to demand a rematch. What
really is called for after an event like Saturday's is a good, long
shower.

 &HT;    Owners leaning toward L.A. expansion
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Apparently more interested in the rash of upsets at
the NCAA Tournament than in league affairs, NFL owners spent more
time huddled in front of television sets here Sunday than in
committee sessions. The result, as the NFL commences its annual
meetings this morning, is an agenda that on some key issues is
mired by inertia.
</P>
<P>
   The Expansion Committee adjourned early Sunday without
recommending a site for the league's 32nd franchise, but the owners
are expected to announce before the end of the week they have
selected Los Angeles over Houston, to begin play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious we're leaning that way,'' Dallas owner Jerry
Jones said. Added New York Giants owner Wellington Mara: ``Nothing
against (Houston), but they have a lot more TVs in Los Angeles and
that's a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But the return to a city abandoned by two NFL franchises this
decade, and where TV ratings have improved dramatically since the
Rams and Raiders exited the nation's second-largest market, will
come with stipulations. It is expected Los Angeles will face strict
deadlines on the sale of season tickets and luxury suites and must
come up with a viable plan to finance a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Those deadlines almost certainly will come before Jan. 31, 2000,
the date when the city of Houston likely will redirect public funds
set aside for a new stadium there. A few owners said Sunday they
remain skeptical Los Angeles will be able to meet the deadlines.
Jones agreed the optimum scenario would be for both cities to get
teams, but said that could be accomplished only be relocating an
existing team.
</P>
<P>
   League vice president Joe Browne acknowledged a city will be
selected but ``not necessarily a (stadium) site or owner'' by the
time the meetings adjourn Thursday. ``It's too big a battle right
now to get it all done. There are plenty of issues to address.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably means a bid process similar to one used with the
Cleveland Browns, who fetched a $530 million price tag. The size of
the Los Angeles market, several owners claim, could push the
franchise fee to $1 billion. Former Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz
and real estate mogul Ed Roski, the part owner of the NHL's Los
Angeles Kings, are bidding for the Los Angeles franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Bob McNair has guaranteed sellouts if the
league grants him the franchise and, along with public funding, has
some supporters among the owners. ``They are more ready right now
(in Houston),'' San Diego owner Alex Spanos said. ``Unlike the
people in Los Angeles, they didn't lose a team because of lack of
support. They had the team taken away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Finance Committee met into the evening Sunday on the
status of potential Washington Redskins owner Howard Milstein.
While there were reports of progress, the sale remains in jeopardy
while Milstein continues to rework loans of $400 million. ... Kerry

 &HT;    IOC meets this week with world watching
 &HT;    (Eds: Today means Monday.)
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee
begins meeting today to confront the Salt Lake City bid scandal,
what may be the most threatening crisis in the organization's
105-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's executive board today will set the stage for the
IOC's special emergency session called to address the Salt Lake
City bid crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The full session begins Wednesday with a scheduled vote of
confidence for IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has become
a lightning rod for criticism directed at the committee over the
scandal. Members here are expressing little doubt that Samaranch
will have overwhelming support from the committee of about 100
members from around the world. Nevertheless, the fight over the
expulsions could get nasty with some IOC members expressing concern
that some high-profile members implicated in the scandal have been
issued only warnings by the special inquiry commission while other
members with lower profiles were recommended for expulsion. A
two-thirds vote is needed to expell the accused members.
</P>
<P>
   Six members face losing their positions, but two of the most
influential members _ Un-Yong Kim of South Korea and Phil Coles of
Australia _ were let off Friday with warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the list of IOC members recommended for
expulsion, Paul Wallwork of Samoa, told reporters in New Zealand on
Sunday that he questioned whether inquiry commission chaired by
Canadian IOC member Dick Pound had applied a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Wallwork compared his situation to that of Coles, who has been
involved in Sydney's preparations for the 2000 Games. ``Of course,
he comes from a major country with a city organizing the Olympic
Games for next year,'' Wallwork said. ``How can you possibly remove
a person like that? To clear some people and penalise others, I
find that inexplicable in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallwork was named in a Salt Lake City ethics report last month
that said his wife borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief
Tom Welch. The report said the money, withdrawn by Welch from his
children's trust fund, was repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Coles had been cited by Salt Lake City's independent ethics
panel for accepting about $60,000 in travel to the Super Bowl and
ski resorts. Coles denied he did anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another IOC member facing expulsion, Jean-Claud Ganga of the
Congo, told a London newspaper that he will fight when the full
session votes. ``If I am punished then I am a scapegoat,'' Ganga
said. ``There's been such a hullabaloo that some heads have to
roll. The IOC members are saying to themselves: How are we going to
resolve this before the international press? It's a show trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said Sunday that he had not yet had a chance to review the
commission's report so he declined to comment to it. ``I didn't
take money,'' Kim said. ``I didn't get any benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised questions about the propriety of the IOC's
investigating the allegations itself rather than seeking an
indepedent investigation. Rather than receiving preferrential
treatment because of his position, Kim said he was scrutinized even
more closely. ``I believe that 120 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that the press and other IOC critics have
failed to adequately distinguish between innocent gift-giving in
friendship and more onerous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should separate outright corruption, bribes, cash payments
from human relations, humanitarian relations and business relations
or else we can't function,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim allegedly used his Olympic position to help land profitable
positions in telecommunications and music for his children,
according to the IOC's Jan. 24 report and findings released Feb. 9
by the Salt Lake panel.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda this week at the unprecedented session will
be reforming the Olympic host selection procedure, establishing an
ethics commission comprising mainly IOC outsiders, and implementing
a mechanism for further sweeping IOC reforms. The IOC is expected
to call a special session in December to address the bidding
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for the meeting are very high. In a letter to IOC
members sent last week, Samaranch described the session as pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess that I consider the coming extraordinary
session one of the most important in our history, and the most
important of my presidency,'' wrote Samaranch, who has been in
power since 1980. ''Our duty requires that we take concrete
decisions, in some cases painful ones, for the whole world will be
observing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most interested observers of the events here will be
corporate sponsors, who spend tens of millions of dollars to
associate their products with the Olympic rings, which have been
tarnished by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Deutsch, spokesman for the Coca-Cola Co., the oldest and
most influential sponsor, said his company would be watching
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectation is that the IOC will recommend and vote
through significant reform regarding their membership and the host
city selection process,'' he said. ``If they do that, the IOC can
take a critical step toward correcting the past and protecting the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch called Coca-Cola Chairman Doug Ivester last week to
reassure him. ``They've committed to us they are going to take
significant action and we expect them to do that,'' Deutsch said.

 &HT;    TV REVIEW: Scheduling will hurt 'Payne,' remake of 'Fawlty
Towers'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Payne.'' 9:30 tonight (Monday) on CBS (94080).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   As part of the television industry's ongoing public service
campaign to make finding a show as difficult as possible, CBS wil
debut the new sitcom ``Payne'' at 9:30 tonight. On Wednesday it
moves to 8:30 p.m. for one airing. Then the following week it moves
back to 8 p.m. Wednesdays for the rest of its short run.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a royal pain.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly who we're talking about _ Royal Payne, the
aptly, if obviously, named lead character played by John
Larroquette. Owner of a small inn, Payne is cheap, manipulative,
oily, greedy, bumbling and sarcastic. He is a lot like Basil
Fawlty, only not as funny.
</P>
<P>
   Fawlty, of course, was the John Cleese character in the '70s
British comedy ``Fawlty Towers,'' which will be re-run sporadically
but in perpetuity as long as there are public television stations
with time to fill. Larroquette and his co-producers know it takes
massive audacity to remake one of the funniest shows ever done, but
apparently they figure if they can even make it about 25 percent as
funny as ``Fawlty Towers,'' it will be better than most of the
sitcoms that make it to TV. And what do you know, they hit their
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Americanized version feels both familiar to ``Fawlty'' fans,
and different. Payne has a bitter wife (JoBeth Williams, answering
``whatever happened to...'') to rail at; a dim bellboy of
indeterminate foreign origin to cuff around; and a pretty maid who
doesn't get much airtime.
</P>
<P>
   There's much here that's as well-worn as a doormat, but also
some very festive bits. In tonight's pilot, a premise that's older
than ``The Honeymooners'' (Payne forgets wedding anniversary,
scrambles and cuts corners with last-minute present, gets into even
deeper trouble) degenerates into a lively, frenetic farce. The next
couple of episodes never quite match that, but still have some good
lines, such as the elderly patient who doesn't have glaucoma yet,
but is taking medicial marijuana ``as a preventative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne'' is a legitimate remake of ``Fawlty:'' money changed
hands, Cleese was consulted, etc. But Larroquette, despite four
Emmys for his work on ``Night Court,'' is too bland. Cleese was so
awkward and oblivious to basic human decency that you didn't know
whether to hug him or wish him dead. Larroquette's Payne is just a
big ol' lug, a little nastier than most sitcom leads, but not
anyone to make you squirm. You just never really feel his Payne.

 &HT;    Leger, Valentino wrap up previews for fall/winter
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A month's worth of fall/winter fashion previews that
started in New York and moved to Europe came to a close over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last designers showing their cold-weather collections
were two, Herve Leger and Valentino, who specialize in clothes for
the dressiest of occasions. Both made brief forays into the
sportswear and careerwear realms _ a lady needs something to wear
during the day, n'est ce pas? _ but the bulk of their collections
revolved around eveningwear themes.
</P>
<P>
   Leger's preview began with long black dresses with large,
chevron-shaped slashes that revealed cream, red or green
underskirts. From there, he moved to a revised take on
color-blocking: coats, dresses and suits in varying-sized panels of
red, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't long before Leger launched into his signature
look: form-fitting apparel made from strips of leather, wool crepe,
silk, jersey and organza. His most noteworthy pieces were short,
sleeveless gowns that looked as if they were made of spun sugar,
angel hair pasta, cotton candy and dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   In his preview, Valentino made bold statements in favor of
beading, embroidery, dainty lace and brocades. His designs drew
attention to the waistline, the back and the leg.
</P>
<P>
   The show began with clingy cashmere sweaters and snug, silk
``jeans'' with bold top-stitching. Valentino's satin jackets were
trim-fitting and cropped at the waist, and his cashmere overcoats
included beautiful brocade linings.
</P>
<P>
   The only segment of the show that seemed of improbable
marketability featured silky tap pants with lace edging worn over
leggings. Valentino made up for that by showing a range of silk,
satin and leather skirts that featured beaded or embroidered belts.
</P>
<P>
   Using shades of pale pink, gray, blue, tobacco brown and
``acid'' green, Valentino's eveningwear segment began with a
selection of long, loose pleated skirts paired with tight,
sleeveless tops and tunics.
</P>
<P>
   The Leger and Valentino shows made summary statements for the
monthlong series of fall/winter collections. For now, at least, the
age of minimalism is over. Decorative dressing represents fashion's
next wave.

PUBLISHERS OF PAPERBACKS ARE FACING SLIDING SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the lowly and cheap paperback tucked on a
drugstore rack was lavished with high praise, ranked in the
revolutionary stratosphere with the advent of the Pill, or at the
very least, air conditioning or color television.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers gleefully described the 1939 introduction of
paperbacks as a revolution. And students of the late 1950s and
early 1960s were labeled ``the paperback generation'' _ a baby boom
of masses raised on Dr. Spock's ``The Pocket Book of Baby and Child
Care'' and inspired by copies of ``Catcher in the Rye'' that seemed
engineered to fit in bluejeans pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But today there is less room in those pockets or, perhaps, some
top publishers speculate, the aging eyes of that generation are
growing a little dim for the printed type in the purse-sized,
mass-market paperbacks, which were once promoted as ``good reading
for the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the number of mass-market paperbacks sold in the
United States has declined by almost 9 percent, falling to 484
million copies last year, about three times the percentage loss in
consumer books overall. And the immediate future offers little
comfort; the book industry's research arm, the Book Industry Study
Group, is projecting continued slight annual declines for the
paperback market over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   With the average price of a paperback climbing toward $7, the
$1.5 billion market for the portable books remains profitable, but
it has been losing an increasing share of the market to discounted
hardcovers, which chains and independent bookstores generally
prefer to stock along with quality trade paperbacks, which are
larger and more expensive than ordinary mass-market paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The paperback has also been buffeted by other forces _ the
consolidation of the wholesale jobbers who stocked mass-market
paperbacks in the United States' supermarkets and drugstores;
sagging public interest in such genres as westerns; the general
aging of the industry's biggest group of customers, and the
declining popularity of mall stores that attracted more impulse
buyers than superstores.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are enough speculative, unproved theories in the
publishing industry to pack a paperback chapter. Are people
devoting less time to casual recreational reading and more to books
offering professional enrichment? Are people simply reading less?
Or are they getting their reading fix from audio-book tapes or the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a business that hit a wall; it's still a business,
but no one can figure out how to make it grow,'' said Jack Romanos,
the president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, which owns Pocket Books, the
paperback publishing house that started the business in 1939 with
the experimental publication of ``The Good Earth'' and ``Wuthering
Heights.'' ``Culturally, we should care, because I believe that the
paperback is the logical entry into the reading place.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the ubiquitous 4\-by-7-inch mass-market paperback
has slipped from 39 percent of book purchases in the United States
to 36 percent in 1997, according to the most recent report from the
Consumer Research Study on Book Purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hardcover sales, while generally sluggish, rose to 31
percent of the market from 28 percent. The same survey noted
declines in paperback sales in outlets ranging from supermarkets
and drugstores to warehouse clubs and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with that climate, paperback publishers have taken a
variety of approaches, starting with the occupants of the top
executive suites.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two months, Gina Centrello, the president of
Pocket Books, departed after 16 years with the company and
reappeared as the new head of a rival paperback publishing house,
Ballantine. Soon after, Pocket Books announced the hiring of its
new president and publisher, a top executive from Ballantine,
Judith Curr, who will be taking over a unit where mass-market
paperback revenues were down last year by more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some paperback publishers have responded to reduced demand by
trimming the number of titles that they offer and shipping copies
more cautiously than in the halcyon days of paperback publishing,
when shipments of a book like Jacqueline Susann's ``Valley of the
Dolls'' could reach 15 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   With the lone exception of the best-selling author John Grisham,
marquee authors today are generally more likely to sell in the
range of 1 million to 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes some publishers wistful for the volume that was.
``I do think these changes have had an effect,'' said Esther
Margolis, the publisher of Newmarket Press and Ms. Susann's former
publicity representative, who believes that people were clearly
reading more then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paperbacks were available, instantly available. If the covers
were enticing, people who had never read books before read them.
They weren't intimidating. They were little books that had pretty
little covers and they were inexpensive and you could throw them
away. It demystified the book for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Avon Books, a paperback publisher owned by Hearst Corp., is
shipping 25 percent fewer copies of paperbacks than it did five
years ago, while at the same time it has reduced the number of
titles it publishes by 10 percent to about 300 a year, Avon's
publisher, Lou Aronica, said.
</P>
<P>
   Other paperback publishers like Pocket Books and Warner Books
have also cut back on the paperback titles they offer. Some have
tinkered with price reductions without making much difference in
sales. And generally they can't reduce prices dramatically, because
of fixed costs for paper, shipping, author advances, and the
expense of unsold books returned by booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, we used to sell eight to 10 mass-market
paperbacks for every hardcover that we sold,'' said Laurence
Kirshbaum, the chairman of Time Warner Inc.'s trade publishing
group, which includes Warner Books. ``Now the ratio is a 2-to-1
relationship. So there's been a tremendous transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperback market has settled in at a certain core, and it
doesn't seem to be growing,'' he continued. ``And what we've done
at Warner is refine our distribution and cut. Something has been
lost here in the sense that what used to be much more of a truly
mass-market phenomenon has become more specialized and to some
extent more elitist.''

<P>
   The contemporary history of the mass-market paperback in the
United States dates back to 1939, when Robert de Graff, an
ambitious publisher, introduced a line of plastic-laminated books
that sold for 25 cents each. Despite some debate over credit for
the idea, legend has it that de Graff settled on this price after
concluding as he tossed two bits into the toll booth at Jones Beach
State Park on Long Island, N.Y., that nobody ever misses a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, de Graff's company, Pocket Books, and its
kangaroo mascot, Gertrude, ushered in the paperback revolution,
creating an alternative mass distribution network.
</P>
<P>
   It moved beyond the elite carriage trade of existing bookstores,
turning to a sprawling network of magazine distributors who took
books to the world where Americans walked _ thousands of
newsstands, candy stores, cigar shops and food stores. But with
consolidation in the 1990s, these distributors have dwindled from a
high of about 700 companies to a handful, and the result is that
they are stocking fewer books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific bargain that was available in 500,000
outlets instead of 5,000,'' said Thomas Bonn, the author of
``Undercover: An Illustrated History of American Mass Market.''
``You couple that with the return of World War II servicemen who
were reading armed-service paperback editions and the postwar
expansion of education, and you have the creation of a generation
of readers. The paperback successfully defended reading because it
was a format that could compete with television.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top executives in major publishing companies count
themselves in the 1960s paperback generation that developed an
appetite for reading with paperback versions of ``Siddhartha,''
``To Kill a Mocking Bird'' or ``Slaughterhouse Five.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, they say, they speak with personal experience when they
wonder whether readers from the baby-boom generation are shifting
to more expensive hardcover formats simply because the larger type
is more comfortable for their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So if readers are buying fewer paperbacks, where has their
attention been diverted? A prevalent theory is that they are
spending more time on competing diversions such as exploring the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham
University who follows the publishing industry, said there were
indications that some readers might be finding more entertainment
on videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, in 1997, consumers spent more on home videos
than on books, a narrow gap projected to increase through 2001,
according to figures from the Statistical Abstract of the United
States. The same figures show that consumers have increased
spending for online access to the Internet, but those expenses are
still less than spending on home videos and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how people are voting with their dollars,'' Greco
said. ``In 1998, the average American spent $88.79 buying or
renting videos and spent $88.09 on books. That's less time and
fewer dollars being spent on reading. You can't rely on videos of
Air Force One to create an enlightened electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   But readers still spend enough on paperback books to convince
publishers that it remains a viable business. ``Like Broadway, it's
that fabulous invalid, and every day there are rumors of its
demise, but people keep showing up,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, the
publisher and president of Bantam Books, which has been publishing
paperbacks for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the mass-market paperback business
has declined and will probably continue to decline, whether you
look at units or dollars or the number of titles that are produced.
But the mass market is still a thriving, multifaceted business. The
bright spot is that on any given day people are still buying
books.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one publisher has returned to the very roots of the
revolution to keep his sales growing. Walter Zacharius, the founder
and chairman of Kensington Books, the second-largest publisher of
romance novels, keeps searching for new sales outlets _ the
critical element that powered the growth of Pocket Books and the
paperback revolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day last year, his company tried pitching
romance-club memberships to a QVC cable television audience, an
effort that did not succeed despite the heart-tugging efforts of
one of his authors.
</P>
<P>
   At age 75, Zacharius has struck a deal to distribute a line of
black romance books through distributors of cosmetics aimed at
black women. He is also negotiating to stock his new line of Latino
romance novels in bodegas through Spanish-language newspaper
distributors in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read this all the time that it's tough to compete,''
Zacharius said. ``They're crazy! We're competing. We're growing.
We're more successful than last year. The truth is that this is
garbage. I really think that people in the mass-market field cannot
forget two words.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, savoring the words like a businessman's mantra in a
scene from ``The Graduate'': ``Mass market.''

REPORT SAYS HARASSMENT OF HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY HAS
INCREASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five years after the Clinton administration adopted
its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in the
military, incidents of anti-homosexual harassment have increased in
each of the armed services, according to a legal group that
represents gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be released on Monday, the group, the
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, says that persistent
harassment has created a climate of fear in some units so severe
that many gay men and lesbians have been forced to abandon military
service, in contradiction of the policy's aims.
</P>
<P>
   The group's report concludes that service members have little
recourse to stop harassment, because reporting it often has invited
more harassment and, in at least some cases, investigations into
their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to stop this harassment is to stand up and say,
`You're talking about me,' '' said C. Dixon Osburn, an executive
director of the organization. ``But doing that, under the policy,
means losing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which took effect in 1994, explicitly allows gay men
and lesbians to serve in the armed services, but it bars them from
declaring their homosexuality or engaging in homosexual acts, like
ceremonies signifying a couple's union.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Richard M. Bridges, declined to
comment Sunday on the group's report, saying the Pentagon had not
yet reviewed a copy. But he said it was not the Pentagon's policy
to prosecute gay men or lesbians. ``We are not out there searching
for homosexuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Pentagon reported that the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine Corps discharged 1,145 gay men and lesbians in the 1998
fiscal year, a 13 percent increase from the year before and nearly
double the number in 1993, the year before the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, officials attributed the increase to a rash of
young men and women declaring their sexual orientation, often to
get out of service after concluding that military life did not suit
them. Rudy de Leon, the under secretary of Defense for Personnel
and Readiness, said that 87 percent of the discharges resulted from
voluntary declarations.
</P>
<P>
   The service members' legal group disputed that, saying that many
``statements'' are in fact coerced in subtle and not-so-subtle
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ```Statements' include disclosures made to psychotherapists, in
personal diaries, in response to direct questions about their
sexual orientation, in anonymous online profiles and those coerced
out of service members due to fear, intimidation, assaults, death
threats and threats of criminal prosecution,'' the group's report
says.
</P>
<P>
   The group tabulated 400 instances of anti-homosexual harassment
reported to its lawyers by service members in the year that ended
on Feb. 28, the anniversary of the policy's adoption, compared with
182 instances the year before.
</P>
<P>
   There were 158 reports of harassment by members of the Navy in
1998, the report says, 122 in the Army, 54 in the Air Force, 63 in
the Marines and three &UR;  &LR; in the Coast Guard, the report said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group's report included lengthy accounts of harassment.
David B. Raleigh, a marine discharged last year after two years in
the Corps, said he had encountered hostility from the moment he
entered the recruiting station. ``The atmosphere is just
intolerable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group did cite signs of progress, noting there were fewer
``mass investigations'' and criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   There are other indications that the issue has become less
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   An anecdotal survey of troops conducted by two sociologists,
Charles C. Moskos of Northwestern University and Laura L. Miller of
the University of California at Los Angeles, suggested a growing
willingness to accept gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest survey, involving interviews of troops serving in
Bosnia, found 26 percent of servicemen said gay men and lesbians
should be allowed to serve, compared with 15 percent in 1993, when
the policy was being fiercely debated. Women seem more accepting,
with 52 percent saying gay men and lesbians should be allowed to
serve, compared with 33 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the issue becomes less contentious,'' Moskos said, ``the
soldiers become more tolerant.''

STUDY SAYS EARLY SOCIAL INTERACTION AVERTS RISKY TEEN-AGE
BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Programs that seek to reduce violence, drug abuse, pregnancy and
other dangerous or unhealthy activities among adolescents are
notorious for doing too little too late and at too great a cost.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study has shown that by starting early _ in grades one
through six _ to foster an interest in school and learning among
children and to enhance their self-esteem, many of these risky
behaviors can be averted and school performance and attendance can
be improved through high school.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an independent analysis of the study showed,
communities can save money over and above the cost of such a
preventive effort.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of this 12-year study, published Monday in the
journal Archives of Pediatrics &AMP; Adolescent Medicine, showed that
coaching teachers and parents on how best to encourage young
children's involvement and interest in school and teaching children
how to interact socially can have a significant long-term effect on
their behavior and academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved schools with students from Seattle's most
crime-ridden neighborhoods. Some of the schools got the
intervention program designed for the study and the other
comparable schools did not.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to students who did not receive the elementary school
intervention program, by age 18, those children who did were 19
percent less likely to have committed violent acts, 38 percent less
likely to indulge in heavy drinking, 13 percent less likely to
engage in sexual intercourse, 19 percent less likely to have had
multiple sex partners and 35 percent less likely to have caused a
pregnancy or to have become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on curbing sexual behavior and teen-age pregnancy
were achieved ``without ever using the `S' word,'' said Dr. J.
David Hawkins, the principal investigator and a professor of social
work at the University of Washington. ``It's amazing to see these
outcomes,'' he said, adding that ``when kids get on a positive
trajectory they are less inclined to take risks that would throw
them off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who attended the schools with intervention programs
also were more likely to stay in school and to achieve higher
grades, although there was no significant impact on their
experimentation with drugs or cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Quinn, who studied youth programs at the Carnegie Council
on Adolescent Development, praised the Seattle program as one of
the very best she has reviewed. Ms. Quinn, who is now program
director at the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, said the study
has three ``remarkable features: One, the intervention is quite
simple and straightforward, something that any community could
adopt; two, it works with people who are already involved in the
lives of children and recognizes young people as agents in their
own development, and, three, it has powerful long-term results _ a
six-year follow-up is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Weissberg, professor of psychology at the University
of Illinois at Chicago, called the Seattle work ``exemplary'' in
its attention to social and emotional issues as well as academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg added, however, that this kind of program should not
stop at the sixth grade but ``should continue through junior high
and high school'' to see if even better results can be achieved.
For example, while there was significantly less violent behavior in
the intervention group, still 48 percent of that group had engaged
in such behavior, a number that might have been lower if
age-appropriate intervention had continued through high school, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved three kinds of efforts: with teachers in each
of the six grades, with parents and with the students themselves.
During five days of in-service training, teachers were taught how
to foster cooperative learning among students so that each child is
rewarded for having contributed to the achievements of the group.
Teachers were also shown how to maintain classroom discipline by
giving children a sense of power instead of belittling or shouting
at them.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said teachers were given guidance in ``how to establish
expectations, rules and routines of the classroom so that kids know
how to behave so they don't get into trouble.'' Teachers were also
taught how to make certain that everyone in the classroom
understood what was being taught, ``not just the three bright kids
in front,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the underlying goal was to help children
``develop a commitment to school, to value education and to become
emotionally attached to their school, teachers and peers. This in
turn can give them the motivation to live in a positive,
responsible way that doesn't jeopardize their stake in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenting programs were offered to the parents of every student
in the experimental classrooms. Overall, 43 percent of these
parents participated. Parents were encouraged to reinforce
desirable behavior _ to ``catch them being good'' _ and to provide
consistent discipline. They were also shown how to help their
children succeed academically, for example, by reading to them or
playing word games with them or simply providing a quiet place in
which the children can do schoolwork. Parents of fifth and sixth
graders were also given tips on how to prepare children for
drug-free years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the children themselves, their guidance started in school
in the first grade with learning how to solve interpersonal
problems, take turns, recognize the feelings of others and talk
positively to themselves. In sixth grade the students were offered
four one-hour training sessions in refusal skills _ how to say
``No'' and still keep their friends and have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The full cost of the program over the six years of intervention
was calculated as nearly $3,000 a child. However, Hawkins noted
that if such a program were adopted in a school system, the actual
ongoing costs would be lower because teacher training would not
have to be repeated annually and would involve existing personnel
and training days already built into the system. But even at the
full cost of the experimental program, the Washington state
Institute for Public Policy demonstrated that the intervention
would be cost-effective if all that it achieved was a reduction in
crime. The institute calculated a taxpayer savings of 21 percent
just from the reduction in the number of felonies committed.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle research team next plans to study the original
participants at age 24 to see how lasting the benefits of the
intervention program have been.

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Weissberg, professor of psychology at the University
of Illinois at Chicago, called the Seattle work ``exemplary'' in
its attention to social and emotional issues as well as academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg added, however, that this kind of program should not
stop at the sixth grade but ``should continue through junior high
and high school'' to see if even better results can be achieved.
For example, while there was significantly less violent behavior in
the intervention group, still 48 percent of that group had engaged
in such behavior, a number that might have been lower if
age-appropriate intervention had continued through high school, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved three kinds of efforts: with teachers in each
of the six grades, with parents and with the students themselves.
During five days of in-service training, teachers were taught how
to foster cooperative learning among students so that each child is
rewarded for having contributed to the achievements of the group.
Teachers were also shown how to maintain classroom discipline by
giving children a sense of power instead of belittling or shouting
at them.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said teachers were given guidance in ``how to establish
expectations, rules and routines of the classroom so that kids know
how to behave so they don't get into trouble.'' Teachers were also
taught how to make certain that everyone in the classroom
understood what was being taught, ``not just the three bright kids
in front,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the underlying goal was to help children
``develop a commitment to school, to value education and to become
emotionally attached to their school, teachers and peers. This in
turn can give them the motivation to live in a positive,
responsible way that doesn't jeopardize their stake in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenting programs were offered to the parents of every student
in the experimental classrooms. Overall, 43 percent of these
parents participated. Parents were encouraged to reinforce
desirable behavior _ to ``catch them being good'' _ and to provide
consistent discipline. They were also shown how to help their
children succeed academically, for example, by reading to them or
playing word games with them or simply providing a quiet place in
which the children can do schoolwork. Parents of fifth and sixth
graders were also given tips on how to prepare children for
drug-free years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the children themselves, their guidance started in school
in the first grade with learning how to solve interpersonal
problems, take turns, recognize the feelings of others and talk
positively to themselves. In sixth grade the students were offered
four one-hour training sessions in refusal skills _ how to say
``No'' and still keep their friends and have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The full cost of the program over the six years of intervention
was calculated as nearly $3,000 a child. However, Hawkins noted
that if such a program were adopted in a school system, the actual
ongoing costs would be lower because teacher training would not
have to be repeated annually and would involve existing personnel
and training days already built into the system. But even at the
full cost of the experimental program, the Washington state
Institute for Public Policy demonstrated that the intervention
would be cost-effective if all that it achieved was a reduction in
crime. The institute calculated a taxpayer savings of 21 percent
just from the reduction in the number of felonies committed.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle research team next plans to study the original
participants at age 24 to see how lasting the benefits of the
intervention program have been.

BERGER SAYS CHINA BENEFITED FROM LOS ALAMOS DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXCLUSIVE-CHINA-MILITARY) 
(DW) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, acknowledged Sunday that ``there's no question'' that
China benefited from obtaining the design of America's most
miniaturized nuclear warhead from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's comments came as Republicans and some Democrats called
for further investigations into whether the administration dragged
its feet in investigating the loss after the first suspicions arose
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, a D-Wash., said on the NBC News program ``Meet
the Press'' that the administration had been ``slow to react'' to
calls from the FBI to strip the lead suspect of his security
clearance. Dicks was co-chairman of a special congressional
committee that recently completed a study of Chinese efforts to
obtain American technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a major counterintelligence failure,'' he said. ``That
is the most important conclusion we reached.'' The administration
is in the midst of an increasingly tense discussion with the
commission, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., over what
information to make public in a declassified version of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he was ``appalled by the leaks of some of this
information'' but said the White House still was trying to keep out
data that already has ``been in the newspapers for several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has been defending the investigation into the
intelligence loss for a week now, arguing that he moved quickly
once the evidence became specific and credible. Appearing on the
same news show, he argued that the first report of the nuclear
technology theft, relayed to him in 1996, was ``simply
preliminary,'' and he asked both the FBI and the Energy Department
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   He did not order a new plan to tighten security until more
specific evidence arose the next year, he said. Warnings from
investigators to take away the security clearance of the lead
suspect, Wen Ho Lee, ``were conversations that must have taken
place between the FBI and the Department of Energy,'' he said,
leaving the impression he was not involved in the decision. The
suspect was not fired until last week, after The New York Times
reported on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Berger made his firmest statement yet that
China had gleaned important information from the theft of the
design of the warhead, known as the W-88. ``There's no question
that they've benefited from this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing criticism of how they handled the
case, administration officials now say they conducted 17 briefings
of congressional intelligence committees in recent years that
included information about the theft. Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., has
said in recent days that the briefings included information on the
Los Alamos case. But Goss, a former CIA officer who chairs the
House Select Committee on Intelligence, insisted Sunday that the
information was ``not highlighted and it was underplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss said that the administration was giving ``a little bit more
attention'' to counterintelligence now, and added, ``I think if we
keep the pressure on, we will indeed understand that national
security is more important than trade.''

IMAGINARY SPOKESWOMAN STEPS OUT FROM THE PAGES OF READER'S DIGEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As imaginary advertising characters go, Carolyn Davis
is no Betty Crocker. The prosaic Davis, who pitches products in the
pages of Reader's Digest magazine, is more akin to Carol Wright,
the fictitious queen of cents-off coupons, than to a widely
familiar, ever-popular creation like Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is now starting to get around, too.
</P>
<P>
   Reader's Digest, which has long used the character in ads
carrying the typically cheery title ``Tips for Better Living,'' has
developed a program under which Davis is appearing for the first
time in ads in magazines from other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Davis foray outside Reader's Digest comes in ads
produced for laundry and cleaning products sold by the Clorox Co.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are running or will run in magazines like Bon Appetit,
owned by the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications;
The Ladies' Home Journal, part of the Meredith Corp.; Metropolitan
Home, owned by the Hachette Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere
Group; Parents, part of the Gruner &AMP; Jahr USA Publishing unit of
Bertelsmann AG, and Redbook, owned by the Hearst Magazines unit of
the Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The ads look almost exactly as they do in Reader's Digest. A
likeness of the make-believe Davis is posed next to short blocks of
ad text and photographs of the products being endorsed. There are
two differences: the ads are of course full-sized, not
digest-sized, and the Digest name and its Pegasus logo are added in
the top left corners.
</P>
<P>
   As with many journeys from home, the Davis trip has not been
entirely bump free. Another Hearst magazine, Good Housekeeping, is
bowing out of the program after running the ad once because,
executives there say, it violated that magazine's particularly
stringent advertising acceptability policies by not identifying
Davis as imaginary.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling Davis ad venture is emblematic of efforts by the
print media to exploit the positive perceptions of their core
brands among readers. Reader's Digest _ which began the Davis ads
about 25 years ago after using the character in subscriber mailings
since 1932 _ is hoping brand expansion will help revive its
flagging operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time thinking whether or not we wanted to do
this,'' said Gregory G. Coleman, president for U.S. magazine
publishing at the parent, the Reader's Digest Association.
</P>
<P>
   Research showed ``a tremendous amount of equity in Carolyn,''
said Coleman, who is based in New York, ``and there's a rub-off
effect to seeing that trusted friend in a different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clorox suggested the idea, Reader's Digest worked out the
details. Clorox agreed to run the Davis ad, produced in-house, in
Reader's Digest as well as in the 12 other magazines and agreed to
pay a small, undisclosed fee for rights to use the Davis trademark.
</P>
<P>
   In the other magazines, the ad will appear inside four-page
inserts planned to run four times in 1999 at a total cost of about
$4 million; the first ad promotes Clorox 2 bleach, Tilex shower
cleaner, Soft Scrub cleanser and Pine-Sol spray cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ad format our brand people really liked that is
known and recognized,'' said Sandy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for
Clorox in Oakland, Calif. ``So they asked whether we could use it
in other publications. It was really pretty simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The other magazines did not balk at taking ads with another
publisher's trappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clorox is a good customer of ours, and we thought it was
interesting to use the Reader's Digest brand equity,'' said Deborah
Barrow, publishing director for Meredith in New York, which will
run the Davis ads in Country Home, Midwest Living and Traditional
Home in addition to The Ladies' Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is completely unheard of,'' she added,
comparing it to carrying ``ads for Martha Stewart paint,'' which
could be construed as promoting Martha Stewart Living magazine. And
many ads that run outside Good Housekeeping serve as miniature
billboards for that magazine by including its seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Good Housekeeping, which carried the Davis ad as part of a
Clorox insert in the February issue, will not run it again.
</P>
<P>
   That had ``nothing to do with the fact it's from Reader's
Digest,'' said Patricia Haegele, senior vice president and
publisher in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she added, ``a fictitious person'' like Davis seemingly
endorsing products ``falls into the category of being confusing and
misleading to our reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Good Housekeeping would ``be happy to create something'' for
Clorox, Ms. Haegele said, ``with a real person from the Good
Housekeeping Institute'' offering ``handy, helpful hints.'' Her
reference was to the laboratory that bestows the seal, which tests
products advertised in her magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reality in ads? What a concept.

EX-TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAYS HER BAG CAUSED DELAYS AT
AIRPORT  
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio) (rk) 
 By   MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former Transportation Department official
acknowledged Sunday that she was the person who checked a suitcase
at the airport in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday that security officials
suspected contained a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Mary Schiavo, said that her aim was to help
a local television station prepare a story about security, not to
disrupt operations at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airport police evacuated the ``B'' concourse at Port
Columbus airport, ordering hundreds of travelers from the area, and
planes were pushed back from their gates. The bomb squad took the
bag to a pre-designated spot on the north runway and closed the
runway for five hours. The FBI and the Federal Aviation
Administration have joined the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiavo is a former inspector general of the Transportation
Department, and before she left her job in 1996 she issued many
reports critical of the FAA, including several on security.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Ms. Schiavo said that she had
been at the airport, which is near her home, with WCMH-TV, an NBC
affiliate in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to go with them to tell them what I thought of
security,'' said Ms. Schiavo, who said she had done the same last
year with ``local print media.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport police and the FBI complained on Saturday that the
incident had disrupted the airport operations for hours, and said
they were investigating whether any laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday if airport officials were mad at her, Ms. Schiavo
said, ``they are, but they were mad at me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiavo said she was trying to prove a point, that bags
checked by passengers are not routinely X-rayed before they are
loaded, and that they should be.
</P>
<P>
   She said airport officials had been tipped off by the television
crew that she was testing their safety arrangements, and had made
as big a fuss as possible over the checked bag.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Richard L. Morgan, the director of public safety at
the airport, said the bag had been pulled aside because airline
workers had become suspicious. ``I find it ironic that as the hours
go by, she comes up with more allegations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have probable cause that possible criminal
violations were involved here,'' he said, but added that the FBI
would decide whether to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Ms. Schiavo had some long-standing dispute with his
department, he said, ``My understanding is that she has a beef with
the FAA and airports in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington said the bag may have been pulled aside
because Ms. Schiavo did not board. She said Sunday she had a second
ticket to Washington on a different flight that day.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, America West workers carried the bag up to the
screening checkpoint usually used for carry-ons, and screeners
became alarmed about what they saw on X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiavo stressed that it was not she who had taken the bag
into the concourse, and that ``it was certainly, certainly not my
intent'' to disrupt the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The bag had a running suit and shoes, a tape recorder, a can of
shaving cream, a can for racquetball balls, children's modeling
clay and wire for stereo speakers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cans and the wire, she said, should have attracted the
attention of a security screener if the bag had been X-rayed; the
clay, she said, would not appear suspicious on X-ray but would show
that the bag could just as easily held explosives.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a Libertarian with attitude, Paul Jacob is
simply not going to let House members forget their ballyhooed
term-limit promises of the Contract With America class of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your word, George,'' declares one of the needling ads
with which Jacob, national director of the U.S. Term Limits
Foundation, has flooded the district of Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., who is reconsidering his 1994 pledge to stay here no more
than three terms.
</P>
<P>
   He is thereby drawing furious flak from Jacob and the movement
that made Nethercutt its poster boy in the Republicans' victory
year when he defeated Speaker Tom Foley, attacking him as
incumbency personified. Nethercutt, under pressure from Republican
leaders concerned about their shrinking margin of majority power,
now is saying that six years is ``probably not enough'' to serve
his constituents well, and that he will be consulting them about
his original pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be playing dodge-ball with his integrity is very
troubling,'' said Jacob, who in laboring among the legions of
special-interest movements here has a personal history of not
merely talking the talk of government reform. He is a Libertarian,
not a conservative Republican as many assume, and his fervor was
forged in what he terms ``re-education camp'' 20 years ago, when he
served five months in a federal prison for resisting, in the name
of principle, the government's attempt to create a roster of men
theoretically eligible for future military draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that at a very young age I had done something that
justified my existence,'' said Jacob, who grew up in a family of
eight in Little Rock, Ark., where ``only politics and religion were
discussed at the dinner table.'' His mother was a nurse, his father
a small-businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first political memory was when I was three, and my mom was
crying after dad lost a race for city council in 1964,'' Jacob
recalled. ``I remember someone telling her not to cry, he would
have another chance. And she replied, `I'm not crying about Jack' _
my father _ `I'm crying about Barry Goldwater.'''
</P>
<P>
   The father of two and a weekend basketball player, Jacob at
first seems an entirely gentle special pleader, well cut from the
institutional cloth of this vast government milltown. But he
flashes steely dedication in targeting Nethercutt. Jacob's cheeky
television ads lump the congressman with Presidents Nixon and
Clinton as perfidious incumbents. His billboard message to the
congressman in Seattle sarcastically blares ``Thanks for keeping
your word!''
</P>
<P>
   ``George Nethercutt will go down in history as the hero of the
movement if he keeps his word,'' Jacob said. ``If he doesn't keep
his word, then he goes down as the Benedict Arnold.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Jacob figures his movement keeps going, with
Nethercutt a handy attraction and a $20 million campaign planned
for next year. Most of it, he says, will be spent in enlisting and
praising new pledge-taking candidates, but enough of it, too, in
excoriating any balking incumbent. The campaign suffered a blow in
1995 when the Supreme Court struck down its busy round of citizen-
initiative drives designed to limit federal terms by way of
statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   This made the tactic of gathering _ and morally enforcing _
pledges from candidates the critical device, Jacob said. He insists
the movement is far from fading in tandem with the Contract With
America. He currently counts three-term pledges in hand from 45
House incumbents, including nine Democrats, and two-term pledges
from 14 senators, including one Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob is a 39-year-old dropout from Westminster College in
Fulton, Mo., who followed his parents' political passion beyond
Nixon-era Republicanism and volunteered to work for Libertarian
presidential candidacies. He loves issue-oriented politics, jotting
off a note to a newspaper the other day as a private citizen
devoutly opposed to the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He became an initiative organizer on the issue of term limits,
targeting ``the incumbent party'' as the underlying problem of
politics. He finds most officeholders more devoted to extending
their careers than to pursuing controversial changes that put them
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the country is yearning for are people who will stand up
and say what they believe,'' Jacob declared. ``And, where they
think the majority of people aren't with them, will at least have
the guts and the integrity to come out and try and convince the
people otherwise.'' He himself shrugs at such a notion in an era
when politicians vett and tailor issues in focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention Nethercutt is attracting, six of the other
nine incumbents whose pledges are falling due have clearly said
they will honor them, Jacob noted. ``It's about how you become
happy _ being true to yourself,'' declared the proud jailhouse
dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why when I hear someone who understands how powerful
incumbency is, like a George Nethercutt, say he's going to let
voters decide, I say no, he gave his word,'' Jacob continued,
firmly maintaining the term-limits needle. ``This isn't about the
voters; it's about him and his own inner self.''

3 AIRLINES RAISE TICKET PRICES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, US Airways and Trans World Airlines raised
their ticket prices over the weekend, matching fare increases made
late last week by the nation's other major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the industry's second price increase this year and comes
as airlines try to raise revenue to meet Wall Street expectations
but also face a strong backlash from consumers and some
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines raised the fares for last-minute unrestricted
tickets favored by business travelers by 1 percent and for less
expensive advance-purchase tickets that are intended for
vacationers by 3 percent. The previous wave of increases, which
began in late January, raised business fares by 2 percent and
leisure fares by 4 percent. Before that, the industry had not
raised prices systemwide in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines file their prices several times a day to a
centralized computer system and are barred by law from alerting one
another to any changes beforehand. The industry is so
price-sensitive that an across-the-board fare increase will not
stick unless all the major carriers go along. Thus the latest
increase, which was initiated by United Airlines, a unit of the UAL
Corp., on Thursday, was not assured until the last three holdouts _
Northwest, US Airways and TWA _ also raised their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said it matched the rise on Saturday, while a
spokeswoman for TWA said the airline raised its prices Sunday. US
Airways declined to comment but the other carriers said it, too,
matched the fare increase.
</P>
<P>
   Though systemwide fare increases have been scarce until
recently, the prices for unrestricted walk-up fares between major
cities have risen steadily during the last three years, while many
leisure fares have fallen. The high fares paid by business
travelers _ which rose as high as $2,000 for a round-trip coach
ticket coast to coast in 1998 _ have outraged many corporations.
Politicians have complained that the high cost of travel limits
economic growth in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, overcrowded planes, cutbacks in amenities like
in-flight meals and a rising number of delays have increased
consumer frustration. Several lawmakers in Congress have proposed
legislation to promote more competition in the industry and to
improve airline accountability.
</P>
<P>
   After four consecutive years of record profits, the industry is
now facing pressure from Wall Street. Airline sales began declining
late last year and do not appear to be recovering despite the
country's continuing strong economic growth. In addition, many
carriers are expanding their fleets this year, leading some
analysts to think that fares will have to be cut to assure that the
added seats are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber, said that each
successive increase helped the airlines less than the previous one
because they still must offer corporate discounts and other
incentives. ``It just means that the sales will be deeper,'' he
said.

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ How word was spread of Caesar's
murder to the rest of the world back in 44 B.C. isn't known. But if
the murder took place today, it's easy to imagine the media
firestorm. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEGOLAND (Carlsbad, CA) Built of 20 million bricks in primary
colors, Legoland California is opening March 20 in Carlsbad, 30
miles north of San Diego. The theme park is only the third Legoland
in the world, and the first one in the United States. This will be
a look at what to expect, including the six themed areas, the
rides, whether you can see the creases where the Legos are joined,
as well as facts and figures, history and fun stuff. With info boxs
and Legoside. By SUE DOERFLER. Story will move in the `A' and L
categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AIRPORTS (PHOENIX) As the Valley continues to grow, small airports
that were once in the middle of the desert are being surrounded by
housing. The crash of two small planes over Scottsdale raises new
questions about the safety of these airports, and the possible
dangers they pose to people on the ground. We evaluate the Valley's
small airports, getting historical data on the number of takeoffs
and landings at each field, as well as the number of registered
aircraft. To determine if these airports are safe, we look at NTSB
accident data and the FAA's Near Midair Collision database, as well
as talking to private pilots and city officials. To peg the effect
of sprawl, we look at population growth in Census tracts around the
airports. We also examine the state of general aviation in Arizona.
According to NTSB records, there have been 338 small plane
accidents statewide since 1994, including 59 fatals. By BILL
MULLER. Story will move in the A category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEGOTIATE (Phoenix) When flight attendants union President Bill
McGlashen squares off in negotiations Wednesday against America
West Airlines management, he'll be fighting for more than a
suitable contract. His job is on the line. At the end of March,
members of the Association of Flight Attendants Council 66 will
choose between McGlashen and two challengers, Lisa Bunch and Tim
Brennan. With the strike deadline looming at the end of the day
Friday, McGlashen's ability to deliver a good contract or an
effective strike that wins concessions for the flight attendants
may be a key factor in whether he's re-elected.McGlashen's
counterpart during three days of ``supermediation'' will be Greg
Garger, America West's vice president of labor. Garger, who joined
America West two years ago, helped negotiate a contract with the
mechanics union that was ratified in October. He was joined by
management labor consultant Jerry Glass during those discussions,
and Glass will be at Garger's side later this week. By PETER
CORBETT. Story will move in the A category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEDICINE (WINDOW ROCK) For more than 30 years, Jack Jackson has
warned the Navajo Nation that the number of medicine men on the
nation's largest reservation is dwindling and some ceremonies are
in danger of being lost forever. By BILL DONOVAN. Story will move
in the A category. &QL;

INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS RESOLVED TO REPAIR REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In a palatial hotel lobby with crystal
chandeliers, members of the International Olympic Committee began
gathering Sunday with a sense of both resignation and defiance
about the future of the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a stain,'' said one member who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Twenty or 30 years from now, people
will say: `Remember the corruption? Remember the bribes? How do we
know you are not taking bribes now?'''
</P>
<P>
   As they acknowledge the need for inevitable reform, however, the
delegates also say that they will move at their own pace. A sort of
back-to-the-wall aggressiveness has emerged in recent days, as
evidenced by a backlash against American and Salt Lake City Olympic
officials. The delegates appear sensitive, perhaps even resentful,
of being sternly told to clean up their act by American sponsors,
Olympic officials, investigators and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to compete with the media's expectations or the
public's expectations,'' said Kevan Gosper, a member of the IOC's
executive board from Australia. ``We're out to recover our
reputation. We have not gone belly up.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the sponsors' wishes into account, he said, ``is a
different thing from being driven by the sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the week when the IOC will show how serious it is about
reform in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. A mood of
lowered expectations already seems to have taken hold. While there
appears to be no chance of immediate sweeping reform, there exists
the possibility that things could devolve into chaos, as did a
doping summit last month.
</P>
<P>
   The key moment of this week's extraordinary session will come
Wednesday, when the delegates, more than 100 of them, will be asked
to ratify the expulsion of six fellow members. Such a vote has
never happened in a century of the modern Olympics. A two-thirds
majority of the assembly is necessary to oust a delegate. If any of
the six are not expelled, it would be viewed as a vote of
no-confidence for Juan Antonio Samaranch, the beleaguered IOC
president, and would undoubtedly further compromise the rattled
confidence of corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to ratify the expulsions could be ``seriously
damaging,'' said Richard W. Pound, the IOC member who headed the
investigation of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members say they are concerned about a scorched-earth
attempt by accused members to save their jobs or take others down
with them. Jean-Claude Ganga, an influential member from Congo
Republic, has vowed to vigorously contest the attempt to oust him
for receiving more than $250,000 in cash payments, medical
treatment, travel expenses and other favors from Salt Lake's
excessive bid to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear we could be destroyed from the inside,'' one delegate
said.
</P>
<P>
   One executive of a corporate sponsor, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said: ``I see this as a real wild card. If this
implodes, we might be forced to do some things we don't want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda this week are changing the process of bidding
on the Olympics, creating an ethics committee, implementing a code
of conduct and forming a committee to study reforms such as
democratic elections and term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to think the IOC can make the problem
disappear in a week,'' said Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for Coca-Cola,
an Olympic sponsor for 71 years. ``This is an issue where we are
not going to be fully satisfied until it has been completely put to
rest, and that is going to take some time. What will be important
is their ability to embrace and enforce the reforms that come out
of the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a halt in allowing delegates to visit bidding cities,
it remains unclear what reforms will be accomplished. It has not
been decided, Gosper said, whether the yet-unnamed reform committee
will be asked to consider specific proposals or to develop its own
ideas in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the IOC was roundly criticized in the United
States, and its appetite for reform was questioned, after it sought
to shift blame for the corrupted bidding environment of extravagant
gifts and lavish favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject out of hand that we've encouraged the gift-giving
mentality,'' Gosper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have found such remarks disingenuous,
considering that a quarter of the IOC assembly has been implicated
in the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the gifts weren't turned down,'' said Jeff
Benz, a San Francisco lawyer who was a member of a U.S. Olympic
Committee investigative panel.

YOU ARE THERE: MEDIA CIRCUS MAXIMUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's March 15 _ ``The Ides of March are come.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Caesar's famous boast to the Soothsayer in William
Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar.'' (``Ay, Caesar, but not gone,'' the
clever devil, who had warned Caesar to beware, shot back.)
</P>
<P>
   The ides are nothing more than the 15th day of March, May, July
and October, and the 13th day of other months. But March 15 marks
the date of one of history's most famous murders _ Caesar's, at the
hands of Brutus and his cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   How word was spread to the rest of the world back in 44 B.C.
isn't known. But if the murder took place today, it's easy to
imagine the media firestorm:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CNN: (Logo with bloody dagger and fallen garland; voice-over
read by James Earl Jones _ `` Rome in Crisis: The murder of
Caesar.'') ``Romans are in a state of shock today after the murder
of dictator for life Julius Caesar. Caesar, a military hero and
successful author, was stabbed to death at the Senate. We'll be
back with round-the-sundial coverage, including a panel of experts
debating Caesar's favor with the gods, after these messages. And
don't forget to tune in tonight for our four-hour special:
``Caesar: From veni, vidi, vici to a violent end.'' (Fade to
profile of slain leader, with ``Caesar, C-XLIV B.C.'' written in
black script; somber music plays underneath.)
</P>
<P>
   Rome Today &UR; : ``Dictator for life Julius Caesar was stabbed to
death at the Senate yesterday. A CNN-``Rome Today'' poll taken
minutes afterward finds that 3 percent of those asked think this is
a bad thing for Romans, 2 percent think it's a good thing, and the
other 95 percent are illiterate and didn't know who Caesar was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Local TV news: ``. . . and more sunny weather is expected
tomorrow! In some sad news: Julius Caesar, dictator for life,
apparently has been murdered. News Chariot XII is at the Senate, so
we'll go live to reporter Cassius Dufus. . . . Cassius?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Clarissa. Witnesses here say that Caesar has indeed
been murdered. As you can imagine, this has caused a traffic
nightmare around the Senate building, so if you're planning to pass
this way, you can save time by taking another route. Try the road
by the temple as an alternate. Back to you, Clarissa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good work, Cassius. Love the tunic. So remember, avoid the
Senate building, at least for the next few hours. And now, in more
weather . . .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Local newspaper: ``G. Julius Caesar, Rome's dictator for life,
was murdered by conspirators at the Senate yesterday. In response,
Josephus Arpaio, Rome's self-proclaimed toughest constable, vowed
to form a `Posse Senatus' made up of retired soldiers, farmers and
vagrants to roam the Senate area on horseback armed with swords and
daggers to help prevent other assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   `` `This is not a publicity stunt,' Arpaio said at a hastily
called (by him) news conference. `Neither were the public
floggings, the pink togas for prisoners or the death-by-hungry-lion
punishment for rabble-rousers. Mark my words: In time, you'll
forget this Caesar fellow, but you'll remember me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Edition &UR; : ``He's sexy, he's powerful. Is he in charge? In
the wake of Julius Caesar's tragic murder, Mark Antony's funeral
speech has his name on all Romans' lips. `Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend me your ears'? Women all over Rome are saying,
`We'll lend you more than that, mister!' ``Inside Edition'' brings
you an exclusive profile of the heroic hunk. And coming up
tomorrow: `Cleopatra _ Why Won't the Rumors Die?' ''
</P>
<P>
   20/20 &UR; : ``Tonight, more from Barbarus Walters' exclusive
interview with Calpurnia, Caesar's widow. Up next:
</P>
<P>
   `` `All that badgering, all those omens, all those warnings _
just before your husband's death, you were a pain in the butt!'
</P>
<P>
   `` `You bet. You bet. But (close-up of her wiping away tear) he
was a really good kisser. I feel so cheap.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `If thou were a tree, what tree wouldst thou be?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Larrius Rex Live &UR; : ``Tonight we have a full slate of guests,
including Marcus Brutus, who will explain why he helped stab his
best friend to death, and Mark Antony, who, I understand, has a
different take on the murder. Assassination _ naked ambition or
good career move? We'll take your calls, so don't go away!'' &QL;

ANTICIPATING CONFLICT IN EURASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ARMY-REFORM) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its search to remain prepared in today's ever
unsettled, rapidly changing world, the Army has a notion at least
of the type of messy international mission its forces may well have
to face in the years ahead: protecting Caspian Sea oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's war-gamers, based at the Army's Training and Doctrine
Command at Fort Monroe, Va., have devised an elaborate geopolitical
``model'' of the Caspian Sea region that will serve as the
computerized basis for conducting exercises and training missions
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with tradition and diplomatic niceties, the Army's
model includes only generic names for the countries involved, like
Blueland and Purpleland. But even a rudimentary familiarity with
geography makes it clear that the Army envisions conflicts
ensnarling a swath of Eurasia from Turkey to Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   Army strategists who once conducted war games against the Soviet
Union will soon be waging their mock wars in former Soviet states
like Georgia, Armenia and Azerbiajan.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Michael Mehaffey, director of Battle Lab Integration,
Technology and Concepts at Fort Monroe, emphasized that the new
model was not meant to send signals about U.S. intentions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the region's characteristics posed a stew
of challenges for commanders considering how to fight future wars.
Among them: ethnic rivalries, austere terrain, a lack of major
seaports, regular and irregular forces and a credible threat of
chemical or biological weapons.

NASH TURNING AROUND A FRUSTRATING SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Privately, there were some rumblings among Mavericks
players when the team signed point guard Steve Nash to a six-year,
$33 million contract extension before he even bounced a basketball
in a regular-season game for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And when Nash started this season in a shooting slump _ combined
with the superb up-tempo play of backup point guard Robert Pack _
the talks intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said he heard none of the scuttlebutt. He was too busy
unpacking to see if he had left his jump shot in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people have been disappointed perhaps in my
play, but I've learned not to worry about what other people
think,'' Nash said. ``In time, I know the people here will
appreciate what I do, and I think that's the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way we play, I may not be in the stat sheets every
night. As long as my teammates and the coaches know and appreciate
the effort and commitment that I give to the guys, I'm happy. I
don't need my name in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the only time Nash got his name in the paper was
because his jump shot was lost at sea and his quarterbacking skills
were all wet. But within the past week, that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games, Nash dispensed 11 assists against Orlando
and 10 assists against Vancouver. He's shooting for double-digit
assists for a third consecutive game when the Mavericks play the
Portland Trail Blazers at 7:30 tonight at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nash's early-season shooting slump, the Mavericks'
coaching staff never soured on the 6-foot-3 playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``His performance on the floor has nothing to do with selfish
reasons or financial reasons,'' Mavericks assistant coach Donnie
Nelson said. ``The only thing he's concerned about is the good of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to put his best foot forward; he wants to win, and he
wants to perform well in a team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 22 games, a new contract, a broken nose and a viral
infection later, Nash has finally settled down and become the
player the Mavericks thought he was when they gave up their
first-round pick in this June's draft for his services.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year veteran is letting the game come to him instead
of pressing as he was during the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was going through the slump and the broken nose and
the viral infection that he had, it was really depressing to him
because he wanted to put on a much better show for the fans, for
management and for his teammates,'' Nelson said. ``The fact that
he's coming through this thing is no surprise to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting this before the slump, the nose and the
viral stuff. Plus, his teammates have been great. They've been real
patient with him because they know what kind of a guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for Nash to perform well has intensified because
Pack will be sidelined for two to four weeks. A magnetic resonance
imaging exam yesterday revealed that Pack suffered a slightly torn
right hamstring in the first half of Saturday's 91-74 victory over
Vancouver. But Nash seems to thrive on pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what happens on offense, I don't care who scores,
I don't care who shoots, I don't care what we run, I don't care
what we do, and I don't care if we shoot 30 percent,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only care what we can control every single night _ and
that's our defensive effort. If we do that, we're going to
definitely win some games that we've lost already this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Nash continues progressing the way he has lately, he'll
keep getting his name in the paper in a positive light.

BO GRITZ IS A HERO TO SOME, A HUCKSTER TO OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Bo Gritz is a leader in the Christian Patriot
movement, a talk-show host and a one-time presidential candidate.
He calls himself the most-decorated Green Beret commander from the
Vietnam War and the ``real-life Rambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters call him a hero. An American freedom fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call him a huckster. And perhaps a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he's called, Gritz (pronounced ``grites'') is used to
the labels. Now it appears that Kansas City had better get used to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Gritz will be among 200 exhibitors at a
``preparedness expo'' at Bartle Hall. His mission: teach people how
to cope with the computer- and millennium-related chaos that he
believes will erupt in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz also told The Kansas City Star that he wanted to form a
``constitutional covenant community'' in the Ozarks similar to
Almost Heaven, a colony he founded in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Almost Heaven, residents must sign a ``covenant'' pledging to
defend the constitutional rights of their neighbors. If authorities
come for them, they will protect one another, even if they have to
take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking into securing property that can be formed into a
safe area for Americans,'' Gritz said. ``The Ozark station will be
affordable, undeveloped, with little or no restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's increased presence in Missouri intrigues authorities and
those who monitor the far right. His appearances, they say, may
provide a forum in which disparate zealots can come together. Once
together, authorities fear, they may give voice to their anger,
which could lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a covenant community in the Ozarks also worries
observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accumulates into these places a hodgepodge of very
eccentric folks,'' said Bill Wassmuth, director of the Northwest
Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These leaders fill these guys full of rhetoric and ideas and
ultimatums and paranoia and fear and anger, and then, sooner or
later, one or two of them loses it...and starts committing
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 60, who lives in the state of Nevada, scoffs at such
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those detractors have never been to Almost Heaven,'' he said.
``They've never read anything I've written or heard anything I've
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's many followers remain loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever meet the man up close and personal, one of the
things that you find with him is a sincerity and an honesty that
you can see in his eyes and his face,'' said Ron Stafford of Kansas
City, who calls himself the ``general'' of the United States
Militia.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the movement, however, call Gritz a phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Bo Gritz does is get people inflamed,'' said Clay Douglas,
publisher of The Free American Newsmagazine, a patriot publication
based in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't give them any real facts. He doesn't offer any
solutions. The only thing he wants to do is take your money and fly
around the country in his airplane.'' Gritz made national headlines
in the 1980s when he led several forays into Laos in search of
American soldiers who many thought were still being held as
prisoners from the war in Vietnam. He made news in 1992 when he
talked white separatist Randy Weaver into surrendering in the
standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he tried _ unsuccessfully _ to mediate in the
``freemen'' standoff in Jordan, Mont. Last August he led dozens of
colleagues through the North Carolina mountains in a fruitless
search for Eric Rudolph, a suspect in bombings of abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after his wife of 24 years told him she wanted a divorce,
Gritz shot himself in the chest. He survived, and many _ including
police and his own son _ questioned whether the former Special
Forces commander had really intended to kill himself. Gritz says
that he wanted to die but now thinks God saved him for a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever people think of Gritz, all agree that he has been a
very busy man. Among his accomplishments, all of which can be
verified:
</P>
<P>
   _ He earned a bachelor's degree in law and corrections from the
University of Nebraska and a master's in communications from
American University.
</P>
<P>
   _ He led dozens of special military operations in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is a commercial pilot and flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   _ He holds a sixth-degree black belt in karate.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is an underwater demolitions expert and a certified
hypnotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond accomplishments that can be verified, though, Gritz
also says that he was featured as ``the'' American soldier in Gen.
William C. Westmoreland's memoirs, A Soldier Report. And Gritz says
he was the model for the hero in the ``Rambo'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   A closer examination suggests that some of the claims are
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Westmoreland, who was Vietnam field commander from 1964 to
1968 and Army Chief of Staff from 1968 to 1972, said he was not
referring to Gritz as ``The American Soldier'' in the chapter by
that name in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Five pages of the 21-page chapter describe Gritz's
accomplishments. Referring to Gritz as a ``daring young
commander,'' Westmoreland describes how Gritz and his South
Vietnamese guerrilla force recovered the ``black box'' from a U-2
spy plane after it exploded along the Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, however, Westmoreland said the chapter
title was not referring to anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent was to talk about the typical American soldier,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland described Gritz as ``a very energetic, can-do type
of guy.'' But he also said Gritz was ``a loose cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew where...he was going or what he was going to
do,'' he said. ``You want people like that...on the battlefield.
But to translate that to a peacetime civilian society is another
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As for Gritz's being the most decorated Green Beret commander,
an Army spokesman says there is no such category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to shortchange anyone by trying to make a
category that is so subjective,'' said Col. John Smith of the
Army's public affairs office. ``So if someone makes that claim, I
would be suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Gresham, a spokesman for the Special Forces Association,
said that even if there were such a category, ``in order to be the
most decorated, you would have to have gotten the Medal of Honor,
and he certainly has not gotten the Medal of Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his 22-year career in the Army, Gritz had
accumulated 62 decorations, including five Silver Stars, 10 Bronze
Stars, two Legion of Merit awards, the Distinguished Flying Cross,
two Purple Hearts, the Soldier's Medal and 26 Air Medals.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said he was once referred to as the ``most decorated Green
Beret commander'' at a medal ceremony in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked a question about the decorations, and somebody
answered, `Bo Gritz is the most decorated Green Beret
commander,' &UR; '' he said. ``That's how that came about.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As for the Rambo label, Gritz routinely refers to himself as
``Rambo'' in speeches and in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But David Morrell, the author of First Blood, the 1972 book
whose character, John Rambo, spawned the movie series, said he had
never heard of Gritz until 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``No real-life Vietnam soldier was ever used as a model for the
character, although Audie Murphy (from World War II) came to
mind,'' Morrell said. ``Certainly...Rambo of First Blood had
nothing to do with him (Gritz) or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the ``Rambo'' producers had Gritz in mind when
they made the second movie, but I knew them reasonably well and
never once heard his name mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' movie, John Rambo goes to
Cambodia in search of American POWs and finds he's been duped by
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz acknowledged that he had never spoken with anyone
associated with the ``Rambo'' movies. But he said it was obvious
that the movie was modeled after him because of the similarities
between his experiences and Rambo's.

   hogwash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz was back in the national spotlight last August when he
announced that he was going to Andrews, N.C., to try to persuade
Rudolph, the abortion clinic bombing suspect, to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers went home empty-handed after eight days.
</P>
<P>
   When Gritz flew his plane back to Idaho, he knew something was
amiss when his wife, Claudia, didn't pick him up at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   She filed for divorce Sept. 11, citing irreconcilable
differences. She could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Claude left me, it was kind of like I didn't have any gas
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20, Gritz got up, showered, shaved and put on his
uniform. He grabbed his Colt .45 service pistol, loaded it with ]
ammunition and drove to a nearby town. There, he confronted his
wife, and then drove to a gravel road a mile from town and climbed
out of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I put the pistol just at the lower row of ribbons
on my chest,'' he said. ``I saw my finger squeeze the trigger, and
the gun went off. I felt the bullet. The next recollection I had, I
was on the ground, looking up. The gun was still in my hand. I just
figured I would probably die there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet entered Gritz's chest and exited through his armpit,
blowing several medals off his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder whether Gritz really meant to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Sgt. Clyde Burgess of the Clearwater County
sheriff's office wrote: ``It is this officer's observation that Mr.
Gritz did not truly intend to kill himself, but instead, to raise
sympathy from his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gritz's oldest son, Jim, has questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rambo can't kill himself?'' he asked sarcastically. ``I think
he was trying to put a point across _ that his heart was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, Gritz filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining
order and alimony from his wife. He said she had $100,000 worth of
precious metals and rare coins and was conducting business at
Almost Heaven, which gave her access to all the community's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am currently living in a borrowed motor home with only my
military pension to subsist upon, which is inadequate for my normal
living expenses that I have enjoyed throughout the course of my
marriage to the plaintiff,'' he said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce was granted Nov. 25, ending Gritz's third marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz got the Center for Action business. His ex-wife got Almost
Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tulsa Grand National Gun, Knife and Preparedness Show on
Feb. 27, more than 2,500 exhibitors were hawking their weapons, Y2K
goods and survival gear.
</P>
<P>
   It was a patriot's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz was sharing a booth with Randy Weaver. As soon as the
doors opened, customers lined up to buy Gritz's book, Called to
Serve, for $25, and Weaver's The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge for
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Business was brisk, with up to 20 persons in line at times, some
with assault weapons slung over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Jim Gritz was running the Close Quarters Combat course.
For $30, participants learned how to fire a weapon and ``clear'' a
house of intruders, and then used paintball guns to shoot posters
of ``bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bo Gritz gave a talk that ended with his traditional
finale: burning the United Nations flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You embrace an unrighteous system, and you're going to end up
a crispy critter,'' he said to the crowd's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's enthusiastic reception does not surprise critics such as
Wassmuth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo is a charismatic speaker,'' he said. ``And there's that
bravado, blustery image that some people find engaging....I suspect
that he will continue to keep right on rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Gritz agree with that prediction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a wonderful life,'' he said. ``And I'm not finished
yet....So I'll just keep trying to help people to be self-reliant,
confident. Like Kansas City, the next time through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of people in Missouri. They're hard, like woodpecker
lips. They've got a good reputation. I like that. And I like people
that say, `Show me. Don't be talking to me about it. Show me.' &UR; ''

<P>
   his experiences and Rambo's. James Gordon Gritz was born on Jan.
18, 1939, and from an early age he loved the idea of being a
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   His father, 1st Lt. Roy L. Gritz, a World War II pilot, was
killed Nov. 19, 1944, while on a mission. At 14, Gritz used $10,000
of his father's insurance policy to enroll at a military academy.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz joined the Army in 1957, finding his calling in the newly
formed Special Forces. When the Vietnam War came along, he couldn't
wait to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be tested,'' he wrote in his 1991 book, /{Called
to Serve/}. ``I wanted to go out and hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   Daring and courageous, Gritz _ by this time known as ``Bo,''
short for ``Jimbo'' _ became a hero among his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``James G. Gritz is one of the finest Army officers I have ever
known in my life,'' wrote one of his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He displayed a positive genius for winning the fanatic
devotion of his native troops and the absolute loyalty of his
American officers and men. They would follow him into the jaws of
death confident that he would bring them through to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, Gritz was still struggling with an identity crisis
brought on, he said, by the 400 Viet Cong he killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In special operations, I never had a job where I wasn't out in
the jungle killing people,'' he said. ``It really screws you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz retired in 1979 as a lieutenant colonel. He says he was
asked by a Pentagon official to retire so he could lead POW rescue
missions.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1980, Gritz began to organize Operation Velvet
Hammer to do just that _ find Americans still being held prisoner.
In March 1981 he began training 25 former Green Berets for the
task, but the mission was called off. Gritz says he was told by
government officials that the Delta Force already had a plan to
rescue the POWs.
</P>
<P>
   He started putting together a new mission, called Operation
Grand Eagle. That plan was shelved in January 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A determined Gritz picked up the pieces and began assembling
Operation Lazarus. He hired guerrillas and entered Laos in search
of POWs in November 1982. The mission was aborted when the party
was ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1983, Gritz and four others _ including a University
of Kansas graduate searching for her lost father _ were arrested in
Thailand for illegal possession of a radio transmitter. They were
ordered to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that Operation Lazarus was financed by
private donors, including actor Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   After Gritz's highly publicized expeditions into Laos, he was
invited to testify before a congressional committee, where he said
he thought that at least 50 Americans were still being held.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for evidence, Gritz said: ``I have the same evidence,
sir, that might be presented by a clergyman to convince you that
God exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, replied:
``Colonel, time is either going to prove you to be one of the great
heroes of our time, or you are going to have a very difficult time
with your conscience for raising the hopes of desperate families.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hearings, the State Department's Richard Armitage
testified that analysis of two bags of bones recovered by Gritz's
team had determined that the remains were those of two southeast
Asians mingled with those of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz later acknowledged that he had no solid POW evidence,
saying that the pictures taken of a camp in Laos where American
prisoners were allegedly being held had not turned out, because he
had used the wrong camera setting.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1994 book, /{Prisoners of Hope: Exploiting the POW/MIA
Myth in America/}, Susan Katz Keating criticized Gritz, saying that
``at best, Gritz is an inveterate publicity hound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Gritz at first comes across as an amusing egotist, he
is also a charismatic leader gone wrong, a man who has toyed with
human lives while in pursuit of his goals,'' Keating wrote. ``In
the process, he has earned a dubious distinction, a place of note
among the charlatans whose claims have so distorted the MIA issue;
for it is Bo Gritz, American hero, who is directly responsible for
constructing much of the framework that supports the POW hoax
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz says his efforts were sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were American prisoners being held,'' he said.
``And none of them came home.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the government for the failure of his POW missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could do all the things I did in Vietnam, why...couldn't
we do something kind of simple, like in Laos?'' he said. ``Every
time we got into a place where we could accomplish the mission,
something happened. It was just too much coincidence.''
In March 1988, Gritz attended the Populist Party's national
committee meeting and gave such an electrifying speech that the
delegates nominated him for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   His presidential running mate: former Ku Klux Klansman David
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Duke and Rambo!'' proclaimed the April 1988 cover of
``The Populist Observer'' newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz says he did not know that Duke would be on the ticket when
he accepted the nomination. He eventually withdrew, but four years
later he ran for president on the Populist Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bo's continuing denial,'' said Wassmuth of the Northwest
Coalition Against Malicious Harassment. ``He'll sidle up to
somebody, then that person gets identified in public as a racist,
then Bo backs away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz has also been criticized for his connections to the
Christian Identity movement. According to Identity teachings, Jews
are the root of all the world's problems, and nonwhites are
inferior to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, who has spoken at several Christian Identity functions,
says that doesn't mean he accepts the doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely reject the premise that if you're not white, you
don't have a soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After dabbling in politics, Gritz founded the Center for Action
in 1989 to ``put accountability back into government.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the Center, Gritz sponsors SPIKE Delta Force training.
SPIKE stands for ``Specially Trained Individuals for Key Events.''
The training, Gritz says, is the same as that received by elite
troops in the Army's Special Operations Command.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz has turned the Center for Action into a full-time business
and says he has trained more than 5,000 students, or ``Spikers.''
Sessions include courses on everything from performing emergency
surgery to passing a lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   One session took place in Kansas City in January, when about 140
persons paid $150 each to learn how to pick locks. Gritz says he'll
be conducting phase two of his SPIKE course when he returns in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be primarily to assault-proof every man, woman and
child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, of the Free American, says the sessions are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he does is give the people just enough training
to get themselves hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz also has a radio show, ``Freedom Call,'' broadcast Monday
through Friday. In the Kansas City area the show runs from 9 to 11
a.m. on KCXL, 1140 AM. It can also be picked up on shortwave radio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's main topics these days is a cause that could
land Gritz in prison. Gritz is facing a 40-year sentence for trying
to help a Connecticut woman regain custody of two children in a
divorce case. Gritz and his son are charged with conspiracy to
commit kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz denies the accusations. ``Absolute hogwash,'' he said.

MORE WOMEN GAIN CREDIT AS INVENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the stacks at the Patent and Trademark Office archives,
researchers often have to turn sideways to pass one another in the
narrow walkways between towering shelves that hold paper copies of
every patent issued since the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly six million patents on record, those copies
represent the work of millions of inventors. Yet for almost all the
first 200 years of patent history, fewer than 2 percent of those
inventors were women.
</P>
<P>
   The share has increased in the last 15 years _ but women
inventors have by no means caught up with male inventors. The
Patent and Trademark Office says that between its official opening
in 1790 and 1984, only 1.5 percent of the inventors who received
patents were women.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1996, that jumped to 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of considering the numbers is that 1,100 women
earned patents in 1977 from that year's total of 43,000. In 1996,
more than 6,000 women shared in 66,000 patents. In that interval,
the percentage rose from 2.6 percent to 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But even today, cursory scans of the roughly 3,000 patents
issued each week show that inventions tend to follow gender
stereotypes. Women are disproportionate winners of patents for
child care, household, clothing or personal-care inventions, while
the majority of inventors listed on scientific and engineering
patents are men.
</P>
<P>
   But that, too, is changing. Women inventors have traditionally
been scarce in the agency's category of chemical technology. But in
1996, 15.7 percent of those patents bore the names of women
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is high,'' says Joanne Hayes-Rines, publisher of
Inventor's Digest. ``That's a lot of what accounts for the
increase. I think it's just the feminist movement from the 1960s
finally kicking in. I've seen this especially in the biotech area.
It's a new industry, and there's no old boys network. That goes
back to women in science, and the push from the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March is both Women's History Month and National
Inventor's Month, this is as good a time as any to look at societal
changes since the 1960s that have made it easier and more practical
for women to patent their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taken more seriously by banks when they need a loan,
more seriously by manufacturers when they want to get a product
made,'' Ms. Hayes-Rines said. ``A lot of those walls have come
down. Women inventors were butting their heads against those walls
40 years ago, and the gals from the 1960s made it possible to go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the affiliation of female inventors is changing,
too. More are now winning patents the way men have for decades _ as
employees of large corporations or as part of scientific and
research teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the numbers back up the idea that women are all
independent inventors,'' Ms. Hayes-Rines said. ``The women working
at places like Dow Chemical represent the increase in the chemical
and engineering areas. The independent inventors are solving
family-related and household problems. I think it is half and
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, necessity is the mother of invention, not the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at home, raising family, it's a problem-solving
environment,'' Ms. Hayes-Rines said. ``Women are constant problem
solvers, and that shows itself in these increased numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, women are responsible for inventions like the
automatic drip coffee maker, the dishwasher, disposable diapers,
frozen pizza dough, Scotchgard fabric protector, liquid paper,
windshield wipers and the Snugli baby carrier. But they also
devised a diphtheria vaccine, Common Business-Oriented Language, or
COBOL, and Kevlar, the bulletproof material used in vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've met one woman who would say she was an
inventor from the time she was a little girl,'' Ms. Hayes-Rines
said. ``They're all people who solved a problem.''

<P>
   Wiggle Those Toes in a Sandal Sock
</P>
<P>
   Warmer weather may not be too far off, and with it comes an
eternal fashion question for those whose summer wardrobes feature
sandals: socks or no socks?
</P>
<P>
   While no socks is the obvious answer for most people, some, like
Charles Corry, prefer them. Corry, who lives in Chicago, has
designed a pair of sandal socks that take account of the fashion
faux pas in wearing any. The patented socks are, in fact, a kind of
woven sandal themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The sock covers the sole of the wearer's foot, but not the top
and sides.
</P>
<P>
   It attaches to the foot with three bands _ one each that cross
the foot over the toes and over the arch of the foot, and a third
that extends upward from the heel of the sock to circle the ankle.
Thus, the sock protects the bottom of the foot but leaves the toes
and top of the foot suitably naked.
</P>
<P>
   Corry received patent number 5,867,838.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

IDAHO COMMUNITY LEAVES SOME RESIDENTS FEELIN THEY'VE BEEN HAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMIAH, Idaho _ The instant they heard Bo Gritz describe Almost
Heaven, it sounded like the answer to Ross and Patty Stirling's
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   A sanctuary sprawled across a 1,200-acre plateau above a rustic
Idaho town, where people could live like their forefathers, was
something the Stirlings could not pass up.
</P>
<P>
   So they sold their house and their shrimp business near
Galveston, Texas, and plunked down $15,000 for a piece of land 12
miles from Kamiah, a town of 1,200 people along the Clearwater
River in north-central Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Stirlings thought the world of Gritz, a Vietnam War
hero and now a spokesman for the Christian Patriot movement. The
development was shaping up to be exactly what they had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, struggling to get by and having lost faith in Gritz, about
the only thing they want is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Almost Heaven,'' Patty Stirling said. ``I call it
Almost Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gritz has loyal supporters at Almost Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo is a wonderful person, and he's always welcome here,'' said
Barb Fuller, one of the original settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Gritz in 1994, Almost Heaven was to be a Promised
Land for patriots, a place where people could live free from
government intervention. Come to Almost Heaven, Gritz said, and the
ex-Green Beret commander would protect them from the evils that
were bound to be brought on by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   But now, parts of the community are in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 residents signed a letter to the county sheriff
dissociating themselves from Gritz, saying they were not interested
in ``cult lifestyles or behaviors.'' Others have scared townsfolk
by flying their flags upside down, showing up at public events with
weapons and declaring their ``sovereignty'' from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Heaven's financial manager left in 1997. Other residents
would like to leave, too, but are having problems selling their
property because, they say, they cannot get clear titles to their
land.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gritz doesn't live at Almost Heaven anymore. He moved to
Nevada last year after his wife divorced him, but he continues to
promote the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely two sides to Bo Gritz,'' Patty Stirling
said. ``What he says and what he does are two different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told people, `Come live like the Amish. We'll find a way to
take care of you.' And here Claudia (Gritz's ex-wife) is with a
tanning bed in her house.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's ex-wife could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the area surrounding the subdivisions are angry,
too, complaining that Gritz has brought blight to a
once-picturesque community settled by pacifist Quaker farmers in
the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disgusting,'' said Audrey Spence, whose family
helped establish the area 104 years ago. ``Bo brought all this
here. Now he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're armed to the teeth. This is a powder keg just waiting
to blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz shrugs off the complaints, saying most people in his
communities are peaceful, happy folk. He noted that residents
included a Los Angeles doctor, a bank president and the mother of
former Olympic star Bruce Jenner.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said he got the idea for a covenant community _ a
development in which residents must pledge to defend their
neighbors' constitutional rights _ when he began to worry about
Y2K. He began selling plots for around $5,000 an acre. He says
about 175 families live in the nine developments.
</P>
<P>
   While the views from Gritz's former $184,000 house and his
neighbor's half-million-dollar log cabin are picture-perfect, other
parts of the development aren't so pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Dilapidated trailer houses and school buses dot the landscape.
One man built a house out of dirt-filled car tires. Another lived
in a dwelling made of hay bales. The county appraiser's office
lists some property values at $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, government officials say, is that Idaho County has
virtually no zoning or building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gillespie, Almost Heaven's former financial manager,
accused Gritz of misleading his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning he was a great man,'' said Gillespie, a
former Arizona state senator. ``But I found that after working with
him a while, he started to change. I think he became very greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz denies Gillespie's claims, saying his former financial
manager nearly bankrupted him _ something Gillespie denies. Gritz
said that the land debts have been paid and that all the deeds are
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally will never see a dime from Almost Heaven,'' Gritz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho County officials said that after Almost Heaven was born,
strange things started happening. For example, the district court
clerk's office was inundated with paperwork from people wanting to
declare their sovereignty or revoke their U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused a paper jam,'' said Court Clerk Rose Gehring.
</P>
<P>
   But the only illegal activity, said Sheriff Eugene Meinen, is
``sovereign citizens'' driving without licenses or license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Phil McLain, pastor of the Woodland Friends Church that
sits in the midst of Almost Heaven, said about 20 residents
attended worship services.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is that a lot of the people seem to be living
in fear _ fear of Y2K, of Armageddon, of the millennium,'' McLain
said. ``And fearful people sometimes do irrational things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents carry guns, McLain said. One brought a weapon to
church.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said: ``This is a wonderful place to live. All these
people want to be good people. They just want to be left alone.''

MICROSOFT'S COUNTERATTACK TO FOCUS ON RIVALS' LINKUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., portrayed by the government as an entrenched
monopolist, will counterattack when its antitrust trial resumes
next month by presenting evidence that suggests that America Online
Inc. plans to become a head-on challenger, according to people
close to the software company.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal tactic focuses on the three-way deal
announced in November, when America Online agreed to buy Netscape
Communications Corp. and made a side agreement to buy and jointly
develop technology with Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the
outcome of the nonjury trial, expressed his view that the deal
might result in ``a very significant change in the playing field as
far as this industry is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust division announced on Friday
that it had reviewed and approved the America Online-Netscape-Sun
pact, which tightly links three of Microsoft's major rivals. The
America Online purchase of Netscape, made with shares, was valued
at $4.2 billion in November, but is now worth nearly $9 billion,
given the run-up in America Online's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft started issuing subpoenas for documents last month to
the three companies involved in the deal, as well as to their
financial advisers, after Jackson gave his approval.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the responses to the Microsoft subpoenas, including
documents and internal e-mail that detail the strategy behind the
deal, were received about a week ago by Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the
New York law firm representing Microsoft. At Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, a
team of lawyers, led by Michael Lacovara, a partner, is poring over
the documents, looking for evidence to support Microsoft's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team also plans to depose key executives
involved in the three-way deal, and perhaps call one or two of them
as rebuttal witnesses. The tentative list of executives to be
examined, according to a person close to the case, includes Stephen
Case, the chairman of America Online; Marc Andreessen, a co-founder
of Netscape, who will become America Online's chief technology
officer, and William Raduchel, the chief strategy officer of Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive at America Online, David Colburn, a senior
vice president, has already appeared as a government witness at the
trial. He testified about a central accusation in the case _ that
America Online chose Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its preferred
browser instead of Netscape's because Microsoft used its monopoly
power as a lever. Microsoft, Colburn testified, offered America
Online a prime place on its Windows desktop screen, the most prized
real estate in computing.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Netscape purchase was announced, Case and other
America Online executives insisted that the company would not
switch to the Netscape browser because Microsoft desktop placement
was too valuable to lose. That stance, Microsoft insists, will last
as long as the antitrust case does _ and no longer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft lawyers are mainly focused on exploring the
software plans of its rivals. At the time of the deal, Case spoke
of the long-range vision of being able to deliver his online
service through a ``new generation of Internet devices,'' including
pagers, cell phones and television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial technology for realizing that future is Sun's Java, an
Internet programming language regarded as a major threat to
Microsoft's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the America Online strategy, according to executives close
to the company, also calls for its software, developed with Sun, to
play a central role in bringing it into new markets that compete
directly with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   As the line between software and services blurs, America Online
wants its centralized hub computers to be able to ``serve'' Web
applications, like personal contacts, scheduling and spreadsheets,
onto users' screens at home or at work. These Web applications,
industry executives say, need not run on Windows and could replace
Microsoft's Office productivity software.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts say documents detailing America Online's
ambitious plans may be most important in persuading the court not
to impose harsh sanctions against Microsoft, if it loses the case.
``The plans of these Microsoft rivals do not relate directly to the
case,'' said Carl Shapiro, a former senior official in the Justice
Department. ``Ambitious plans do not change the fact of Microsoft's
desktop monopoly and how it used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shapiro said he expected Microsoft to use the deal
documents ``to bring alive for the judge the notion that this
high-tech landscape is changing and fluid, and that's not just
Microsoft's view.'' The Microsoft message, he said, will be that
``even if you think we cross the line, draconian measures are not
needed.''

ST. LOUIS NEIGHBORS HOPE FIRE SERVES AS WAKE-UP CALL

 LOUIS-FIRE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ten-year-old Deandre Stevenson woke up Saturday
morning with his worst nightmare fresh in mind.
</P>
<P>
   People screaming; flames billowing; children dying.
</P>
<P>
   But this nightmare had been real.
</P>
<P>
   After school Friday, Deandre and several classmates walked by
firefighters battling an apartment fire in his north St. Louis
neighborhood. Six children died inside, including at least two of
his schoolmates from Clay Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an area where violence is not rare, the fire jarred many
children. Those still living are victims too, parents said.
</P>
<P>
   Deandre was so shaken he could not sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing those kids' faces,'' he told his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities Saturday identified the victims as Danielle
Williams, 9; Howell Jason, 8; Jason Wordlaw, 6; Forise Nowden, 5;
Briana Sanford, 2; and Amber Polk, 8 months. All the children lived
in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A woman believed to be the mother of two of the children
suffered a broken leg when she fell from a second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the fire was set, possibly by a man who had argued
with his girlfriend, who lived in the building. Nevelynn Stokes,
23, was charged Saturday with six counts of murder and one count of
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents of the Hyde Park area of north St. Louis wonder
whether this tragedy will rally the neighborhood or further
desensitize children who have grown up around shootings and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something they're accustomed to, which is the sad
part,'' said Kathy Schwab, owner of Hyde Park Donuts, where
neighborhood children often stop after school. ``They have so much
negative that they're learning that there is no room for the
positive. I hope this is a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Litter blows on the sidewalks here. Some businesses are boarded
up or burned out _ a $1,000 reward has been offered for information
on recent arsons of vacant buildings. One longtime business owner
compared the desolate streets with Bosnia, even with the Gateway
Arch as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drugs are not hard to find, and children walk to
school amid guns and fighting. Schwab's shop has been robbed
several times.
</P>
<P>
   The children might be the area's best asset, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Elementary's after-school program has been hailed for its
tutoring and extracurricular activities. The school works with
nearby Friedens Haus, a nonprofit center, to provide one-stop
social services for children and adults. School attendance has
skyrocketed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While most residents do not consider Hyde Park a close-knit
neighborhood, they say the children are tight because many have
spent years together in class and at the after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pupils in the after-school program were returning from a field
trip to the YMCA when they came across the fire in the second-story
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They were whisked back to school, but the damage had been done.
Many were crying. Some wondered whether any classmates were inside.
One staff member described the scene as mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   One pupil asked his classmates to just stop and pray.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, when he heard three had died, the child started
bawling. He burst out of the room, dashed up the stairs and out the
door. Staff members found him a block away, hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   The school district plans to bring counselors on Monday to talk
to pupils. Parents say they don't know what to tell their children.
Wanda Telford, Deandre's mother, had to ask her fiance, a minister,
to comfort her son early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to deal with this myself,'' Telford admitted.
``How is a child supposed to react? It's a lot to ask of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann Brandon, 8, tried to block it all out.
</P>
<P>
   When the television broadcast footage of the fire that killed
her school friend, she covered her eyes. Then she prayed for
Danielle, trying to comfort herself with the belief that her friend
is in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The two called each other almost daily, Carol Ann said, and
loved to play tag and jump rope on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss her,'' Carol Ann said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann's mother, Tammy Harmon, said: ``This hits so close to
home. You hope that it doesn't affect the children too much.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carol Ann tried to close her eyes, others did not want to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Becherer brought her son Saturday to lay two bouquets
of flowers at the fire scene. The pink, violet and yellow blossoms
contrasted sharply with the charred black steps leading to the
second-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Becherer's son did not attend school with the children, but he
played with them in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Becherer, tears welling in her eyes, said the fire should
motivate parents to ensure that violence is not part of their
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to know that they can be safe,'' she said. ``That's
the biggest contract we have as a society. When that is broken,
every parent and child suffers. We let our children down this
week.''

NAVAJO NATION STRUGGLES TO PRESERVE MEDICINE-MAN TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ For more than 30 years, Jack Jackson has
warned the Navajo Nation that the number of medicine men on the
nation's largest reservation is dwindling. Some ceremonies, he
says, are in danger of being lost forever. Now the tribe is in the
midst of a pilot program that attracted more than 300 applicants
and provides stipends for young Navajos who want to train to be
traditional healers. But Jackson and others are wondering if it's
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that we once had some 300 ceremonies and now that
has gone down to just 29, and many of these are in danger of being
lost,'' said Jackson, a state senator representing the Arizona
portion of the Navajo Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson was working for the now defunct Navajo Health
Authority back in the 1970s, he began pushing the Navajo Nation
Council to address problems about the declining number of medicine
men.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this century, almost every family on
the reservation had at least one member who was a ``hatathli,''``''
who supervised ceremonies and knew the chants and stories.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1970s, when more and more jobs became available on
the reservation, fewer and fewer young Navajos approached older
medicine men to become their apprentices and learn the various
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Dine Spiritual and Cultural Society, which is
composed of many of the reservation's medicine men, said there were
a number of reasons for this trend. One is that being a medicine
man is hard work. Another is that the pay, which averages about
$15,000 annually for a full-time medicine man, wasn't that great.
Much of it came in the form of sheep or jewelry which had to be
resold.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Navajos also objected to the lengthy training period
_ up to 10 years for some of the longer ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal traditions prohibit the taping of ceremonies or taking
notes, so the learning process is the same today as it was hundreds
of years ago _ listening to the complicated chants over and over
again until they are memorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the Tribal Council in the early 1980s to charter
the medicine men's association but they refused, saying that Navajo
ceremonies were a religion and it wouldn't be proper to mix
religion and state,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson and others argued that the ceremonies were not a
religion but a bona fide healing system comparable to the Anglo
medical system.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Tso, who took over Jackson's cause a few years ago when he
joined the tribe's Dine Language and Cultural Office, was finally
able to change enough minds to get a $180,000 grant in 1997 to
establish the first apprenticeship program to train young Navajos
in the traditional healing arts.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which finally got underway in December, attracted
more than 300 applicants. Seven were chosen to take part in the
pilot project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to concentrate on those ceremonies that are in
danger of being lost forever because those who know it are now in
their 60s or 70s,'' Tso said.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides $350 to medicine men who agree to give up
to 24 hours of training a month; the apprentices receive $300 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The big question now is whether the tribal program can turn
things around.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Walters, chairman for Dine studies at Dine College in
Tsaile and one of the most respected traditionalists on the
reservation, said he sees does see a situation where there are
fewer and fewer medicine men serving more and more Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inevitable because of the population explosion,'' he
said. &QL;

LIFE-SAVING GIFT BONDS CASUAL FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT, Iowa _ It's not often, Linda Krueger said, that you get
to fix something that's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   But there she sat one morning last fall listening in sad
disbelief to a colleague talk about Bernadine Hardisty, the cheery
junior high math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   A genetic disease was fast destroying Hardisty's kidneys. She
was performing dialysis on herself four times a day. She needed a
transplant. Soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, Bernie's done things right in her life,'' Krueger
said. ``She built a good marriage. She raised two good boys. She's
a nice person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease didn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Krueger has only one of her kidneys. Hardisty, grinning and
grateful, has the other.
</P>
<P>
   Across America physicians perform more than 230 kidney
transplants a week. The surgery is successful about nine times out
of 10. Usually the donor is dead _ maybe a teen-ager, killed in a
traffic accident, whose parents decided something good could come
out of something bad.
</P>
<P>
   Less often the kidney is taken from a live donor, someone
checked to make sure he or she understands the sacrifice and has a
body healthy enough to withstand the extraction of a vital organ.
</P>
<P>
   Typically in those cases, the donor is a family member. Fewer
than five times out of 100, it's not a sibling or a parent or a
spouse. Even in those cases, the National Kidney Foundation says,
the donor is usually a ``close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Krueger barely knew Bernie Hardisty.
</P>
<P>
   They both taught at Walnut Community School, but Krueger had a
second-grade class, while Hardisty taught math and computer classes
for seventh- and eighth-graders. They lived in different towns,
socialized in different circles. A smile in the hallway, a shared
chuckle from time to time _ that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Krueger knew that someone she knew, or at least someone she
knew of, was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Hardisty had seen polycystic kidney disease do its damage
before. It took her father at age 49 _ he died on her sister's
birthday _ and also killed three of her aunts and her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``I just knew I wasn't going to get it, because I
was a good girl. God wasn't going to let it happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then about four years ago she had trouble beating the flu. A few
visits to the doctor later, her diagnosis came: polycystic kidney
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Her kidneys were becoming less able to clean the toxins from her
blood and remove excess fluid from her body. Dialysis could help
for the time being. But not forever.
</P>
<P>
   By September 1998 she had been placed on a national waiting list
for a new kidney. Expect to wait two years, the doctors said. Wear
a beeper around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives, normally the choice for donations, posed a problem
because they were at risk for the same disease.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, word spread through the school in Walnut. Bernie
really looks bad. She needs a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the waiting list was forever,'' Krueger recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And Krueger knew from giving blood over the years that she was
O-positive, meaning her organs were likely to be compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as an opportunity to step out of my comfort
zone...and help somebody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger had a loving husband, three great and mostly grown
children, a good job, a nice home. Maybe risking that, chancing
surgery she didn't need, might help her appreciate it all the more.
So she picked up the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie,'' Krueger said, ``I want you to have my kidney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure?'' Hardisty asked.
</P>
<P>
   She was sure.
</P>
<P>
   A television show the next night on a kidney transplant and a
minister's sermon the next Sunday on sacrifice seemed to bless the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then began months of tests to confirm Hardisty was healthy
enough to receive a kidney, that Krueger had one to spare (some
people are born with a single kidney) and that the organ from one
could thrive in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they'd call me with the results of a test,''
Krueger said, ``they'd ask, `Are you sure you want to go through
with this? We can make it look like you flunked one of the tests.'
'' She was always sure.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed the women came to know each other better. The
patter of jokes began. How would Krueger's kidney fare, she would
crack, without its regular dose of coffee?
</P>
<P>
   Finally in mid-February _ recipient and donor had hoped to get
this behind them months earlier _ they were in an Omaha, Neb.,
hospital room waiting on the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger made a point to say something to Bill Hardisty, Bernie's
husband. ``If something goes wrong and I die,'' Krueger told him,
``tell Bernie I said it's not her fault.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody died. Hardisty now has three kidneys, and Krueger has
one. Krueger holds her abdomen when she moves or when she laughs.
Hardisty swallows 26 pills a day, including some big ones that
``smell like a skunk'' but keep her body from rejecting its new
organ.
</P>
<P>
   Both are getting better by the day.
</P>
<P>
   One is grateful for a new appreciation for what she has. And
maybe it was going through surgery, or being part of extending
someone else's life, but Krueger said she also had a greater
appreciation for her own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, I look at things a little differently,'' Krueger
said. ``I have come away enjoying every day more.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is simply grateful to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``How,'' Hardisty wonders, ``can I repay her?''

COLUMN: LEWIS HAS HIMSELF TO BLAME FOR DRAW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's being denounced as the biggest robbery since
Willie Sutton was the heavyweight champion of bank heists. But for
all the complaints about Lennox Lewis' 12-round draw with Evander
Holyfield, he robbed himself.
</P>
<P>
   After seven rounds Saturday night, Lewis was in command on all
three judges' scorecards: 69-64, 68-66 and 67-66. All he had to do
was maintain his domination, but he didn't. He allowed Holyfield to
earn the next four rounds. If Lewis had not won the 12th round, he
would have lost on a split decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis argued later that ``I felt like I was in complete
control,'' and for seven rounds, he was. But when asked why he
wasn't more aggressive in those later rounds, he explained that he
didn't want to get ``suckered'' into the trap he thought Holyfield
might be setting for him.
</P>
<P>
   By not being aggressive, Lewis reverted to the chess player he
is in his quiet time, something that his trainer, Emanuel Steward,
would rather he not be.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield didn't win the eight, ninth, 10th and 11th rounds as
convincingly as Lewis had won most of the early rounds _ with a
barrage that led to Lewis' overall 348-130 advantage in punches
landed _ but Holyfield did enough to deserve those later rounds,
just as Lewis didn't do enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was thinking instead of punching. And boxing judges have
seldom been known to award points for thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox has a tendency to think too much, to hesitate,''
Steward had said a week before the fight. ``He's a chess player.
Sometimes he'll take 20 minutes to think about making a move. In
boxing, you don't have time to think. Boxing is instinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Holyfield, Lewis' hesitation contributed to the draw
that created a dispute instead of an undisputed champion. Holyfield
remained the WBA and IBF champ, Lewis the WBC champ.
</P>
<P>
   I agreed with the draw verdict of the British (and WBC) judge,
Larry O'Connell. He scored it 115-115 in points, 5-5-2 in rounds. I
had it 114-114 in points, 6-6 in rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Christodoulou, the South African (and WBA) judge had
Lewis ahead, 116-113 in points, 7-4-1 in rounds. Eugenia Williams,
the New Jersey (and IBF) judge, had Holyfield ahead, 115-113 in
points, 7-5 in rounds, somehow awarding Holyfield the fifth, even
though Lewis pummeled him throughout that round.
</P>
<P>
   Had Williams instead given the fifth round to Lewis for a
114-114 score, the outcome would have been a majority draw.
</P>
<P>
   Although most dissidents questioned Williams' perception,
especially of the fifth round, Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, was
more annoyed at his homeboy, O'Connell, for scoring it a draw. But
whenever controversial scoring occurs, it's fashionable to doubt
the judges' integrity, especially when Don King is the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody got to the judges,'' Lewis' promoter, Panos Eliades,
said with a smirk. ``I'm just happy we got a draw instead of a
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   King, meanwhile, was already cackling about the millions to be
generated by a rematch, even proposing Yankee Stadium or London as
a summertime site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where the wild goose goes,'' King said. ``These guys must
fight again. As for the mandatory title opponents waiting out
there, I believe that under these controversial conditions, I would
have a good argument with the governing bodies for an immediate
rematch. The fans want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans surely would rather see a rematch than see Holyfield
against Henry Akinwande or David Tua, or see Lewis against John
Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   But with the personalities and politics involved, a rematch
won't be that simple. It took more than a year for King, who is
Holyfield's promoter, to come to terms with Eliades, who now has a
six-bout contract for Lewis with HBO. These people finally put
Saturday night's fight together, but they are not friends.
</P>
<P>
   When King didn't supply the letters of credit for the fighters'
purses, HBO had to come up with nearly $30 million _ another reason
HBO was rooting for Lewis to emerge with all three titles.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was guaranteed $20 million, Lewis $9.5 million plus
probably another $2 million from the pay-per-view profits. But for
a rematch, Lewis would surely want as much as Holyfield, say $15
million each. Lewis might also demand that Eliades be the primary
promoter, especially if the rematch were in London.
</P>
<P>
   As for Holyfield, his demeanor in the post-fight interview area
betrayed his feelings. While Lewis stood tall, Holyfield sat
slouched with a sheepish smile.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lewis, Holyfield sounded as if he had lost, saying:
``Lennox was great tonight, I have to take my hat off to him. I was
wrong about my third-round knockout prediction, but now I'll get
another opportunity in the rematch.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield seemed to know that he hadn't deserved to win.
And he would not have even salvaged a draw if Lennox Lewis hadn't
stopped punching to play chess.

MEMORIAL TO HONOR DOG MANY BELIEVE WAS PSYCHIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Mo. _ At 77, Evelyn Counts describes herself as a pain
in the neck. ``People see me coming and skedaddle,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. For the last three years Counts has been cajoling
people for money _ she's amassed more than $40,000 so far _ to
honor, of all things, a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Jim the Wonder Dog, who 62 years ago this
Thursday, March 18, 1937, collapsed at the Lake of the Ozarks, died
a short time later at a Sedalia veterinary clinic and then was
buried before a crowd of hundreds at Marshall's Ridge Park
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Originally just outside the cemetery, the dog's grave now is
inside its boundaries because of expansion. Cemetery officials say
Jim's simple stone draws uncounted visitors, many of whom leave
flowers, coins and other mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Come 11 a.m. May 1, Jim's admirers and tourists will have
another sight to see with the opening of what Counts and others
here have been advocating _ ``The Jim the Wonder Dog Memorial
Garden'' _ just north of the courthouse square at 105-109 N.
Lafayette St. Several thousand people are expected to be at the
dedication.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will have a water garden, trees, shrubs, plaques
telling Jim's story, brick pathways and, at the entrance, a
life-size bronze statue of the Llewellyn setter named Jim who _
according to those who knew him _ was psychic.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a phenomenal bird dog _ 5,000 birds were shot over
him _ Jim did things that left people slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   Told to find a walnut tree, Jim would do just that, bypassing a
juniper or an oak. Given instructions in a foreign language, he'd
obey. Asked to find a car with a certain license plate on the
square, he'd trot off, a crowd following, and go unerringly to the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Jim chose winners of the Kentucky Derby and the World Series and
the sex of unborn babies; picked unfamiliar people out of crowds;
and could decipher Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   As word of his accomplishments spread, things happened.
Paramount Pictures sent in a newsreel crew. Newspaper reporters
from all over the country flocked here to write feature stories.
Reader's Digest ran a piece on him. He was in ``Ripley's Believe It
or Not!''
</P>
<P>
   Jim appeared before the Missouri General Assembly. He traveled
as far as Wyoming to give demonstrations. A huge billboard 10 miles
south of here at the junction of U.S. 40 and U.S. 65 bore Jim's
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, in the 1930s, Jim probably was Missouri's best-known
resident. Folks in the Show-Me State knew Tom Pendergast, the
machine boss, or Lloyd Stark, the nursery man turned politician,
and even the new U.S. senator, that little fellow named Harry S.
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim was known all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the skeptics came, all trying to figure what sort of
magic Jim's master, Sam VanArsdale, was working on the dog, what
subtle cues he prompted the dog with, what sort of flim-flam was
being foisted on a gullible public.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto the veterinarians at the University of Missouri, the
visiting professors who poked and prodded, even the writers who
made the trek to the Hotel Ruff, which VanArsdale managed and where
he, his family and Jim lived.
</P>
<P>
   Most arrived convinced of a gigantic deception, conducted their
tests and then left muttering words and phrases like ``occult,''
``mysterious powers,'' ``enigma,'' and ``beyond understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts Jim was the real McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   And so was VanArsdale, a religious man who feared gamblers might
kidnap Jim and refused vaudeville offers, and whose only profit
came from increased business in his hotel's dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jim died at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   And through the years, the memory of the black-and-white dog who
loved treats of cornbread and had deep, limpid eyes, somehow faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like World War II was a wall,'' Counts says. ``On one
side, we could believe in something like Jim. On the other side,
since the war and with all our gadgets, all our hurrying around, we
don't believe anymore. It's like he was a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the kids still do. I can go out to a school, tell those
youngsters about Jim, and you can tell by their eyes they don't
doubt a word you say.''
</P>
<P>
   The resurrection of Jim started three years ago, when the state
assessed this area's tourism potential. Two things stood out, says
Walter Keith, a city official. One was the Nicholas-Beazley
Airplane Co., which in the early 1920s was the nation's largest
aviation school, and Jim the Wonder Dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had forgotten Jim,'' Keith says. ``Even here in Saline
County.''
</P>
<P>
   About then, in 1996, the stars seemed to align themselves. The
economy was good. Like a lot of small cities, Marshall was seeking
to develop a clean industry like tourism, and, most serendipitous
of all, there was an empty lot where the old Hotel Ruff had stood
until it was demolished more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting, Counts says. The old hotel was gone, but Jim's
garden would be where he lived all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of Saline County committee formed a subcommittee
called the Friends of Jim, composed of Counts, Keith, Donna Huston
and Lee Bearden. The last three worked out the nitty-gritty of site
acquisition, utilities, landscaping and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   One contract was the commissioning of Andy Davis, a Marshall
native who now is a sculptor in Columbia, to do the statue.
</P>
<P>
   Counts got the task of raising the money to make it all happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I raised 99 percent of it,'' she says. ``It wasn't easy.
Right as I started, the YMCA was kicking off their $4 million
drive. And then here I'd come, asking for money. I'm sure some
people thought I was a nag.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with her personal appeals plus the sale of T-shirts,
sweatshirts and videotapes recounting Jim's life, Counts found
herself stuck at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then she had a flash of intuition. She'd sell paving bricks for
the garden's courtyard, engraved with names or messages at $100 a
pop. ``One hundred bucks for a brick?'' people scoffed. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Counts sold 255 bricks, raising $25,500 and putting her over the
top. Representative of the messages on the bricks is this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``Saw Jim. It's All True.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the donations that affected Counts the most
came from children _ dimes, quarters, crumpled dollar bills. The
kids know, she says. After all these years, Jim is still real to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Counts still seeks donations for an endowment to support Jim's
garden in the years to come. Tax-deductible contributions can be
sent to the Marshall Chamber of Commerce, 214 N. Lafayette St.
Marshall, MO 65340.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be another Jim somewhere out there? After all, he
was just a dog, one of millions born every year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Counts says. Especially if you could find some small
town where there's a dusty old hotel and unhurried people, their
supper finished, sit on a spacious porch amid the gloaming and
visit: about the weather, politics, their kids, or even dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Counts says, I don't know of anyplace like that
anymore.''

NO CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER EMERGING IN RACE FOR DERBY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ So, who is No. 1 on the road to the Kentucky
Derby now that Exploit came to the end of his five-race winning
streak, now that his stablemate Prime Timber outran him in the San
Felipe Stakes, now that Vicar won the Florida Derby for his second
straight score in a Grade I stakes in three weeks and now that the
filly Silverbulletday won in the mud for her eighth victory in nine
starts?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in short, that the weekend's races left them all with only
seven weeks before the chosen few are led into the starting gate at
Churchill Downs for the Run for the Roses?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the trainer with a full house of Derby contenders
in his barn, spent the weekend in New Orleans watching
Silverbulletday win the Fair Grounds Oaks on Saturday and his star
colt, General Challenge, run fifth in the Louisiana Derby Sunday
for his first defeat in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the 4-5 favorite, did not even get into the
photo finish that made Kimberlite Pipe the winner over Answer
Lively, last year's juvenile champion, with Elliott Walden's Ecton
Park third.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert was away, he missed the upset of the weekend: Back
home at Santa Anita, his undefeated star Exploit, with a 5-for-5
record and ranked No. 1, was outrun Saturday by Prime Timber in the
San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Gulfstream Park on the Eastern end of the
3-year-old caravan, Vicar won the Florida Derby by a nose over
Wondertross, three weeks after winning the Fountain of Youth by a
neck. His trainer, Carl Nafzger, saw only good omens in the way
Vicar responded to pace and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally got the trip I wanted,'' Nafzger said Saturday.
``He did what we wanted and responded, and that's the key. He'll
step up five lengths from this race. He'll have to. If horses
aren't stepping up at this point, they're falling behind. You can't
go into the Kentucky Derby with any holes. Every step now is a step
up and another elimination. It's like basketball and the NCAA
tournament. He proved himself yesterday. Now, he has to prove that
he's the best of all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the East Coast candidates still aiming for the
Kentucky Derby will be the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April
10. The parade will be led by Vicar, the No. 1 colt pro tem.
Following him are Wondertross, who is owned by the New York
Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, and trained by Nick Zito, and
Cat Thief, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who ran in the money for the
ninth time in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   One colt who may not be following the leaders to Kentucky is
Grits'n Hard Toast, who went off as the fourth favorite in the
Florida Derby but never fired and finished ninth in a 10-horse
field. His trainer and part-owner, T.V. Smith, reported Sunday
morning that his horse had medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he didn't run his race,'' Smith said, ``we had the
veterinarian scope him. He has a lung infection, and he also bled.
The main thing is he'll live to race again. We're going to treat
him and get him back in top shape. Then we'll decide what will be
next for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zito came out of the Florida Derby in high spirits after he
made a substitution: He switched Doneraile Court and The Groom Is
Red out of his lineup and promoted Wondertross and Adonis. Adonis,
who is owned by Ernie Paragallo, finished sixth. But Wondertross,
who was inspected in the paddock and watched in the race by
Steinbrenner, closed with a mighty rush for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never won a Florida Derby,'' Zito said, ``but the
race has been good to me. I was second with Strike the Gold in
1991, and he won the Kentucky Derby, and that was OK. I was fourth
with Go For Gin in 1994, and he won the Kentucky Derby, and that
was OK. I was fourth with Louis Quatorze in 1996, and he won the
Preakness, and that was OK. And I was third in 1998 with Halory
Hinter, and he won the Blue Grass, and that was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito said he would send Wondertross to the $750,000 Blue Grass
to challenge the rest of the herd. And if he should improve by the
length of his nose, that would be OK, too.

<P>
   Buried deep in the mountains 150 miles east of Xian, where the
Chinese built a terra cotta army to protect the remains of the
Emperors, lies a far smaller but lethal force: a half dozen or so
intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles near the town of Luoning are hardly sophisticated
by modern standards. The Pentagon believes each is equipped with a
single warhead, large but not very accurate, intended for busting
cities. They are mounted atop liquid-fuel rockets that take a full
hour of preparation to launch.
</P>
<P>
   In total, China is believed to possess roughly 20 missiles that
can reach American shores, and perhaps 300 nuclear weapons that,
aboard medium-range missiles or bombers, could hit Japan, India or
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bare-bones arsenal compared with the thousands of
warheads still maintained by the United States and Russia. But the
question in Washington this week is whether China's nuclear fleet
will stay that way 10 or 20 years into the future or become a far
more potent arsenal that could rekindle the kind of fears that
shaped the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that China stole the design of America's most
advanced miniaturized warhead _ the W-88 _ from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory more than 10 years ago has prompted anger in
Washington, especially in Congress. On Sunday President Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, defended the
administration's investigation into the loss, but added, ``There's
no question that they've benefited from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite continuing evidence of Chinese espionage abroad, most
experts doubt that China intends to fundamentally change its
largely defensive nuclear strategy or that it will try to alter the
imbalance of weapons with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts outside the U. S. government _ including some
who have talked at length with Chinese leaders and military
officials _ say Beijing is clearly seeking to modernize its nuclear
forces, with a 10-year plan to make them more accurate, easier to
launch and far less vulnerable to attack than they are today. And
it is hoping to use high technology to offset its outmoded
conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   What China seeks, they say, is an arsenal large enough to give
them global status and deter the potential for nuclear blackmail,
but small enough to avoid the Soviet Union's mistake _ a military
force so expensive that it sped the bankruptcy of the nation. But
China's modernization certainly could accelerate its ability to
threaten its neighbors, and it could be sped up if China feels
increasingly insecure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without the W-88 warheads, China today is able to
threaten the United States,'' William J. Perry, the former defense
secretary, said last week in Washington, just after returning from
a visit to China where he spent time with military leaders and
China's president, Jiang Zemin. ``You have to anticipate that
ability will improve in coming years. They will evolve into a more
global force. The challenge is how do we manage that?''
</P>
<P>
   Western experts are not certain whether China, as part of its
force improvements, intends to place multiple warheads atop its new
missiles, as the United States and the former Soviet Union did long
ago. The W-88 technology could speed that transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they eventually put six or ten warheads on their
ICBM's, we will still have an overwhelming advantage,'' said Bates
Gill, a specialist on the Chinese military at the Brookings
Institution. ``But if it is achieved, it could complicate our
calculations in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the public statements of Chinese officials, what is
most likely to provoke an expansion of their nuclear forces is a
decision by the United States to deploy antimissile defenses around
the American mainland and around Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.
China's objections to the proposed missile shields have become more
vociferous in recent months, including during Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to Beijing a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a January speech in Washington, China's senior arms control
official, Sha Zukang, warned in so many words that if it erects a
missile defense, the United States would force China to further
upgrade its intercontinental nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a country, in addition to its offensive power, seeks to
develop advanced theater missile defense or even national missile
defense,'' Sha said, then ``other countries will be forced to
develop more advanced offensive missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give rise to a new arms race,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As early as 1946, a year after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima
and in the midst of the civil war between the Communists and the
Nationalists, Mao professed to be unimpressed by America's new
nuclear arsenal. He reportedly called the United States a ``paper
tiger'' that could not stand up to China in a ``people's war.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, after America threatened to use nuclear weapons
during the Korean War and after several confrontations over Taiwan
that revealed the magnitude of China's disadvantage, Mao's tone
changed. ``In today's world,'' he said in 1956, ``if we don't want
to be bullied by others, we should have the atomic bomb by all
means.''
</P>
<P>
   China's progress in developing nuclear weapons was rapid. In the
1950s the Soviets helped the Chinese establish nuclear production
installations. In 1964, after Beijing's split with Moscow, China
exploded its first atomic bomb. In 1966 it first tested a
nuclear-tipped missile, and in 1967 it tested its first
thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, China insisted that its strategy was far
different from that of the two superpowers. China pledged that it
would never be the first in a fight to go nuclear, and said it
supported total global nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   It was good propaganda, but it also fit China's limited
capabilities. At the same time Beijing was slowly continuing to
invest in its nuclear fleet, and in 1983 Deng Xiaoping, then
China's paramount leader, said, ``We must have what others have,
and anyone who wants to destroy us will be subject to
retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of missiles _ named the Dong Feng, or East Wind _ were
developed and deployed over the 1970s and 1980s. Many of those were
later sold to other nations, starting a decade of tensions with
Washington over proliferation. Bomb tests, initially above ground
and then below, accelerated into the 1990s, including tests on
smaller-size warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence gathered from one of these last tests, conducted
just before China signed the treaty that bans underground testing,
led the American agencies to suspect that China had obtained the
W-88, and started the search for a spy at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, with the introduction of a new generation
of long-range ballistic missiles, China's nuclear weapons have been
capable of reaching the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   China has deployed five to seven of its longest-range missiles,
called the DF-5, that can hit virtually any part of the United
States. An additional dozen or so missiles, the DF-4, can reach the
West Coast. Neither is a precision weapon, but precision is not the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the strategy used by the Soviet Union and the
United States, the key to China's nuclear doctrine has been what
Western experts call a minimum deterrent _ the ability, after a
major attack by a nuclear adversary, to launch at least one or two
missiles that could destroy a major city. China's hope was that it
had enough nuclear weapons so that in a confrontation with either
the old Soviet Union or with the United States, neither country
could rattle the nuclear saber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese realized that the whole approach taken by the
Soviets and the United States was an extraordinary waste of
money,'' said Joseph Nye, the dean of the Kennedy School of
government at Harvard and a former senior Defense Department and
intelligence official. ``Their view is that as long as they have a
few invulnerable weapons, they have all they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Godwin, a leading expert on Chinese nuclear forces who
recently left the National War College, puts it simply: ``This is
not an offensive force.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese clearly worry that their force is increasingly
vulnerable. The missiles are still in fixed sites, and because they
use liquid fuel that must be stored outside the rocket, it takes an
hour or more to fire a missile. Moreover, China has only one
nuclear-equipped submarine, with 12 missiles that have a range of
1,100 miles. But the sub's seaworthiness has long been doubted by
intelligence experts, and it does not threaten the American
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of China's nuclear arsenal is composed of medium-range
and short-range missiles, deployed in fixed silos in sites around
the Chinese countryside, that could reach most corners of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the United States now has about 7,000 nuclear
warheads deployed atop land- and submarine-based missiles, as well
as weapons carried by bombers.
</P>
<P>
   China has been developing a new generation of long-range
missiles, called the DF-41, which will be mobile and powered by
solid fuel _ eliminating the two major vulnerabilities of the older
models. Western experts expect the conversion to take place by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether China also plans to multiply its
power by placing multiple warheads atop its missiles _ something
made easier with small warheads like the miniaturized W-88 design,
although most experts believe that the Chinese were also developing
and testing their own small warheads in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that they have been pursuing this for some
time,'' said Jonathan Pollack, a military expert at the Rand
Corporation in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe that American intelligence services
believe they have an operational capability,'' he added, referring
to the ability to field weapons bearing multiple warheads.
</P>
<P>
   That is at the heart of Washington's concerns about China's
search for Western technology. The primary reason the Clinton
administration blocked the sale of a Hughes Electronics
communications satellite to a Chinese-run consortium last month was
the fear that China, as it learned how to place the satellite in
precise orbit, would also learn techniques that could aid it in the
tricky business of accurately releasing warheads from a missile.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese military journals, some theorists have discussed
expanding China's nuclear capabilities to deter their rivals' more
powerful conventional weapons, giving China the option to launch
``warning strikes'' in a severe crisis or to overwhelm new,
Western-designed missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this suggests that China's decision makers may be
increasingly uncertain about the credibility and reliability of
their past minimum deterrence and believe a more well-rounded and
reliable nuclear war-fighting capability has military value,''
Michael D. Swaine and Alastair Iain Johnston, two leading China
scholars, wrote in a study published this month by the Council on
Foreign Relations. Other experts warn that there is no evidence
that China's leaders have decided to follow this new route.
</P>
<P>
   Whether China decides on a major expansion of forces could
depend on the growing push in the United States, Japan and perhaps
Taiwan to develop a ``theater missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is ostensibly designed to protect American bases in
Asia from North Korea. But China views the system as a threat to
its own forces. It particularly condemns talk of extending the
defense to Taiwan, because it would blunt China's ability to
intimidate the island, overtly tie American forces to the defense
of Taiwan and encourage the island's pro-independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether China's threats to respond to a theater
missile defense system are a bluff. But last week, China's foreign
minister, Tang Jiaxuan, issued his strongest warning yet. Any
effort to include Taiwan in the system, he said, ``would amount to
an encroachment on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.''

NO HUNDLEY WORRIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ A month into spring training and Todd Hundley
hasn't caught a game for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Management says
not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said he overdid a batting practice session six days ago,
which caused inflammation in his elbow and knocked him out of
Sunday's lineup against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers say
not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day is three weeks away and the Dodgers say not to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll know when I'm concerned,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``When my eyes are fogged up and I have a look
like I want to be 100,000 miles from here, then I'll be concerned.
It's a strain from overuse. It's not a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers physical therapist Pat Screnar said the injury has
nothing to do with the reconstructive right-elbow surgery Hundley
underwent in September 1997. Screnar said it had nothing to do with
the ligaments in Hundley's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has muscular soreness and we're going to wait until that
calms down before he plays,'' Screnar said. ``His elbow is stable.
(The injury) is on the other side of the elbow, the outside of the
elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the revised plan was for Hundley to catch Tuesday,
but Hundley voiced frustration about the incident for one of the
few times since spring training began.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more frustrating (than not catching) is the achiness in
the joint,'' Hundley said. ``It's not the ligament. It's not where
it was surgically repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed was the notion that Hundley might have to pare
back his catching duties this season so as not to put extra strain
on the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've caught a lot of games to this point in my career,''
Hundley said. ``To be smart, looking at it long term, a catcher
would want to catch between 100 to 120 games, and that could keep a
guy going. I've caught 150, 140 games. I'm not looking to cut
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Young debut: Manager Davey Johnson said Saturday that Eric Young
wouldn't play until after the weekend, but after talking with the
second baseman, the skipper placed him in the leadoff role Sunday
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely made some progress,'' Young said. ``I had no
problem with everything I did. Got a pop-up, a ground ball, was
able to swing and run. Everything was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has been plagued by nagging stiffness in his lower back.
Johnson's plan is to give him today off and put him back in the
lineup Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield on leave: Frustrated left fielder Gary Sheffield was
granted permission to leave the team for a few days to tend to
personal affairs in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnson said Sheffield came to the Dodgers a month ago
and asked for permission to leave at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said the lost spring-training time won't hurt
Sheffield because he wouldn't be able to do much the next few days
anyway. Sheffield had a cortisone shot Saturday to ease the pain
he's experiencing from offseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very hard on himself and I told him that,'' Johnson said.
``We talked (Friday) and everything was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is expected to return to Dodgertown on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said right-hander
Ismael Valdes' tightness in his left thigh was not a strain....
Starter Carlos Perez had a rough outing, allowing five runs on six
hits in four innings.

OH BOY, JUST WHAT BOXING DIDN'T NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A 14-year-old boy who couldn't wait to see the
``big fight'' sat in rapture as Evandar Holyfield and Lennox Lewis
engaged in war.
</P>
<P>
   Someone uttered halfway through what became a pathetically
one-sided bout that ``this is boring.'' The boy, thrilled at the
mere magnitude of such a great event, would have none of it. ``No
way! This is great!'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the judges' decision.
</P>
<P>
   The look of utter bewilderment on the boy's face and the words
that spilled from his mouth captured the moment perfectly: ``How
can they do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, how !ital!can!off! they do this?
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfield-Lewis fight on Saturday in New York was supposed
to be the best boxing has to offer. Instead, it was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds, Lewis gave Holyfield the equivalent of a
back-alley whooping. Lewis, the WBC champion from England, rendered
a great but aging WBA and IBF champion helpless with shocking ease.
</P>
<P>
   It was very simple: Holyfield couldn't cope with Lewis' size,
his reach, his speed, his strength, his skills and any other facet
of the fight game that comes to mind. The fact Lewis was relatively
passive when he had Holyfield hurt and in the later rounds was
largely irrelevant: He won easily.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, computer statistics were indicative of a
rout: Lewis landed 348 punches, Holyfield a paltry 130.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the judges' decision was so disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The first score to be announced was that of ``judge'' Eugenia
Williams of the United States: 115-113 for Holyfield. Jaws around
the world had to hit the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the score of South African judge Stanley Christoudoulou:
116-113 for Lewis. Whew. It appeared Lewis was going to get his
due.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, judge Larry O'Connell of England: 115-115. A draw.
There were two appropriate reactions, stunned silence or laughter.
The decision was that absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ashamed tonight for the way we (Americans) treated
Lennox Lewis the way we did,'' said boxer Roy Jones Jr., a
television commentator for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Anytime Don King is involved, you can expect a draw to
come from somewhere. Ask Pernell Whitaker about the (similar) Julio
Cesar Chavez fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something like that is in the air. That's the way it
goes. That's type of thing that makes people stray from boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication there is obvious: As Jones saw it, King, who
promoted the fight, played a role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Did he pay off Williams and O'Connell? Did he pay off the
organizations that hired the judges? Or did he use his immense
influence in a less direct manner to gain the result he wanted, the
result that could translate into a rematch and a few more million
dollars in his pocket?
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is certain at the moment: A 14-year-old can sense
that something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and O'Connell ought to be ashamed of themselves. The
problem is they have no shame. Or integrity. Or pride.
</P>
<P>
   King? King was King, operating in his self interest at the
expense of everyone else with the possible exception of Holyfield,
an embarrassed champion left holding two championship belts that
have lost their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   It was as sad a night as boxing has ever experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight is what's really hurting boxing,'' said Emanuel
Steward, the respected trainer of Lewis. ``Every time we start to
move boxing forward and make a great fight of some type like this,
this type of (garbage) comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander won three rounds, four at most, and nevertheless it's
called a draw. This is what's killing boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   One must feel for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   This was his moment, his rightful ascension to the pinnacle of
boxing and all that means in terms of glory and money. All the
years he tried to earn the respect of a chauvinistic American
boxing public, all the years so many top heavyweights avoided him
had finally paid off.
</P>
<P>
   And then his moment was gone, stolen from him by corrupt
officials overseeing a corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crime, nothing less. Lewis must have cried in his
dressing room after the fight. And, certainly, many people around
the world felt like crying with him.
</P>
<P>
   One must also feel for boxing, the good elements that is, the
officials who are trying to clean up the sport and the countless
honest trainers and fighters who toil every day to realize their
own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   As Steward said, the sport seemed to have turned a corner in the
past year. Suddenly, promoters were making the kind of fights fans
wanted to see _ Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey, Whitaker-Felix
Trinidad, Holyfield-Lewis, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, who has been more bane than boon to the sport, was
twice humbled by Holyfield and ended up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The aging King, the symbol of all that is wrong with boxing,
appeared to be fading ever-so-slowly from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   And then this.
</P>
<P>
   The powers that be in the sport had better wake up, they'd
better find a way to weed out the Kings and Williamses from the
sport before it loses any remaining credibility. And to the
legislators who are working to regulate boxing: hurry. There isn't
much time.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing probably has lost the 14-year-old boy as a fan. His
innocent faith was shattered. And millions of people around the
world must be feeling the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker-Savarese: Lou Savarese was down between 12 and 13
seconds when Lance ``Mount'' Whitaker decked him in the sixth round
of their March 6 bout in Atlantic City, N.J., which Savarese won by
decision.
</P>
<P>
   One apparent reason for the long count is disturbing: Referee
Steve Smoger was busy giving Savarese encouragement. He seemed to
say ``take your time'' and ``come on'' during the count.
</P>
<P>
   America Presents, Whitaker's promoter, has formally requested
that the new Jersey State Athletic Control Board review the
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch appears to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   WBO follies: It's time the WBO forces its featherweight champ,
Naseem Hamed, to fight No. 1 challenger Juan Manuel Marquez or
strip him of his title.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, promoted by the Forum, has been the top challenger for
16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight has to be done this year and soon,'' Marquez said.
``I don't think he is afraid but I don't know what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is this: Hamed, who isn't as talented as many
people believe, is being protected by his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   A Forum spokesman said legal action will be considered if the
fight isn't made soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Erik Morales will defend his WBC super
bantamweight title against Wayne McCullough on the undercard of the
De La Hoya-Oba Carr fight on May 22 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Morales-McCullough fight is a mismatch. McCullough has
neither the skills nor speed to cope with this rising champion.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Floyd Mayweather defends his WBC super
featherweight crown against Goyo Vargas....
</P>
<P>
   David Reid, who outpointed Laurent Boudouani to win the WBA
super welterweight championship on March 6, is scheduled to have
more surgery on his droopy left eye today....
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sportsline recently conducted a poll asking, ``Who is the
most promising heavyweight?''
</P>
<P>
   The results: Michael Grant, 34.4 percent of the votes; Andrew
Golota, 23.8; Chris Byrd, 15.7; Ike Ibeabuchi, 10.4; David Tua,
9.2; and Hasim Rahman, 6.4.

   LOS ANGELES _ Stanford's Jason Collins's appearance on the cover
of Sports Illustrated in these parts _ sure that isn't Jarron? _ is
more fodder for those who believe in a cover jinx.
</P>
<P>
   How about the SI hijinx?
</P>
<P>
   This week's sign that the apocalypse is upon us would be that
new version of Sports Illustrated for Women exposing itself last
week on the news stands.
</P>
<P>
   So now we've got SI for Kids, for Women, for Men (the regular
one) _ the whole darn family is covered. Congrats to Time Inc. for
finding a way to bleed every last cent out of each imaginable
demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Or have they? We're waiting to see the ink dry on:
</P>
<P>
   SI for Retirees _ Each issue filled with long rambling letters
to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   SI for the Incarcerated _ A weekly diary from Mike Tyson and the
regular feature, ``Scarfaces in the Crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   SI for Panhandlers _ The column in the back: ``This is No Life
of Reilly.''
</P>
<P>
   SI for Grounds Keepers and Zamboni Drivers _ Morgana, who has
covered more sod than any rail-jumper in sports history, is the
cover girl for the annual jumpsuit edition, shot in George Toma's
backyard gazebo.
</P>
<P>
   SI for Michael Jordan _ Reissues of everything from the past 15
years.
</P>

Propecia ads. Kinda like what regular SI will soon be.

Someone's already talking about a two-hour bio film on the life of
Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe now that apparently no one can
object. It's perfect movie fodder.
</P>
<P>
   To put things into perspective, the closest we can come in 1999
to a DiMaggio-Monroe marriage of sports and entertainment megastar
magnitude is....
</P>
<P>
   Well, the David Justice-Holly Berry marriage is dust. The Derek
Jeter-Mariah Carey tryst never got off the ground. So that leaves
us with....
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra?
</P>
<P>
   That's like comparing a champagne-and-caviar dinner party to a
Big Gulp and El Taco from 7-Eleven....
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky and Janet Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley and Tawny Kittain?
</P>

   Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford?

<P>
   Ahmad and Felisha Rashad?
</P>
<P>
   Norm Nixon and Debbie Allen?
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Peete and Holly Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Niedenfuer and one of those Landers sisters?
</P>
<P>
   We're pushing for Rick Fox making the hook-up with Vanessa
Williams. It's no wonder Fox doesn't complain about his playing
time....

So what did Cade McNown learn from this FBI point-shaving
investigation: a) Start watching ``The Sopranos'' on HBO more
closely, b) don't hang out with Paul Hornung and c) Do it again and
you could find the head of USC's Traveler next to you in bed....
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 ought to look next into UCLA's basketball team for
shaving. You know, whether the kids even use a razor and soap....
</P>
<P>
   Shake it off, Lennox. It's just Don King's way of saying,
``Welcome to America, now go home.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks' misplayed fly ball that cost the San Diego Padres
a spring-training game over the week is bound to inspire a Grammy
Award-winning song: ``One Step Back.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Comin' up this week: The NFL decides if L.A. deserves another

   LOS ANGELES _ A search of ``fantasy baseball'' on Infoseek shows
24 Web sites. A Yahoo! search shows 49, including their own
(http://fantasy.yahoo.com/baseball) with a reminder that player
drafts for public and private leagues begin today.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's John Skilton's know-everything page
(http://www.baseball-links.com/), with 276 links on the subject.
Honest.
</P>
<P>
   We know about the big-name sites and contests. The best? Who
really knows.
</P>
<P>
   But the ones that have tanned our horsehide lately are those
that are there for the love of the mercenary game _ basically, a
bunch of guys with goofy team names bonding over whether Kevin
Appier is worth drafting with Jim Parque and Jeff Suppan still on
the board. It's just that they have some HTML to use to keep
everyone on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   For that, we've nominated these as sites with that kind of
spirit:
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Leo Rotisserie League
(http://www.parlorcity.com/glrl/). This group in Leo, Ind., claims
to have America's second-oldest fantasy baseball league _ it's in
its 16th year. There's loyalty. Its draft this year is on April 10
down at Witmer's, with an optional pre-draft breakfast at the
Cracker Barrel at 7:30 a.m. There's tradition. And the home page
plays ``Take Me Out To The Ballgame.'' There's the campiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Moorhead State University Rotisserie Baseball League
(http://www.nwpress.com/msurbl/). It's based in Fargo, N.D. _ the
home, incidentally, of Angels first baseman Darren Erstad. You
betcha.
</P>
<P>
   The Moonlight Graham Fantasy Baseball League
(http:/amar.colostate.edu/(tilda)drj/moonlite.html). We'd like a
team in the Kinsella Division, please.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood League Baseball
(http://home.earthlink.net/(tilda)jake141/) was started by two
friends who've known each other since the fourth grade in
Minnesota. One moved out to Los Angeles. ``Since we're a fantasy
league, what city best represents fantasy than Hollywood,'' said
co-founder Tim Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisher Avenue Baseball League
(http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/6992)), nine years
strong, got its name because three of the original owners lived in
a house on Fisher Avenue in Falls Church, Va. Just like the
Midwest-based Taco Bell League
(http:users.mwci.net/(tilda)greeder/tblstatistics/), going since
'85, was named such because the original owners came up with the
idea while scarfing down at a Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the ``We Can't Get Dates' Rotisserie Baseball
League (http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/(tilda)tlo/roto/roto.html). Which
pretty much sums it all up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNEAUT, Ohio _ Call it nostalgia. Or sentimentality. Or call
it an uncanny prescience.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Anthony himself is not exactly sure why he kept a certain
fish in his freezer for 37 years, carefully rewrapping it every so
often and making sure that his wife did not let it thaw when she
defrosted the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Anthony, a 63-year-old barber in this working-class
town on the shores of Lake Erie, had a feeling when he caught the
fish, a blue pike, back in 1962, that someday somebody might be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling my wife it was more valuable as time went on
and that's why we needed to keep it,'' Anthony said. ``It's hard
for me to explain, but that blue pike meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, nearly four decades later, Jim Anthony's blue
pike means a lot to other people, too. It has become the central
clue in a compelling scientific detective story that some
scientists are hoping will lead to an extraordinary result: the
return of an extinct species.
</P>
<P>
   Blue pike, native only to Lake Erie, were once so ubiquitous
there that they spurred a booming commercial fishing industry in
the 1930s and 1940s, catering to demand for the mild, meaty taste
of the bright blue fish. But in 1975, blue pike were declared
extinct, a casualty, scientists say, of pollution, overfishing and
habitat changes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, fishermen have occasionally reported seeing what
looked like blue pike in smaller lakes in Canada and elsewhere.
Some Lazarus-like resurrection? More plausible was the theory that
during the blue-pike heyday, people transferred small batches of
fish from Lake Erie to smaller lakes and they never died out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fish biologists generally assumed that those blue fish
were really a type of walleye, a common fish in Lake Erie, and not
the true blue pike. But they could not be sure. They could find no
specimens of blue pike preserved in such a way that DNA could be
extracted and compared with the DNA of other fish.
</P>
<P>
   And they were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find and verify the survival of the blue pike,
then we could restock them in Lake Erie,'' said Dieter Busch, a
fishery biologist who helped spearhead the research as chief of the
Lower Great Lakes Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said the blue pike had been sorely missed, both for
environmental reasons (it filled an ecological niche as one of the
few Lake Erie fish to spawn in deep water) and for economic reasons
(he estimates that blue pike at their previous levels would add
more than $150 million to the lake's fishing industry).
</P>
<P>
   ``The species was such a valuable species,'' Busch said, ``it
was worth getting an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Research was going slowly. Scientists had blue pike from
museums, but they were preserved in formaldehyde, which makes DNA
hard to extract. Scientists also had scales from blue pike used in
unrelated earlier studies, but that DNA was disappointing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for science, Anthony, while snipping hair, chatted
to customers about ``the blue-pike generation.'' That was the
golden age of blue pike, when Anthony's father sold piles of them
from his fish markets in Conneaut (pronounced KAHN-yaht) and
popularized the ``fish sandwich without bones.'' After school, Jim
pulled on rubber boots and got down to scaling and cleaning fish.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, a burly, self-effacing man who worked as a fisherman
for his father until the blue-pike population started to dwindle in
1957, told his barbershop customers about the 15-inch blue pike he
caught with a simple hook, line and night crawler in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he knew the fish was rare, and he kept it alive in a
bucket while contacting state wildlife agencies. He offered them
the fish but they declined. One agency suggested he release it into
the lake, and he tried, but it was already too weak and died.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's wife, Mary Lynn, accepted the fish-preservation
routine graciously, realizing that it was important to her husband.
Sometimes while defrosting the freezer, she either moved the fish
to another freezer or piled frozen foods on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my customers knew I had a blue pike in my freezer,''
Anthony said in his white ranch house not far from the great lake.
``They thought I was nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last year a customer brought him a local newspaper
article about scientists trying to determine whether any blue pike
still existed. Anthony called one of the scientists, Carol Stepien,
an ichthyologist, or fish zoologist, at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland and offered his fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't look bad for 30-something years in the freezer,''
Anthony said. ``Except for a little freezer burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien was more concerned with what was inside.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, ``It has great DNA,'' she said. The research
``would be very difficult without his fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien's crew is proceeding systematically, first trying to
determine whether the original blue pike is in fact a separate
species from the walleye. If the two fish are too closely related,
then the walleye might have interbred with the last of the blue
pike, making it unlikely that any original blue pike still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stepien says she will not disclose her conclusion until a
scientific conference in May. Busch, however, who now works for the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, is bolder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that blue pike are a separate species,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Busch said, is searching for ``suspect blue
pike'' in various lakes (so far, there have been rumors of blue
pike in Ontario, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Tennessee). Fishermen
have sent putative blue pike to Dr. Stepien and to the Fish and
Wildlife Service, but the DNA of those fish will not be tested
until the first phase of the project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Busch even has a fish that someone sent him eight years ago,
which he says has telltale blue-pikeness: a pointy nose, large eyes
and smaller size than a walleye.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I unwrapped it, my stomach jumped,'' Busch said. ``I have
seen hundreds of walleye and this was different.''
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists find living blue pike, they will focus on ways
to reintroduce them to Lake Erie. The lake is cleaner now, but
there would have to be an adequate food supply _ the lake herring
that blue pike ate tapered off decades ago and Busch said they
might have to restock that, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of this is somewhat controversial with some fishery managers
and the fish and wildlife agencies in the states with a border on
Lake Erie: Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. They are concerned that
before any fish are reintroduced, there should be solid proof not
only that the fish are blue pike but that they will not interbreed
with walleye or invade the walleye's habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have them back, but we want the original
ones, and that's the key,'' said Roger Knight, supervisor of the
Sandusky Fish Research Unit of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. ``You
can build false hopes and there may be pressure to stock blue fish
in Lake Erie, even if we're not sure they are the original blue
pike. We're not about to introduce another strain of walleye into
our lakes where our walleye are doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony knows the investigation could take years, but he is
hopeful it will show that the fish of his childhood is still around
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He winces to recall the waning years of the blue pike, when the
fish his father's workers caught contained no eggs, or eggs that
were deformed.
</P>
<P>
   After he caught his blue pike in 1962, the year after his father
died, he tried to conjure up ways to keep the breed from
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd meet a politician, I'd say `Just get me
permission to set a net and catch some blue pike and try spawning
them in holding tanks,''' said Anthony, who could no longer set
nets, because he had given up his commercial fishing license.
Later, Lake Erie commercial fishing was banned for a while because
of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they didn't think blue pike was really going to die
out,'' Anthony said, ``but I couldn't understand why they weren't
doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he bequeathed his frozen blue pike, Anthony has visited
Dr. Stepien's lab a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound corny, but I had a lot of feeling in that fish
_ it's a part of my life,'' he said. ``Now, they call it the
Anthony fish. I like that.''

   WARREN BUFFETT ATTACKS MANIPULATION OF EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report to shareholders, the investor Warren
Buffett makes an extraordinary attack on many of his fellow chief
executives, who he says have worked purposefully ``at manipulating
numbers and deceiving investors'' through accounting gimmicks and
misrepresentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many major corporations still play things straight, but a
significant and growing number of otherwise high-grade managers _
CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for your children or as
trustees under your will _ have come to the view that it's OK to
manipulate earnings to satisfy what they believe are Wall Street's
desires,'' Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 report.

   NANNY CONTROVERSY IS REVIVED

<P>
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' has stirred new controversy in the so-called
nanny murder in Massachusetts, in which Louise Woodward, a young
British woman accused of killing an infant, was freed by a judge
after being convicted of second-degree murder. ``60 Minutes''
broadcast a report on the case that raised questions about whether
the prosecution had correctly identified the cause of death,
leading to a flood of coverage in Boston, some of it critical.

   FUTURE LOOKING DIM FOR PAPERBACKS

<P>
   Since 1995, the number of mass-market paperbacks sold in the

   WARNINGS ABOUT YEAR 2000 SCAMS

<P>
   While many consumers have worried that year 2000 computer

   EX-EXECUTIVE AT CENTER OF SCANDAL

   CASTING A LINE INTO CYBERSPACE
</P>
<P>
   It may lack the aroma and open-air experience of a traditional
fish market, but starting this week seafood lovers will be able to
bid on Alaskan king crab leg gift packages, four-course dinners for
two and live Maine lobsters on the auction site Ubid.com. Hoping to

THEFT REPORT IS A `FARCE,' CHINA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also EXCLUSIVE-CHINA-MILITARY and CHINA-MILITARY-REACT) 
(DW) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's state news agency Sunday rejected assertions
that its spies stole nuclear-weapon designs from the United States
as a ``farce'' and a ``fabrication'' by forces out to sabotage
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary from its Washington bureau, the New China News
Agency singled out an article in The New York Times that first
publicly revealed the official suspicions of espionage, saying it
set off a ``smear campaign against China.''
</P>
<P>
   American investigators, the Times article on March 6 said,
suspect that in the late 1980s Chinese spies learned the American
design of an advanced, small nuclear warhead, and believe spying
efforts have continued. Last week, the prime suspect in the case, a
scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was dismissed for
security infractions, though he has not been charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story is a complete fabrication,'' said Sunday
Chinese commentary, and has ``fanned up a hullabaloo among
anti-China witch-hunters on the Capitol Hill and the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, China's foreign minister denounced the assertions of
nuclear spying as ``irresponsible'' and ``unfounded,'' but Sunday's
dispatch was China's strongest denunciation yet of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence, the commentary said, that the accusations
appeared as the two countries were preparing for the visit in April
of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington. ``In Washington,
whenever there is a visit by leaders between China and the United
States, there is a crusading farce against Beijing,'' it said.
``Some Americans concocted such stories as ``political donations''
and ``satellite secrets leakage'' just before exchanges of visits
in the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `lab theft' story, cooked up by anti-China forces in the
United States, is also designed to press the Clinton administration
into giving up its policy of `constructive engagement' with
China,'' the article said. ``This shortsighted attempt will get
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fabrication of `news' out of political opportunism is an
insult to the motto cherished by The New York Times, which says
`all the news that's fit to print,' '' it said. ``The distortion of
facts by a few congressmen shows that they are irresponsible in
dealing with serious political matters.''

TEMPLE UPSETS CINCINNATI

<P>
   BOSTON _ Temple coach John Chaney is fond of talking about how
his team is criticized in Philadelphia for its ugly-looking,
trademark matchup zone.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it didn't play well for the Cincinnati audience yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Cincinnati never completely solved the Owls'
defense yesterday and Temple advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first
time since 1993 with a 64-54 East Region victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach always tells us your will is stronger than your skill,''
Owls' guard Rasheed Brokenborough said. ``They tried to beat us
with their athletic ability rather than their heads. We knew early
they were not attacking the zone like you're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels good. A lot of people thought we going home. We
shocked a lot of people by going to the Sweet 16, but we're not
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple (23-10) jumped from a 6-6 tie to a 26-11 lead and led by
11 at the half. The Bearcats (27-6) closed to 35-29 seven minutes
into the second half. But Owls' guard Quincy Wadley _ who scored 14
off the bench _ nailed a three from the wing and Cincinnati never
again got as close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a hole and had a hard time getting out,''
Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said. ``Our whole deal coming in was
we had to do a better job on the glass and they beat us on the
offensive glass early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we cut it to six, we had the ball but didn't score. Then
they hit a three, we gave up two offensive rebounds and they took
it back to 11. We were continually fighting out of a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Barnes and Pepe Sanchez each had 15 for Temple. Guard
Melvin Levett led the Bearcats with 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The second round of Kosovo peace talks was set for
a desultory start in Paris on Monday with few in the Clinton
administration predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the grand ceremony that opened the first round of
negotiations in the French town of Rambouillet, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright had no plans to go to Paris, her aides said.
She invested substantial personal capital in the talks last month,
only to see them end in virtual collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And after watching its diplomatic offensive of the last 10 days,
involving Bob Dole and Richard C. Holbrooke, fade without result,
the Clinton administration was downplaying the final stage of the
talks. The negotiations are resuming as bloodshed continues and
even escalates in Kosovo, where marketplace bombs killed seven
people and wounded 58 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus in Washington is that there is little chance of
reaching an agreement,'' a senior official said. The Albanians'
refusal to sign the accord so far, the stubborn Serb refusal to
countenance foreign troops in Kosovo and the increasing violence
apparently have shifted the mood in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what the administration's strategy was to
resolve the conflict if, as is currently expected, the talks end
after several days.
</P>
<P>
   The best that the administration hoped to extract from Paris was
a &QL; 
signature from the ethnic Albanians on the plan presented at
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan calls for a three-year interim period of autonomy
for Kosovo, for the withdrawal of Serbian forces and for the
disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting
for the independence of Kosovo, which is ruled by Serbia but
dominated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But while the likelihood of an agreement from the ethnic
Albanian delegation appeared more likely than in the last two
weeks, it was still not certain they would sign on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to think they are going to sign,'' an adviser to the
ethnic Albanians said, choosing his words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   One promising point, diplomats said, was that Hashim Thaci, the
leader of the delegation and key member of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, arrived in Paris for the talks. He had eluded Western
officials in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the peace plan by the ethnic Albanians is the
critical step before NATO can threaten a tough bombing campaign of
the Serbs if the Government of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
leader, does not also accept the proposal _ and the 26,000 allied
peacekeepers to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that after the Paris talks, they
expected the focus to move to Belgrade where Milosevic remains as
recalcitrant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the options for forcing a peace plan looked so grim that one
senior administration official suggested that it might take another
massacre in Kosovo to galvanize momentum for a meaningful threat of
NATO airstrikes against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may turn out that we may need another Srebrenica before we &QL; 
have a Dayton,'' said the official, reviewing the options on
condition of anonymity. ``But wasn't Racak sufficient?'' The
massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces
led to NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs which in turn
enabled Holbrooke to build on earlier groundwork and organize talks
at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   A massacre in the Kosovo village of Racak of more than 40 ethnic
Albanians by Serbian forces in January spurred the current efforts
of Ms. Albright to persuade NATO to authorize air strikes against
the Serbs if they reject a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When the ethnic Albanians failed to agree to the peace plan, the
NATO threat against Milosevic was vitiated. As the president of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic is the leader of the two remaining Yugoslav
republics, Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo is a southern province of
Serbia where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana, was in Washington
today conferring with the administration's national security
adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and was expected to meet with Ms.
Albright Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, authorized by NATO in late January to unleash air
strikes against Milosevic if he did not agree to a peace
settlement, is reported to be disturbed about the credibility of
NATO as the threats of air strikes have lost their punch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holbrooke was sitting with Milosevic last week in
Belgrade telling him that if he did not agree to a peace settlement
NATO air strikes would result. Just at that time, American
diplomats who had been evacuated from Belgrade two weeks weeks
earlier because of the possibility of strikes were returning to
their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were also perturbed about
events on the ground in Kosovo, where Serbian security police and
Yugoslav soldiers were on the march and where the increasingly
well-armed Kosovo Liberation Army were getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Milosevic appeared to be thumbing his nose once
again at the West with an extraordinarily long news broadcast on
Serbian state-controlled television.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour of the program, which has been extended
frequently in recent days, was taken up with anti-NATO propaganda,
including such slogans as ``No NATO, we will fight NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the hysteria, there were laudatory
interviews with five waiters who were brought from neighboring
Macedonia to Belgrade as heroes because they claimed they had
beaten up NATO soldiers who had become drunk in their bar in the
Macedonian capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand NATO soldiers are in Macedonia ready for quick
deployment to Kosovo if a peace settlement is reached.

   BOSTON _ Purdue's unlikely venture into the NCAA Tournament
continued yesterday with a surprising 73-63 victory over Miami,
which was seeded second in the East Region.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers (21-12) ended the Hurricanes' most successful
season and landed a berth in the East semifinals against Temple on
Friday in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's victory gave the tournament's 10th seeds a 7-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better teams rated higher that this,'' Purdue coach
Gene Keady said. ``But to come back \Rfrom a 7-9 Big 10 season\S
and play like this the last two games _ I couldn't be prouder.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was marked with statistical anomalies. For instance,
Miami got 27 offensive rebounds, but made 25 of 76 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if went to the offensive boards we could create
problems for them,'' Hurricanes coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``But
to my surprise, we had 13 offensive rebounds in the first half and
still shot 18 percent. I've never seen 20 offensive rebounds we
couldn't put back in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Purdue. But when you
miss 17 point-blank layups, you've got to take some of the blame
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue shut down Miami's Johnny Hemsley, who nailed 9-of-12
3-pointers and scored 31 in a first-round victory over Lafayette.
He only got off two 3-pointers against the Boilers and missed both.
He finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure I was there every time he caught the
ball and make it tough for him to get looks and maybe rush some
shots,'' Boilers guard Alan Eldridge said. ``I'll end up getting a
lot of credit, but the team did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mario Bland hit Miami's only 3-pointer of the game in 14
attempts _ with 1:37 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue closed the first half with a 15-0 run, then outscored
Miami 13-2 when the Hurricanes got to five in the second half.
Brian Cardinal led a balanced attack with 20 points. Purdue scored
its last 19 points from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilers shot 57.9 percent, second-only to a 58.6 night in an
overtime victory over Indiana a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win,'' Keady said. ``We did a lot of good
things _ defense, hitting free throws and we had a couple of spurts
each half. The nine straight shutouts the last of the \Rfirst\S
half probably won the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami (23-7) set a school record for victories and won its
first-ever NCAA Tournament game, beating Lafayette in the first
round.

SOUTHWEST MISSOURI DANCES INTO DATE WITH DUKE

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ To help dramatize its opening, CBS Sports
asked Kevin Ault to read from a book titled ``Cinderella'' as it
rolled tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was kind of strange, but after what's happened, I
guess it sort of fit,'' the Southwest Missouri State guard said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in school history, the Bears are in the Sweet
16 and Cinderella is required reading. For the second consecutive
game, 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State (22-10) put the
defensive clamps on an opponent. Yesterday in the second round of
the East Regional, the Bears shackled Tennessee, 81-51.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team gave me 80 minutes of everything they had at the
defensive end and that was the difference,'' Southwest Missouri
State coach Steve Alford said of the Bears' effort in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Volunteers (21-9) shot 29.5 percent. Including
a first-round victory against Wisconsin on Friday, the Bears have
held opponents here to 28 percent shooting (30 of 108).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well and when you shoot 29 percent, you're not
going to beat any good teams,'' Tennessee coach Jerry Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Moore scored 25 points to lead the Bears. The 6-foot-11
center also hit both of his 3-point attempts. His first gave
Southwest Missouri State an 11-7 lead at 14:09 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee declined to double-team Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the first game all season I haven't been
doubled or tripled,'' said Moore, who was 8-of-14 from the field.
``I felt pretty good when I realized that they were going to guard
me with one man. My teammates got me the ball when I was open.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Southwest Missouri State advances to the Sweet 16 and faces
top-ranked, top-seeded, top-dog Duke in a semifinal game on Friday
in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about games like that,'' Southwest Missouri State
point guard William Fontleroy said. ``You just go out and give your
best, and when it's over it's over.''
DUKE 97, TULSA 56
</P>
<P>
   With 10:26 remaining against Tulsa, Duke's Elton Brand stretched
his 6-8, 260-pound body flat out during a floor-burn-inducing dive
for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   Key play in a tight game? Yes and no. At the time, the Blue
Devils had a 77-38 lead. But Brand's hustle was far from
meaningless. No matter the score or the time, Duke just plays.
Hard.
</P>
<P>
   That effort translated into another name-the-score blowout here
yesterday in the second round of the East Regional. The top-seeded
Blue Devils (34-1) won their 29th consecutive game with a 97-56
domination of ninth-seeded Tulsa (23-10).
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great players and they've got a killer instinct,''
Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``That appears to be a team on a
mission. They don't think like most humans. Most teams get a lead
that big, they let up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, a 99-58 first-round winner against Florida A&AMP;M, became the
first team in NCAA Tournament history to record two 40-point
victories in a single tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Duke took a 9-2 lead, but Tulsa pulled to within 9-8 with a 6-0
run. That spurt was started by a Marcus Hill 3-pointer made
possible when the Golden Hurricane hustled for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the next timeout, \Rcoach Mike Krzyzewski\S reminded us
nobody got on the floor for that loose ball,'' said Duke guard
Trajan Langdon, who returned from a foot injury to score 12 points
in 26 minutes. ``We take pride in making those kind of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That pride turned into a forget-about-it 30-5 run for a 39-13
lead 6:27 before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to too many loose balls,'' said Tulsa forward Michael
Ruffin, who was shut out in 34 minutes of play. ``They competed a
lot harder than we did. When we got down, most teams let up, they
kept competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa shot 33.9 percent for the game and was outrebounded 47-33.
Duke shot 48.7 percent and was 11-of-20 on 3-pointers, getting 3s
from six different players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at the scoreboard,'' said Duke point guard
William Avery, who had a team-high 19. ``We play every possession
like the score is 0-0.''

SLAYINGS OF 2 YOUNG NEW YORKERS BRING DIFFERENT PUBLIC RESPONSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY with GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two names almost rhyme, Watkins and Watson, like
an old-time song-and-dance team. They did not know each other, but
Amy Watkins and Marvin Watson were both young, both archetypes of
the New York newcomer. She was the Midwestern idealist come to the
big city, a graduate student hoping to become a social worker. He
was the striver from Jamaica, an immigrant who became an
electrician and was saving money for his unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   They both came to the city to better themselves, and they lived
barely a mile apart in Brooklyn. They could have shared the same
subway into Manhattan and never known it. In the early morning of
Jan. 16, Watson, 22, was stabbed to death outside his father's
ninth-floor apartment in a Crown Heights public housing project. He
had tried to save his brother from an attack and ended up dead
himself. Last Monday night, about seven weeks later, Ms. Watkins,
26, was walking from the subway to her Prospect Heights apartment
when she was stabbed in the back and left for dead on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the two attacks are not related, but they are paired
nonetheless: They are the only two homicides reported so far this
year in the three-mile rectangle that makes up Brooklyn's 77th
Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Watkins' death has attracted national attention,
Watson died anonymously. Her death led Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to
reassure the public, and more than two dozen investigators were
assigned to the case, which remains unsolved, within a day. Police
handled his case routinely and made an arrest after a month. Her
death inspired sensational tabloid covers last week and had
television reporters camped at the scene of the crime. His death
went unreported by the tabloids and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the killings were treated differently, they each touched
on fears held deeply by many New Yorkers, even as crime has fallen
in the city. Ms. Watkins' death evoked the image of a woman
brutally attacked on a dark street. She lived in a diverse,
gentrifying neighborhood much like other once-neglected areas that
are now attracting middle-class professionals. Her photographs show
a smiling, brown-haired woman; to many people, she looked too
familiar, like a favorite friend or a relative in a picture on the
mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's death represents the immigrant's nightmare. He was a
poor black man who died in the projects. A slender man who wore his
hair in short dreadlocks, he came to New York to do better than his
father and to have his son do yet better. Instead, he was buried in
a New Jersey cemetery two weeks before his son was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't understand why a person who was doing so good,
who had so much going for him, had it all taken away from him for
nothing,'' said Doris McKenzie, the mother of Watson's baby.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where most homicides occur in poor minority
neighborhoods, the circumstances of Ms. Watkins' death did not fit
the usual profile. The case of Watson did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amy Watkins killing broke out of the pattern of the usual
carnage,'' said Robert McCire, chairman of the Department of Law,
Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay
College. ``That grabbed the attention of the public because people
say, `That could have been me, my friend or my children in that
situation.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unacceptable as it is,'' he added, ``Marvin Watson's death
does not appeal to public sympathy as Amy Watkins' does.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Watson was his father's favorite son. He had his father's
high cheekbones, his narrow chin and his wiry, muscular build. The
father, Vivian Watson, came to New York in 1986 after his wife
died, leaving his four children with another family in Kingston,
Jamaica. He worked as a security guard, saved his money, and sent
for his children in 1994. When they arrived, he moved into the
Albany Houses, a public housing complex in Crown Heights where he
could rent a three-bedroom apartment for $305 a month. His three
sons shared a small bedroom less than 10 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Watson had been asleep when, at 5:30 on a Saturday
morning, he heard shouting in the ninth-floor hallway. His youngest
brother, Nakia, had been playing cards with friends for much of the
night one floor below. Police said one of the players was a
convicted felon named Phillip Gardner. An argument erupted and the
players scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Gardner chased at least one card player
upstairs to the Watson apartment, waking Marvin, who opened the
door. When Marvin stepped into the hallway, police said, Gardner
stabbed him in the chest. But Vivian Watson said Gardner was
chasing three people, including Nakia. Marvin heard Nakia yelling
in the hallway, Vivian Watson said, and jumped from bed to help
him.
</P>
<P>
   With a knife in his chest, Marvin staggered back into the
apartment and collapsed in the doorway of his father's bedroom.
``When I turned him around,'' Vivian Watson said, ``the blood was
coming so fast, like a river.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, 34, was arrested a month after the attack and charged
with second-degree murder. Sgt. Ellen Tietjan, a police
spokeswoman, said Gardner had prior convictions dating back to 1982
for larceny, assault, burglary, drug and weapons possession and
menacing. Vivian Watson said Gardner lived on the 14th floor
despite laws prohibiting convicted felons from living in public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those types of people are not supposed to live here,'' Vivian
Watson said. ``They're like pit bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Who killed Amy Watkins remains a question police have not
answered and her friends cannot comprehend. The rough outline
remains unchanged: Last Monday night, she got off the D train at
the Seventh Avenue stop, bought groceries on Flatbush Avenue and
walked down Park Place toward her apartment. About two blocks away,
someone apparently robbed her and stabbed her once in the back with
a kitchen knife. Whether it was a random attack or one aimed
specifically at Ms. Watkins remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   People who did not know her were shocked by the brutality of the
attack. People who did know her were saddened by the loss of a
person they described as extraordinary. She grew up in Topeka,
Kan., and enrolled at the University of Kansas to become a painter.
But a year and a half into college, she switched her major from art
to social work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say she went into social work because she was more
interested in the people who were painting than the actual
paintings,'' said Jack Lerner, an ex-boyfriend now attending
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to New York last year to attend Hunter College's
prestigious graduate school in social work. Her schedule required
an internship, and she worked about 25 hours a week at New
Settlement Apartments, a housing complex in the Bronx with a social
service outreach. She counseled battered women, leading a Wednesday
night support group. She led a candlelight vigil to protest
domestic abuse in October.
</P>
<P>
   At New Settlement, she also met her boyfriend, Adam Green, whom
she began dating about four months ago. He lived in Prospect
Heights, too, about a block from her. They began riding the subway
home together. Usually, he said, they would take the 4 train. But
on the night Ms. Watkins died, the couple took the D train out of
the Bronx. They talked about Green's recent trip to Puerto Rico
until he got off at 125th Street and transferred to the local. He
was meeting his parents for dinner on the Upper West Side. He said
that Ms. Watkins had decided not to come, but that they were
planning to spend the following evening together.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The night before his death, Marvin Watson arrived at about 7
p.m. at the East New York apartment that his girlfriend, Doris
McKenzie, shares with her parents. She is 18, and she had dated
Watson for two and a half years. Their baby was due in a month, and
they were preparing for a baby shower the next day.
</P>
<P>
   They had decided to name him Andre Elijah Watson. ``He was
excited about everything about the baby,'' Ms. McKenzie said of
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKenzie liked that Watson was ambitious. He was a
meticulous dresser who wore nice shoes and brand-name clothes like
Tommy Hilfiger or Polo. He played soccer in Prospect Park as often
as he could, but he also graduated from trade school as an
electrician. He had gotten work in Manhattan. He had plans.
</P>
<P>
   With the baby coming, Ms. McKenzie said, he began saving money
so he could move out of the housing projects into a place of his
own. He wanted her and the baby to join him. They had talked about
getting married, but not yet. He wanted to join an electricians'
union. He applied for a position with the Metropolitan Transit
Authority. He turned 22 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Watson cooked enough curry chicken on the night before the baby
shower for the 25 or 30 guests expected. The couple got a large
room inside a nearby preschool to accommodate the crowd. Ms.
McKenzie said the thought of so many friends bringing gifts for his
unborn baby thrilled Watson. She spent an hour braiding his hair
because he wanted to look just right.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2 a.m., Watson drove home to Albany Houses. He
called to let Ms. McKenzie know that he had arrived safely, but her
father answered the telephone. She had already fallen asleep.
</P>
<P>
   A line in the movie ``The Wizard of Oz'' has been transformed in
the popular culture into a wry warning to anyone arriving off the
hay truck in the big city: You're not in Kansas anymore. The quip
takes on a cruel meaning in the case of Amy Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   But her friends say Ms. Watkins was exactly where she wanted to
be, doing exactly what she wanted to do. Her memorial service on
Friday was attended by a United Nations of mourners. Walter
Thompson, a fellow Hunter student, surveyed the crowd and
understood why so many people came.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a nice person _ to everybody,'' he said. ``She
was genuine. She would smile and you had to smile back. She was
just a nice person. What she did she did with grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Her best friend, Abbe Basin, said Ms. Watkins loved animals but
was allergic to cats. Ms. Basin said her friend could not resist
touching and stroking her cat whenever she visited. ``Amy comes
over and takes all this medicine, antihistamines,'' recalled Ms.
Basin, also a student at Hunter's School of Social Work. ``She
would touch the cat and wash her hands and touch the cat again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lawrence Watkins, a private school teacher who once
was a Presbyterian minister, said in an interview that the attacker
was probably the sort of person his daughter would have tried to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never dealt with people in the abstract,'' he said. ``She
was really there, really listening. She achieved something, in the
brief time she had to live. Her life was not half-lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Elijah Watson was born Feb. 20 at 11:52 a.m. at St. Mary's
Hospital in Brooklyn. He weighed 8 pounds, 11 ounces. He arrived
fatherless, with a head of dark, silky hair and eyes as brown as
melted chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Doris McKenzie's happy sleep the night before the baby shower
ended at about 7 a.m. A relative of Watson's called to tell her
about the stabbing, and after some thought she decided to have the
baby shower. She said she did not want to inconvenience her guests.
They arrived and brought gifts and ate Watson's curry chicken.
People tried to act happy, even when she cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is planning for life as a single mother. Her high
school graduation portrait on the wall shows a smiling, glamorous
young woman in a sleeveless dress. She began freshman classes at
City College last fall, but she stopped to care for Andre. She said
she plans to resume school this summer. She wants to become an
architect. She said she doesn't blame anyone for her misfortune;
her child is her gift.
</P>
<P>
   She has filled a scrapbook with photographs of Watson and
mementos of his life. ``So that when Andre gets older I can show
him the pictures of Marvin and let him know what his father was
like,'' she said. ``Even though Marvin was not here, I want him to
be able to say he had a father, to feel like he knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   He will see pictures of a smiling man lying on the grass of
Prospect Park with his soccer team, relaxing on a job in Manhattan
with members of his work crew. Andre will also see a $2 bill on
which his father had written a note to his mother:
</P>
<P>
   ``To my Empress
</P>
<P>
   my Queen
</P>
<P>
   my love
</P>
<P>
   of my life
</P>
<P>
   my baby mother''
</P>
<P>
   There are no clippings in the scrapbook, no newspaper stories
about Watson's death, because none were written. On Thursday, as
she rocked Andre in her arms, Ms. McKenzie said she knew about Amy
Watkins. She heard about her death on the news and in the papers.
She didn't seem surprised or upset that the Watkins case had
attracted so much attention while the Watson case had attracted so
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess because of the way she was killed, out on the street
like that,'' she said. ``And nobody knows who did it. There are a
lot of killings in New York, and I don't think all of them could be
covered.''

<P>
   Toddlers practice coloring inside the lines on computer
workstations at a Queens public library, their feet dangling
because the chairs are too high. Fourth graders in Westchester
County check stock quotations on the Internet, arching their necks
at mom or dad's computer, to complete a homework assignment about
investing.
</P>
<P>
   At a public school in upper Manhattan, students balance
keyboards on their knees because there is no room in front of the
monitors. And at an after-school computer center on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, children brush up on spelling with their arms
stretched taut toward the keyboard and their fingers clenched
around the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   These boys and girls are the first generation of American
children to learn computing along with colors and ABCs. And they
are coming of age at a time when the nation's elected leaders, from
the White House to the local school board, are calling for a
computer on every desk by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rush to bring all the latest technology to every
child in the nation, experts say there have been virtually no
efforts to ensure that children have appropriate equipment and
furniture, and proper training in posture and keyboard technique.
</P>
<P>
   While experts said they could not predict the level of future
problems among children, there is wide concern among physicians,
physical therapists and ergonomists that a tide of injuries,
mirroring those sustained by adults in certain professions, is
inevitable as young people spend more time on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time somebody paid attention,'' said Jane M. Healy, an
educational psychologist who spent more than two years watching
children working on computers while she researched a book,
``Failure To Connect (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998). ``What I saw, all
over the country, was just appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only the most embryonic research about whether children
are vulnerable to the repetitive stress injuries that have
afflicted 20 million American adults, making such disorders the No.
1 workplace injury in America. To date, only one study on computer
workstations and children has been published in the United States,
in last month's issue of the journal Computers in the Schools.
</P>
<P>
   In that study, a team of researchers from Cornell University
observed third, fourth and fifth graders and found a ``striking
misfit'' between the children and the equipment and a ``marked lack
of attention and commitment'' to correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all the children worked with craned necks, hunched
shoulders or flexed wrists. The researchers concluded that at least
4 in 10 were at risk of serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on such early research, and extrapolating from the
well-documented experience of adults, about two dozen experts
interviewed said they believed that risks to children would
multiply as society and schools became more computerized.
</P>
<P>
   They said that with at least 70 percent of America's 30 million
elementary school students already using computers _ at school, at
home or both _ many children could suffer sore wrists, tingling
fingers, aching backs or worse if they failed to practice safe
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think children play with computers, they don't work
with computers,'' said Alan Hedge, one of the Cornell researchers.
``But there is no reason to assume that what happened to adults
won't happen to children, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Several designers of software and hardware said they had
received no reports of children injured from computing and did not
want to overstate the risks. While their own observations, part of
the development of new products, suggested that a problem was
brewing, they said that only proper research could determine its
extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this situation cries out for a systematic assessment,''
said Erik Strommen, who heads the research and design group for
children's products at Microsoft. ``And the simplest thing to do in
the meantime is be guided by what we know about adults.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By all accounts, children who have already sought treatment have
been injured playing games, like Nintendo, which require a steady
pounding of controls with thumbs and mesmerize children in awkward
postures in front of television screens for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomists have already observed children, despite their
flexible young bodies, rubbing their hands and shrugging kinks out
of their shoulders as they work at computers.
</P>
<P>
   And as educational software evolves, experts said, the programs,
too, could rivet the attention of young people who would otherwise
be squirming and thus naturally protecting themselves from injuries
caused, in part, by long motionless periods in contorted postures.
</P>
<P>
   One child entranced by this emerging software is 4-year-old
Claudia Martinez, who craned her head toward the screen one recent
afternoon as she worked at a program called Kendra's Coloring Book
at the new $35 million public library in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother watched proudly, saying she was unconcerned by the
girl's awkward pose, but disappointed that she was limited to 20
minutes during busy hours. Ruth Herzberg, the branch manager,
boasted about the computer skills Claudia was learning, taking no
note of her poor posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how her attention's not diverted at all,'' Ms.
Herzberg said. ``Usually a child that age is not good at
concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and educators are not willfully ignoring the health
risks of poor computing habits, experts say. It is more that they
are preoccupied with the educational opportunities of the
burgeoning technology.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is widespread even among those who are teaching
children computer skills and installing equipment in schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Score, an Upper West Side after-school computer center, there
are adjustable chairs, but nobody adjusts them, even for toddlers.
``I never thought of it,'' said Jaime Rissin, one of the peppy
young instructors who reward each completed lesson with a
high-five.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Dow's Lane Elementary School in suburban Irvington, N.Y.,
where the Board of Education recently embarked on a $1
million-a-year technology initiative, every classroom is to be
equipped with high-speed T-1 telecommunications lines, digital
cameras and color scanners. But children still work at the
computers in old-fashioned library chairs at one-size-fits-all
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never dawned on me,'' said Don Beverly, the district's
technology director, ``and that's the gut truth. But we will look
at that in the future, before it gets to be a liability issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when guidance is offered, it is sometimes rebuffed. Karen
Jacobs, president of the American Occupational Therapy Association,
taught classes in ``healthy computing'' at her daughter's middle
school in a Boston suburb, showing 600 children how to stretch,
take frequent breaks and make their workstations more comfortable
by sitting on dictionaries, stuffing gym shorts to cushion the
smalls of their backs and using their backpacks as footrests.
</P>
<P>
   But when she sent fliers to parents offering free consultations
on modifying home workstations, she got no responses. ``Parents are
more concerned with how fast they can get on the Internet, whether
they have the right math games,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs recommends makeshift solutions that do not
necessarily include fancy equipment, which is financially out of
reach of many families and school districts. In New York City, for
example, where school buildings are literally crumbling, adjustable
desks and chairs are not high on anybody's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are into very basic stuff,'' said Philip Russo, a spokesman
for the Board of Education. ``Safe, warm and dry _ that's the
mantra.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts said that some basic ergonomic training would be a
cost-efficient intervention with children that might prevent
injuries as they moved on to college and jobs. School officials
interviewed agreed that such training would be a good idea. But
they remain focused on teaching both staff members and students how
to use the programs on their new computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvington teachers, for example, are offered seminars in
desktop publishing and PowerPoint presentations, but none in
ergonomic training. Likewise, the students, 75 percent of whom are
also online at home, are taught to search the Internet for
documents from the Colonial era and to e-mail scientists at the
Bronx Zoo, but not to stretch and to rest.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few small efforts to teach safe computing to
children. On the Web site of the American Occupational Therapy
Association, parents can download screen-savers with safety
instructions. And the Garnett Foundation in Burlingame, Calif.,
which runs programs to interest girls in technology careers,
distributes mouse pads with illustrations of good computer posture.
</P>
<P>
   There are also specialty products, including touch-screens to
avoid mice or joysticks, large track balls for little hands and
software that reminds users to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that ergonomic training and specialized
equipment are half measures without follow-up at home by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs' 30-minute classes at the Andover West Middle School,
for example, bore only temporary fruit, according to her
12-year-old daughter, Ariel. ``For a little while they were doing
the things my mom taught them, and then they forgot about it,''
Ariel said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference parents can make, experts say, is in
limiting the hours children spend on computers. In some households,
children boot up before breakfast and again at 3 p.m., remaining
online until bedtime. In other households, computer time is
rationed along with television, which has been documented as having
adverse effects on children.
</P>
<P>
   And the range of parental approaches is just as wide among
ergonomists.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Gillespie, an ergonomic consultant and graduate student at
New York University, permits no computing at home for her
6-year-old son and cringes at the notion that children are playing
Legos on the screen instead of on the living room rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an actual Luddite,'' Ms. Gillespie said. ``But my gut
feeling is kids don't need to use computers to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Jacobs' 14-year-old son, Josh, is a computer
junkie. On school days, he is online for about three hours, and on
weekends the monitor never goes dark. He gossips with friends on
America Online. He surfs the Net. He downloads games.
</P>
<P>
   But Josh is confident that he is not hurting himself because he
has a cordless keyboard that allows him to roam while he types,
rather than sit motionless in a chair. ``I can walk around while
I'm typing and lie in bed so my back and neck don't hurt,'' he
said. ``My mom thinks it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. ``Did he say he does it in bed a lot?'' Ms. Jacobs
asked. ``I'll have to watch him more closely.''

<P>
   NOVO SELO, Yugoslavia _ On a tranquil Sunday morning, the
residents of this village were chatting in the sun outside their
local shop, or working among the chickens in the walled courtyards
of their houses.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful scene belied the fear that lurks here, in one of
the few mixed villages left in Serbia's Kosovo province, a place
where Serbs and ethnic Albanians live side by side in apparent
harmony. They are surrounded by violence, and as the conflict
escalates around them, they are clinging desperately to the hope
that peace will reach them before war does.
</P>
<P>
   The previous day had been bad, said Ibrahim Maxhuni, 35, an
unemployed ethnic Albanian trader. Some of the villagers had been
in the nearby town of Mitrovica when a bomb exploded in the market
place. Not long before, two other bombs had exploded in another
local town, Podujevo. By Sunday, the toll was seven people killed
and 57 wounded in the three blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the villagers had listened for hours as Serbian tanks
and artillery shelled the other side of their valley. All night,
they had watched the fires as neighboring villages burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it in the neighborhood and you wait for it in your own
home,'' said Rasim Maxhuni, a retired lawyer and another member of
the Maxhuni clan here. ``Everything is working up toward the
finale.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence erupted just as delegates from both sides
were leaving for Paris, where peace talks that stalled two weeks
ago resume on Monday. A political agreement seems within reach, but
the two sides are still far apart over carrying out the deal, with
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, Serbia's leader, still
refusing to contemplate the presence of a foreign peacekeeping
force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Novo Selo, Serbs and Albanians alike expressed hope that the
talks would bring peace, but said they could trust only in foreign
pressure on Serbia. ``If the West gets serious, they will sign,''
Rasim Maxhuni said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ibrahim Maxhuni said he expected the situation on the
ground in Kosovo to worsen. ``You could have a lot of bombings and
killings before the peace talks are over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Novo Selo has not been touched so far, probably because it is a
mixed village, and because there were no Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas in the village, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they worry. Serbian tanks and military units are positioned
only a mile away. Paramilitary groups and armed Serbian civilians
are active in the area, they said, and could come into the village
and attack Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to those in the village, but we are afraid of
groups from outside,'' said Sabri Maxhuni, the local shopkeeper. He
said no one went out after 5 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn off the lights in the evening,'' he said. ``We are
afraid someone might shoot from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed Serbian policemen patrol the village twice a week, he
said, adding, ``We usually hide inside until they pass.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs in the village the fears are different, but no
less real. There are 53 Serbian families here and some 300 ethnic
Albanian families, a mixture that is slightly less disproportionate
than the general breakdown in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mica Kostic, 62, has lived with her husband and sons in the
village for nearly 40 years, and her family traces its roots in
Kosovo back some 300 years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very hard,'' she said, wiping a roughened hand over
her lined face. ``But we trust in our future and in our neighbors.
Our neighbors are not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the villagers always have maintained good relations
with one another. Yet she more than anyone here has been touched by
the war. She was in the market in Mitrovica, selling vegetables,
when the bomb exploded on Saturday, she said. Her cousin was killed
last year by unknown people when he was driving across the
province, and another relative was shot dead recently in a mixed
village across the valley.
</P>
<P>
   That village, Bukos, is no longer mixed, because after the
killing, Serbian security forces moved in and caused the Albanian
villagers to flee. Mrs. Kostic refused to contemplate the same
happening in Novo Selo and said she would never think of leaving
the village or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent, I will never go,'' she said. Yet the
Serbs in the village had evacuated all their children just days
before, as the conflict escalated in the neighborhood, she
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic should accept the peace proposal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everyone it would be better if he signs,'' she said. ``It
would bring back normal life. I think the Albanians think the same.
It would be good for the situation to calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing at the farmland behind her house, she said, ``It is
time to start working.''
</P>
<P>
   She longs for the return of her grandchildren. ``It is like the
house of the dead without them,'' she said. ``But it is good they
do not know fear.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Tabitha Walrond, a 19-year-old welfare
recipient, gave birth to her first child on June 27, 1997, she did
what new mothers rich and poor are urged to do these days: she
breast-fed her baby. But on August 27th, seven weeks after leaving
the hospital, the son she had named Tyler Isaac Walrond died in her
arms of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walrond goes on trial Tuesday in the Bronx, charged with
recklessly causing Tyler's death by failing to nourish him
adequately and by failing to obtain prompt medical attention when
his condition became dire.
</P>
<P>
   The case is unusual because while some nursing mothers have
problems producing enough breast milk, it is rare for a baby to die
as a result, and rarer still for the mother to then be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for women and the poor contend that Tyler's death was
not a crime, but a tragedy that reflects hidden perils of
breast-feeding and obstacles to health care for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, urged in their efforts by Tyler's father, say
that Ms. Walrond was responsible for the baby's death because she
did not heed warnings and obvious signs that he was starving. The
most compelling evidence, they said, are photographs of the
emaciated infant taken eight days before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at the pictures,'' said Steve Reed,
a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson.
``Any reasonable person would look at this and say the baby looked
like something out of Biafra.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree on one point: Tyler's death should have been
prevented. But prosecutors focus on the last days of Tyler's life,
while Ms. Walrond's defenders say the circumstances that put him in
such jeopardy were shaped much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tipograph, Ms. Walrond's lawyer, says that the young
mother nursed her son faithfully, not realizing that her supply of
breast milk was inadequate. Routine pediatric checkups would have
caught the problem, but records show that although Tyler was
entitled to such care under Medicaid, efforts to enroll him in that
health insurance program for the poor were rebuffed or delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lactation experts say that photographs can be misleading,
because a nursing mother with insufficient breast milk typically
fails to recognize even drastic weight loss until it is pointed out
by a pediatrician with a baby scale because she sees the baby every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was unaware of it, Ms. Walrond was at great risk
for difficulties in breast-feeding. At age 15, she had breast
reduction surgery, which experts say greatly increases the chances
of insufficient breast milk. But her medical records indicate that
the surgery's significance went unrecognized during her prenatal
and postpartum care.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tyler's father, Keenan Purcell, and his mother saw
the 7-week-old baby on a visit, the boy looked so skinny that they
urged Ms. Walrond and her mother to feed him formula, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Walronds, confident of the superiority of breast milk
and bitterly estranged from the Purcell family, insisted that Tyler
was in good health, both sides agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on August 27, Ms. Walrond found her son
unresponsive in his bassinet. He died on the way to a hospital
emergency room, weighing about five pounds, almost three pounds
less than the day he was born at the Jack D. Weiler Hospital
division of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Because women have breast-fed their babies throughout history,
many people assume it comes naturally. In fact, problems arise in
some cases, but those in which a baby dies or is permanently
injured for lack of milk are extremely unusual, experts said, and
they are rarely, if ever, prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Zion Cox, the son of a nurse and a minister, died in Colorado in
1995. A baby in Cincinnati had a leg amputated because of blood
clots related to dehydration. A an infant in Norfolk, Va., suffered
permanent brain damage because of inadequate breast milk. None of
the parents faced charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Tatiana Cheeks, 21, of Brooklyn, who had been
breast-feeding her baby daughter, was accused of homicide after the
6-week-old died of malnutrition. Ms. Cheeks had brought her baby to
an outpatient clinic of New York Methodist Hospital for a checkup,
but was turned away for lack of Medicaid coverage or money to pay a
$25 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office dropped the charges
after hearing from lactation experts. Later, the State Department
of Health faulted the hospital for its role.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Walrond case different, besides the photographs
and the additional weeks Tyler went without medical care, legal
experts suggested, are angry paternal relatives pushing for
punishment. ``As far as I'm concerned, she is a monster that I did
not protect my son from,'' Purcell said of Ms. Walrond, who faces
up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates contend that what sets the Walrond case apart from
those in other states is the mother's poverty and a reaction to
notorious cases of child abuse that has made New York too quick to
prosecute poor parents. Until Ms. Tipograph took over the defense,
they add, Ms. Walrond's legal representation, unlike Ms. Cheeks',
was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly that in both cases the infants' deaths are
attributable to failures in health care provision for poor New
Yorkers, rather than criminal negligence on the part of their
mothers,'' Ronnie Eldridge, a city councilwoman from Manhattan,
wrote prosecutors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marianne Neifert, an authority on breast-milk insufficiency
syndrome and director of a lactation center in Denver, estimates
that the problem affects up to 5 percent of nursing mothers. At
first, starving babies may compensate, she said, using their own
fat and slowing their growth, but otherwise not acting sick. Then,
sometimes suddenly, she said, the baby rapidly declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen to anybody,'' said Dr. Neifert, who has agreed
to testify for the defense. ``To expect the mother to make these
self-assessments is completely unrealistic and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By law, Tyler was entitled to automatic Medicaid coverage from
birth. In practice, experts in health care financing say, a city
caseworker had to approve and secure Tyler's enrollment in
Medicaid. This process became caught up in bureaucratic delays and
mistaken computer rejections, in part because Ms. Walrond, who was
finishing high school, was living with her mother, a former state
hospital aide, and was a dependent on her public assistance case.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Walrond received her prenatal care through a
Medicaid managed care plan at the HIP (Health Insurance Plan of New
York) Medical Group in the Bronx, Tyler was supposed to be enrolled
there even before birth.
</P>
<P>
   The Walronds said that because the baby lacked a Medicaid
number, they were turned away when they tried to schedule his
checkup at HIP.
</P>
<P>
   The family's frustrated efforts to comply with the rules started
four months before Tyler's birth, they said, and involved separate
trips to at least three city offices, including one to Tremont
Multi-Service Center Number 41 six days before he died.
</P>
<P>
   According to a written account prepared by HIP last year in
response to a State Department of Health query, HIP asked the city
several times for the identification number needed to pre-enroll
Tyler as a HIP member, beginning five months before his birth. Each
time, the city's Medicaid computer system rejected the request,
classifying his eligibility as ``pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Creggett, director of public affairs at HIP's corporate
offices, said that company policy required care to be extended in
such cases and that HIP had no record of Ms. Walrond seeking an
appointment for her son.
</P>
<P>
   The Walronds' city caseworker would not discuss the case, but
the Walronds say she told them that Tyler's Medicaid coverage would
start after his Social Security card and birth certificate were
issued. When Purcell became alarmed at the baby's appearance, he
said, he called a different clinic and was told that it required
the same documents.
</P>
<P>
   Recent federal investigations and court rulings have found that
New York City welfare policies that are intended to push poor
mothers from public assistance to work and self-reliance have made
it harder for them to enroll their children in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, Tyler was never seen by a pediatrician at
the HIP center, HIP's account acknowledged, not even after Ms.
Walrond proudly brought the baby to her own postpartum checkup, and
her doctor noticed that Tyler, then almost 5 weeks old, looked
underweight. That doctor, Ohmad Rotenberg, would not discuss the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her breast reduction surgery, Ms. Walrond suffered
complications in childbirth that experts said should have alerted
doctors to potential breast-feeding problems. Because of fetal
distress, Tyler was delivered by Caesarean section and Ms. Walrond
developed a fever and blood clots that kept her in the hospital for
12 days. In that time, she was allowed to nurse only for the first
three days and the last two, because she was being treated with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the hospital, a division of Montefiore Medical
Center, reflect confusion over whether the baby was going to be
breast- or formula-fed at home. Follow-up care is listed as HIP,
but with no appointment date.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Silverman, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said, ``We are
confident that all the medical and ancillary care were
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that
breast-feeding newborns be checked after they have been home for 48
hours. But pediatricians still typically schedule a baby's first
checkup at 2 weeks of age, with a second checkup at 6 weeks for
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walrond, now a college student, met Purcell when they were
children at the Love Gospel Assembly, where his mother taught
Sunday school and she and her own mother still attend services
twice a week. By Purcell's account, they broke up after she refused
to get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when she was six months pregnant, he informed her in the
HIP waiting room that he had a new girlfriend who was also having
his baby. Distraught, Ms. Walrond asked her doctor for an abortion.
She quickly dropped the request, but it is part of her medical
record.
</P>
<P>
   After Tyler was born, Purcell went to court to secure visitation
rights, and would have sought custody of the child, he said, except
that he lacked the means to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Tyler's parents are haunted by his death. Purcell said
he thinks of his dead baby when he looks at his other son, now 16
months old. In interviews, Ms. Walrond's tear-streaked face still
lights up when she recalls her 3 a.m. breast-feedings with Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he would hear my voice, you'd see his little face turning
in my direction, and his eyes would open wide and he'd stop
crying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Months after Tyler died, two different Medicaid cards and a HIP
membership in his name arrived in the mail.

KIPLAGAT'S RUN AT RECORD IS ILL-TIMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DALZIEL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything was in place Sunday morning for Lornah
Kiplagat to begin her quest for a third straight L.A. Marathon
title.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Kenyan woke up at 5:30 a.m., had a bowl of
cereal and washed down a bagel with some tea. More importantly,
Kiplagat was physically ready to take on the 26.2-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling absolutely OK,'' she said. ``I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kiplagat, everything didn't turn out OK.
</P>
<P>
   Right before she hit the 10th mile, Kiplagat came to a complete
stop on Olympic Boulevard. She bent over and put her hands on her
knees. A few seconds later, she slowly started walking, but she
wasn't going forward. Instead she was making her way to the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplagat sat there on the curb, spitting up phlegm and refusing
water from various on-lookers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after being taken to her downtown hotel, she would find
out she was coming down with bronchitis. Kiplagat's vision of
becoming the first three-time winner in the 14-year history of the
race vanished before her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started the race not feeling any problems,'' Kiplagat said.
``I had no problems with my legs. The first two or three miles I
felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed they (the leaders in the pack) were using was
perfect. I thought it would be a perfect time to run a good race,
and I'm absolutely sure I would break 2:30:00.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Kiplagat reached the fourth mile, the symptoms hit her,
and it was downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the fourth mile it was hard for me to breathe,'' she
said. ``I couldn't understand. Then at the sixth mile I was
coughing; then I started coughing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the seventh mile it was hard for me to breathe and I
continued to cough. I've seen it before and I didn't want to take a
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Kiplagat felt this way was in 1997 at the Chicago
Marathon. But in the Windy City, the flu-like symptoms didn't begin
until halfway through the race, but she finished.
</P>
<P>
   Barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just my muscles getting tired,'' she
recalled. ``I finished, but I was in a daze when I went through the
finish line and then I collapsed and was unconscious for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sunday) I realized I saw the same thing happening and I
didn't want to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of the few dozen media members after the race,
Kiplagat kept a positive attitude about not finishing the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be angry,'' she said about pulling out. ``This is
just beginning; I'm not even halfway in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the human body and we have to accept what happens.
This is something that I didn't expect, so why should I be angry? I
have no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Marathon president Bill Burke expects Kiplagat to be ready
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lornah has carved herself a very special place in this history
of the marathon,'' Burke said. ``Like she said, she's young, and I
expect her to be back here and win it again.''

BOSTON MEDIA FAULT `60 MINUTES' FOR NANNY REPORT  
 A WRITER WITH A PAST TURNS TO ADVERTISING  
 THE CELEBRITY AUTHOR WHO SAT AND WROTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The so-called Nanny murder stirred widespread debate in 1997,
especially after Louise Woodward, a young British woman accused of
killing an infant in her charge, was freed by a judge after being
convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the controversy was back in full force, especially in
Boston, where the trial took place, after CBS' ``60 Minutes''
broadcast a two-segment report on the case that raised questions
about whether the prosecution had even identified the correct cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' report, presented by Mike Wallace, introduced
a medical expert, Dr. Floyd Gillis, chief of neuropathology at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, who declared that Matthew
Eappen, the 8-month-old victim, did not die of shaken-baby
syndrome, as had been asserted during the trial, but was strangled.
He also suggested that the baby showed signs of ``serial abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The report set off a flood of further coverage, some of it
critical, especially from The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald.
The news department of the CBS station in Boston, WBZ, held a
discussion with Wallace, which several people called combative, the
day after the report was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Bogdanich, one of the producers of the report, said on
Friday that ``60 Minutes'' had anticipated some heated reaction
because ``we were saying everyone in the case was wrong and a lot
of people have their careers invested in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   A major criticism was that the report did not adequately
identify a doctor who supported Gillis' findings, Dr. Marvin
Nelson. He is chief of radiology at the same hospital and was a
paid consultant for the defense in the case. Wallace did in fact
report that Nelson had been in contact with the defense and had not
been called to testify. He said in subsequent interviews that the
report should have noted that the doctor had received $700 for his
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Boston news reports also cited a letter sent to CBS by 77
doctors who called the strangulation theory ``preposterous'' and
urged the network to apologize to the infant's parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace said Friday that the program would include a
statement backing the report. And Bogdanich noted that the program
had not taken a position that Ms. Woodward was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward's lawyers said they intended to ``investigate the
evidence presented on `60 Minutes.''' How this might affect the
ultimate disposition of the case is unclear. Ms. Woodward, whom
Wallace interviewed for the report, is now studying law in England.
</P>
<P>
   _ BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   A Writer With a Past Turns to Advertising
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Shalit, a former associate editor at The New Republic whose
quick rise to prominence as a political reporter was halted by
charges of plagiarism, has found a new calling: advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Ms. Shalit, 28, who left The New Republic at the
end of January, began her new job helping to develop ad-campaign
strategies at Mad Dogs and Englishmen, an advertising agency in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalit said one of the main reasons she decided to change
careers was a realization that the charges of plagiarism leveled at
her in August 1994, and again in June 1995, ``would be a data point
about me as long as I stayed in journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Those accusations were based on a close resemblance between
several passages and sentences in articles she wrote and in
articles by other reporters about the same subjects. At the time,
Ms. Shalit said she had confused her typewritten notes with
articles downloaded from the Lexis-Nexis database.
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic printed apologies in both incidents and at the
end of 1995, after a critique she wrote about affirmative action at
The Washington Post and continued criticism over the incidents of
plagiarism, Ms. Shalit took a six-month leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned in 1996, she moved away from the often
scathing critiques of Washington institutions and people that had
earned her a reputation as one journalism's rising stars and a
lucrative contract with GQ magazine. Instead, she began writing
cultural criticism, book reviews and trend pieces, and maintained
generally low visibility.
</P>
<P>
   But her case drew revived attention last spring when another New
Republic writer, Stephen Glass, was found to have fabricated large
parts of articles he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ms. Shalit said, she decided it was time to make a fresh
start in ``a field where I could use of all my talents and be
judged for who I am instead of on the basis of mistakes I made when
I was a dippy 23-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lane, the editor of The New Republic, refused to comment
on Ms. Shalit's departure. But Leon Wieseltier, the literary
editor, said she had left the magazine of her own accord and
expressed confidence that Ms. Shalit had put the incidents of
plagiarism behind her. ``If I thought that she hadn't paid her
dues, I would never have had her write for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
</P>
<P>
   The Celebrity Author Who Sat and Wrote
</P>
<P>
   It's become common to assume that celebrity authors rarely write
more than the autograph in their books.
</P>
<P>
   So even a veteran publisher like Esther Margolis of Newmarket
Press paused when approached with a manuscript for her independent
publishing house from the actor Gene Hackman and his co-author, Dan
Lenihan, who had worked together in Santa Fe, N.M., for three years
on ``Black Star Rising,'' a novel about early 1800s pirates and
shipwrecks and the requisite wood-splintering storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this for real?'' Ms. Margolis recalled asking the author's
agent, Noah Lukeman. ``I'm a small publisher and I don't do much
fiction. And here was fiction that appeared to be very commercially
viable with a bona fide movie star as an author.''
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to Santa Fe in January to meet with the first-time
authors, Hackman, 69, and Lenihan, 53, an underwater archaeologist
with the National Park Service, Ms. Margolis said she was satisfied
that they truly had written the manuscript and were prepared to
submit to editing and rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman said that he and Lenihan divided up the writing into a
``labor of love,'' and that he worked from the beginning and his
co-author worked from the end.
</P>
<P>
   They chose a rather unconventional approach to publishing, he
said, because ``if we were going to do it, we were going to do it
in a way that we had some control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in the last 40 years in film and theater,''
he continued, ``and I know what it's like to do something under
pressure that you consider to be artistic _ something of value as
opposed to something commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   And that unconventional attitude applies to ghosts of the
literary sort. ``I just couldn't do that,'' Hackman said. ``If you
go to a ghostwriter, how do you go out and publicize it? I just
couldn't. I don't need the money for one thing. You have to be
honest with yourself about what kind of achievements that you come
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel is expected to be published later this year.

AIDE WHO RESIGNED TOSSES A BARB AT SCHROEDER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Oskar Lafontaine, who threw the German
government into turmoil on Thursday by quitting as both finance
minister and as chairman of the ruling political party, ended three
days of silence Sunday with a thinly veiled attack on Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for my resignation is the poor teamwork that we
provided in the last few months,'' he said Sunday outside his home
in Saarbruecken, near the French border. ``Teamwork requires that
you watch out for each other and that you stick together,
especially in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he barely mentioned Schroeder, Lafontaine confirmed that
his own brand of left-wing doctrine had become irreconcilable with
Schroeder's pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart isn't traded on the stock market yet, but it has a
home,'' Lafontaine said. ``And it beats to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was telling. Lafontaine had enraged industry leaders
and investors across Germany and even across much of Europe with
his plans to raise taxes on industry and his campaign to raise
German wage levels, which are already among the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned, the stock market soared more than 200 points
and Europe's new single currency, the euro, enjoyed its biggest
one-day jump against the dollar since its debut on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroeder struggled this weekend to pull together his new
government, that same split between left-wing traditionalists and
more pro-business modernizers was evident throughout the ruling
Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the split is certain to be Schroeder's greatest
challenge in the months and years ahead. Sunday, the leftists were
clearly on the run and the pragmatists were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's two top deputies turned in their resignations. One
of them, Heiner Flassbeck, is an economist who provided Lafontaine
with arguments that the source of unemployment problems had nothing
to do with high wages and almost everything to do with hawkish
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more pro-business Social Democrats began pushing for
new tax breaks for industry. Wolfgang Clement, premier of the state
of North Rhine-Westphalia, contended that corporate income taxes
ought to be dropped to as low as 28 percent from their current
level of about 50 percent. Bodo Hombach, Schroeder's chief of
staff, said the government would reduce corporate taxes in order to
contribute to ``an enduring relief, particularly to middle-sized
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures are great. Schroeder campaigned for election on
his pledge to reduce the jobless rate, which has been above 10
percent for years _ a rate for which former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
also failed to reduce. Unemployment has increased slightly in
recent months and the economy has abruptly slowed down once again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most active and powerful groups within the Social
Democratic Party, including the huge labor unions, are fighting to
prevent any change in the country's almost unparalleled system of
social benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of ``poor teamwork,'' Lafontaine alluded to
complaints from ``the team'' that he was pursuing anti-business
policies. That appeared to be a direct allusion to Schroeder's
angry complaints at a cabinet meeting last Wednesday as well as to
Schroeder's personal attempts to water down plans for increasing
business taxes and shutting down nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were able to cut taxes for small- and medium-sized
companies by five billion marks, the team was discussing whether we
were making policies aimed against industry,'' he said indignantly.
``Work that out for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the election campaign last summer and during their
first five months in power, Schroeder and Lafontaine had portrayed
themselves in countless rallies as a perfect team.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the two were political rivals who had formed a
marriage of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, relations with Lafontaine deteriorated so badly
that Schroeder was not even able to reach Lafontaine on the
telephone until after he resigned. After Lafontaine spoke Sunday, a
spokesman for Schroeder said only that the chancellor had ``taken
note.''

UCLA-KENTUCKY: THE NEW CHAPTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA vs. Kentucky. Can't beat that matchup of
traditional college basketball powers.
</P>
<P>
   Except this isn't the men. It's the women who meet tonight in an
NCAA Tournament second-round game at Pauley Pavilion, with the
winner advancing to next weekend's West Regional at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup remains attractive, even if it involves two programs
succeeding in the large shadows of their male counterparts, who
have combined for 74 NCAA appearances and 18 national titles, more
than any other two schools.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3-seeded UCLA (24-7) has come further than No.6 Kentucky
(21-10). The Bruins won the Pacific-10 for the first time this
season and their first conference title of any kind in 20 years and
are making their second consecutive NCAA appearance.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, behind Maylana Martin's 18 points and LaCresha
Flannigan's 16 points, the Bruins beat Wisconsin-Green Bay 76-69.
</P>
<P>
   In Martin, the conference Player of the Year and third-team
All-American with an 18.5-point average, they have a legitimate
go-to player. In Janae Hubbard (12 points, 12 rebounds Saturday),
they have a legitimate post player. In Erica Gomez (15 points,
eight assists), they have a true point guard. And in Flannigan,
they have an exciting player who can score and get down the court.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, UCLA beat Kentucky this season 64-54 in the final of the
Rainbow Wahine Classic in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But Kentucky has made tremendous strides in recent years. It won
20 games for the first time in nine years and is in the tournament
after a 17-year absence. A victory over UCLA will go a long way
toward earning the women more recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lineup has changed,'' Kentucky coach Bernadette Mattox
said. ``Our younger people have matured. Our older people have
matured even more. The play in the SEC has matured us. Because of
the toughness of our schedule (fifth strongest schedule
nationally), it forced us to mature.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the schedule and a ratings percentage index (RPI) of
18, Kentucky regularly has three players scoring in double figures:
forwards Laura Meadows and guards Erica Jackson and Tiffany Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Against Nebraska on Saturday, it had six. It doesn't matter what
defense is thrown at them _ trap, box-and-1, 1-2-2, 2-3, full-court
man _ they can score.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On Saturday) our defense was shaky in the second half,''
Gomez said. ``We have to play 40 minutes against Kentucky, and we
can't have those kind of lapses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez referred to Wisconsin-Green Bay's 22-9 second-half run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get low and go for 40 minutes,'' UCLA coach Kathy
Olivier said. ``When we get up 18-20 points, we get soft. If we
take breathers, Kentucky will come up after you. We have to make
sure we rebound. Kentucky attacks the glass well, and their guards
penetrate, so we need to contain better from the zone.''

U.S. HOPE IS LOW AS TALKS RESTART ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 17th graf to change date of Solana meeting to SUNDAY.)  (Eds.: See also KOSOVO-BOMBINGS) 
(ms) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The second round of Kosovo peace talks was set for
a desultory start in Paris on Monday with few in the Clinton
administration predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the grand ceremony that opened the first round of
negotiations in the French town of Rambouillet, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright had no plans to go to Paris, her aides said.
She invested substantial personal capital in the talks last month,
only to see them end in virtual collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And after watching its diplomatic offensive of the last 10 days,
involving Bob Dole and Richard C. Holbrooke, fade without result,
the Clinton administration was downplaying the final stage of the
talks. The negotiations are resuming as bloodshed continues and
even escalates in Kosovo, where marketplace bombs killed seven
people and wounded 58 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus in Washington is that there is little chance of
reaching an agreement,'' a senior official said. The Albanians'
refusal to sign the accord so far, the stubborn Serb refusal to
countenance foreign troops in Kosovo and the increasing violence
apparently have shifted the mood in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what the administration's strategy was to
resolve the conflict if, as is currently expected, the talks end
after several days.
</P>
<P>
   The best that the administration hoped to extract from Paris was
a &QL; 
signature from the ethnic Albanians on the plan presented at
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan calls for a three-year interim period of autonomy
for Kosovo, for the withdrawal of Serbian forces and for the
disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting
for the independence of Kosovo, which is ruled by Serbia but
dominated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But while the likelihood of an agreement from the ethnic
Albanian delegation appeared more likely than in the last two
weeks, it was still not certain they would sign on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to think they are going to sign,'' an adviser to the
ethnic Albanians said, choosing his words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   One promising point, diplomats said, was that Hashim Thaci, the
leader of the delegation and key member of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, arrived in Paris for the talks. He had eluded Western
officials in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the peace plan by the ethnic Albanians is the
critical step before NATO can threaten a tough bombing campaign of
the Serbs if the Government of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
leader, does not also accept the proposal _ and the 26,000 allied
peacekeepers to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that after the Paris talks, they
expected the focus to move to Belgrade where Milosevic remains as
recalcitrant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the options for forcing a peace plan looked so grim that one
senior administration official suggested that it might take another
massacre in Kosovo to galvanize momentum for a meaningful threat of
NATO airstrikes against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may turn out that we may need another Srebrenica before we &QL; 
have a Dayton,'' said the official, reviewing the options on
condition of anonymity. ``But wasn't Racak sufficient?'' The
massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces
led to NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs which in turn
enabled Holbrooke to build on earlier groundwork and organize talks
at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   A massacre in the Kosovo village of Racak of more than 40 ethnic
Albanians by Serbian forces in January spurred the current efforts
of Ms. Albright to persuade NATO to authorize air strikes against
the Serbs if they reject a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When the ethnic Albanians failed to agree to the peace plan, the
NATO threat against Milosevic was vitiated. As the president of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic is the leader of the two remaining Yugoslav
republics, Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo is a southern province of
Serbia where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana, was in Washington
Sunday conferring with the administration's national security
adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and was expected to meet with Ms.
Albright Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, authorized by NATO in late January to unleash air
strikes against Milosevic if he did not agree to a peace
settlement, is reported to be disturbed about the credibility of
NATO as the threats of air strikes have lost their punch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holbrooke was sitting with Milosevic last week in
Belgrade telling him that if he did not agree to a peace settlement
NATO air strikes would result. Just at that time, American
diplomats who had been evacuated from Belgrade two weeks weeks
earlier because of the possibility of strikes were returning to
their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were also perturbed about
events on the ground in Kosovo, where Serbian security police and
Yugoslav soldiers were on the march and where the increasingly
well-armed Kosovo Liberation Army were getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Milosevic appeared to be thumbing his nose once
again at the West with an extraordinarily long news broadcast on
Serbian state-controlled television.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour of the program, which has been extended
frequently in recent days, was taken up with anti-NATO propaganda,
including such slogans as ``No NATO, we will fight NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the hysteria, there were laudatory
interviews with five waiters who were brought from neighboring
Macedonia to Belgrade as heroes because they claimed they had
beaten up NATO soldiers who had become drunk in their bar in the
Macedonian capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand NATO soldiers are in Macedonia ready for quick
deployment to Kosovo if a peace settlement is reached.

6 ARRESTED AS GAYS ARE ORDERED OUT OF ST. PATRICK'S PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until the moment the whistle blew, Brendan Fay said
with tears rolling down his face, he held out hope that a showdown
would be averted, that his exclusion would not be made palpable.
</P>
<P>
   But when the first St. Patrick's Day Parade in the Bronx in 70
years got under way at noon Sunday in the Throgs Neck section, and
Fay's group of gay and lesbian Irish-Americans, the Lavender and
Green Alliance, stepped in to march, it became clear that no
welcome would be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Police stepped in, too _ acting, they said, on instructions from
the parade's organizers, the Throgs Neck Benevolent Association _
and told the group to step out of the parade line.
</P>
<P>
   Some did; Fay and five others, including City Councilwoman
Christine Quinn and state Sen. Thomas Duane, both openly gay
Democrats who represent parts of Manhattan, did not. All six were
arrested, charged with disorderly conduct, issued summonses and
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx parade thus followed the example of the annual St.
Patrick's Day Parade along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which has
prohibited gay organizations from marching under their own banners
since 1991. This year's Fifth Avenue parade is to be held on St.
Patrick's Day, Wednesday. The organizers of the Bronx parade
decided to march earlier to avoid a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Lavender and Green Alliance said they would not
have tried to march in the Bronx had they not been invited. But an
invitation from the parade's organizers was abruptly revoked on
Thursday, Fay said, after numerous church groups and the Ancient
Order of Hibernians of Bronx County said they would pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking, devastating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fay, the founder of the Lavender and Green Alliance, and other
advocates for gay issues said police officials told them that
Patrick Devine, the parade chairman who issued the original
invitation, had received death threats. A police spokesman said he
could not confirm that report.
</P>
<P>
   Fay sought support from numerous elected officials and religious
leaders. Some agreed with him: Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer withdrew from the parade, as did the city's public advocate,
Mark Green, and the city's comptroller, Alan Hevesi. But when
parade organizers would not budge, the alliance decided to march
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Devine could not be reached for comment Sunday, but other
members of the Throgs Neck Benevolent Association tried to downplay
the controversy. Some insisted that the group had never been
invited at all. ``There was a miscommunication,'' said Karin
O'Connor, a member who was involved in the organizing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Hibernians stayed away from the parade, but
representatives of the organization could not be reached for
comment Sunday. Many churches and Catholic school groups did
participate, as did the Emerald Societies of the Police and Fire
Departments, more than 30 other groups and a total of about 2,000
people, under the watchful eye of several hundred police officers.
Members of most of the groups said they supported the parade
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to march,'' it would be fine, Fran Mahoney, a
district leader for the local Democratic organization, the Chippewa
Democratic Club, said of the gay group. ``But not under a banner _
it's a Christian community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Connor shared her view. ``We're celebrating a Catholic
holy day,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ``We're marching for St. Patrick,
and people who march should be in line with what we're celebrating
_ Irish pride and Irish Catholic pride.'' An openly gay group, she
said, did not fit in at a Catholic celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The several thousand spectators, wearing green hats and scarves
and carnations, seemed more divided. Mary Ellen O'Brien, a Yonkers
resident, said the pressure to rescind the invitation was
disgraceful. ``Who would it have hurt to let them march, if it
makes them feel better about themselves?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocky Roff, a 48-year-old neighborhood resident, said he did
not think a parade was a place for a political statement. ``There
are other places to air your laundry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throgs Neck is a tightly knit neighborhood of mostly Irish and
Italian residents. At a morning Mass at St. Benedict's Church, more
than 1,000 residents heard the pastor praise the community because
it has changed so little over the decades. It is the kind of place,
residents said, where children grow up, marry and return to live.
</P>
<P>
   After the parade along East Tremont Avenue, many of the marchers
crowded into Charlie's Inn, where the beer and whiskey flowed like
the sentiment, and Irish waltzes sent elderly couples onto the
dance floor. March organizers said they were so pleased with the
march that they would have another one next year.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, a smaller crowd attended Ferrer's previously
scheduled celebration of Irish heritage and culture. There,
Lavender and Green members said they, too, would be at next year's
march _ with, they hoped, the approval of march organizers.

COMMENTARY: OF NUKES AND SPOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Absolutely no truth to it _ it's an outrageous
statement,'' fumed Sandy Berger, the first national security
adviser to regularly attend political campaign meetings in the
White House. ``It's wrong ... not based on any facts whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to Tim Russert's quotation on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' of my assertion of connections among: (a) the Clinton-Gore
fund raising from admittedly illegal Asian sources, followed by our
stunning turnabout in trade policy; (b) the uncleared access to the
White House by a high Chinese military intelligence official; (c)
the Clinton decision, accompanied by huge campaign contributions by
a satellite manufacturer, to switch regulation of technology
transfer to his anything-goes Commerce Department, and (d) the
years of foot-dragging by the Clinton National Security Council
when confronted by evidence that China had stolen nuclear secrets
from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Berger would have us believe that these are not facts, and if
they are, they are wholly unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   It would be outrageous indeed to suggest that American officials
were consciously betraying our national interest. But the
confluence of these facts in election year 1996 _ combined with the
urge to disregard or derogate any intelligence that would stop the
political blessings of a ``strategic partnership'' with China _ led
to President Clinton's denial of a dangerous penetration.
</P>
<P>
   A few questions to the committees holding closed hearings this
week:
</P>
<P>
   The White House line is that Congress was adequately briefed on
this 17 times. If true, were the intelligence ``Big Four'' properly
forewarned and did they then fail in their oversight
responsibilities? Rep. Chris Cox tells me no: ``Our committee
expressly found the administration failed to comply with National
Security Act requirements for keeping Congress informed. To claim
otherwise is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Spooks wonders if the FBI office in New Mexico that bungled the
Edward Howard capture fumbled again in 1995 by taking a full year
to react to evidence of heavy theft. Others suggest that Beijing,
eager to intimidate us in the Taiwan Strait, wanted us to know it
had our W-88 nuclear-warhead technology. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Justice Department's intelligence surveillance
policy staff, which reports directly to Janet Reno, deny the FBI
authority to tap the telephone of its suspect, Wen Ho Lee, at Los
Alamos in 1995? This was no mere Mafia drug bust; a Chinese
document showed our most vital national-security secrets were
threatened. Over three years, did FBI Director Louis Freeh protest
to Reno about this leave-him-alone decision?
</P>
<P>
   Why has Berger &AMP; Co. repeatedly stressed that ``other countries,
including friendly countries,'' spied on us? Is this the spin
machine's not-so-sly way to get supporters of Israel in the
Congress and the media to shut up and back off?
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of Department of Energy intelligence, Notra
Trulock, says he was ordered not to inform Congress of his
suspicions, but his boss, Elizabeth Moler, disputes this. Whose
story will change under oath?
</P>
<P>
   Why, if Secretary Bill Richardson were so ``seized of'' this
secret issue last August when he was named, did he demote the
expert, Trulock, and put in charge a CIA man from his U.N. embassy
staff _ Larry Sanchez _ who knew nothing about the agency's worst
problem?
</P>
<P>
   Does Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying, daughter of a top Chinese general,
provide a link between the stealing of secrets at our national
laboratories in the '80s and the purchase of secrets from our
American satellite and computer manufacturers in the '90s? Did a
U.S. company help China widen the acquisition envelope of its SA-12
anti-aircraft missile by 20 degrees, and are Air National Guard
F-16 pilots now being briefed on their new danger?
</P>
<P>
   Is it true that even now, tens of thousands of e-mail messages
every month flow out of our national laboratories at Sandia and Los
Alamos _ but our National Security Agency's Big Ear fails to
monitor them?
</P>
<P>
   Is Berger telling the public the same story he told the Cox
committee under oath? If so, why was Clinton denied knowledge from
1995 to 1997 about this most damaging atomic spy coup since the
Rosenbergs? Isn't a president entitled to such information before
proposing a ``strategic partnership''? Or did Clinton really know?
</P>
<P>
   But to pose these questions is outrageous.
</P>

NO WORD YET ON NFL EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The NFL owners apparently do not have the hurry-up
offense in their playbook.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for 90 minutes or so Sunday morning, the league's
expansion committee adjourned without taking any vote or making any
recommendation on a proposed 32nd team in either Houston or Los
Angeles. The committee will convene again today with the hope of
having something to present to the full ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it's quite likely everyone will leave here only
slightly further along in the process.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles, as anticipated, is named as the location for
team 32, it likely will be one of the more vague decisions in
sports history. No ownership group or stadium site will be
attached. Neither Michael Ovitz and Carson nor Ed Roski, Eli Broad
and the New Coliseum will be given the league's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there will be a list of conditions longer than the
Starr Report _ most of them having to do with money _ that Los
Angeles owners must meet within a league-set time frame. Think
Christmas. If the stipulations aren't met, the opportunity would
likely revert to ready-to-go Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you can draw is that the most we'll get out of
this week is the selection of the city,'' NFL spokesman Joe Browne
said. ``I don't see, based on the discussion, that we'll (select) a
stadium or an owner. It's too big a piece to bite off in one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the league going to one city or the other on an
if-see basis, but it's just speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Goodell, the league's vice president of development, said
there never was a mandate for the league to make a hard decision at
these meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of these meetings (is) to evaluate the proposals we
have and see if we have the best possible solution,'' he said.
``Whatever decision we make will dictate what else we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Los Angeles, the league seems less interested in
what else Ovitz and Roski/Broad have to say at this point as much
as whether there are any other potential bidders out there.
</P>
<P>
   Its list of prospective sites is currently limited to the
Coliseum and Carson, but only because they're closer to breaking
ground, especially the Coliseum. Goodell said the league would
consider another site if the facility could get off the mark
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles gets the bid, the time frame to fill in the
blanks would be by the end of the year. In the case of Houston,
businessman Robert McNair's bid contains a clause for a new stadium
that must be exercised by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been working on this for a couple of years, and he's in
it for as long as it takes,'' McNair spokesman Chip Nieves said.
``There's been a lot of speculation about where things are headed,
but (McNair) has been reassured by (the league) that he's not
wasting his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NFL attorney Frank Rothman said the Raiders' legal
claim on owning any rights to Los Angeles is not a factor in any
expansion decision. ``We don't think it's a threat in any way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne also said owners received a letter Sunday from a group
interested in an expansion franchise in Anaheim, which the Rams
vacated after the 1994 season. ``But we're not looking at any other
site in Southern California than the two that have been
presented,'' he said.

EXPERTS TUTOR GEORGE W. BUSH ON DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ind., Calif.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE with RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He is the early favorite for the Republican
presidential nomination, but even Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
concedes that his foreign policy experience goes no farther than
Mexico. Kosovo? Not even on the radar screen. And he has never had
to worry about the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to fill in his blank slate on pressing issues of the day
before the campaign swings into full gear, Bush has embarked on a
cram course that could be titled ``What you need to know to run for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a second term last November, Bush began summoning
dozens of the nation's brightest thinkers around a table in the
Governor's Mansion for sober-minded tutorials. Politicians in both
parties said they had never seen such a comprehensive and elaborate
undertaking, particularly this early in a campaign. There may never
have been a ``serious'' candidate who needed it more.
</P>
<P>
   The endeavor is intended to counter what are widely seen as
among Bush's biggest vulnerabilities: that he lacks experience
beyond Texas and that he has not articulated a grand view of what
he would do in the White House. It was no accident that in their
announcement speeches last week, Elizabeth Dole and former Gov.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee emphasized their credentials on
national issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visitors defended the governor as a quick study. ``Nobody
knows everything about what goes on in the world, so you've got to
find out,'' George Shultz, secretary of state under President
Ronald Reagan, said recently as he sat back in his rocking chair
with a State Department seal at his office at Stanford University,
where he is a fellow at the Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ability to draw big names _ all of whom, in the
beginning, paid their own way to Austin _ is not simply testament
to the governor's personal appeal or skills at outreach.
Self-interest is at play as well: Academics like to be asked for
advice, particularly by a politician who is leading in the polls
and who might someday be in a position to appoint them to
something. What for Bush is a tutorial might serve as an audition
for his tutors.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prestige factor. ``They come back and say,
`Well, I was just down in Austin,''' said Martin Anderson, an
economist at Stanford University and an official in the Reagan
administration. Participants have been plucked from around the
country, but there is particularly heavy representation from the
Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hubbard, an Indianapolis business executive who coordinated
the early meetings for Bush, said people were invited to Austin
``under the condition that they would be supportive of him'' and
all but one person accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The deep conversations about policy are all the more surprising
because _ fairly or unfairly _ Bush is known more for his hands-on
governing style than for his intellect. He has never been known for
savoring the minutiae of policy like President Clinton. ``Having
known George as a student, I'm shocked, and his professors would be
shocked,'' said Hubbard, a classmate of Bush at the Harvard
Business School. ``He wasn't a great student. But he's the most
conscientious politician I've ever worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former member of the Federal Reserve
Board who was on Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and is
Bush's chief outside economic adviser, described him as ``a very
good and patient student.''
</P>
<P>
   The sessions started informally after the election and they have
become more organized in the past few months. Besides Lindsey, who
invites economic experts to the meetings and structures the agenda,
Bush has named Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis to preside
over domestic policy, while Condoleezza Rice, the provost of
Stanford University, oversees foreign and military policy. Josh
Bolten, an international trade lawyer in the Bush administration,
recently signed on as overall policy coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are often convened in a formal, deep blue dining
room in the Governor's Mansion, and sometimes in a smaller, sunny
conservatory. They usually include just over half a dozen experts
in a field and are scheduled for three hours, but often last
longer.
</P>
<P>
   To all but the most devout policy wonks, the conversations can
be eye glazing. According to an agenda of a health care briefing
that Goldsmith presided over on Feb. 18: Six minutes were allocated
for introductory remarks; 25 minutes for a discussion of the
financing system and the delivery systems, with such topics as
``trends in patient care: acute to chronic conditions; diffusion of
technology, rise of pharmaceutical therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a 30-minute discussion of philosophy, including ``What
level of care are we prepared to guarantee?'' Then a 50-minute
examination of the uninsured, followed by 50 minutes on the
``anxious insured.'' Goldsmith was to close with a 20-minute review
of matters for further discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said in interviews that the discussions
were framed less around how the governor should respond to a
particular question on the campaign trail and more around how he
would tackle the matter as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a very interactive seminar than people sitting
around giving formal talks,'' Ms. Rice said. The governor, she
said, ``is not somebody who puts on airs or attempts to appear
imperial, so there's a kind of easiness about the conversation.
Sometimes you get a bunch of foreign policy experts together and
they talk on a plane where nobody asks the basic questions. He'll
drive you back to the basic question.''
</P>
<P>
   When the end of the Cold War came up, she said, Bush asked:
``What does America's role really mean to you? What did we mean
when we talk about the expansion of NATO? What is the military of
the future going to look like?''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations about economics, participants said, Bush always
returns to job creation. ``What can I do to make higher paying
jobs?'' said John B. Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford.
``That's a bottom line for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts said Bush appears confident and does not pretend to
know more than he does. Like Ronald Reagan, Anderson said, ``He has
no problem talking to people who were smarter and quicker. There
are other candidates who don't like to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While they described Bush as smart and disciplined, many
participants said he obviously still had a lot to learn. ``He still
has some growing to do,'' said Michael Boskin, a Stanford
University economist and former chief economic adviser to President
Bush, who organized some of the early meetings. ``But he's become
the most impressive presidential or potential presidential
candidate that I've seen in decades.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to portray himself as more conservative than his father,
Bush has stayed clear, at least publicly, of many of the former
president's top advisers. Even after hours of meetings, several
participants who know his father were hard-pressed to distinguish
the philosophies of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the governor was more conservative than his father,
Shultz replied, ``Out of the blue I would say that. But then if you
said `Why?' I wouldn't have a good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The visits have ignited a firestorm of gossip in academic and
political circles about how people are angling for posts in a Bush
administration. But participants said the preening is kept to a
minimum, though experts sometimes compete over who brings the most
colorful graphics. ``You could think about the jobs available:
budget director or treasury secretary or national security adviser.
I haven't participated in lists of names of who would be good for
things,'' Taylor said. Referring to Bush, he added, ''I don't know
if he's done that. He's probably thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush's visitors do not dare speculate openly about their
futures, they clearly delight in the attention. When Ms. Rice, a
national security official in President Bush's administration, was
shown an editorial in the Stanford University student newspaper
with the headline ``Secretary of State?'' she gasped, ``My God!''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Ms. Rice, who is stepping down as provost,
retreated to a position of studied nonchalance. ``Certainly,
nobody's asked me to be secretary of state,'' she said. ``And I'm a
terrible long-term planner.''

BOSTON COLLEGE WOMEN NOW MUST COMPETE WITH THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After qualifying for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association women's basketball tournament for the first time,
eighth-seeded Boston College was riding an emotional high. And with
a 72-59 victory over ninth-seeded Ohio State on Saturday night at
the Thompson Bolling Arena in Knoxville, Tenn., before 11,190
screaming fans, the Eagles (22-7) gained the confidence necessary
to play a significant role in the outcome of the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Except the Eagles now face the difficult task of continuing
their unexpected run Monday night by upsetting top-seeded
Tennessee, the three-time defending champion. The Lady Vols (29-2)
trounced their first-round opponent, Appalachian State, by 113-54
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The winner advances to Greensboro, N.C., for next week's East
Regional semifinals and finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message all week was, `Don't be happy just to be here, come
to win,''' said Coach Cathy Inglese, who is in her sixth year at
the Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne Stepherson, a guard who scored 11 points on 4-for-8
shooting against Ohio State, is taking a more conservative approach
to Boston College's biggest game of its program's 27-year
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an incredible team and a great coach,'' Stepherson
said of Tennessee. ``They have 16 possible all-Americans on that
team. They basically have the type of status that we want, so we're
going to come out and play our hardest. And no matter what the
outcome of the game, hopefully we'll just come away with something
that we've learned and we'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Having held its opponents to 40 percent shooting this season,
Boston College will have to continue that performance in the second
round of the tournament. In addition, the Eagles must avoid being
pressured by Tennessee from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols opened up against Appalachian State with a 19-0
run and built a 53-19 lead at halftime. They forced the
Mountaineers to commit 33 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Against Ohio State, Boston College turned the ball over eight
times in the first eight minutes, prompting Inglese to call a
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still very confident because there were some things that
we just were not executing,'' Inglese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we'd be successful if we got the ball to Alissa and
really cut down their post play,'' she said of Alissa Murphy, who
is averaging 15.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese must also find a way to contain the Tennessee
all-American Chamique Holdsclaw, who became the NCAA tournament's
career-leading scorer with 405 points, surpassing the former Lady
Vol Bridgette Gordon, who had 388 points from 1986 to 1989.
Holdsclaw also surpassed Cheryl Miller as the tournament's career
leader in rebounds with 172.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory was not entirely a celebration for Tennessee.
The sophomore guard Semeka Randall injured an ankle while driving
to the basket in the second half. Her status for Monday night was
not known. ``She's got a pretty tough sprain there,'' Coach Pat
Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, Boston College has faced adversity of its
own, but has managed to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Bouchard, a starting guard who is Boston College's leading
scorer, sustained a season-ending knee injury in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Becky Gottstein sprained her ankle during the Big East
Conference tournament. She did not return to practice until
Thursday, but came off the bench Saturday night to register a
career-high 23 points on 10-of-14 shooting and get 12 rebounds
against Ohio State. Boston College is 7-2 when Gottstein has led or
tied for the team lead in scoring.

TORRE PLANS TO MEET WITH HIS YANKEES' PLAYERS

<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Yankees Manager Joe Torre is expected to meet
with his players Monday, the first time he will speak to the team
collectively since he was found to have prostate cancer last week.
Others in the organization believe he will give the players the
details of his treatment, and an estimate of how long he will be
away from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials have been protective of Torre's privacy, at
his request, and most of those who were asked about whether Torre
would appear at the park _ including the coach Don Zimmer and
General Manager Brian Cashman _ either declined to answer or
responded coyly. However, two members of the organization said
Torre wants to speak to the players, and a sign was posted on a
clubhouse wall noting boldly that players will be required to be
dressed in uniform and in the clubhouse at 2:15 p.m. Monday,
unusually early for a night game. Cashman said, ``If he is planning
on being there, he could always change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zimmer, ``This is Joe's team and he's going to do what he
wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre has sought multiple opinions as he considers his treatment
options; he used George Steinbrenner's private jet to visit the
Washington University hospital in St. Louis on Friday for tests.
Others in the organization continue to say he is leaning toward
surgical removal of the cancer. If Torre has surgery, he will
probably be out for anywhere from three weeks to three months,
according to estimates of club officials and friends. If Torre made
a swift recovery, he would still miss the first week of the regular
season.

 &HT;    Kentucky shows why its champion
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ This isn't the best team. It wasn't the best team
a year ago. It is simply the hardest team to beat, a team that has
an otherworldly grasp on the concept of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not national champions for nothing,'' said Ryan
Robertson, the Kansas guard. The Jayhawks nearly ended the Kentucky
reign Sunday, leading by five with 89 seconds left. But then it
happened, same as it happened to Duke and Stanford and Utah last
March. The Wildcats tied it in regulation, won in overtime, marched
ever onward.
</P>
<P>
   ''A heartbreaking experience for us,'' said Roy Williams, the
Kansas coach. ''We were so, so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have been similarly close these past two seasons, but no
opponent has yet managed to finish off these Wildcats. A senior,
Scott Padgett was playing his 14th NCAA Tournament game Sunday.
Likewise a senior, Wayne Turner was playing his 19th.
Over141/2-minute span that carried deep into OT, the two scored all
30 of Kentucky's points. Said Padgett: ''We sort of willed
ourselves to this win.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first postseason meeting of these hallowed
programs, and for nearly 39 minutes Kansas was the more resourceful
team. Robertson and Jeff Boschee kept air-mailing treys, and there
were moments when it seemed that even the Wildcats believed this
day, at long last, would be someone else's. But only moments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down five with a minute to play, a lot of teams would fold,''
Padgett said. ''But we've been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   Five points down, time flying. Turner drove, same as he'd driven
against Duke's Steve Wojciechowksi in epochal comeback a year ago.
Fouled, Turner made a pair. Kentucky chose not to foul, defended
expertly, forced Boschee to take an ungainly banker as the shot
clock ran down. Jamaal Magliore rebounded. Turner drove again --
''I was glad to see they weren't taking a three,'' Williams said --
and missed. Magliore won the scramble, shoveling the ball to
Padgett on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Padgett's three that brought down Duke in St. Petersburg,
and here he was again. ''I was already thinking about the shot
before I got the ball,'' he said. Kenny Gregory ran at him. Padgett
pumped. Gregory flew past. Padgett took one dribble, stepped behind
the line, drained the trey.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen seconds remained, time enough for Kansas. Robertson
broached the lane and heard Gregory calling. Said Robertson: ''I
misread the play. I thought we'd have a layup. If I had it to do
again, I'd have taken the shot myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Magliore closed on Gregory, turning the presumed layup into a
contested 10-footer that flew 11 feet. Overtime. Forced to choose,
Kansas chose incorrectly. At such times, Kentucky seems never to
misread anything. Kentucky just knows.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tournament is hard,'' Williams said. ''If (Robertson)
could have made that play, a different decision, we'd be talking
about it years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked about luck, about the twists of fortune that keep
leaving Kansas a red-eyed March loser, the same twists that never
befall Kentucky. ''When you're sitting by yourself you call it bad
luck,'' Williams said. ''But I'm realistic enough to know that
Scott Padgett made a heck of a play.''

 &HT;    Gordon takes third Atlanta win
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The skies above Atlanta Motor Speedway eventually
opened up at about 6 p.m. Sunday, about the same time it seemed
NASCAR's spotlight would finally shine on someone other than Jeff
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 30 laps remaining in the Cracker Barrel Old
Country Store 500, however, the clouds returned and so did Gordon's
reign on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the two-time defending points champion, led 56 of the
final 69 laps to win his second race in a row _ and third overall _
at AMS. His previous victories in Atlanta came in the Purolator 500
in March 1995 and November's NAPA 500, the 1998 season-finale.
</P>
<P>
   After rain delayed the race for one hour, 40 minutes, Gordon,
points leader Mike Skinner and pole-sitter Bobby Labonte dominated
the 43-car field on the 1.54-mile oval, combining to lead 291 of
325 laps.
</P>
<P>
   The final few laps were completed under lights, because rain
started to fall again at the Hampton facility. Two of the six
caution flags during the race were because of precipitation on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lights came on that thing was a rocket,'' Gordon said
of his No. 24 Chevrolet. ``We weren't the best car all day long,
but by the end _ when it counts _ we were. We just hope we can be
consistent, and right now having two wins is big. It'll carry some
momentum the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon pulled away from Labonte in the final 25 laps, beating
him to the finish line by 2.537 seconds. Mark Martin finished
third, while Jeff Burton and Dale Jarrett were fourth and fifth,
respectively. Skinner, who had engine problems late in the race,
dropped to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (Gordon's) car just got better toward the end,''
Labonte said. ``He probably took care of it during the first part
of the race. He was steady. I saw him back there all day. It was
probably the best car when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gordon took the lead from Labonte on lap 257, he led until
the leaders made their final pit stop 41 laps later. But Labonte,
who entered the race having won three of the last five Cup events
at AMS, was faster off pit road, grabbing the lead from Gordon one
lap later. Labonte's lead grew to as much as 50 yards during the
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Labonte) got up there in front of me the last time after the
pit stop and I thought we were in big trouble,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte says he immediately knew that his No. 18 Pontiac was
in trouble after taking only two new tires during the pit stop.
Gordon also took only two tires during refueling, but he says his
car was handling much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there at the end, it was just one of those deals where
our two tires didn't work out,'' Labonte said. ``I'm not very good
at that anyway. I can't ever make two tires work. I just didn't run
the right line for a few laps and Jeff made up a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also made up time when Labonte got slowed behind the
lapped No. 98 car of Rick Mast with only 22 laps remaining. When
Mast didn't move near the apron to allow Labonte to pass, Gordon
passed Labonte on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   After all of the lead-lap cars made their final pit stop by lap
311 -- Bill Elliott and Sterling Marlin were the last to stop after
running low on fuel -- Gordon had the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you work real hard all day to get your
car right,'' Gordon said. ``When you do, you want to show everyone,
especially a car without a sponsor on it. (Mast) was running really
strong at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I feel bad for Bobby because he was cheated a little
bit. I wouldn't have closed on him if he hadn't been held up. In
fact, I couldn't have taken the lead. But lapped traffic is a part
of racing. I got held up a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a few weeks since Gordon and his Rainbow Warriors
last saw victory lane. After winning the season-opening Daytona 500
on Feb. 14, Gordon finished 39th at Rockingham after the engine in
his car blew up. Last week at Las Vegas, he finished third behind
Burton and his brother, Ward.

   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Utah coach Rick Majerus warned his team that it
could win the battle with All-America forward Wally Szczerbiak and
still lose the war with Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Utes lost the battle and the war.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak scored 24 points, going 10-of-10 from the free-throw
line, as the 10th-seeded RedHawks upset the second-seeded Utes
66-58 Sunday in a second-round NCAA Tournament game at the
Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (24-7) advances to the Sweet 16 for the first time. The
RedHawks will play third-seeded Kentucky on Friday in the Midwest
Regional at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, which lost to Kentucky in the NCAA championship game last
year, finishes the season 28-5. Sunday's loss ended a 23-game
winning streak for the Utes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami didn't play harder than us, but maybe they played a
little smarter,'' said Utah coach Rick Majerus. ``They were more
physical than we were, and they seemed to play with more of a
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Szczerbiak score 43 points in the RedHawks'
victory Friday against Washington, Utah forward Alex Jensen did
everything he possibly could to limit the number of times
Szczerbiak got a decent shot at the basket, even if it meant
fouling him regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak took only 11 shots, but he went to the free-throw
line five times and made it count. Szczerbiak had three trips to
the line in the final two minutes, including twice with one-and-one
situations, and he made all of his attempts. The 6-8 senior also
had seven rebounds, five assists, two blocks and two steals while
playing all 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a game during which the RedHawks proved they have a
few other guys who can play a little basketball, also. Center John
Estick equaled his season high with 18 points, backup forward Jason
Stewart came off the bench to score 12 points, and guard Rob Mestas
had eight rebounds while guarding Utah All-American Andre Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team, even though it may not seem like it at times
because Wally is here,'' said Miami coach Charlie Coles. ``I told
them that Utah was not going to let Wally score 43, so somebody was
going to have to step up. Today, that was Jason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is a shooter, and he's going to take his shots.
Sometimes they fall, and they did today. And Estick played as smart
a game as he has all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah built a 24-13 lead with 7:29 to go in the first half, but
the momentum of the game changed when Stewart came in and sank
three 3-point shots over a 1-minute, 25-second span to make it
24-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we were a little down and we were looking for some
answers,'' Szczerbiak said. ``Then along comes hardheaded Jason,
and he knocks down three 3s. That really got us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key for Miami was the 6-6, 250-pound Estick, who made
nine of 15 shots in the lane by working for four offensive rebounds
and getting open on backdoor plays when Utah overplayed the
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they would guard Wally hard after what he did Friday,''
Estick said. ``It was going to leave somebody open, and I found out
it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 32-29 at halftime, Miami led 42-41 with 10
minutes to go. But the RedHawks outscored the Utes 14-5 over the
next five minutes to build their biggest lead at 56-46.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tried to bring Utah back by scoring nine consecutive
points for the Utes to close the gap to 58-55 with 1:45 to go, but
Szczerbiak's perfect performance from the line when the pressure
was on sealed the victory for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 6 in the nation, Utah is the highest-ranked team the
RedHawks have beaten. But Miami and Wally's World will get another
stern test Friday against eighth-ranked and tradition-rich
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a name to us,'' Estick said. ``They have to dribble
and shoot just like we do. We feel we can play with anybody because
we practice harder than most teams play.''

 &HT;    High seeds' path blocked to Sweet 16
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A classic between two of college basketball's heavyweights put
the perfect ending to the first week of the NCAA Tournament on
Sunday as Kentucky outlasted Kansas 92-88 in overtime in the second
round of the Midwest Regional in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (27-8), the defending national champions, advance
to this week's regional semifinals in St. Louis, where they meet
10th seed Miami of Ohio, which stunned second-seeded Utah 66-58.
</P>
<P>
   Even though all four top seeds advanced to Sweet 16, five
double-digit seeds _ Gonzaga, Southwest Missouri State, Purdue,
Miami of Ohio and Oklahoma _ beat the odds and will crash the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A quick look ahead:
</P>
<P>
   EAST: Duke's path was made considerably easier Sunday by two
upsets in Boston. Third seed Cincinnati, the only team to beat the
Blue Devils this season, was upset by sixth seed Temple 64-54. Then
second seed Miami of Florida was knocked off by 10th seed Purdue
73-63. The Blue Devils (34-1) will be the only ranked team in the
regional semifinals when they take on 12th seed Southwest Missouri
State Friday in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH: This was the only regional holding to form, with the top
four seeds advancing. No. 1 seed Auburn (29-3) won a tough game
with Oklahoma State on Saturday and will have its hands full with
Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd, the Ohio State backcourt, Thursday
in Knoxville. Maryland (28-5) vs. St. John's (27-8) could be one of
the tournament's best games.
</P>
<P>
   WEST: Tenth seed Gonzaga (27-6), which upset second seed
Stanford on Saturday, next meets Florida (22-8), which is in the
Sweet 16 for only the fourth time. But the team to beat in Phoenix
will still be top seed UConn (30-2), which is going for its first
Final Four. The Huskies must first beat surprising Iowa (20-9), on
an emotional high as it plays for coach Tom Davis, who is leaving
at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST: No. 13 seed Oklahoma (21-10), the last at-large team to
get a bid in the tournament, played its way into the Sweet 16 by
beating N.C. Charlotte 85-72 and will face top seed Michigan State
(28-5), which rallied to beat Mississippi 74-66.

 &HT;    Gordon gets a grip at AMS
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forty-three cars started the race and the survivors
were driving into the twilight in the 500-mile test of man and
engine, named for a chain of roadside food stops called Cracker
Barrel. There is some speculation that the Indian burial ground at
the north end of Atlanta Motor Speedway has cast a spell over this
stock car Taj Mahal. The November race, known as the NAPA, wasn't
finished until near midnight because of foul weather. The race last
March, known as the Primestar, was refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the gentlemen didn't start their engines until an
hour and a half after the time advertised. A pea soup fog shrouded
the place until after noon. Then the surface had to be dried. These
guys wouldn't put a tire on a racing surface where somebody had
spilled even a teacup of water.
</P>
<P>
   The sky scowled throughout the race, sometimes spitting a few
drops that sent the racers scurrying for the pits. In olden times,
this race probably never would have been finished, but the
entrepreneurial Bruton Smith had thought of everything. The maitre
d' of this shrine of speed installed a lighting system fit to read
by. Otherwise, this would have been a run against darkness as well
as cranky weather.
</P>
<P>
   When this place struggled into life about 40 years ago, it was
hampered by foul weather. Rain turned it into a mud bog. Races were
delayed, postponed or shortened. It was known then as Atlanta
International Raceway, AIR, which some translated to ``Atlanta
International Rainmaker.'' Almost as if by tradition, just as this
race ended and the winner (surprise!), Jeff Gordon, parked in the
winner's circle, a little benedictional shower sprinkled the area.
</P>
<P>
   It seems rather fitting that Jeff Gordon broke into NASCAR
racing in the race that Richard (The King) Petty drove his last, on
this same track, before reconfiguration, in 1992. He finished 31st.
In retrospect, though, it seems now like an unofficial succession
to the throne, for since that time Gordon has won 44 races, been
the Winston Cup champion three times, and married a beauty queen.
He's 27, looks 18, and has the trim frame of an athlete who should
be performing on the centre court at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of California, stopped over a few years at
Indianapolis, where he became introduced to serious racing, then,
lo and behold, went back and won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis
in 1994. Now his address is Mooresville, N.C., where he settled
among the top cats of stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Like golf needs Tiger Woods, like baseball needs Kerry Wood,
stock car racing warmly embraces the princely figure of Jeff
Gordon. The old guard is losing its grip, and while their lineage
is following them into the game, the weanling Earnhardts, Pettys,
et al. are not yet far enough from the crib to take up the slack.
Meantime, Dale Earnhardt, Bill Elliott and Darrell Waltrip, three
old standards, are having trouble finding their way to victory
lane.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt won just once last year. Elliott hasn't won in five
years. Waltrip hasn't won since 1992, and harsh as it may seem,
when he goes out now he has about as much chance as Arnold Palmer
has of winning a golf tournament. Earnhardt hit the wall on the
22nd lap Sunday, came back out 136 laps later, and it was sort of
sad to see his No. 3 limping around the oval at the end.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gordon's second winning trip in a row here,
contradicting his conclusion that he has ``not been my best here at
Atlanta.'' He had won the crown jewel, Daytona 500, conked out
early at Rockingham and rebounded with a third at Las Vegas. Still,
he wasn't, and still isn't, the points leader. A refugee from truck
racing, Mike Skinner, came into this race leading, and still does,
with a sixth-place finish. The 39th finish at Rockingham left
Gordon with a tough hill to climb, but he is accustomed to climbing
tough hills, though ``I never really thought of taking up racing as
a career.''
</P>
<P>
   He started slow Sunday, left the dueling to Bobby Labonte, who
has won three times on this track, and Skinner, the trucker. When
the lights came on, it was Gordon's time to shine. In the end, he
led 109 laps, especially No. 325. After which Gordon said, ``It has
been a stellar start to the season,'' and there's no questioning
that.

ANGELS MENDING FENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The asymmetrical outfield fence dimensions at
Edison Field were meant to give the ballpark a look of its own and
a flavor of the old-time ballparks. But it also took a toll on the
number of home runs the Anaheim Angels hit last season.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions in center and the power alley in left-center were
408 feet and 396, respectively. The result was the fewest number of
homers since 1994. Although the Angels used the extra room to hit a
club-record 314 doubles, a number of potential homers found an
outfielder's glove at the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   So the Angels announced Sunday they are moving the fence in to
400 in center and 387 in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``These alterations are something that was a topic of discussion
throughout last season,'' general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``When
the (Anaheim Stadium) renovation was taking place we discussed
leaving available the option of moving the fences forward in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason they didn't just build it that way originally was
because with newly built concourses, they were unsure how the air
currents would flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we built them in, it would be much more difficult to move
them back out,'' Bavasi said. ``Which was a concern not knowing how
the wind would affect fly balls. We didn't want a situation like
Baltimore (Camden Yards).''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: First baseman Mo Vaughn was scratched from
Sunday's game because of a tight right hamstring. Third baseman
Dave Hollins aggravated his left hamstring rounding second base in
the first inning and had to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Some players have blamed the rash of sore hamstrings on the
infield dirt. ``I can't remember it being that soft,'' said
Hollins, who added his hamstring was ``just sore and he'd be OK in
a couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley (muscle strain upper back/neck) will make his first
spring start Tuesday against the White Sox in Tempe. His catcher
will be Todd Greene (shoulder), making his first appearance behind
the plate this spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Dickson: Jason Dickson, competing for the fifth spot in the
starting rotation, gave up four runs (all earned) and seven hits in
two-plus innings in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``I've seen this guy pitch for two years. I know what he can do.
Today he got his pitches up, and he's down when he's on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson said he simply ran out of gas in the third inning, when
he gave up three runs without recording an out. Omar Olivares, also
competing for the No. 5 spot, will pitch today at the Angels'
minor-league camp in Mesa. The rest of the team has the day off,
the only full day off all spring.
</P>
<P>
   Roster moves: The Angels are expected to option outfielder Norm
Hutchins to minor-league camp today. Hutchins, one of the best
Angels prospects, impressed Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played as good as anybody in this camp,'' Collins said.
``He's one of the most improved players on this team. He made
tremendous strides at both sides of the plate and in the outfield.
A couple years ago I saw him misjudge three balls in the outfield,
now he's making catches Jim Edmonds makes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels cut six others from their roster Sunday. Pitcher Reid
Cornelius was released, while pitchers Scott Brown, Kevin Lomon and
Paul Menhart, infielder Chuck Abbott and catcher Ben Molina were
returned to minor-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Second baseman Justin Baughman, recovering slowly from
multiple fractures in his left leg, said he'll decide by Wednesday
whether he'll have a second surgery.... The Angels are still
negotiating a multi-year contract with reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa
_ expected to be two years with an option for a third. Hasegawa
signed a one-year deal for $625,000 last week when the deadline
came for renewal of players with zero to three years of
major-league experience.

 By   TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The presidents of the three sanctioning bodies for
the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification bout
have ordered a rematch within six months. The bout Saturday night
at Madison Square Garden ended in a controversial draw, even though
it appeared that Lewis had clearly controlled the entire fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame there was so much controversy attached to this
important fight,'' Bob Lee, president of the IBF, told The
Associated Press. ``But we did what we thought was the most
sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee met with Gilberto Mendoza, president of the WBA, and Jose
Sulaiman of the WBC early Sunday morning, right after the fight,
and decided to order the rematch. Holyfield is the WBA and IBF
champion and Lewis holds the WBC title.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is whether a rematch can be scheduled,
considering the difficulty in working out the first bout. Both the
fighters and all the promoters involved are in favor of a rematch,
but that does not mean it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   There might not be enough money in the fight for both the boxers
_ Holyfield received $20 million for Saturday night's fight and
Lewis got $10 million. The rematch clause in Lewis' contract calls
for him to earn $15 million and Holyfield will probably ask for
more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Gov. George Pataki said he would ask the New
York State Athletic Commission to look into the controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that his administration has worked hard to bring
championship boxing back to Madison Square Garden, ``but it has to
be done in a way that upholds the integrity of the game and
people's confidence in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King will have to get back the confidence and the
money from somewhere and it will be a tough sell, because it was
not a particularly tantalizing fight and the outcome appeared
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the fans' reaction to King after the fight on
Saturday night, it will be an uphill struggle. As he was exiting
the main arena to attend the post-fight news conference, someone
from the stands yelled: ``Hey Don! Where are you taking the judges
on vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to the fact that in the past King has taken
the jury members of his federal court trials on vacation or made
them his guests at fights that he promotes.
</P>
<P>
   King said he expects to be made the villain in the controversy,
but he said he had no role in picking or assigning the judges. Each
of the sanctioning organizations selected a judge and the judges
had to be approved by both fighters' camps.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' trainer, Emanuel Steward, said he objected to the judges,
but he would not say which judge or why. Steward said, however,
that he only mentioned his objections within the camp. Frank
Maloney, Lewis' manager, said he didn't have a problem with the
judges when they were first selected.
</P>
<P>
   The fight left unresolved the question of who the next
undisputed heavyweight champion would be, and it put a greater
focus on the subjective nature of scoring by the ringside judges.
And with Lewis clearly controlling the fight from start to finish
and not getting a victory, the public will again call into question
the integrity of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hurts me that this happened in my sport,'' Steward
said. ``People spent millions of dollars on this fight. We owe it
to them to make sure things like this don't happen. I don't take
this lightly. This is a disgrace to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Christodolou of South Africa scored the fight,
116-113, for Lewis. Judge Eugenia Williams of New Jersey scored the
fight, &QC; 115-113, for Holyfield and judge Larry O'Connell of Britain
scored the fight 115-115. It was one of the most controversial
decisions in a big-time fight in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was interviewed by Fox Sports following the bout,
said she didn't have a problem with her scoring. She was the only
judge to give Holyfield the fifth round, a round in which Lewis
landed a big right hand on the top of Holyfield's head and pinned
him on the ropes with a barrage of unanswered punches for 45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she based her final score on the number of punches
that Holyfield threw during the fight. According to Compubox punch
statistics, Holyfield landed only 130 of 385 punches, while Lewis
landed 348 of 613 punches. When informed that Holyfield threw fewer
punches than Lewis, Williams said she was merely doing her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care what the public saw,'' Williams said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fight was broadcast live on TVKO pay-per-view to more than 1
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in the minority in her view that Holyfield (36-3-1)
won the bout. Even Holyfield's trainer, Don Turner, thought the
fight was a draw. ``I had Evander losing five of the first seven
rounds, but I had him winning the rest of the fight,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, 36, wasn't sure whether it should have been a draw.
``I haven't seen the fight yet,'' he said. ``When I watch it, I'll
let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Holyfield did not fight the right fight to beat
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to fight more inside, but he could never get
inside,'' Turner said. ``He was never able to land more than one
punch at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox fights better tall than any fighter I've ever seen. He
leans back more away from punches. He fought a very different fight
than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield didn't look to be in good shape as he left the
post-fight news conference early Sunday morning. A doctor gave him
ice for various parts of his aching body and he remained standing
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Turner denied reports that Holyfield was treated early Sunday
morning for injured ribs, but he did confirm that Holyfield
suffered severe cramps in his legs during the bout beginning in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, Lewis, 33, fought a smart fight. He kept
Holyfield away with his jab and when Holyfield did manage to get
inside, Lewis tied him up so that he couldn't land any punches.
Holyfield also missed on several looping lefts and rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and the style was too much for him,'' Steward said.
``Evander was missing punches by two feet. That's just Lennox's
size and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1-1) did what he needed to do to walk away with the
undisputed heavyweight title, but he left it in the judges' hands
by not knocking out Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's prediction of a third-round knockout never
materialized, even though he picked up the action more in that
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did predict I would knock him out in the third round,''
Holyfield said. ``I was wrong. Maybe in the next fight.'' &QL;

LARROQUETTE'S `PAYNE' FOLLOWS A `FAWLTY' FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Larroquette's name in his new series is Royal Payne.
</P>
<P>
   And he is. The show is ``Payne'' (Monday night on CBS), and
Larroquette plays the ethically impaired proprietor of a seaside
inn.
</P>
<P>
   JoBeth Williams is his wife Constance _ close, I guess, to
constant pain. You almost expect them to have a kid named Stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chambermaid, Breeze (Julie Benz), and a much-abused
bellman, Mohammed (Rick Batalla) of indeterminate national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Does ``Payne'' sound familiar? Yes, it's yet another American
effort to duplicate the success of John Cleese's ``Fawlty Towers''
and its surprisingly sparse 12 episodes of British farce.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier try was ``Amanda's,'' which survived half a season
on ABC in 1983. Its star, Beatrice Arthur, found better lodgings
with ``The Golden Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The new show actually comes across more as a mean-spirited
``Newhart'' than as a ``Fawlty Towers'' clone. But it's not bad if
you have a high tolerance for broad physical humor _ and for
Larroquette.
</P>
<P>
   Whether as Dan Fielding on ``Night Court'' or Royal Payne here,
Larroquette is one of television's better comedy heels. The best,
maybe, since Gale Gordon blunderbussed his way through ``Our Miss
Brooks,'' ''The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Gordon foils were mostly just over-starched shirts,
whereas Larroquette reaches his highest notes as a liar, a cheat
and a bully.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after forgetting his wedding anniversary, he tries to
placate Williams by giving her an antique diamond pin that's been
left behind accidentally by a guest. When the guest returns, things
become sticky.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiness includes much gesticulation, wringing of hands,
bounding here and there and _ an old comedy standby _ hiding an
intruder in the bedroom. Also, Larroquette clapping a palm over
Williams' breast. Whatever works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne'' would seem to be an adequate fit for CBS' midlife and
older audience. It's a handsome production with a strong comfort
factor, considering that the show is taking a fundamental risk.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is making Larroquette's character the center of the
show. Usually, we're supposed to like our lead characters and cluck
amusedly at the misdeeds of supporting scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne'' returns on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., and that will be
its usual spot. This Wednesday's episode is worth watching for a
piece of business Larroquette performs with a leaky pen. It's a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ And then there's ``Rescue 77,'' barging into homes Monday on
the WB.
</P>
<P>
   The action series focuses on three paramedics (Christian Kane,
Victor Brown, Marjorie Monaghan) attached to a Los Angeles fire
station. Richard Roundtree plays the station house captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rescue 77'' is in the tradition of all sort of ``rescue''
shows, including ABC's ``240-Robert.'' I happen to remember that
one because it turned out that the helicopter was flown not by the
presumed pilot, Joanna Cassidy, but by a guy cleverly disguised as
a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the most important thing to know about ``Rescue 77'' is
that it's an Aaron Spelling show. That means the show is badly
written and populated with attractive young performers who can't
act a lick.
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan appears to be the worst actor on display here.
Good-looking blonde, mind you. But when she says, ``I'm sorry'' to
a dying woman, she makes it sound as if she's just knocked over a
salt shaker.

FLEET TO ACQUIRE BANKBOSTON   IN $16 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group Inc. sealed an agreement Sunday to acquire
BankBoston Corp., creating a powerful new financial institution out
of two bitter rivals and increasing the odds that Boston will be
home to a major bank into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-for-stock deal, valued at $16 billion, stunned the
banking world by bringing together two strikingly different
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The combined entity, for now called Fleet Boston Corp., creates
the nation's eighth-largest bank, with $178 billion in assets, and
establishes a new, stronger player in national and international
banking.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly put together on the initiative of Fleet chief
executive Terrence Murray, the deal underscores the dominant
position of Fleet _ an aggressive company that has grown rapidly in
recent years _ over BankBoston, a patrician, 215-year-old
institution that has recently stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of New England's two largest banks, both
headquartered in Boston, may presage a new wave of consolidation
among the nation's top banks. Under such a winnowing, to be played
out in coming years, Fleet Boston Corp. could buy more financial
firms or itself be taken over, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Murray, 59, will be chairman and
chief executive of the new company for two years. During that
period, his counterpart at BankBoston, Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford,
will serve in the No. 2 position as president and chief operating
officer. At the end of 2001, Murray will retire, staying on as
chairman, leaving Gifford, 56, to run the new company, according to
a joint statement issued by the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Fleet-BankBoston will have to sell off $13 billion in
deposits as well as an unspecified number of automated teller
machines to meet regulatory and antitrust requirements. Executives
at both banks said the new entity would also close a couple dozen
branches and lay off between 4,000 and 5,000 employees across New
England. The companies are expected to announce specific figures on
branch closings and layoffs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks were keen to portray the combination as a merger of
equals. But Fleet has clearly acquired its smaller competitor.
Fleet is paying $53 per BankBoston share, an amount 13 percent
above the bank's closing price on Friday of $46 15/16 and 30
percent above its price one week ago Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks formally announced the deal Sunday after a report
first describing the acquisition appeared on Boston.com, The Boston
Globe's on-line service.
</P>
<P>
   For Murray, buying BankBoston is the crowning achievement in a
37-year career in which he turned a tiny unknown bank in Rhode
Island into a regional powerhouse and national contender. For
Gifford, whose bank is descended from the nation's oldest bank, the
deal comes amid disappointing earnings and investor worries about
BankBoston's troubled Latin American operations.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street has been enthusiastic about Fleet's strong
growth and earnings in recent months, it has punished BankBoston by
pushing its stock price down and shrinking its market value. Such
pressure made BankBoston vulnerable to a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been rife with rumors in recent months that a
regional, national, or overseas bank would try to acquire
BankBoston. One source close to the deal said Murray moved to
acquire his competitor before anyone else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry drove the deal,'' the source said, adding that talks
between the two banks began approximately six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, with bank mergers in full force, Gifford and Murray
held talks about a possible combination. But the merger fell apart
when senior BankBoston executives objected that the companies were
too different. This time around, sources said, BankBoston's board
was more enthusiastic about a deal, mostly because of the company's
weakened financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston Corp. will produce annual savings of $600 million a
year several years from now, Fleet chief financial officer Eugene
McQuade said in an interview Sunday, adding that the transaction is
expected to boost earnings next year.
</P>
<P>
   McQuade will be chief financial officer of the new entity, while
his counterpart at BankBoston, Susannah Swihart, has been asked to
step down and run a new $100 million charitable foundation that
Fleet Boston Corp. will establish.
</P>
<P>
   Henrique Meirelles, now BankBoston's president, will join Robert
Higgins, currently Fleet's president, in managing the combined
entity's core business lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, currently the nation's ninth-largest bank, is a
diversified financial services company, with credit card, mortgage,
discount stock brokerage, and asset management operations. It has
$104.5 billion in assets and a market capitalization of $25
billion. With 35,000 employees and 1,150 branches, nearly all of
its business is US-based.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, BankBoston is a smaller operation, with different
business lines. Most of its 427 branches are in Massachusetts, and
it derives around 20 percent of its revenues from Latin America,
where it has been active since 1917. BankBoston, currently the
nation's 15th-largest bank, also owns an investment bank, San
Francisco-based Robertson Stephens. With $73.5 billion in assets
and 25,000 employees, its market capitalization, at $13 billion, is
half Fleet's.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's earnings last year were $1.58 billion, compared with
$879.2 million for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two companies are reflected in the
styles of their leaders. Murray, who grew up in blue-collar
Woonsocket, R.I., is a tough executive constantly in search of a
deal. By contrast, Gifford, prominent in Boston social circles, has
been more risk averse, banking analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's acquisition of BankBoston _ formalized in New York on
Saturday afternoon _ is expected to close in the fourth quarter
after approval from regulators and the Justice Department. Under
the terms of the deal, BankBoston shareholders will receive 1.1844
shares of Fleet stock for each BankBoston share they own. Fleet
shareholders will own 62 percent of the new company, while
BankBoston shareholders will own 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means that Fleet is paying 3.2 times BankBoston's book
value of $4.9 billion _ a ratio analysts described Sunday as
neither too high nor too low.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 million customers, a combined Fleet-BankBoston ``creates
an organization that becomes large enough to compete with any bank
in the country,'' industry analyst Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony
Inc. said. Cassidy said that based on branch concentration for both
banks, he expected branch closings to in the Route 128 area and in
Hartford and Providence.
</P>
<P>
   The merger creates a much more diversified financial services
company that corresponds more to the model of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined company will have a healthy mix of earnings
streams, with greater emphasis on higher growth businesses and less
reliance on core banking activities,'' Fleet's Murray said in a
statement Sunday. He said that no line of business would contribute
more than 20 percent of total earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was also driven by both Gifford's and Murray's
desire to see Boston end up with at least one major bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a major city and don't have a bank, it's a negative
and a disadvantage in terms of prestige and allocation of resources
to area businesses,'' said one source close to the transaction.
``Neither Terry nor Chad wanted Boston to become like a lot of
major American cities that don't have a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Fleet Boston Corp. is temporary, and will be scrapped
after the new company conducts a market survey. But the new entity
will retain the name BankBoston Corp. for its Latin American
operations. The company will scrap BankBoston's corporate logo _ an
eagle in flight _ and may get rid of Fleet's logo _ three sailboats
_ as well.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said the merger became possible after Gifford
reevaluated the company's strategic position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry and Chad got to know each other a lot better in the past
year,'' Swihart said. ``Our industry is steadily evolving, and
recent mergers have shown that scale and size are important.''
</P>
<P>
   New York investment banks Goldman Sachs Inc. and Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette were Fleet's advisers on the deal. BankBoston
used Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has said that he wanted Fleet to grow to $150 billion to
$200 billion in assets. By acquiring BankBoston, he is now in the
middle of that range. The new company has a market capitalization
of $40 billion, ranking it seventh in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boston banks have grown this decade through acquisitions of
smaller area banks and financial services firms. Most notably,
Fleet bought Shawmut National Corp. in 1995 after then Bank of
Boston failed to seal a deal. Gifford responded by acquiring
BayBanks Inc. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   US banks have gone through a wave of mergers in recent years
that have created a new breed of megabank with $600 billion in
assets and market capitalizations of $300 billion. Those deals,
designed to cut costs and boost market share, have put pressure on
smaller banks to combine in order to compete and survive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gifford had said in recent months that he felt no
pressure to do a deal and preferred to remain independent. That
sentiment clearly changed in recent months, as BankBoston failed to
convince Wall Street that it could go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston Corp.'s board of directors will have 22 members,
including 12 from the current Fleet board and 10 from the current
BankBoston board.

EX-OFFICIAL AT BANKERS TRUST CLAIMS FRAUD-CASE SETUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ B.J. Kingdon, a once high-powered executive at
Bankers Trust Corp., is being unfairly singled out as the
mastermind of a fraud at the bank by his former employer and the
federal government, his lawyer contends.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said Bankers Trust withheld stock
options and other benefits from Kingdon, who has yet to be charged
with any crimes, to compel him to cooperate with the federal
investigation into corruption at the bank. Kingdon is now the chief
target of that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Arkin said, Bankers Trust only pleaded guilty to
criminal fraud charges filed against it by the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan to complete its merger with Deutsche Bank AG of
Germany more rapidly. Had the merger not been in the works, Arkin
speculated, Bankers Trust would have more forcefully contested the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust declined to respond to Arkin's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues of Kingdon said he enjoyed the good life. They
said he owned at least two racehorses, one of which, Crafty Card,
made regular appearances at the Monmouth Race Track in New Jersey.
They also described Kingdon, a resident of Oceanport, N.J., as a
natty dresser who favored expensive clothing and made frequent
visits to a castle he owns in Ireland. The former colleagues, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had family members living
in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon sat on Bankers Trust's 12-member operating committee and
oversaw its custody, corporate trust and pension services
businesses before resigning in early 1997. Last week, Bankers Trust
pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges that senior officers and
employees in Kingdon's division had illegally diverted $19.1
million in unclaimed checks and other credits owed to customers to
the bank's own books to improve its financial performance from 1994
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That admission would cast the company's viability into doubt
were it not in the midst of completing a merger with Deutsche Bank.
Many large bank customers are forbidden to do business with a
company that has admitted to a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust agreed to pay a $60 million fine to the federal
government and a separate fine of $3.5 million to New York state
authorities for the illegal scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Unclaimed bank funds fall under ``escheat laws'' that typically
require that such funds be turned over to the state. Instead,
Bankers Trust used the funds to pad its performance at a time when
the bank was mired in a scandal stemming from questionable sales
tactics involving complex financial products known as derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust recorded a $20 million charge against its earnings
in early 1997 to reconcile accounting differences the bank had
uncovered in Kingdon's division. Kingdon's unit accounted for about
$94 million of Bankers Trust's overall earnings of $612 million in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said his client did not have criminal intent in mind when
his division appropriated the unclaimed funds. He also said that
cases involving suspected improprieties related to unclaimed funds
are typically weak because the law applying to such cases is murky.
Arkin said his client would contest any criminal charges that might
be filed against him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bankers Trust gave Kingdon a gentle sendoff when his resignation
was announced in 1997. Frank Newman, the bank's chief executive,
said at the time that Kingdon was leaving to ``turn his focus
toward his personal life'' and spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon reported directly to the president of Bankers Trust,
Eugene Shanks, during years in which Bankers Trust illegally padded
its results with unclaimed funds. Former colleagues of Kingdon said
he insisted on reporting directly to Shanks. Shanks did not return
phone calls seeking comment, nor did Charles Sanford, who was the
bank's chief executive during that period.

at Fort Irwin in California. Many military experts and
reform-minded critics, some within the Army itself, say the service
has moved far too slowly to transform a force that, although
smaller, looks much as it did when the United States prepared to
slug it out with the Soviet Union on the plains of central Europe.

promises of the Contract With America class of 1994. Jacob's fervor
was forged in what he terms ``re-education camp'' 20 years ago,

principle, the government's attempt to create a roster of men
theoretically eligible for future military draft. ``I felt that at

03-14 -- An Army soldier taking a break during war game exercises
at Fort Irwin in California. Many military experts and
reform-minded critics, some within the Army itself, say the service
has moved far too slowly to transform a force that, although
smaller, looks much as it did when the United States prepared to
slug it out with the Soviet Union on the plains of central Europe.
Facing that reality, the Army is now moving to change the way it
organizes its units and trains them to fight. (Ted Soqui/New York

theoretically eligible for future military draft. ``I felt that at

MOVE WILL MAINTAIN A NEW ENGLAND INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was as good as it was going to get.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that plenty of people are going to lose their
jobs in the combination of Fleet Financial Group Inc. and
BankBoston Corp. (not good), but at the same time Terry Murray and
Chad Gifford went a long way to ensuring that Boston doesn't become
just another branch-bank city for BankAmerica Corp. or First Union
Corp. And make no mistake: That mattered not a little but a lot to
Murray and Gifford, both New Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   When the winners and losers are totaled, Murray emerges not just
as a winner but as a visionary. Here's a guy who came from nowhere
running a tiny Rhode Island bank called Industrial National, and
now sits atop all of New England banking. He was right: Size does
matter.
</P>
<P>
   And Gifford? He's scheduled to run the combined bank two years
down the road. But then BankAmerica chief executive David Coulter
was going to run the combined NationsBank-BankAmerica. Today's he
gone. We'll see soon enough on Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of inside-baseball aside, the region emerges as a
clear winner because it does matter where the bank calls home. When
the job cuts come, would you rather be working in the Boston
headquarters or in Charlotte's Boston office? If you are raising
money for the Boston Symphony Orchestra or Children's Hospital, do
you want to be calling on the hometown chief executive or a
regional vice president?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why BankAmerica chief executive Hugh McColl is
a hero in Charlotte for making his bank, and city, a winner. Murray
and Gifford, in putting aside their real differences, have given
Boston the same chance.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run BankAmerica, First Union, and Bank One Corp.
are not going to be happy about this neat Boston deal. BankBoston,
with its sagging stock price, was beginning to look like lunch for
some of these big national players, and who is to say Fleet was
untouchable, either?
</P>
<P>
   Now Murray &AMP; Co. are going to do all they can to keep the big
competitors out. To get this deal past the regulators _ and you can
be sure they have already gotten a wink and a nod there _
Fleet-BankBoston is expected to have to divest something like $13
billion of $110 billion in deposits, maybe $10 billion of that in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what the regulators require, there could either be
one big buyer or several small ones. Already there is talk about
establishing three separate banks _ one each in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island _ and selling them to separate
bidders. The last thing Murray wants is for regulators to force him
to spin off enough branches and deposits that someone like First
Union could turn into a serious competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly in the space of a decade we're down to one New England
megabank and a bunch of midgets. Murray and others will tell you
quite rightly that there is no shortage of competition: How many of
us are walking around with Visa cards in our wallets from Citicorp?
The mortgage business is driven by brokers and their only loyalty
is to who has the best rate, not the address on the headquarter's
door.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end it would be better for everyone to have a
world-class competitor on the ground who could push back against
the new Fleet-BankBoston behemoth. Competition is good, and we just
eliminated one big competitor. Replacing it with another would be a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   It could, ironically, even be good for Fleet-BankBoston. These
are two very different banks, and the chance of internecine warfare
at the top is real. A tough competitor would focus its attention
where it belongs _ outward _ and not allow it the luxury of years
of battles on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   A final note: The Boston Connection may not have run its course.
Even after the merger, Fleet-BankBoston will have a market
capitalization of just $40 billion; BankAmerica's market cap is
$125 billion; Citigroup's is $149 billion.

novel's steady retreat from realism is as much a result of film's
expansive record of the way the world looks as it is of the
increasing sophistications of literature itself. ``Still, after a
hundred years or so, it may be that movies can do nothing more for,
or to, literature than they already have done,'' says Doctorow.

03-14 -- An Army soldier taking a break during war game exercises
at Fort Irwin in California. Many military experts and
reform-minded critics, some within the Army itself, say the service
has moved far too slowly to transform a force that, although
smaller, looks much as it did when the United States prepared to
slug it out with the Soviet Union on the plains of central Europe.
Facing that reality, the Army is now moving to change the way it
organizes its units and trains them to fight. (Ted Soqui/New York

NFL TO L.A.'S SUITORS: SHOW US THE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Four NFL seasons have come and gone since the Rams and
Raiders left greater Los Angeles, long enough for its most fervent
NFL fans to have discovered a life.
</P>
<P>
   There's been no anguish, no rallies for a common cause. There
has been no sense of outrage like there was in Cleveland when Art
Modell abruptly moved the Browns to Baltimore. If we're losing
contact with any need for pro football, it is developing slower
than the Rams' old running game.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who are exceptions to this are here in Phoenix
seeking papal approval from the league to put an expansion team in
Los Angeles. For the last year or longer, Kings owner Ed Roski and
Hollywood shaman Michael Ovitz have put a spotlight on L.A.'s NFL
profile, such as it is, and talked the city up like no one in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Without overstating the reach or motives of either, you have to
go back to the days of Walter O'Malley and Jack Kent Cooke, who
built facilities on their own dime, to find someone with this much
L.A. loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL's response to both men has been typically feckless.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acknowledging all that Roski, a commercial real
estate baron, has done in the last five years -- breath life into a
new visage of the Coliseum, save the Kings from bankruptcy, build
the Staples Center, add a billionaire (Eli Broad) to his New
Coliseum team -- it is frowning at his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bonding with Ovitz, who the league encouraged to get
involved because of his showmanship and glitz, it looks down on his
fractured financing, conveniently forgetting that agents are always
doing things with other people's money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reasserting itself boldly in a market which once
supported two teams, the league comes with its hand out again. The
league's answer to every financial question is always the same:
More. If Cleveland's franchise fee was $476 million and the
Redskins' sale with stadium was $800 million, then any fee for the
``vast potential'' of Los Angeles must be $650 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   For the opportunity to return to the NFL, the league is telling
its two L.A. suitors that it wants more money than George
Steinbrenner wanted to sell the Yankees, and that their current
resources apparently are not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   A less patient man would have told the NFL to punt months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are far fewer opportunities in L.A. to turn a profit than
there are in the two most recent examples. Fan loyalty was never a
concern in Cleveland; the Browns may sell out their new stadium
into the third millenium. Economists who studied Al Lerner's
purchase estimate he will start showing a profit in year six or
seven, as long as the league's TV revenue doesn't go into freefall.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners of the Redskins inherit a virtually new stadium
with all of the perks, plus a waiting list for season tickets that
circles the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such guarantees here, where construction costs run
higher, where one of the first versions of the PSL bombed when the
Raiders were still in the Coliseum. Whoever gets a team here, be it
Ovitz, Roski or some other rich man, will have to overcome the
sizeable ill will left behind by Georgia Frontiere and Al Davis.
And lord knows what ticket prices and PSLs will be for any owner
needing to cover an obscene nut.
</P>
<P>
   The league says it wants to make sure any franchise here will
succeed. But if that's true, then why is the rumored franchise fee
running hotter than the Dow Jones? Why isn't the league putting its
own money into a stadium, an idea it once suggested but now appears
to have abandoned?
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to go far to find people critical of the way
the NFL operates.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants owner Wellington Mara left a committee meeting
Sunday shaking his head over the league's franchise follies, the
vacating of L.A., Houston and Cleveland in a two-year span. ``I
never thought we'd ever leave Houston, much less Los Angeles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what that says about the league. ``That maybe we
need to look at our own values.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the exec with a team who remembers one rancorous
closed session meeting of owners a year or so ago. An owner needing
renovations to his stadium presented a plan which featured $80
million of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, it featured (ital) no (end ital) public money.
``(Commissioner Paul) Tagliabue got up and said `no, no, no, we
can't have any team doing anything with its own money,' '' the exec
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when Pat Bowlen (Denver), Mike Brown (Cincinnati) and
Dan Rooney (Pittsburgh) were all looking for public money to help
with new stadiums. (Tagliabue) said there can not be an attempt for
a privately funded stadium when so many teams are seeking public
money for new stadiums or renovations. He said `If one team does
it, the public will get angry and expect every team to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When you hear stories like that and follow the public money
trail everywhere else, one's pessimistic view becomes even more
entrenched. As naughty as the Raiders and Davis were here, he's no
more cunning and rapacious as the league. Less so, because there's
no pretense.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. may or may not get an expansion franchise this week. One
way or the other, the sense is that despite four years without a
team, L.A. is still getting sacked.

SKINNER'S BGN WIN TAKEN AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Upon further review, Mike Skinner's first NASCAR
Busch Grand National Series victory did not happen at Atlanta Motor
Speedway on Saturday after all.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials discovered an unapproved cylinder head during
an inspection after the Yellow Freight 300 Saturday evening.
Race-winner Skinner, making his second BGN start for team owner
David Ridling, was relegated to the 43rd and last spot in the
revised standings, and will receive the prize money and points for
that position.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the race's title sponsor also is Skinner's primary
backer on the No. 19 Chevrolet Monte Carlo he is scheduled to drive
in a limited BGN schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Former World of Outlaws champion Dave Blaney, who finished 2.261
seconds behind Skinner, was declared the revised winner of his
first BGN race. Pole-sitter Blaney, driver of the No. 93 Amoco
Pontiac Grand Prix, made his 24th career Busch start Saturday on
the 1.54-mile quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations, said Skinner's
team was in violation of a rule stating that all cylinder heads
must be NASCAR-approved, and all modifications must be submitted to
the sanctioning body before any proposed modification is eligible
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head was an approved part,'' Triplett said yesterday
morning, ``but the modification was unapproved. Our question was
the shaping of the port \Ron the inside of the head\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the reaction of Skinner's team, Triplett said,
``Well, they didn't agree with us. We didn't expect that. But they
have a right to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, whose top BGN finish remains a 24th-place effort, was
taken aback by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision scarred what I thought was a great day on the
track,'' said Skinner, who was competing in only his ninth BGN
race. ``I don't know about the motors. I don't build the motors.
It's a judgment call and NASCAR has to make it. All I do is drive,
but I don't agree with it.''

FIGHT WAS A FARCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KIRKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early Sunday morning after another one of his shows
had been tainted by the scoring of unscrupulous judges, Don King
was being interviewed by a TV guy in the Madison Square Garden
press area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person has an inalienable right in America to make the
kind of decision his conscience sees fit to make,'' King was
intoning in his characteristic booming voice. ``You don't have to
like it, you don't have to agree with it. There are a lot of
unpopular decisions made every day in this great land of ours. What
about the Dred Scott decision? There are injustices perpetuated
every day in America. What makes our country so beautiful and so
utterly unique is that we accept these decisions peacefully and do
our best to rectify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don King paused momentarily, and suddenly his faced gleamed with
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it again,'' he said. ``Let's have a rematch. That's
the only way to settle this burning controversy. Let's have these
two great warriors fight it out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Please, Don, spare us the agony.
</P>
<P>
   One one-sided, even tedious Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield fight
is enough.
</P>
<P>
   The only faint resemblance this tame affair had with that
memorable Ali-Frazier I classic held 28 years earlier in the same
building was that it was fought inside the same 20 by 20 ring.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, forget about it!
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to see Lennox Lewis, younger, stronger, quicker,
fresher, busier, once again relentlessly hammer a once gallant
warrior whose best days are far behind him?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if these two men have a rematch---and let's all keep our
fingers crossed that they won't---the only chance the aging
Holyfield would have would be if King once again makes sure the
officials are solidly aligned in his corner as they were Saturday
night when they somehow wound up giving Holyfield a draw even
though he landed only 130 punches across the 12 rounds to the 348
he received from Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   And knowing Don King as we all know him, he would see to it the
deck once again would be stacked against Lewis, who should be
savoring today being the first undisputed heavyweight champion from
Great Britain in 102 years but, instead, is grieving over one of
the most corrupt decisions in the history of a sport brimming with
them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what behind-the-scenes machinations Don King did to
pull off this latest farce to curse boxing, but one grudgingly has
to hand it to King for the sheer chutzpah of doing it on such a
high-profile stage in which millions watched around the world and
21,284 saw first hand in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are compelling reasons for King's typical shenanighans.
</P>
<P>
   Pure and simple, if Lewis had been given a victory that he
deserved because he dominated Holyfield throughout the fight with a
left jab that seldom missed its mark, King would have lost his
eternal hold on the heavyweight title that dates from Muhammad Ali
to Mike Tyson with Larry Holmes and a bunch of faceless
champions---Oliver McCall, Tim Witherspoon, Greg Page, Pinklon
Thomas, etc.---in between.
</P>
<P>
   King holds title options on Holyfield, but none on Lewis, who
would have certainly gone his independent way and avoided King had
he emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   The only other heavyweights King has in his promotional stable
are Henry Akiwande and Johnny Ruiz, neither of whom are destined to
hold a heavyweight title of any legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the two that Evander Holyfield still has in his
possession, the ones belonging to the WBA and IBF, won't be
accepted by anyone who viewed Saturday night's hoax in which Lewis
convinced everyone he was better than Holyfield except for two of
the judges, Jean Williams and Larry O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what strings Don King yanked to once again
tarnish a profession in which he has dredged millions, but I do
know that his newest rumored silent business partner, IBC president
Bob Lee, was responsible for assigning Williams to work this fight.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Williams who gave Holyfield a two point win
(115-113), even though she just might be the only person on the
face of this earth to see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Williams' judging was so inept that she actually had
Holyfield winning the fifth round, which is quite hard to figure
since that happened to be the round in which Lewis pounded
Holyfield with impunity, pinning him on one occasion against the
ropes and unleashing one punch after another against his anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   In my notebook, I scribbled, ``. . .Holyfield seems hurt, being
overwhelmed, big, big round for Lewis. . .''
</P>
<P>
   But not according to Williams, who just might have mistaken
Holyfield for Lewis, or might have fallen asleep, or might have
been transfixed by the countless celebrities in the crowd like
Jerry Seinfeld, Jack Nicholson, Keith Richards, Spike Lee, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I have no logical explanation for Williams' wayward view, but
I'm sure Don King does.
</P>
<P>
   The chap who somehow viewed the proceedings even at 115-115,
England's Larry O'Connell, was assigned by, of all people, Jose
Sulaiman, the WBC president and a long-time King stooge.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that O'Connell today is the most unpopular
figure in England since Charles I, whose head was dislodged by his
disgruntled followers for perceived indiscretions. The Brits are
more humane these days---they don't even let their cops carry side
arms---or Mr. O'Connell would be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   You also can be sure Bob Lee, Jose Sulaiman, Jean Williams and
Larry O'Connell will be on Don King's Christmas gift A list.
</P>
<P>
   And you can wager your favorite 8 by 10 glossy of Don King that
the WBA-assigned arbiter, Stanley Christodolou of South Africa
won't be receiving any holiday goodies from King, not after his
116-113 ruling for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   You must understand that Don King never has had the political
muscle with the WBA that he's had with the WBC, where he has that
touchingly warm friendship with Jose Sulaiman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't the first scandalous decision to pollute
boxing, and you can be sure it won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Don King will see to that.

<P>
   BOSTON _ In the first step of a crackdown on environmental
violations at colleges and universities across New England, federal
officials Monday will file a complaint against the University of
New Hampshire that could result in a fine of up to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which alleges that UNH violated hazardous-waste
management laws, is the first of several planned actions in a
sweeping campaign by the US Environmental Protection Agency to
bring the region's institutions of higher education into compliance
with federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very ambitious and concentrated effort to improve
environmental performances on college campuses throughout New
England,'' said the EPA regional administrator, John DeVillars.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the EPA will mail letters to 258 college presidents
outlining the agency's strategy, which will include training
college officials on how to improve environmental management on
their campuses and conducting inspections this spring at schools
suspected of violations.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are being targeted for the crackdown, according to
DeVillars, because they normally have laboratories, waste-treatment
facilities, and power plants that have the potential to cause
environmental damage if they are not properly managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that some educational institutions don't take
their environmental obligations as seriously as they should,''
DeVillars stated in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   While EPA officials emphasize they are holding universities
accountable for environmental problems just as they would any large
corporation, the agency also says it will help schools comply with
the laws by conducting workshops and providing technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, the EPA will sponsor its first workshop at Harvard
Medical School to address the environmental pressures that colleges
and universities face.
</P>
<P>
   The action against UNH stems from a 1997 inspection of its
Durham campus during which officials found 15 violations of federal
and state hazardous-waste laws at several laboratories and storage
facilities, according to DeVillars. For example, the school is
being cited for pouring mercury down a drain without ensuring the
waste was properly treated, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   A UNH official expressed disappointment that the agency would
file the complaint at a time when the school has improved its
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that although there were some technical compliance
issues back in 1997, our program was fundamentally sound then and
is even better now,'' said Donald Sundberg, UNH vice president for
research and public service.
</P>
<P>
   Sundberg said in a statement that UNH officials plan to work
closely with the EPA to satisfy the agency's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against UNH represents the third EPA inquiry of a
New England college in the past four years. In 1995, Yale
University paid $348,000 in fines and environmental investments in
the community after being cited for mishandling and improperly
labeling hazardous chemicals on its New Haven campus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Boston University was cited for violating regulations
on underground storage tanks and storm water. An investigation was
prompted when a tank near the BU Bridge leaked 1,000 gallons of oil
into the Charles River. The school agreed to pay $753,000 in fines
and in community projects. It was the nation's largest settlement
between an educational institution and the EPA, according to
DeVillars.
</P>
<P>
   BU has since reduced its oil inventory on campus by 40 percent
and its underground tanks by 20 percent, according to Kevin
Carlton, a BU spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   UNH officials have the choice of fighting the complaint through
a hearing process or seeking a settlement with the EPA, like Yale
and BU, according to Ken Moraff, chief of the EPA's regional
enforcement office.
</P>
<P>
   Moraff said additional complaints are expected against New
England colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are often finding is that some schools don't have a
good system in place to manage hazardous waste or systems to manage
underground oil storage,'' he said. ``That can be dangerous if you
don't store it properly, risking explosions or spills.''

MOTOROLA INVESTS IN HOME-NETWORK STUDIES  
 FROM CELEBRITY DOCTOR, MEDICAL ADVICE ONLINE  
 TAKING THE FISH MARKET INTO CYBERSPACE

<P>
   Motorola Corp. plans to announce Monday that it will donate $5
million to create a new research center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Laboratory to explore ``think and
link'' technologies that connect everyday appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, to be named the Motorola Digital DNA
Laboratory, will explore concepts that are still years away from
development into commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   One example, according to Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's
Semiconductor Products division, is a wireless technique known
inside the company as Piano, which can transmit information at
speeds as high as 500 megabits a second over distances of about 10
feet.
</P>
<P>
   There is already a great deal of activity in the computer and
consumer electronics industry on setting standards for connecting
networks of consumer devices. These might include PCs, television
sets, cell phones, personal digital assistants, stereo gear and
various home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz said that it was important to look further into the
future, when such devices might be far smarter, with far more
information and instructions to exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola Digital DNA Laboratory will be housed in 5,000
square feet within a new building that is scheduled for occupancy
in early 2003 and will be connected to the current MIT Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Lab has an annual budget of $30 million. Most of the
financing comes from about 160 corporate sponsors, and the balance
from government agencies and individuals.

   From Celebrity Doctor, Medical Advice Online
</P>
<P>
   Consider it the ultimate play in celebrity marketing. A new Web
site bearing the name of Dr. C. Everett Koop, who as U.S. surgeon
general during the Reagan administration became America's doctor,
is about to join the ranks of Internet initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that drkoop.com, which offers free medical information,
has been up and running for only nine months and last year had
revenues of only $48,000. The association with the outspoken Koop
is what the venture's founders are clearly banking on. The company,
which calls its site ``Your Trusted Health Network,'' will go
public under the Nasdaq symbol KOOP.
</P>
<P>
   Koop founded the company in July 1997 with Don Hackett, a former
executive with Physicians Health Network. The initial investment
was less than $500,000. With its public offering, underwritten by
Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., drkoop.com hopes to raise $50 million, much of
it for an advertising blitz later this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Koop, he will own 11 percent of the public company, and
he has a five-year deal to receive 2 percent of the company's
revenue. And given the country's apparently insatiable appetite for
free medical advice, that could amount to a tidy sum.
</P>
<P>
   So far at least, Koop's site shows every sign of being a
success. In its first month, it had 2 million visits; these days
2.6 million people visit drkoop.com in a typical month and 83,000
of them are registered as regular users.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers free medical information about diseases and
treatments, discussion groups on subjects like allergies, and
online support groups for recovering alcoholics and others. An
insurance section provides policy quotes and information on
flexible spending accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And as one would expect from a former surgeon general, there are
plenty of reminders that smoking can be hazardous to your health.

   Taking the Fish Market Into Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   As a third-generation ``fish guy'' in New York City, Stratis
Morfogen practically grew up at the Fulton Fish Market, watching
men dicker over seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Auctions of hard-to-get delicacies were long a staple of the
wholesale market. So when he heard about the growing popularity of
online auctions, Morfogen, who is now 31, realized that he could
fuse the tension of the professional fish auctions with the fun of
``playing along'' at home for the online audience.
</P>
<P>
   After he first saw the Internet a year ago, Morfogen decided to
build his own site, Fultonstreet.com. His father thought he was
crazy, Morfogen said, until 300 orders started coming in each day,
at an average of $90 apiece. This week, Morfogen, who has signed a
deal to be the ``exclusive online fish store'' for Ubid.com, will
start auctioning Alaskan king crab leg gift packages, four-course
dinners for two, and live Maine lobsters. Starting bid: $7.

INVESTING SUCCESS BREEDS UNLIKELY TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CMGI-WETHERELL) 
(lb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is CMGI an Internet company or a mutual fund?
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the question seems almost absurd. The company owns
roughly a dozen Internet start-ups, which offer specialized
marketing services to companies that want to do business over the
Internet. CMGI had revenues of $90 million in its last fiscal year,
ended July 31, and $76 million in the first six months of the
current year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last
month, CMGI notified investors that because of its highly
successful investments in Lycos, Geocities and other
Internet-related companies, it meets the characteristics of a
mutual fund under the federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which steadfastly states that it does not want to
be a mutual fund, has until October to rectify the situation. If it
succeeds, CMGI's shareholders will be no worse for the experience,
although investors in the companies that CMGI owns could feel a
downdraft from CMGI's selling of those securities. And if CMGI
cannot revamp in time, its shareholders could get hit with huge tax
burdens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal securities laws, any company that owns
investment securities with a value exceeding 40 percent of its
total assets, excluding cash and government securities, is an
``investment company,'' subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, which governs mutual funds, closed-end funds
and other investment pools.
</P>
<P>
   By investing in Internet start-ups through a series of
venture-capital pools, CMGI's investment assets have grown far more
quickly than its underlying direct-marketing business.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of January, CMGI owned $1.6 billion worth of stock in
publicly traded companies. Roughly 60 percent, or $957 million, of
that is in companies where CMGI owns less than 20 percent of the
shares. The remainder is in ``affiliates,'' those companies where
it owns more than 20 percent but less than half of the total
shares.
</P>
<P>
   All told, those investments account for a huge portion of CMGI's
assets. Just how much, the company will not say; it is scheduled to
release those details later this month. But it is likely that it
amounts to more than half of CMGI's total assets. At the end of the
company's first fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 31, noninvestment
assets were worth about $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's board of directors instructed the company's management to
make sure it is not considered a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 31 of this year, when the one-year grace period allowed
under federal securities laws will expire, the company's management
must take one of two actions: First, CMGI could buy the rest of one
of the companies like Lycos, where it already owns a substantial
stake. That would change the status of that holding from an
investment to a continuing business operation.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, CMGI could sell enough of its investments so that
they account for less than 40 percent of assets. But Andrew
Hajducky III, CMGI's chief financial officer, says that is ``a last
resort,'' and will generate big tax liabilities for CMGI, since
most of the investments were made at far lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Selling is not a particularly attractive option. Besides the tax
implications, the company has been banking on those Internet
investments to provide its direct-marketing business with
information about people surfing the Web. By selling some of those
investments, ``anticipated synergies between our core businesses
and disposed assets may never arise,'' the company said in a recent
filing with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most young Internet companies, CMGI does not have losses
on its books to offset the capital gains it is reaping from its
investments. In the six months ended Jan. 31, the company earned
net profits of $52.6 million, or $1.04 a share; the company's gains
on its investments in the period totaled $134 million, or roughly
double its revenues from the marketing businesses it operates.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI could also avoid having to buy or sell more businesses by
reorganizing as an investment company. (Technically, CMGI would be
a closed-end fund rather than a mutual fund, because it has a
limited number of shares that trade on an exchange.) But that, a
highly unlikely move, would create some unpleasant results for
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   As a fund, CMGI would be forced to distribute to shareholders
all of the capital gains it reaps each year as it cashes in some of
its investments. Last year, the company reported $101 million in
such gains, and in the first six months of this fiscal year,
another $95 million. Together, those would have resulted in taxable
capital gains of nearly $4 a share for the company's stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   That tax burden would take a lot of the fun out of investing in
the Internet.

   Dissatisfied with the pace of efforts to prepare the nation for
a germ or chemical weapons attack, President Clinton has decided to
provide an additional $11 million to train firefighters and other
emergency service personnel.

   White House officials said Sunday that Clinton would provide the
money for this fiscal year, which began in October, by transferring
money between accounts in the Department of Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The money will enable officials in 12 cities to begin creating,

DUKE ROLLS OVER TULSA; SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Tulsa's players had talked about a monumental
upset, about how they matched up with the top-seeded Duke Blue
Devils, about how they knew they could play with them.
</P>
<P>
   But 40 minutes and a 41-point loss later, the Golden Hurricane
admitted it was foolish to think this Duke team could be beaten in
the NCAA tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All those boasts did was prompt Duke to eviscerate the East
Regional's ninth-seeded team, 97-56, and advance to the round of 16
and a match with Steve Alford's long-shot Southwest Missouri State
Bears, who defeated higher-seeded Tennessee by 81-51 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though each team earned its trip to the regional semifinals, at
Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., in impressive fashion,
Alford was careful not to let any errant thoughts, no matter how
hopeful, antagonize the Blue Devils (34-1).
</P>
<P>
   His team is made up of real-life Hoosiers, much like himself,
plucked from the high schools of Indiana. The Bears (22-10) are
making their first trip to the NCAA tournament's round of 16, the
Blue Devils their 10th under coach Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players know that they're going to be going against nine
high school all-Americans, and I'll be going against a Hall of Fame
coach,'' Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're outstanding, but we'll show up and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a loose ball in the opening minutes of the game that set
off first Krzyzewski, and then the Blue Devils. Eric Coley of Tulsa
went to the floor and got it. Elton Brand, Shane Battier and the
rest of the Blue Devils did not, and they heard about it from their
coach in the ensuing timeout. Their lackadaisical effort had led to
a 3-point shot by Marcus Hill, six straight points and the Golden
Hurricane's brief flirtation with backing up its boast as it crept
within 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   In a diplomatic interpretation of Duke's animated huddle, guard
Trajan Langdon said, ``We didn't go down on the floor and get it,
and coach challenged us to get physical.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, how they responded. The Blue Devils scored the next 26
points in a seven-minute span that showcased the variety of ways
they can take a team apart.
</P>
<P>
   Battier, a 6-foot-8-inch defensive stopper, tipped in one basket
and then made two 3-pointers from the top of the key. Brand bulled
his way inside of 6-8 Michael Ruffin and 6-10 Brandon Kurtz _ the
brawny tandem that was supposed to shut down the inside _ for three
more scores and two trips to the free-throw line. Chris Carrawell,
William Avery and Langdon turned pressure defense into
scalpel-precise fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carrawell who offered a warning for Southwest Missouri
State, or any mouthy, optimistic opponent in a future round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at us before the game and say they can play with
us,'' Carrawell said of Tulsa's boasts. ``But it's another thing
when you step on the court with us and you look up at the
scoreboard and say, `Dang, we're already down 30 points.' It's
funny how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Hurricane (23-10) never recovered from its
seven-minute hammering. By the end of the first half it was down by
30 points. Tulsa shot 33.9 percent, gave up 40 Blue Devil points in
the paint and, as guard Tony Heard breathlessly lamented afterward,
``They just kept coming at us with players off the bench _ good
players.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, six Blue Devils reached double figures. The team shot 55
percent from the 3-point arc and was led by 19 points from Avery,
17 from Brand and 12 from Langdon, who was playing in his first
tournament game since he sprained the fifth metatarsal in his left
foot last week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not depth or balance or athleticism or skill that
Tulsa coach Bill Self wanted to talk about after declaring the Blue
Devils unbeatable. ``The best thing about them is their mind-set.
They have the killer instinct. It appears to me that they're on a
mission that they want to make history. They're almost not human.''
</P>
<P>
   No.12-seeded Southwest Missouri State upset No.4-seeded
Tennessee by doing what its coach did best during his all-America
and national championship career at Indiana: taking care of the
ball and filling the basket with deadly accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears shot 51.9 percent in a display that was so
otherworldly that the 6-11 center Danny Moore twice popped behind
the 3-point line and drained shots. ``I've been shooting out close
to that line before, but today I was feeling it and decided to step
back,'' said Moore, one of four Indiana natives in the starting
lineup. He finished with 25 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The more athletic Volunteers (21-9) could not rattle Southwest
Missouri State's backcourt of William Fontleroy and Kevin Ault, and
the Bears stretched a 10-point halftime lead to as many as 32 early
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Fontleroy handed out four assists and Ault five to go with 14
points. The two players helped the Bears turn the ball over only
six times in the game, once in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears earned their celebration at the final buzzer, but they
were aware of what awaited them this week in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In the loose, joking manner that he wore all weekend, Alford
offered one strategy to slow the Blue Devils' tournament run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get some friends in New Jersey to put up some road signs
that detour Duke before the game,'' he said. ``That way we can
start the game five-on-zero and get a head start. We'll need it,
the way they're putting away people so quickly.'' &QL;

CANADA PROCEEDS WITH LAW TO PROTECT MAGAZINE INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KALYANI VITTALA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Canadian House of Commons is expected to pass
legislation on Monday that would protect its magazine industry from
American competition, a move that could lead Washington to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is also subject to approval by the Canadian
Senate before it goes into effect, would essentially make it
illegal for advertisers to buy space in ``split run'' magazines,
which are Canadian versions of publications like Sports Illustrated
or People. Officials on each side of the border are tyring to
negotiate a compromise that would satisfy Canada's desire to
protect its cultural industries without violating the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal become law, American officials have threatened
to retaliate by imposing tariffs on goods including steel, lumber,
plastics, pharmaceuticals, textiles and clothing. Canadian
supporters of the legislation have accused the United States of
bullying tactics and vowed to hold firm.
</P>
<P>
   But after meeting Friday with senior Canadian officials, the
deputy United States trade representative, Richard Fisher,
announced no immediate action would be taken if the bill was passed
in the House of Commons. Fisher said he was confident that suitable
amendments would be made to the bill before it was passed by the
Canadian Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Canadian officials are conceding little at this point
except the willingness to discuss the issue further. ``It's very
easy to talk about retaliation and threats of war,'' Sergio Marchi,
Canada's Trade Minister, said Friday in Ottawa. ``It takes more
courage to refrain from going down that slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier law, which prohibited split runs through a
complicated set of taxes, was struck down as an unfair trading
practice by the World Trade Organization in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's magazine industry is modest at best, since 80 percent
of the publications found on newsstands here are American. But it
does provide an outlet for Canadian viewpoints. The rationale
behind the new legislation is that split run magazines are produced
almost entirely in the United States with minimal Canadian content.
This puts them in a position to undercut advertising rates and
siphon off significant portions of this country's $600 million
(Canadian) industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Maclean's magazine lost only 10 percent of its ad
revenue it would just cease to be,'' said Francois de Gaspe
Beaubien, a spokesman for the Canadian Magazine Publishers
Association, referring to Canada's leading news magazine which has
a weekly circulation of about 500,000. ``That would be one more
Canadian voice that has been silenced.''  &QL;

   BOSTON _ The pundits said they should not have even been invited
to the Tournament after closing the season with a sub-.500
conference record and five losses in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Even their coach was ``surprised'' his team was given a chance
at a second life that comes with an NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   With two upsets in the East Regional, the Purdue Boilermakers
made sure they took advantage of the second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Miami became the second victim Sunday, as Purdue had a 15-0 run
to end the first half and held off several mini-charges from the
No. 2-seeded Hurricanes on the way to a 73-63 win at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers, who are one of three No. 10 seeds still alive
in the Tournament, will take on Temple, a 64-54 winner over
Cincinnati, in the regional semifinal March 19 at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   If a week ago you had told the Boilermakers' Brian Cardinal that
he would be going to the Sweet 16, he would have been
flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd want to know where I was sitting in the stands, because I
didn't think we could get there (to play),'' he said. ``I knew all
year that we had a good team, it was just a matter of us playing
well and playing together, and getting things worked out where we
were a ballclub on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems were, Purdue (21-12) seems to have worked
them out. Coach Gene Keady said it took an ``attitude adjustment''
for his players to come together.
</P>
<P>
   They did not look that well adjusted against Texas in the first
round, but a win is a win. Two days later, they looked fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers' offense flowed smoothly, making assists on 18
of its 22 field goals as the team hit 58 percent of its shots (22
of 38).
</P>
<P>
   But it was Purdue's defense that was the difference, holding
Miami to its third-lowest scoring output of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami made just 32.9 percent from the floor (25 of 76), going a
porous 1-for-14 from behind the 3-point line. Senior center Mario
Bland was the lone Hurricane to hit from long range.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hurricanes' first-round win over Lafayette, guard Johnny
Hemsley scored 31 points and was 9-of-12 from 3-point range as
Miami tied a season high with 10 treys. Hemsley managed just 13
points and was 0-2 on treys Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' poor shooting skewed the final statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Miami took 76 shots to Purdue's 38, grabbed 27 offensive
rebounds to the Boilermakers' three (45-29 overall) and forced 20
turnovers while committing 18.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive rebounding number was inflated by the high number
of missed shots, but unfortunately for the Hurricanes, the extra
boards just afforded them more opportunities to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Purdue, because they
had something to do with how we played, but when you miss 17
point-blank layups, you have to take some of the blame yourself,''
said Miami coach Leonard Hamilton, whose team finished with a 23-7
mark, setting a school record for wins.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those misses came during the drought to end the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   After Miami had trailed by seven points in the early going, Tim
James scored inside to tie the score at 17 with 7:23 to play before
halftime. The Hurricanes did not score again until after the break,
going nine consecutive trips without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Purdue got points from four players, including two
3-pointers from Cardinal, who led the team with 20 points. The last
trey for Cardinal, who went 4-for-5 on 3-pointers, was a 24-footer
just before the halftime buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   After halftime, Miami made several attempts to get back into the
game, its best coming midway through the second period when the
Hurricanes cut the lead to 43-38.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal again stepped to the forefront, draining a 3-pointer
from the top of the key and finishing off a fast break started by
Tony Mayfield's steal with a layup to start a 13-2 run to put the
game away.

RANGERS WIN 3-2 OVER ISLANDERS IN OVERTIME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Adam Graves was dragging after 64 minutes of
up-and-down hockey when the puck found his stick. Desperate, like
his Rangers, he fired a long shot from just inside the Islanders'
blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' shot, hard and accurate, deflected off the arm of
Islanders goalie Tommy Salo and entered the corner of the net to
give the Rangers a dramatic 3-2 victory with 55 seconds remaining
in overtime before a sold-out crowd today at Nassau Coliseum. The
victory improved the Rangers' record to 4-0 against the Islanders
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck had eyes, so to speak,'' said Graves, who has 33
goals, three of which have been overtime winners.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' goal prompted a celebration behind the Islanders' net,
the kind usually reserved for big playoff victories. This isn't the
post-season, of course, but for the Rangers these last 15
regular-season games will determine whether they will get the
chance to cheer anything in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playoff hockey; you can't afford to lose one,'' said
Graves, who is expected to sign a multiyear contract extension with
the Rangers this week. ``Each game is a huge one because of the
position we put ourselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   Salo, who made 18 saves, said of Graves' shot, ``It hit my
shoulder and went right through before I got my arm up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved within 2 points of the Boston Bruins for the
eighth and final playoff berth in the East. Now in 10th place, the
Rangers also trail the Florida Panthers by 1 point in the
three-team scramble for the final spot. The Bruins and the Panthers
have each played one game fewer than the Rangers, who are host to
the Washington Capitals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was huge for us,'' said Rangers goalie Dan Cloutier,
who made 31 saves. ``This was crucial when you're fighting for a
playoff spot. Every shift of every game is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But for much of the game, the Rangers played down to the level
of the Islanders, who are the second-worst team in the National
Hockey League. The Rangers were outplayed badly in the second and
third periods, surrendering a two-goal lead in the process. During
a 20-minute-10-second stretch bridging the second and third
periods, the Rangers failed to register a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we were the better team today,'' said Trevor
Linden, the Islanders' captain. ``But the bottom line is we lost.
We've had a couple of overtime losses the last 10 days. You've got
to come away with a point.''
</P>
<P>
   After goals by Manny Malhotra and Kevin Stevens, the Islanders
stormed back on goals by Mariusz Czerkawski, late in the second
period, and Zigmund Palffy, who tied the score at 2-2 at 5:19 of
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra scored on the power play 3:37 into the game to put the
Rangers ahead by 1-0. Malhotra, an 18-year-old rookie, who has seen
his ice time increase significantly since the injury to Wayne
Gretzky, buried a rebound of Ulf Samuelsson's shot from the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had many scoring opportunities in the opening
period, but could not finish them off. Joe Sacco was stopped twice
from point-blank range, and Palffy came so close, his arms went up
in celebration. But the Islanders did manage to kill off a
five-on-three advantage for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens scored the Rangers' second goal at 2:49 of the second
period, stretching his team's lead to 2-0. Like Malhotra, Stevens
tapped a rebound past Salo. Again, the Islanders' goalie was down
and out of position after stopping the Rangers' first shot.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski cut the Rangers' lead to 2-1 late in the second
period. He fired the puck over Cloutier's glove at 14:39 for his
14th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy scored the tying goal at 5:19 of the third period. He
fired a turnaround shot from the slot between Cloutier's pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that couldn't find a way to win a game last
year,'' Islanders Coach Bill Stewart said of the Rangers. ``But
this year they are finding a way.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Rich Pilon, the rugged Islanders defenseman, left the game
during the second period with back spasms. He is probable for
Monday's game at Buffalo. Pilon appeared in his 500th career game,
all with the Islanders.

YANKS' KNOBLAUCH FINDS HIS NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Chuck Knoblauch's locker in the clubhouse is a
few feet from that of Derek Jeter, and the banter between the New
York Yankee infielders is as steady as the trains running to and
from Grand Central Terminal. Jeter likes to adjust his
pronunciation of Knoblauch's name _ ``Knob-a-lockah,'' Jeter will
say _ and they play catch together before each workout, their
friendship growing.
</P>
<P>
   It is far different from last spring, when Knoblauch first
joined the Yankees. He is approachable and friendly, but during the
1998 season he knew few of his teammates. Knoblauch often sat in
front of his locker, his seat turned inward, and ate his specially
prepared meals with few words for others. He was like the new kid
in school, sitting in the corner of the room, quiet and intent on
his work.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is over this initial discomfort, which he believes
contributed to some of his struggles last season. ``It was almost
like going through my rookie year again,'' he said. ``But I'm glad
I went through it _ it's all a learning experience, and like with
everything, you've got to take the good with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, 30, did many things well in 1998: As the leadoff
hitter, he was terrific at working the ball-strike count, fouling
off pitches and wearing down opposing starters; he averaged 4.09
pitches a plate appearance, fourth in the American League. With his
pesky approach, Knoblauch gave teammates opportunities to see what
the opposing pitcher was throwing well or poorly the first time
through the order. ``He really set the tone,'' Yankees pitcher
David Cone said. ``He probably didn't receive as much credit for
this as he should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch scored 117 runs, drove in 64 runs, and played
excellent defense in the final two months of the regular season. He
did not commit an error after Aug. 29, and only three in the second
half of the season, his range improving markedly.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the bench coach Don Zimmer acknowledged, Knoblauch was
not the same player who haunted the Yankees in the past. From 1994
to 1997 for the Minnesota Twins, Knoblauch batted .319; last year,
he hit .265, his average sliding under .250 in one stretch.
Knoblauch had a great spring last year, slashing line drives to the
opposite field, reaching base time after time. After the All-Star
Game break, however, Knoblauch fell into the habit of lifting fly
balls, rather than hitting ground balls and liners.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had been an intimidating base runner for the Twins,
taking a huge lead, daring the pitcher to pick him off, and there
was the inherent threat of a stolen base once he reached first. He
seemed unusually passive on the bases last year, some on the team
convinced he had temporarily lost his fearlessness and was worried
about making mistakes. Knoblauch attempted to steal 43 times _ down
from 72 attempts the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in game two of the American League Championship Series,
Knoblauch stood and argued a call as the ball rolled behind him and
a Cleveland runner circled the bases with the tie-breaking run.
Afterward, Knoblauch was not fully aware of the reaction to his
blunder. But when he saw the replays later that night _ ``about
five times,'' he says now, chuckling _ he realized how bad the play
looked, and acknowledged the mistake the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself, Cone said, was not as important as the
aftermath. ``He was a stand-up guy,'' Cone said. ``He stood up and
apologized, and that was extremely important. That next day, to me,
was when he turned the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   As Knoblauch recalled the play Sunday, Knoblauch compared
himself to a boxer stunned with a jab in the first round: The
circumstances forced him to concentrate the rest of the postseason.
He batted .286 in the final four games of the ALCS, and then .375
in the World Series against San Diego, his three-run home run in
Game 1 proving pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Before manager Joe Torre left the team last week after learning
he had prostate cancer, he talked about how much more relaxed
Knoblauch was, how he had grown more comfortable with his
surroundings. On Sunday, Knoblauch played a joke on reliever Mike
Stanton. Everybody laughed, and Knoblauch stood in the middle of
the visitors' clubhouse here, doubled over, no longer the new kid
in school.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte, the left-handed pitcher who strained his elbow
last week, will play catch Monday, the first time he will test the
joint since he injured it ... Yankees officials are extremely
pleased with Hideki Irabu's effort to lose weight in the last two
weeks _ he has dropped 11 pounds, and he managed to keep up with
Roger Clemens in Saturday's workout ... Paul O'Neill continues to
feel poorly from the flu that is making its way through the ranks
of Yankees; Chili Davis and others have also picked up the bug ...
Bernie Williams, out of action in recent days because of a strained
muscle, is expected to return to the lineup this week.

TEMPLE AND PURDUE SURGE TO UPSETS AND THE ROUND OF 16
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Duke's waltz through college basketball's big dance
seemingly became easier Sunday when Miami and Cincinnati, seeded
second and third, respectively, in the East Regional, were
eliminated at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-seeded Purdue scored the final 15 points of the first half
to build a commanding lead over Miami and coasted to a 73-63 upset.
Miami, one of the powers of the Big East Conference, never led and
only briefly challenged Purdue's double-digit lead in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue will meet sixth-seeded Temple in the regional semifinals
on Friday night at East Rutherford, N.J. Temple defeated
Cincinnati, 64-54.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Miami won the first NCAA tournament game in its
history with a 21-point victory over Lafayette. Sunday, Miami's
play was listless and careless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one of those off nights at a time when the other team
was having a good night,'' Miami Coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``It
wasn't very good timing on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's weekend sweep was somewhat stunning since the
Boilermakers had lost five of their last six Big Ten games heading
into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't even think we belonged in this
tournament,'' said Purdue forward Brian Cardinal, who had 20 points
and 6 rebounds. ``It's kind of fun to shock people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal acknowledged that a trip to the Round of 16 was even
beyond his expectations. Asked what he would have said a week ago
if someone had told him he was going to the regional semifinals,
Cardinal said, ``I'd have wanted to know where I was sitting in the
stands because that's the only way I would have thought I'd be
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim James, Miami's star forward, led his team with 19 points,
but James, who missed 14 of 21 shots, appeared hampered by the back
stiffness that nearly kept him out of Friday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say Tim's injury was a factor,'' Hamilton
said. ``But anyone who has seen him play in the past would have
noticed that his quickness and agility was not the same as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But James was just one of several Miami players struggling in
the first half, when Miami made just 18.2 percent of its shots from
the floor, including 0 for 7 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game, Cincinnati became the only team in the
history of the NCAA tournament to be seeded second or third in
three consecutive years and not advance to at least the regional
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, the only team to defeat top-ranked Duke this season,
has fashioned a national reputation for athleticism, aggressiveness
and a snarling, dependable defense, but the Bearcats played timidly
Sunday. Temple's matchup zone defense dominated the game, forcing
Cincinnati into 16 turnovers and 34.7 percent field-goal shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a showing for one of the glamour programs in the
nation, a program that won 27 games this season and has not won
fewer than 26 games in the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Temple has a rich basketball history, and though the Owls
had twice lost to Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament in the 1990s,
they were not intimidated Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't afraid of them; they were afraid of us,'' Temple
guard Rasheed Brokenborough said. ``You could see in the first
three minutes of the game, they were worried and confused by our
zone. They were trying to use their athleticism and they didn't use
their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple took a 6-0 lead, and when Cincinnati made up that
deficit, Temple then outscored Cincinnati, 23-5. Cincinnati went 8
minutes 31 seconds without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't attack,'' Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins said.
``We kind of stood around on the perimeter and missed a lot of
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said he was not concerned his team would be considered
underachievers, despite the three successive NCAA losses in either
the first or second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read the papers or listen to talk shows and those are
the only people who would say something like that,'' Huggins said.
``I don't worry about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For Temple, the key substitution was guard Quincy Wadley, who
had played sparingly in recent weeks because of a broken finger on
his nonshooting hand. He came off the bench to score 14 points,
hitting four 3-point shots.

CLEAVES ROUSES MICHIGAN STATE IN TIME TO ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When it came time for Mateen Cleaves to wake up, and
wake his team up, he did so in the nick of time. For much of
Sunday's second-round game in the Midwest Regional, Cleaves, the
all-America guard for top-seeded Michigan State, played in
desultory fashion against ninth-seeded Mississippi. Cleaves had
been racking up nearly as many turnovers as points at the Bradley
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi led by 3 at the half, and Cleaves had 8 points and 5
turnovers. And with less than five minutes to play, Cleaves, a
6-foot-2-inch junior who is built as solid as a beer keg, was
embarrassed when the player he was guarding, 5-5 Jason Harrison,
drilled a 3-point shot at the shot-clock buzzer to break a tie.
</P>
<P>
   That shot apparently shook Cleaves from his slumber, and he went
on to propel Michigan State to a 74-66 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He came down and hit a 3-pointer in the face of Harrison to tie
the game. He then drove and scored against Harrison on the next
possession, hit Antonio Smith with a scoring pass under the basket,
then scored again on a steal and fullcourt layup. After that, he
rebounded a Mississippi miss and dished to Morris Peterson for
another score. Suddenly, the game had turned irrevocably around.
Michigan State led by 67-59 after an 11-0 run with just over a
minute to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that's my role,'' Cleaves said. ``The guys know
that down the stretch I can hit some big shots. We call that money
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves finished with a team-high 18 points, seven assists and
had just one turnover in the second half. Jason Smith and Marcus
Hicks, who formed a formidable front line for Ole Miss, scored 18
and 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the half, we knew we could match their talent,'' said
Antonio Smith, the Michigan State forward. ``We just had to match
their intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans now go to St. Louis where they meet Oklahoma, 85-72
upset winners Sunday over North Carolina-Charlotte, on Friday in
the Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, for Michigan State, could not have been any more
satisfying than it was for the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the Sweet 16!'' shouted Oklahoma Coach Kelvin
Sampson. ``I think there's some irony in that statement. We just
play basketball. We run our stuff. We're not going to wow you. I'm
tired of saying our players don't get their due. But the Sweet 16
gives us our credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, presumably the last at-large team chosen in the
64-team tournament and seeded 13th, led NC-Charlotte, the
fifth-seeded team, throughout the game, and by 15 points at the
half. The 49ers cut their deficit to 7 points on a 3-point shot by
Kedric Smith with just over four minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Just under a minute later, Oklahoma's Eric Martin, who scored 18
points, committed his fifth and final foul.
</P>
<P>
   The NC-Charlotte rooters, dressed in the blue and white school
colors, were shouting and shaking their pompoms. But Eduardo
Najera, as he had all day, replied immediately. He got fouled on a
drive and sank both free throws to make it 72-63.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the bench I was a nervous wreck; I could hardly watch the
game,'' Martin said. ``We had a lead, but with the 3-point shot in
today's game, it's so easy to come back.'' But the Sooners didn't,
and NC-Charlotte was unable to get any closer than it had after
Smith's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's coach and players had expressed huge disappointment
that they were given such little recognition in the seeding after
their 20-10 regular season. But they came into this game on a high
note after having upset fourth-seeded Arizona, 61-60, in the first
round on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After Oklahoma had built a 21-6 lead with 13 minutes left in the
first half, it seemed that neither the Sooners nor NC-Charlotte had
the time or the inclination to score a field goal, until Martin
sank a three-pointer for the Sooners with 6:55 remaining. Oklahoma
had also developed its lead without any points from its leading
scorer, Najera, the 6-8 native of Chihuahua, Mexico. Najera had
disappointed his father, Servando, a former Mexican League
infielder, when he grew too tall to play third base, but he has
obviously done his family proud as a basketball player. Even when
not scoring, one hardly notices, since Najera is so helpful in
every other area of the game, from passing to rebounding to
skidding nose-first across the court for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   Najera finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds, high for his
team in both departments. The sophomore Sooners guard Alex
Spaulding also gave a lift at critical points, hitting a big
3-pointer, 7 of 12 free throws _ all in the second half _ and
scoring 12 points and compiling 8 assists. Galen Young, the swift,
strong forward for N.C.-Charlotte. led his team with 23 points, 13
rebounds and six assists. Kelvin Price, normally the starting
center for Charlotte, was suffering from the flu and played just 23
minutes and scored five points.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sampson's fifth season as the coach at Oklahoma. He has
taken his team to the tournament in each of them _ but it was not
until this year that he had finally won a game in it.
</P>
<P>
   He's got five days now to figure out how to beat Coach Tom Izzo
and his favored Michigan State.

METS' WILSON DOESN'T WANT TO START SEASON IN THE MINORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ On his final day with the Mets before the
regular season starts, Tom Seaver was asked Sunday which young
pitchers had impressed him most in his nearly two weeks around the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen, Paul Wilson, Grant Roberts and Octavio
Dotel, replied Seaver, who is scheduled to leave for his Napa
Valley, Calif., home on Monday. ``They've all got good, live
arms,'' said Seaver, who served as a roving instructor here and who
will broadcast Mets games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Arms that should not be rushed, however, the Hall of Famer
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are still seeking to improve their starting pitching
via a trade. But there is also the chance that they could give up
on Hideo Nomo or Masato Yoshii before the season starts, which
would open a spot.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo has struggled with his control for nearly two years. Yoshii
was hit hard in his first two appearances of the spring before
throwing four scoreless innings against the Florida Marlins in
Viera, Fla., in a split-squad game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners have expressed interest in one of the two
Japanese pitchers, a baseball executive said Sunday. That might
provide an opening for Wilson, who has not allowed an earned run in
nine innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But not if Seaver is allowed anything to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happened,'' Seaver said, envisioning a scenario where
Wilson would begin the season with the Mets, ``that's when I would
raise my hand and say, `No! No!' I think that would be a mistake.
He needs innings pitched. Both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver was also referring to Isringhausen. But there is almost
no chance that the 26-year-old Isringhausen _ who missed all of
last year because of elbow surgery _ will begin the season with the
Mets. He has allowed two earned runs in four innings while striking
out seven this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been a bit more of a question mark since training
camp began. On Saturday in the Dominican Republic, however, after
Wilson had tossed four scoreless innings, Mets manager Bobby
Valentine was asked if Wilson's chances of making the team had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Valentine said. ``He's doing a very good
job to get back here, but I haven't seen anything change. I believe
he is going to be a major league pitcher for a long time. But he
needs to put Class AAA behind him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver agrees. Wilson, however, does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that mean?'' Wilson, the first overall pick of the 1994
draft, said Sunday. ``I put Class AAA behind me three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Wilson underwent labrum surgery on his right
shoulder in November 1996. Since then the right-hander, who turns
26 two weeks from Sunday, has pitched just 822/3 innings, including
382/3 innings last year at the Triple A level.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, Wilson said he knew that the Mets had six
pitchers with six guaranteed contracts (and none of them him) vying
for their starting staff, and that he was resigned to beginning the
season at Triple A Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe all along I never wanted to believe it,'' Wilson,
who came to camp bigger and stronger than ever, said Sunday. ``That
it still wasn't the end of the story. It was just a way to put it
out of my head while we're preparing for the season. But I'm
frustrated with the system. And I think I have a right to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilson has said previously that he would take a
demotion, if and when it came, in stride, he cannot help being
impatient and feeling he belongs with the major league club now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was on a different team, would I be making the team?''
Wilson asked. ``It just comes down not to fighting for a job, but
to there not being jobs available.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the caution that his manager, General Manager Steve
Phillips and Seaver want? ``I'm tired of being cautious,'' Wilson
said. ``I just want to be a part of it so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are likely to make their first cuts of the spring on
Monday. Wilson will most likely be spared, but probably only until
a later date.
</P>
<P>
   And if that time comes this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll gripe and moan for about a day,'' Wilson said. ``And then
I'll go down there and do my job.''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE COURT AND DISABLED STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Iowa)   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 15:
</P>
<P>
   In an important recent decision, the Supreme Court interpreted
federal law to require public schools to pay for special care for
students with disabilities as long as the services can be provided
by someone other than a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of a bright quadriplegic boy in Iowa
who was dependent on a ventilator and could not attend school
without a trained aide to monitor his needs. The 7-to-2 decision
was based on the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which
guarantees a ``free appropriate public education'' to students with
disabilities, and requires districts to furnish special education
and ``related services.''
</P>
<P>
   From a legal and humane standpoint, it is the right outcome.
Children should not be isolated or their education limited because
of a disability. But the decision also raises serious concerns. As
a practical matter, the expansive ruling will impose new financial
burdens on local school districts already struggling with the
mounting costs of special-education mandates _ exacerbating a
longstanding problem Congress needs to address, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Educating disabled youngsters is a national obligation. The
expense should be borne by the nation as a whole, not imposed
haphazardly on states or financially strapped districts that happen
to serve a large number of disabled students.

MOYA'S NEW CROWN IS KNOCKED ASKEW BY PHILIPPOUSSIS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ It seemed like only yesterday that Carlos
Moya, the newest No. 1 in men's tennis, was brandishing a champagne
bottle in one hand and a crystal trophy in the other as he jumped
in a Jacuzzi to celebrate his installation as ``king of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, after dutifully picking up his racquet for his first
official assignment as the top-ranked player, Moya had his new
crown rudely knocked askew by Mark Philippoussis of Australia in
the final of the Newsweek Champions Cup. Moya, who is guaranteed a
two-week reign at the top, and Philippoussis, who will move to a
career-high 11th, dueled in the searing desert sun for nearly three
hours before Philippoussis won, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have played the best match that I ever played
against him, but I still didn't beat him,'' said Moya, whose 0-3
record against Philippoussis includes a contentious semifinal loss
at the 1998 United States Open. ``I'm very confident, and maybe I
think now that I can beat anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Moya, who picked up his first Grand Slam title
at last year's French Open, became the first Spanish man to earn
the top ranking by prevailing over Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil in
their semifinal on Saturday. Dealing with the heavy artillery of
the unseeded Philippoussis was too taxing, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be No. 1 and then win the title on top of that, it would
have been the perfect beginning,'' said Moya, who was seeded fourth
here. ``But today he's better than me, so that's it. He has a great
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Living up to his reputation as a purveyor of ballistic serves,
Philippoussis had three aces in the final game of the match. His
impudent parting shot at Moya was a 129-mile-an-hour ace, his 23rd
of the confrontation. The 22-year-old Philippoussis, who was a
distant runner-up to his countryman Patrick Rafter last year in the
United States Open final, described himself as a slow bloomer after
earning his seventh career title and his first in one of the ATP
Tour's showcase events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big kid, a slow maturer,'' he said. ``I just had a lot
of other things on my mind. I love having fun.'' Philippoussis was
pondering premature retirement last spring until, coaxed to test
his serve-and-volley prowess at Wimbledon by his fellow Australians
John Newcombe and Pat Cash, he reached the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Now coached by Gavin Hopper, a fitness fanatic, and Cash, the
1987 Wimbledon champion, Philippoussis has declared himself mature
enough to take on, outwork and possibly even outlast the likes of
Moya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard the last few months, concentrating on
the court, just been fighting and enjoying the challenge, I'd have
to say,'' said Philippoussis, whose 14-2 start this season is the
best of his career. ``I think what's improved for me is just my
self-belief. In the past I would have broken down if it went to
five, sort of not gave it to him, but just mentally lost it in the
fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Moya, already annoyed with himself for missing a
break point opportunity that would have put him ahead by 5-3 in the
third set, who felt his resolve cave in after Philippoussis broke
him in the third game of the fifth set. A weary, frazzled and
unconvincing passing shot that buried itself in the net allowed
Philippoussis a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he broke me at the beginning of the fifth set, I was
fighting like crazy, running to get to every ball,'' Moya said.
``And then stupid things, he broke me, and it makes me feel like
I'm there for nothing.'' Moya lost his serve again to trail by 5-2
when he barreled an easy forehand out of bounds at break point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was a little bit tired, maybe mentally,'' Moya said.
He admitted that he had expended ample mental energy last week when
he discovered that he was in the hunt for Pete Sampras' No. 1 spot,
despite a horrible beginning to the season that included a
first-round loss at the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   When this event began, Moya was part of a four-man posse that
included his fellow Spaniard Alex Corretja, the Australian Open
champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Rafter, a two-time United States
Open champion. Once Sampras, who was eight weeks short of tying
Ivan Lendl's record 270 weeks at the top, took an opening-round
tumble against Felix Mantilla, all four of them had a chance of
toppling him.
</P>
<P>
   Moya now faces a similar scenario at the Lipton Championships,
which begin Thursday at Key Biscayne, Fla. Sampras, Corretja,
Kafelnikov and Rafter will have an opportunity to make Moya's reign
a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being top 10 means you have to win every match,'' Moya said.
``Now I have to win even more matches than before.'' &QL;

PAC-10 WAS EARLY CASUALTY OF MARCH MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Air! Give Pacific-10 commish Tom Hansen some air!
</P>
<P>
   Four teams, five games, and they're ... gone! The last time the
league didn't place a team in the Sweet 16 (1987), Walt Hazzard was
coaching UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected it, but perhaps we should have. After a
sparkling four-year tournament run that included two national
titles and 11 Sweet 16 appearances, the Pac-10 was due for some
early exits.
</P>
<P>
   If you're searching for an explanation, a trend, a theory _
don't. There isn't one. That's the beauty of March Madness, where
the only constant is chaos. Here's a quick look at the Pac-10
collapses:
</P>
<P>
   _Despite the discrepancy in seed, No.2 Stanford's loss to
Gonzaga was a mild upset at best. Stanford was injury-riddled and
exhausted; Gonzaga was skilled, experienced and beautifully
coached.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs beat Washington and lost close games at Kansas,
Purdue, Detroit and Texas Christian. They were playing a few hours
from home, in Seattle, and their seed (10) wasn't commensurate with
their credentials.
</P>
<P>
   _Washington's loss to Miami-Ohio was easy to predict. The
Huskies played poorly in the stretch, losing twice in Los Angeles,
and never seemed comfortable away from Edmundson Pavilion. They had
no chance against Wally Szczerbiak. Give up 43 points to one
player, and you deserve to lose.
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona's exit is not as easily explained, except the Wildcats
hadn't had a first-round loss in four years, so Lute Olson was due.
They also faced one of the nation's most underachieving teams,
Oklahoma, whose seed masked its talent.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a battle of the present and future Arizona
coaches. Wildcats athletic director Jim Livengood hired Kelvin
Sampson at Washington State and could do it again in Tucson when
Olson retires. If Sampson does replace Olson, the league's coaches
will rejoice. Arizona could do a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   _For the third time in four years, UCLA drew a first-round foe
that loved to play slow _ first Princeton, then Miami, then
Detroit. Perhaps the selection committee is sending the Bruins a
message: Learn to play a complete game, or depart early. If not for
the UCLA women's team, which beat Wisconsin-Green Bay on Saturday,
it might have been the worst sporting week in school history.
</P>
<P>
   First weekend fodder: Sweet 16 seeds, by region: East _ 1, 6,
10, 12; Midwest _ 1, 3, 10, 13; West _ 1, 5, 6, 10; South _ 1, 2,
3, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Florida guard Eddie Shannon has a prosthetic eye, but he saw the
floor well enough to compile seven assists and five steals in the
second-round victory over Weber State. Shannon was an easy pick for
U.S. Basketball Writers' Most Courageous Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   Word is Gonzaga coach Dan Monson considers Washington State a
dead-end position; he won't replace departed coach Kevin Eastman.
Smart move. Monson has most of his best players back next year and
should be in line for a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for former Arizona State interim coach Don Newman to get
the Wazu gig. He was an assistant there under Kelvin Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Kentucky-Kansas was the best game so far, but
Kentucky-Duke in the Final Four will be the game of the tournament.

   BOSTON _ It took less than 20 seconds for the player to get
slammed to the floor from a collision away from the ball. To no
one's surprise, he was a Temple Owl.
</P>
<P>
   But to nearly everyone's surprise, the final thud heard at the
FleetCenter came at the expense of the Cincinnati Bearcats, who had
the door to the Sweet 16 slammed in their faces _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, which scored the first six points and went on a 15-2 run
shortly thereafter to take control, never trailed in walking past
third-seeded Cincinnati 64-54 Sunday in an East Regional game.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (23-10) will face Purdue in a regional semifinal March 19
at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati and Kentucky are the only schools that have been
seeded in the top three of the Tournament in each of the past three
years. But the Wildcats, who moved into the Sweet 16 with a victory
against Kansas on Sunday, have advanced to two consecutive
championship games, while the Bearcats have now lost three
consecutive second-round contests.
</P>
<P>
   Temple has been to 10 consecutive NCAA tournaments, but this is
the first time the Owls have advanced past the second round in six
seasons. The meeting was the third between the teams in the last
five tournaments, with Cincinnati prevailing in the first two (1995
and '96).
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent from the start that Temple, a No. 6 seed, was
not bothered by its Tournament record vs. the Bearcats or its
underdog status.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls employed coach John Chaney's famed matchup zone to
perfection, forcing Cincinnati to play from the outside in, but the
outside shots weren't falling and the Bearcats never came up with
another plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach always told us that your will is stronger than your
skill, and they tried to beat us athletically,'' Temple guard
Rasheed Brokenborough said. ``They didn't try to use their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the first play they were going to have problems
with our zone. They were really hesitant out there, and they really
weren't attacking the zone like you're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats elected to fire away from behind the 3-point arc,
taking almost half their shots in the first period from long range
and hitting just 2-of-9. For the game, Cincinnati was 6-for-22.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have anybody that when you leave him open outside he
can make the shot,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said. ``If we
don't make shots, we have a tough time beating people.''
</P>
<P>
   With the missed shots (Cincinnati went 17-of-49 for 34.7 percent
from the field), the Bearcats rarely got their press set up and
ended the game with just one point coming via a fast break. The
Bearcats' bench also was soundly whipped, getting outscored 20-1.
Cincinnati's reserves average 23.9 points a game, 32 percent of the
team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats also pointed to their rebounding as a problem in
the loss. Though Temple grabbed only one more rebound and was
outrebounded by three on the offensive end, the battle on the
boards appeared to be one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats managed to pull within seven points with less than
50 seconds remaining in the game, but they did not have any
timeouts left and the Owls made enough free throws in the final
minute to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Barnes led Temple with 15 points and point guard Pepe
Sanchez matched Quincy Wadley with 14.
</P>
<P>
   Post Kenyon Martin led Cincinnati with 16 points. Melvin Levett
had 14 points and Steve Logan 13, but the Bearcats' backcourt
starters combined to hit just eight of 27 shots from the field,
including six of 20 3-pointers.

FUN BUILDS AS LEGOLAND CALIFORNIA PREPARES TO OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUE DOERFLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It's an Oz-like fantasy world where yellow
bricks _ and red, green and blue ones, too _ predominate. Lego
bricks, that is. Millions of them.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland California opens Saturday, March20, 30 miles north of
San Diego. It's the third Legoland in the world, the first in the
United States. Spread across 128 acres, it's bigger than Disneyland
and just as colorful, in a primary tone sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Lego designers from Billund, Denmark, where the toy was invented
by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932, pieced together the park, using
the actual plastic blocks that are sold in Lego kits in 138
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, who first made them in wood before turning to
plastic in 1947, called them Lego, which is a contraction of the
Danish words ``leg godt,'' meaning ``play well.'' And, in Latin,
Lego means ``I put together'' or ``I assemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other theme parks that have their share of adult thrill
rides, the $130 million Legoland California is designed for the
younger set, those ages 2 to 12, the ages of most Lego users.
</P>
<P>
   For the $32 adult and $25 child admission price, visitors are
treated to a few rides, some that even all ages will like, but the
main attractions are the 5,000 phenomenal Lego models scattered
throughout the park.
</P>
<P>
   It took 2 million Lego bricks and months to create the 9-foot
tall, 34-foot-long red dinosaur near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein's brain power takes on new proportions in the
Imagination Zone area: 1.2 million gray bricks were used in the
15{-foot-tall representation of his head that fronts one of the
buildings. The 19-foot-tall black and gray animated tyrannosaurus
rex towering nearby required 1 million bricks.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it's called Miniland, this area, a one-twentieth
scale re-creation of the Manhattan skyline, Washington, D.C., San
Francisco, New Orleans and a New England harbor, is made of 20
million bricks. The Empire State Building alone is 200,000 bricks.
The U.S. Capitol required 380,792.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers building horses, bridges and skyscrapers
with Legos as a child could spend hours looking at these creations.
</P>
<P>
   There are gray Lego brick elephants that spray water through
their trunks. Well-fed-looking zebras with black and white zigzags.
Red flamingos. Yes, red. Pink isn't in the Lego brick color
palette.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials could take out most of the rides and add more
models, and most Legomaniacs wouldn't even notice. Visitors still
would be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The model possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102,981,500 ways to combine six 8-stud bricks of the
same color. Three 8-stud bricks can be combined in 1,060 ways.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern California location means fitting in with the
surroundings, thus, there are a few rides, mainly slow-moving ones,
such as a boat ride and a safari-car ride. The roller coaster on
Castle Hill, while faster than other rides at the park, still is no
match for those at Six Flags or even a state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Montgomery, vice president of park operations, is quick to
point out that Legoland California's atmosphere is different than
that of amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about racing up to the next ride,'' he said. ``Our
appeal is very different. The scale and magnitude of Disneyland is
what you're impressed with. What is impressive about us is more
subtle. It's a series of little surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the model of a dog and a fire hydrant. Or the Mount
Rushmore model, where two Lego guys are using a Lego Q-tip to clean
one of George Washington's ears. Or the moving marching band that
parades in front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its more relaxed feel, Legoland shouldn't have trouble
attracting visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Name recognition alone is a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're a very strong brand and because we're a park
that has quite a narrow, specific focus, people will travel a lot
farther to come here than to a thrill ride park,'' Montgomery said.
There are many amusement parks, but only one Legoland in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all children have heard of or played with Legos, he said.
The United States ranks second in sales volume for the company,
topped by Germany, where children receive an average of six to
seven kits a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each hour, 2 million Lego bricks are manufactured at factories
in Denmark and the United States. Through 1998, 189 billion Lego
pieces had been molded.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it does with its toys, Lego is promoting family
interaction throughout the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have has some form of interaction and
decision-making,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   On one ride, called Sky Cycle, kids and their parents have to
work together to pedal a colorful, zany-looking car around an
elevated track. At the Kid Power Tower, they sit in outward-facing
seats and pull on a rope to propel themselves up 30 feet to the top
for a view of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the Imagination Zone, kids _ and their parents _ can build
race cars out of Legos, then compete with each other on a downhill
track. At the Driving School ride in the Fun Town area, young kids
drive electric Lego-looking cars around a streetscape, stopping at
signals and yielding to others.
</P>
<P>
   But what about older children and teens who won't be content to
putter along in cars that don't even bump into each other?
</P>
<P>
   Will older teens be bored? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are flatly not looking to attract and don't expect we'll
see many teenagers at the park,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   But some teens will enjoy bringing younger siblings to the park.
And they are certain to enjoy the restaurants, food booths and the
Lego factory tour that shows how the bricks are made and packaged.
They may even pull out their old Lego sets when they return home
and get creative.
</P>
<P>
   And parents and grandparents? They'll be watching or interacting
with the younger set, when they're not marveling at all the amazing
Lego models. &QL;

FUN BUILDS AS LEGOLAND CALIFORNIA PREPARES TO OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUE DOERFLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It's an Oz-like fantasy world where yellow
bricks _ and red, green and blue ones, too _ predominate. Lego
bricks, that is. Millions of them.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland California opens Saturday, March20, 30 miles north of
San Diego. It's the third Legoland in the world, the first in the
United States. Spread across 128 acres, it's bigger than Disneyland
and just as colorful, in a primary tone sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Lego designers from Billund, Denmark, where the toy was invented
by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932, pieced together the park, using
the actual plastic blocks that are sold in Lego kits in 138
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, who first made them in wood before turning to
plastic in 1947, called them Lego, which is a contraction of the
Danish words ``leg godt,'' meaning ``play well.'' And, in Latin,
Lego means ``I put together'' or ``I assemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other theme parks that have their share of adult thrill
rides, the $130 million Legoland California is designed for the
younger set, those ages 2 to 12, the ages of most Lego users.
</P>
<P>
   For the $32 adult and $25 child admission price, visitors are
treated to a few rides, some that even all ages will like, but the
main attractions are the 5,000 phenomenal Lego models scattered
throughout the park.
</P>
<P>
   It took 2 million Lego bricks and months to create the 9-foot
tall, 34-foot-long red dinosaur near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein's brain power takes on new proportions in the
Imagination Zone area: 1.2 million gray bricks were used in the
15{-foot-tall representation of his head that fronts one of the
buildings. The 19-foot-tall black and gray animated tyrannosaurus
rex towering nearby required 1 million bricks.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it's called Miniland, this area, a one-twentieth
scale re-creation of the Manhattan skyline, Washington, D.C., San
Francisco, New Orleans and a New England harbor, is made of 20
million bricks. The Empire State Building alone is 200,000 bricks.
The U.S. Capitol required 380,792.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers building horses, bridges and skyscrapers
with Legos as a child could spend hours looking at these creations.
</P>
<P>
   There are gray Lego brick elephants that spray water through
their trunks. Well-fed-looking zebras with black and white zigzags.
Red flamingos. Yes, red. Pink isn't in the Lego brick color
palette.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials could take out most of the rides and add more
models, and most Legomaniacs wouldn't even notice. Visitors still
would be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The model possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102,981,500 ways to combine six 8-stud bricks of the
same color. Three 8-stud bricks can be combined in 1,060 ways.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern California location means fitting in with the
surroundings, thus, there are a few rides, mainly slow-moving ones,
such as a boat ride and a safari-car ride. The roller coaster on
Castle Hill, while faster than other rides at the park, still is no
match for those at Six Flags or even a state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Montgomery, vice president of park operations, is quick to
point out that Legoland California's atmosphere is different than
that of amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about racing up to the next ride,'' he said. ``Our
appeal is very different. The scale and magnitude of Disneyland is
what you're impressed with. What is impressive about us is more
subtle. It's a series of little surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the model of a dog and a fire hydrant. Or the Mount
Rushmore model, where two Lego guys are using a Lego Q-tip to clean
one of George Washington's ears. Or the moving marching band that
parades in front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its more relaxed feel, Legoland shouldn't have trouble
attracting visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Name recognition alone is a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're a very strong brand and because we're a park
that has quite a narrow, specific focus, people will travel a lot
farther to come here than to a thrill ride park,'' Montgomery said.
There are many amusement parks, but only one Legoland in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all children have heard of or played with Legos, he said.
The United States ranks second in sales volume for the company,
topped by Germany, where children receive an average of six to
seven kits a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each hour, 2 million Lego bricks are manufactured at factories
in Denmark and the United States. Through 1998, 189 billion Lego
pieces had been molded.
</P>

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I recently returned from a ``Theater at Sea'' cruise on the
Stella Solaris, which took us from Rio de Janeiro up the Amazon to
Manaus. Every night, those of us who were on board as stars of
Broadway, opera and cabaret performed for the passengers. My New
York colleagues were Patricia Neal, Julie Wilson, Brian Bedford,
Lee Roy Reams, Anna Bergman, Patrice Munsel and Margaret Whiting,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   On boarding the ship, we were asked to fill out a brief form.
After duly writing in my name, address and passport number, I
decided to respond whimsically to the final question, ``How do you
want to be called?'' by filling in the blank with ``hey you''
contracting it, for more whimsy, to ``heyou.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when the passenger guest
list was slipped under our door. There I was, listed as ``Heyou
Alexander.'' It gave us all a good laugh. _ JANE ALEXANDER
</P>
<P>
   MARCH
</P>
<P>
   Lion or lamb?
</P>
<P>
   Science or scam?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it really a matter of luck
</P>
<P>
   Whether or no
</P>
<P>
   The weather is so?
</P>
<P>
   'Cause March came in like a duck.
</P>
<P>
   _ ROBERT H. NUTT
</P>
<P>
   The voice came from behind as Alison Schiff walked in Central
Park. ``Drop it,'' it said. Ms. Schiff turned to see a woman
scolding a dog on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a doughnut,'' the voice continued. ``And you just got
your figure back.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: The warehouse sale at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Baile Jaffe and a sales clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaffe: ``Would you help me find ties to match this suit for
my husband?''
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerk: ``Sure, what does your husband do? Is he a
banker?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaffe: ``No, he's a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerk: ``What kind of doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaffe: ``Psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerk: ``Does he work in a hospital or an outpatient
clinic?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaffe: ``Outpatient clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerk: ``Does he work with mainly depressed or manics? It
makes a difference, you know. A bright color would cheer up a
depressed person and a subdued tie would calm a manic person.''
</P>
<P>
   A professor of French history boarded a city bus on a bright but
showery day. Windows were open, so some of the seats had little
pools of water. The professor selected a dry seat, sat down, and
absent-mindedly took out a tissue and began to wipe up the moisture
on the seat beside her. The silence on the bus was broken by a
woman opposite the professor, who leaned forward and said, ``Do you
have any days free?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Herrig was shopping at a specialty food store on
Lexington Avenue in the 80s. Waiting at the cash register, he was
startled when the man in front of him turned and pointed to a
basket of produce. ``That's the kind that usually get slapped,'' he
said sotto voce.
</P>
<P>
   Another weirdo, Herrig thought. Then he noticed the sign above
the basket _ ``Fresh Dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Tuttle's 7-year-old niece, Stacey Day, had just received
a present and called her grandmother to share the news. ``It's the
greatest game, Grandma,'' she said. ``It's called Chinese checkers
and you don't even have to turn on the computer to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSY B's
</P>
<P>
   Alphabetically speaking, the B is abuzz,
</P>
<P>
   Doing what no other consonant does.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, it's a vitamin, blood type or grade;
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, the bolivar paid,
</P>
<P>
   A symbol for boron, a bishop in chess,
</P>
<P>
   A note, often flat, under musical stress,
</P>
<P>
   A BB's a gunshot, and travelers know
</P>
<P>
   A quaint B &AMP; B is the ``inn'' way to go!
</P>
<P>
   There are B-to-B ads in mellifluous tones
</P>
<P>
   Of Bell Atlantic's own James Earl Jones,
</P>
<P>
   But the twin B's have gained a new connotation
</P>
<P>
   As the B-line for '99's hot destination:
</P>
<P>
   The B &AMP; B we are packing for now _
</P>
<P>
   Is Spain's Barcelona _ and Bilbao!

   David Creed, strolling on Columbus Avenue, took it in stride
when a well-dressed man walked up to him and asked, ``How are you
on Cole Porter lyrics?'' and almost immediately went on to ask,
``What comes after this: `A cigarette that bears a lipstick's
traces/An airline ticket to romantic places?''' Creed offered,
``Oh, how the ghost of you clings/These foolish things remind me of
you.'' The man thanked him and went off.
</P>
<P>
   Creed returned home, looked up the lyrics of ``These Foolish
Things'' and discovered that he was only partly correct. It should
have been ``And still my heart has wings/These foolish things
remind me of you.'' Nonetheless, he was still one-up on his
questioner. The song was not written by Cole Porter but by Eric
Maschwitz, Harry Link and Jack Strachey.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Nancy Y. Arndt loves New York: Shopping at
Bergdorf Goodman, she asked for directions to the Chanel
department. ``Take a left at the third chandelier,'' she was told.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Brand and her husband were having lunch at a neighborhood
restaurant in the East 70s and discussing what to do after they had
finished. The waitress, overhearing the conversation, said, ``You
should go to the Frick; it's really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   When she left the table, Mrs. Brand and her husband wondered,
``Does she think we're tourists?'' And when the waitress returned,
Mrs. Brand asked her just that question. ``Oh, no,'' the waitress
answered. ``You're wearing too much black to be from out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   One thing I remember well from my youth is the family radio. The
evening shows were always so entertaining _ Fibber McGee and Molly,
Amos and Andy, the Shadow and many more.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed and World War II started. I joined the Army and was
stationed all over the world. We were lucky to have time to write
home or be fortunate enough to have a radio and tune in to the news
and music of the Armed Forces radio. Even Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally
supplied us with music.
</P>
<P>
   All the great music provided by Crosby, Perry Como, Sinatra,
Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Benny Goodman and the big bands gave us
memories that will last forever. And with the music of Berlin,
Gershwin and Cole Porter, we made sure we were never without the
wonderful radio.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the war was over and I treasured the great American
classics each time I found them on my radio stations. Last year
there was only one such station left _ WQEW (1560 AM) _ and in
December that station changed its format.
</P>
<P>
   So it was over: The music I loved is gone, my romance with radio
is finally finished.

PHOENIX-AREA SKIES ARE JAMMED, AIR PORTS SPUR FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ To the layman, the Phoenix area's flyway chart _ a sky
map for pilots _ is a confusing quilt of circles and arrows, dotted
lines and cryptic symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But a warning, found on the inside flap, is plain enough: The
skies may be friendly, but they sure are crowded.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, more and more planes are flying out
of the Phoenix area's general aviation airports, which are on a
collision course with urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Around the airports, sagebrush and sidewinders have given way to
tile roofs and swing sets. Census figures show the population is
growing steadily, right along with the air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   With more planes flying over more houses, neighborhood activists
say it's only a matter of time before tragedy strikes, and a plane
crashes in a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing that hasn't happened,'' said Don
Hopkins, a Scottsdale resident who has battled the city over
airport noise. ``There have been crashes, but they haven't been
severe enough yet for elected officials to understand there is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, two planes collided near Scottsdale Municipal
Airport, killing two men and peppering an apartment complex and a
golf course with debris.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a plane in a mock dogfight failed to pull out of a
dive and crashed in the desert northwest of Phoenix, killing two.
At least one witnesses observed the crash from the parking lot of
an outlet mall.
</P>
<P>
   In February, high winds dragged a hot-air balloon across
rooftops in Peoria, seriously injuring a passenger and damaging two
homes. Since October, four F-16s flying out of Luke Air Force Base
have crashed near the increasingly populated area, prompting the
base commander to briefly ground his 212 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials note that crashes are fairly rare, and say
safety really doesn't really drive the encroachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying is dangerous,'' said Deer Valley Municipal Airport
Manager Walt Fix, ``because you have to drive to the airport to get
to your airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The key issue, they say, is aircraft noise, which spawns
hundreds of complaints from residents whose homes are beneath the
flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Airport executives take those complaints seriously, mostly
because they can be fatal to small airports. According to a
national aviation group, some 50 to 70 small airports close each
year, and encroachment is the No. 1 reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airports that take the approach `We were here first' are
playing a very short-term game,'' said Scottsdale airport Manager
John Kinney, ``and they'll lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials employ multiple tactics to deal with
encroachment: meeting with residents, encouraging low-density
development and sometimes buying land to block new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   There are also laws that require builders to tell prospective
home buyers about airports, though they don't always work. People
continue to buy homes near airports, some knowingly, some not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a gal on the phone a few months ago, and she literally
was crying because she realized she was too close to the airport
after she built a custom home,'' said Mark Meyers, manager of
Falcon Field in Mesa. ``She didn't realize we were here, and she's
three-quarters of a mile away from the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   As sprawl continues in once-remote areas of Maricopa County,
skirmishes have flared up between homeowners and airports:
</P>
<P>
   In Gilbert, residents are suing U.S. Homes, alleging that the
developer did not disclose the impact of Williams Gateway Airport.
Traffic has steadily increased at the airport, which has been
touted as a future alternative to Sky Harbor for cargo and
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler, the city will ask voters to approve a controversial
plan to lengthen the runway at the city airport. Residents who
oppose the plan say the city's ultimate goal is to attract larger
corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, airport officials abandoned plans for a second
runway, mostly because of noise concerns. The city recently bought
200 acres just south of the airport to stop a development that
would have put 600 homes a stone's throw from the runway. Airports
officials have also restricted training flights at night.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, city officials ended a bitter fight by buying about 134
acres that buffered the residents of Red Mountain Ranch from TRW
Inc., a helicopter plant and nearby Falcon Field.
</P>
<P>
   As those fights play themselves out, the number of people living
near Phoenix-area airports continues to grow, according to census
figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Falcon Field, air traffic has increased 50
percent since 1988. Between 1990 and 1995, the population around
the airport rose 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic at Glendale Municipal Airport has risen 24 percent since
1998. Meanwhile, the population near the airport grew by 142
percent from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the smaller airports has siphoned small air
traffic away from Sky Harbor, leaving more room for larger planes.
General aviation at Sky Harbor dropped 33 percent between 1988 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Johnston, a Sky Harbor spokeswoman and pilot, said small
airports are just ``easier and quicker'' for general aviation
pilots to use.
</P>
<P>
   The airports haven't always been in competition with
neighborhoods. When they were first built, they were in the middle
of nowhere. The military, which used them for training, competed
with creosote bushes and the occasional coyote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the evolution of an airport, it starts in an
isolated area,'' Kinney said. ``Development takes place, in part
because of the airport, in part because of businesses located near
the airport, and it has that ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being surrounded by neighborhoods, airports seem
determined to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale and Deer Valley, there are plans to extend or
improve runways, add hangars and attract more businesses. In the
East Phoenix area, both Chandler Municipal and Williams Gateway are
gearing up to grow.
</P>
<P>
   All the airports are big economic engines for the Valley of the
Sun, as the Phoenixarea is known. A recent study by Arizona State
University found that the Scottsdale airport generates about $119.6
million while Williams Gateway adds $113 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the helicopter plant (recently sold by Boeing to MD
Helicopters), Falcon Field generates about $866 million, while Sky
Harbor has an economic impact of $16 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Torres, one of the Gilbert residents who is suing over
Williams Gateway, said he knows why the city wants to expand the
airport and lure cargo and passenger business from Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the money,'' he said. ``They think that this is the
cash cow that's going to save their city bankrolls, that it will
bring in hotels, industry, and high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to turn it off . . . that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Kinney said officials have worked hard to
encourage low density development, such as golf courses and
industrial parks, around the airport. The city also employs a
full-time noise abatement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Residents) see we don't have horns and a tail and we will
work with them,'' Kinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Hopkins writes off such statements as PR.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are employees of the city of Scottsdale, and it's
their business to keep that airport open and operating and making
money,'' Hopkins said. ``And the bottom of their list is noise
abatement and safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler, George Tandy Cook III says the city airport was
nothing more than a small strip when he moved into his log home in
1986. City officials told him it was going to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one runway, and they didn't have any tower at
all,'' Cook said. ``They didn't have a fence around it. We used to
ride horses on the runway, and sit out there for hours waiting for
a plane to land.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Today, there's a heliport about 100 yards
from Cook's home, though the city has promised to move it.
</P>
<P>
   The little airstrip has grown up into a thriving airport with
nearly 200,000 takeoffs and landings each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't want jets, they just want a bigger
runway,'' Cook said. ``We know that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fix, Deer Valley's manager, says growth is inevitable around
airports, no matter how hard government officials try to manage it.
Even in the once-isolated area around Deer Valley, neighborhoods
are springing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously can't stretch our arms out beyond our land use
boundaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While builders are required to disclose the airport's location
to home buyers, the airport still gets plenty of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become more and more of an issue over the last four and
half years,'' Fix said. ``As the residential areas grow near the
airport like they have, we get more complaint calls . . . and calls
from prospective home buyers wanting to to know more about the
airport before they purchase a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley continues to expand. The airport plans to spend $15
million to build new hangars, remodel the terminal and reconstruct
the south runway.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing compared with business owners, who are preparing
for the arrival of the Outer Loop, which will slice through the
area in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been incredible,'' Fix said. ``Even right across the
street on Deer Valley Road, we have businesses going in, in all the
infill lots across the street, from 19th Avenue to Seventh
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney, the Scottsdale airport manager, says Barry Goldwater
summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You can take an airport and build it in the absolute
middle of the Sahara Desert, and within five years, you'll be
completely surrounded by homes. I guarantee it.' '' &QL;

THE BIG CITY: A HAND SIGNAL TO COUNTERACT ROAD RAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What we have here is a failure to communicate. New
York's streets and sidewalks are clogged with more people from more
places than ever before, and often the only way they can talk to
one another is through sign language. But there is only one clearly
understood gesture.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have something to express that cannot be represented
by a raised middle finger? Even New York drivers are sometimes
tempted to say ``excuse me'' or ``thank you.'' Now that civility is
coming back into fashion, New Yorkers could use a new signal, and
researchers are already at work on it.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Gridlock Sam, also known as Samuel I. Schwartz,
who coined the term ``gridlock'' when he was chief engineer for the
city's Department of Transportation. ``With traffic at record
levels, we need to give drivers a way to lower the rage level,''
said Schwartz, now a consultant and the traffic columnist for The
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   His experimentation with friendly signals began with the 1960s
peace sign, the two fingers raised in a V, but he found it
ineffective. Some people resented its political connotations; some
thought he was flashing a victory sign; some got angry because they
saw only one finger. Schwartz has had better luck with a gesture of
apology: a light tap of the palm to the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it when I've inadvertently cut someone off,'' he
explained. ``It's a way of saying, `How thoughtless of me! I'm
sorry!' People seem to get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the Forehead Tap become a standard gesture? Maybe locally.
But David Givens fears it will not be a lasting contribution to
world peace, and he should know. Givens, the director of the Center
for Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash., is an anthropologist
working on the first dictionary of body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forehead Tap,'' he said, ``might show you're angry at
yourself, but it's not a sign of appeasement, and it can be
ambiguous. In some Mediterranean regions, it means `I'm crazy' or
`A curse on you!' In France, you knock your forehead to mean that
your companion is stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, even the raised middle finger is not universally
understood. Although it has a long history _ ancient Romans called
it the ``digitus impudicus,'' or indecent finger _ it's not an
automatic reflex. ``The finger is an iconic gesture,'' Givens
explained, ``that was invented in some cultures to picture the
erect phallus. It's a symbol of dominance that must be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   But some gestures are automatically understood by all humans,
and Givens proposes to use them in a new signal of goodwill that he
has concocted: the Bowing Thumb Waggle. It incorporates gestures
that vertebrates have been programmed to make _ and to recognize in
others _ since amphibians and reptiles began making peace by
lowering themselves to the ground in submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we feel meek or friendly, our emotions toggle these old
reptilian brain circuits,'' Givens said, ``and we automatically
start to shrug our shoulders and rotate our wrists so that the
palms face up. It's our equivalent of the submissive gesture that
dogs make by lowering their head below their shoulders. Around the
world, when people feel helpless or contrite, they hold up their
open palms, and when they want to be friendly, they wave hello with
an open palm.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the Bowing Thumb Waggle, you display the open palm and
wave gently, with the fingers spread slightly apart and the thumb
folded across the palm. ``It looks as if you have only four
fingers,'' Givens said, ``and that's interpreted by the
subconscious brain as a sign of weakness. The overall gesture says,
`I mean no harm, as you can see by my open palm and poor thumbless
hand.' It can't be confused with any other cultural cue anywhere,
not even in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowing Thumb Waggle has not been tested in the field, but
Givens is confident it could make New York a friendlier place.
``You could do it out the window of your car to apologize or ask
someone to let you cut in,'' he said. ``You could use it to
politely interrupt someone in a boardroom meeting, or if you wanted
to accost someone on the sidewalk to ask directions.''
</P>
<P>
   And if someone does not reciprocate with goodwill to your bowing
thumb and waggling palm? In that case, Givens recommends that even
New Yorkers avoid the temptation to fully rotate the palm and bow
three other fingers.

KNICKS' COACH PREPARED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The teaser worked. Jeff Van Gundy stayed tuned when
he heard his name mentioned just before a commercial during an NBC
broadcast Sunday. About 60 seconds later, NBC reported that Van
Gundy could be fired if the New York Knicks did not beat the
Charlotte Hornets Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did beat Charlotte. They wavered at times, but
unearthed an intense 11-2 fourth-quarter run to close out a 94-86
victory by leaning on an active Chris Dudley (13 rebounds) and some
pivotal jumpers from Latrell Sprewell, who scored 16 points. Allan
Houston added 20 points and Larry Johnson scored 19 to counter 23
points from the Hornets' newest arrival, Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Van Gundy was reportedly on the verge of losing
his job, the way he was early in his first season, in his second
season and last year. A glib Van Gundy shrugged off the report
after he arrived at Madison Square Garden before Sunday night's
game, and the team president, Ernie Grunfeld, called it ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Van Gundy did not take comfort in the pregame
reassurances he received from management. It was hard to take
comfort in anything, with the Knicks having fallen to 11-9
following a horrendous, uninspired performance in a 76-63 loss to
the Chicago Bulls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, until they fire you, they are never going to
say, `Hey, I'm thinking I'm going to fire you, but let's give it a
couple of games, and we'll see,''' Van Gundy said before the game.
``I'd say, `Hey, if we play like we did in Chicago, someone's got
to pay.' If we play like that consistently? It's my responsibility
to get the team to play with pride. I have no problem with being
held accountable for that. That's your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Van Gundy's job is to move his team to perform. And that
did not happen in Chicago. The Knicks showed no desire or pride as
they set franchise lows for points in a half (22) and field goals
in a game (19). They also tied a team mark with just five points in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that performance, one official from the
Eastern Conference said Van Gundy's job was considered shaky but
added that Grunfeld's position was also in question. People within
the Knicks' organization have indicated that the relationship
between Grunfeld and Dave Checketts, the president of Madison
Square Garden, has cooled. Grunfeld, who has spent $64 million to
assemble the current roster, is also being held responsible for the
Knicks' underwhelming start this season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been injuries _ including ones to Sprewell and
Patrick Ewing _ but several other teams are struggling with health
problems and managing. So far, the moves the Knicks have made to
compensate for injuries and personnel changes have not consistently
worked out well. Marcus Camby, who arrived in a trade for Charles
Oakley, has not been the answer against physical teams. The passion
Oakley brought to the team has not been supplied by Kurt Thomas.
And Dennis Scott, who was signed to replace the shooting off the
bench once provided by the jettisoned John Starks, was waived
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy did not use the off-season moves as a cover. He
took responsibility for the problems that have haunted his team,
like poor rebounding, poor free-throw shooting and a lack of effort
on the road. Entering Sunday night's game, the inconsistencies had
meant just three victories in the Knicks' last nine games and a
five-game losing streak on the road. The atrocious loss to Chicago
only punctuated the obvious issues the Knicks face. So it did not
surprise Van Gundy to hear a report that his job was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered why it's taken so long,'' Van Gundy said. ``It
would be different if I didn't know what I was getting into. I knew
what I was getting into when I took the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny is intense in New York. Each loss leads to
questions about what is wrong with a team that started the night
fourth in the Atlantic Division. Some wonder if Van Gundy's
methods, and his pessimistic take on his team's play, have worn
thin on his players. At times, they appear to be tuning Van Gundy
out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy disagreed, saying: ``I think that's a fiction type
thing. I don't think it happens as often as the media thinks. It's
not that simplistic. It's like 24 hours earlier they were listening
when we played Washington and then they stopped the next night in
Chicago. I don't know the answer, but I tell you the one way to
find out is what goes on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Knicks _ players like Johnson, Ewing and Houston
_ has been supportive of Van Gundy. After hearing the NBC report,
Houston said: ``I don't think there is a better-prepared coach than
Jeff. We have to look at ourselves after Chicago. Was that a
reflection on Jeff? I don't think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has his stars' support. But he could not just dismiss
a television report that caught his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching,'' Van Gundy said. ``Then they said, `We'll
discuss Jeff Van Gundy when we return,' so I kept the TV on to find
out what was happening to me. Gee, I thought, maybe they'll say I
got a raise. You never know. You wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if we keep playing like we did against Chicago, my job
will be in jeopardy.''

BOR WINS L.A. MARATHON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Simon Bor doesn't know what all the fuss was
about. The 30-year-old Kenyan heard little about the course other
than how difficult it was and how its hills made a respectable time
nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In his first attempt, Bor shattered the L.A. Marathon course
record of 2:10:19 by winning Sunday's 14th annual event in 2:09:25.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Bogacheva of Kirgizstan won the women's race in 2:30:32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, according to how I saw the course, it was almost the
same all the way through,'' Bor said. ``I don't see where the
problem was. I had been meant to understand Los Angeles was a hard
course, so all the way when I was running, I was thinking or
dreaming in my mind that it was a hard course. I can actually say
the course was not very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bor thrust his fists into the air and bounced around beyond the
finish line with a huge smile on his face after his victory, but
another man was just as happy about Bor's time.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Marathon president Bill Burke desperately wanted a sub-2:10
finish. Because of the course's hills in the second half, which
peak at 395 feet during mile 21, he contemplated re-routing the
course. A flatter course would help provide times to put the race
on par with elite marathons like Boston and New York, but would
require excluding areas that have become important to the
atmosphere of the event that attracted an estimated 20,630
participants this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night before I went to bed I said a prayer,'' Burke said.
``The prayer was, `God help me out with this course decision.' What
he did was he sent me Simon Bor. That was a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who cried when Bor completed the race, said the course
will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Martin Mondragon set the previous record of 2:10:19 in
1988. Since then, only American Mark Plaatjes in 1991 had finished
below 2:11. Last year's field was promoted as one of the best, but
Burke realized by mid-race he wouldn't get a record as runners
continued to hold back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Bor on the other hand, went out there and was like a
fantasy for me,'' Burke said. ``At the halfway point when they had
the projected time at 2:07, I thought our clocks were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bor took the lead in the sixth mile and was in front the rest of
the way _ with the exception of two miles near the middle of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   A pack that included Bor and fellow Kenyans Christopher
Cheboiboch, Simon Sawe and Joseph Kariuki broke away during the
eighth mile. By the 15th mile, Bor and training partner Cheboiboch
were the only ones left. The two continued running side by side for
four miles.
</P>
<P>
   Cheboiboch, diagnosed with malaria two weeks ago, grabbed his
stomach and began to drop just before the 19-mile mark. James
Bungei of Kenya passed Cheboiboch during the 23rd mile and went on
to finish second (2:10:43) in his first marathon. Cheboiboch
(2:13:49) took third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Bor, he's also one of my heroes now,'' said Burke,
putting the runner in the same category as Muhammad Ali. ``He took
an 800-pound gorilla off my back and made me a free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the happiest guy. I'm happier than Simon. I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bor ran at a pace of 4:56 minutes per mile. His first marathon
in the United States _ and third marathon overall _ didn't match
his personal best of 2:08:46, but provided his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Los Angeles is where my good luck is at,'' said Bor, who
receives a $25,000 bonus for breaking the 2:10 mark in addition to
the $35,000 and a car awarded to first-place finishers. ``Maybe it
was waiting for me here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my best effort in a marathon. You people have been
talking about how hard the course is, so you have to compare the
situations. I have to say it was the best performance for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moges Taye entered the race with the second-fastest personal
best time but was never a factor. The Kenyan was at least 50 yards
behind the lead pack by the third mile. He finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The women's side was also without one of its favorites at the
end. Two-time defending champion Lornah Kiplagat's hopes of
becoming the first three-time winner were dashed as the Kenyan
withdrew just before the 10th mile because of illness. Nadia
Prasad, winner of the 1995 event, returned after three years away
but failed to keep up with the lead pack.
</P>
<P>
   Bogacheva came out of nowhere to surge past Russia's Svetlana
Zakharova in the 23rd mile. The 37-year-old led the rest of the way
after Zakharova held a comfortable lead for more than 13 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bogacheva said her plan was to come on strong in the second half
of the race, so she wasn't worried about the gap opened by
Zakharova. While Zakharova, 28, showed signs of fatigue in the
final miles, Bogacheva remained in good form.
</P>
<P>
   Bogacheva finished second in the 1997 L.A. Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time around is always better,'' she said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Top American finishers were Jose Luis Arriaga from Glendale and
Christina Nooney of New York. Arriaga finished 17th at 2:25:35,
while Nooney came in at 2:47:17 to place seventh in the women's
race.

KNICKS' COACH PREPARED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The teaser worked. Jeff Van Gundy stayed tuned when
he heard his name mentioned just before a commercial during an NBC
broadcast Sunday. About 60 seconds later, NBC reported that Van
Gundy could be fired if the New York Knicks did not beat the
Charlotte Hornets Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did beat Charlotte. They wavered at times, but
unearthed an intense 11-2 fourth-quarter run to close out a 94-86
victory by leaning on an active Chris Dudley (13 rebounds) and some
pivotal jumpers from Latrell Sprewell, who scored 16 points. Allan
Houston added 20 points and Larry Johnson scored 19 to counter 23
points from the Hornets' newest arrival, Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Van Gundy was reportedly on the verge of losing
his job, the way he was early in his first season, in his second
season and last year. A glib Van Gundy shrugged off the report
after he arrived at Madison Square Garden before Sunday night's
game, and the team president, Ernie Grunfeld, called it ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Van Gundy did not take comfort in the pregame
reassurances he received from management. It was hard to take
comfort in anything, with the Knicks having fallen to 11-9
following a horrendous, uninspired performance in a 76-63 loss to
the Chicago Bulls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, until they fire you, they are never going to
say, `Hey, I'm thinking I'm going to fire you, but let's give it a
couple of games, and we'll see,''' Van Gundy said before the game.
``I'd say, `Hey, if we play like we did in Chicago, someone's got
to pay.' If we play like that consistently? It's my responsibility
to get the team to play with pride. I have no problem with being
held accountable for that. That's your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Van Gundy's job is to move his team to perform. And that
did not happen in Chicago. The Knicks showed no desire or pride as
they set franchise lows for points in a half (22) and field goals
in a game (19). They also tied a team mark with just five points in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that performance, one official from the
Eastern Conference said Van Gundy's job was considered shaky but
added that Grunfeld's position was also in question. People within
the Knicks' organization have indicated that the relationship
between Grunfeld and Dave Checketts, the president of Madison
Square Garden, has cooled. Grunfeld, who has spent $64 million to
assemble the current roster, is also being held responsible for the
Knicks' underwhelming start this season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been injuries _ including ones to Sprewell and
Patrick Ewing _ but several other teams are struggling with health
problems and managing. So far, the moves the Knicks have made to
compensate for injuries and personnel changes have not consistently
worked out well. Marcus Camby, who arrived in a trade for Charles
Oakley, has not been the answer against physical teams. The passion
Oakley brought to the team has not been supplied by Kurt Thomas.
And Dennis Scott, who was signed to replace the shooting off the
bench once provided by the jettisoned John Starks, was waived
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy did not use the off-season moves as a cover. He
took responsibility for the problems that have haunted his team,
like poor rebounding, poor free-throw shooting and a lack of effort
on the road. Entering Sunday night's game, the inconsistencies had
meant just three victories in the Knicks' last nine games and a
five-game losing streak on the road. The atrocious loss to Chicago
only punctuated the obvious issues the Knicks face. So it did not
surprise Van Gundy to hear a report that his job was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered why it's taken so long,'' Van Gundy said. ``It
would be different if I didn't know what I was getting into. I knew
what I was getting into when I took the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny is intense in New York. Each loss leads to
questions about what is wrong with a team that started the night
fourth in the Atlantic Division. Some wonder if Van Gundy's
methods, and his pessimistic take on his team's play, have worn
thin on his players. At times, they appear to be tuning Van Gundy
out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy disagreed, saying: ``I think that's a fiction type
thing. I don't think it happens as often as the media thinks. It's
not that simplistic. It's like 24 hours earlier they were listening
when we played Washington and then they stopped the next night in
Chicago. I don't know the answer, but I tell you the one way to
find out is what goes on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Knicks _ players like Johnson, Ewing and Houston
_ has been supportive of Van Gundy. After hearing the NBC report,
Houston said: ``I don't think there is a better-prepared coach than
Jeff. We have to look at ourselves after Chicago. Was that a
reflection on Jeff? I don't think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has his stars' support. But he could not just dismiss
a television report that caught his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching,'' Van Gundy said. ``Then they said, `We'll
discuss Jeff Van Gundy when we return,' so I kept the TV on to find
out what was happening to me. Gee, I thought, maybe they'll say I
got a raise. You never know. You wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if we keep playing like we did against Chicago, my job
will be in jeopardy.''

NISSAN IN TALKS WITH RENAULT ABOUT STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Negotiations concerning the sale of a stake in Nissan
Motor Co., Japan's second-largest car maker, continued this past
weekend in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, and four other Nissan
executives flew to France on Saturday, people at the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In France, they were planning to meet with senior executives of
Renault SA, the French car maker that Nissan turned to after
Daimler-Chrysler AG broke off talks about taking a stake on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NHK, the Japanese broadcasting company, reported Sunday night
that Hanawa had returned to Tokyo, apparently after discussions
with Louis Schweitzer, the head of Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has decided it wants a deal by the end of the fiscal year
on March 31, though there is no obvious reason for the deadline.
Traditionally, Japanese companies prefer to settle all pending
matters and start the new fiscal year with a clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   Renault is expected to have a board meeting on Tuesday, after
which it may announce a deal, Nissan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are expecting Nissan and Renault to reach some sort of
deal, largely because the French government, Renault's largest
shareholder, seems to favor it. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial
newspaper reported that officials from Japan's Ministry of Trade
and Industry were also talking with the French government to
support Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said on Wednesday at the Geneva Auto Show that many
hurdles to a deal would be tough to overcome, like cultural
differences and development of a realistic plan for turning around
Nissan's operations and cutting its debt, which exceeds $21
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little overlap in the companies' operations, and,
unlike DaimlerChrysler, Renault has need of a big partner.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, as emissions regulations grow tougher in Europe,
Renault is interested in technology Nissan has developed for
producing more environmentally friendly cars. Renault also has its
eye on Nissan's two small-car plants in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A 33.4 percent stake in Nissan, the minimum needed for a board
veto under Japanese law, would cost more than 500 billion yen, or
$4.2 billion, based on Nissan's current share price. That price
would stretch Renault, which would have $2.1 billion in cash after
paying down its existing debt. &QL;

AMERICA WEST FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' UNION CHIEF IN TALKS, THEN IN
ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When flight attendants union President Bill McGlashen
squares off in negotiations Wednesday against America West Airlines
management, he'll be fighting for more than a suitable contract.
</P>
<P>
   His job is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, members of the Association of Flight
Attendants Council 66 will choose between McGlashen and two
challengers, Lisa Bunch and Tim Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   With the strike deadline looming at the end of the day Friday,
McGlashen's ability to deliver a good contract or an effective
strike that wins concessions for the 2,400 flight attendants may be
a key factor in whether he's re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen's counterpart during three days of ``supermediation''
will be Greg Garger, America West's vice president of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Garger, who joined America West two years ago, helped negotiate
a contract with the mechanics union that was ratified in October.
He was joined by management labor consultant Jerry Glass during
those discussions, and Glass will be at Garger's side later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Glass has his own consulting firm, J. Glass and Associates, in
Washington, D.C. He was America West's lead negotiator on the
pilots union contract and has represented other carriers, including
Mesa Air Group and Atlantic Coast Airlines, as well as trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Garger, who shuns the spotlight that comes with a high-profile
labor dispute, said he's focused on reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Tempe-based America West, Garger spent 14 years
practicing employment and labor law with Winston and Strawn, a
Chicago firm. A Cornell University graduate, Garger represented
Caterpillar Inc. in a contentious labor battle with the United Auto
Workers that resulted in the longest strike in the heavy-equipment
company's history.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, the UAW ended a 17-month walkout with nothing
gained for more than 8,700 strikers.
</P>
<P>
   While Garger prefers a low profile, McGlashen seems comfortable
when the TV lights go on for live shots during union rallies and
news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   After joining America West as a flight attendant in 1989, he
became involved in organizing the flight attendants in 1994 and
became president of Council 66 last June.
</P>
<P>
   For McGlashen, it was a return to the political arena that he
first entered in 1997 when he immersed himself in Republican
campaigns in his home state of Texas. At age 21, he became the
central Texas youth coordinator for the Ronald Reagan presidential
campaign in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In his Tempe union office, McGlashen has a picture of himself
with President Reagan, who is disdained in union circles for
busting the air traffic controllers union.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen is quick to point out that it was an illegal strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my stripes,'' he said, adding that he has
had disagreements with Reagan's politics over the years.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen also points out that it's not inconsistent to be a
Republican and a union leader. About 40 percent of union members
are Republicans, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his relatives are retired UAW members.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen was born near Flint, Mich., and raised in the Houston
area. He graduated from Houston Baptist College with a history
degree and worked in corporate communications for a Houston
hospital for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen then took a radio job in Albuquerque with KIVA-AM/FM
as a producer and salesman.
</P>
<P>
   His timing in joining America West didn't work out so well.
Within two years, the company filed for bankruptcy. McGlashen had
to take a 10 percent pay cut and his 60 shares of company stock
became worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's union president, McGlashen said he is used to the
ebb and flow of the job, which is similar to what he experienced in
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Once he leaves office, McGlashen is eager to return to flying a
``normal schedule'' as a flight attendant and returning to work
part time at the Poisoned Pen, a Scottsdale mystery bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has an interest in running for the state
Legislature from Tempe's District 27. &QL;

DRAGON SYSTEMS DELAYS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock-market debut of Dragon Systems, a voice-recognition
software company in Newton, Mass., has been postponed until at
least next month, following Dragon's report of unexpectedly anemic
sales revenue in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's Naturally Speaking software products have made the
small company the retail leader in its niche, against hefty
competition from IBM and weaker rivals including Lernout &AMP; Hauspie.
The company had expected to sell a minority stake to the public
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, potential investors had been relying on
financial statements for the first nine months of 1998, though
Dragon warned that the fourth quarter was its most important
selling season. When the full year's numbers were tallied, in
amended financial statements filed recently with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, they showed less than exciting results.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's sales revenue inched up only slightly in the fourth
quarter, to $21.8 million from $20.7 million in the third quarter.
By contrast, revenue in the fourth quarter of 1997 was more than
twice that reported in the third quarter of that year.
</P>
<P>
   And net income in the fourth quarter last year dipped to $1.6
million from $7.6 million in the third. Though the company posted
losses in all four quarters of 1997, its loss in the fourth quarter
of that year was considerably smaller than in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's revenue for 1998 totaled $71.4 million, more than twice
its 1997 revenue of $26.8 million. And after several years of red
ink, Dragon posted profits in 1998 of $10.3 million, compared with
a loss of $5.3 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But when surprises like this crop up, underwriters typically
seek more time to explain them to potential institutional
investors, people familiar with the company's plans said. A
spokeswoman for Dragon refused to comment on the reasons for the
disappointing quarter, citing SEC restrictions on a company's
comments about a pending stock offering.

`ANALYZE THIS' RETAINS ROLE AS BOX OFFICE KINGPIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gangster-comedy ``Analyze This'' continued to rub
out rivals with an estimated $15.7 million at 2,537 theaters during
the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal, has topped Hollywood's expectations with an impressive $40
million in 10 days. It dropped only 17 percent from its opening
weekend and took in more than double the nearest competitor, Sony's
second weekend of ``Cruel Intentions,'' with $7 million at 2,300
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word of mouth among moviegoers for `Analyze This' has been
very strong,'' said movie analyst Arthur Rockwell &UR;  &LR; on Sunday. ``The
studio has to be happy with it, because the demographic appeal
beyond adults was not that clear before it opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``Analyze This'' has benefited from the absence of other
adult-oriented comedies and the success of HBO's mobster-comedy
series ``The Sopranos.'' He predicted ``Analyze This'' will gross
$80 million overall, $25 million above his earlier forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also saw five openings with each generating moderate
rather than blockbuster results. Bucksbaum said the returns were
not a surprise, given how crowded the marketplace has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are way too many films being released, particularly
since this is not a huge time for going to the movies,'' he said.
``Still, the box office is performing pretty well, considering how
few of the new films are major titles.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers finished in a tight pack, taking the five slots
between third and seventh. MGM's horror sequel ``The Rage: Carrie
2'' posted the best debut with $6.8 million at 2,286 theaters,
followed by New Line's police drama ``The Corruptor'' with $5.8
million at 1,804 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's long-shelved family comedy ``Baby Geniuses'' took fifth
with $5.7 million at 1,689 theaters, overcoming mostly negative
reviews, followed by the studio's family drama ``The Deep End of
the Ocean'' with $5.6 million at 1,907 sites. 20th Century Fox's
science-fiction adventure ``Wing Commander'' finished seventh with
$5.2 million at 2,016 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' has the strongest
long-term prospects of the quintet, but projected its final gross
will be a less-than-stellar $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``The Other Sister'' came in eighth
with $3.9 million at 1,863 theaters, followed by Sony's third
weekend of ``8mm'' with $3.6 million at 2,241 locations and
Universal's fourth weekend of ``October Sky'' with $3 million at
1,565 screens. Bucksbaum noted that ``October Sky'' is the
longest-running film in the top 10 with 24 days in release,
underscoring the difficulty of competing against the barrage of new
entries.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love'' finished 11th with $2.8
million at 1,405 theaters to push its 94-day total to nearly $69
million. ``Shakespeare'' has benefited far more from Academy Award
``buzz'' than any other contender, as it has almost doubled its
gross since its 13 Oscar nominations were announced Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's sixth weekend of ``Payback'' came in 12th with $2.6
million at 1,982 theaters, extending its lead as the top 1999
grosser with $76 million overall. Miramax's 21st weekend of ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' which has seven Oscar nominations, continued to
draw well with $1.8 million at 646 locations and has nearly $33
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks pulled ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with 11 Oscar nods,
from 329 theaters after nearly nine months in release and the epic
drew $862,000 at 616 screens to push its total to $208.7 million.
``Ryan'' needs less than $2 million to top ``Back to the Future''
for the 22nd spot on the all-time domestic chart.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy continued to rack up solid returns from ``Lock, Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels'' with $296,000 at 33 theaters in its
second weekend. Miramax generated lukewarm response from
German-language drama ``The Harmonists'' with $28,000 at six sites.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $81 million, down about 1 percent from
the same weekend a year ago when the 13th weekend of ``Titanic''
led the box office and Leonardo DiCaprio's ``Man in the Iron Mask''
opened with an impressive $17.3 million. Year-to-date grosses have
gone past $1 billion, trailing the 1998 period by about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparisons with 1998 are pretty tough but this is pretty
solid business for this time of year,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Four new movies will open Friday, including DreamWorks'
romance-comedy ``Forces of Nature'' with Sandra Bullock, Fox's
frontier thriller ``Ravenous'' and a pair from Warner Bros. _
animated musical ``The King and I'' and Clint Eastwood's murder
mystery ``True Crime.'' Bucksbaum said ``Forces of Nature'' will
likely lead the box office, given the strong appetite for comedies
and Bullock's drawing power.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Rarely has a game between the best and the worst of the
Eastern Conference encompassed as much drama as Sunday's game
between the Miami Heat and the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   While the game evolved into the rout the team's records
forecast, the atmosphere remained as tense as a courtroom awaiting
a jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the intensity was generated by the intrigue surrounding
John Calipari, the third-year Nets coach whose job is in jeopardy
because of the team's poor performance. So strange were the events
encircling the crestfallen coach that they overshadowed the Nets
debut of Stephon Marbury, whose acquisition on Thursday led NBC to
change its plans and give the game national rather than regional
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing sentiment heading into Sunday's game was that a
strong performance might delay Calipari's firing, while a poor one
could cement his demise.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets players, who have read the newspapers, heard the rumors
and privately fingered Calipari as a large reason for their 3-17
record, knew what was at stake going in. In response, they played
softly and inconsistently and were routed, 102-76, at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   After the game it appeared that Calipari was on the verge of
being fired. While the assistant coaches, the players and the rest
of the staff headed to the airport on the team bus, Calipari left
with Lewis Katz, the team's principal owner, in a private car.
</P>
<P>
   The two went to dinner, where a Nets official said they
discussed the team's problems and possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, who has two years and $6 million remaining on his
contract, might be given the option of stepping down as coach but
remaining with the organization in some other capacity or accepting
a buyout and leaving the Nets altogether, according to a person
close to the team who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, who carried a travel bag with him when he got into the
car with Katz, did not fly to Toronto with the team for Tuesday's
game against the Raptors. He might fly to Canada on Monday,
however, and the Nets expect to make an announcement concerning
Calipari's future Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If playing to save Calipari's job was not enough inspiration for
the Nets Sunday, the debut of Marbury (21 points and five assists)
might have sparked them. But the excitement of adding him to the
lineup wore off quickly and the Nets stumbled to their seventh
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   This one was the worst of the season, though, as they fell
behind by as many as 28 points and allowed Miami, whose 16-5 record
is the best in the East, to reach 100 points for only the third
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   As his team crumbled before his eyes, Calipari paced the
sideline, weakly yelling out instructions and wearing a morose
look. Katz had refused to give his coach a vote of confidence two
days earlier and with him now observing Sunday's action from a
courtside seat, grimacing after every Nets' miscue, Calipari seemed
like a dead man walking.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, a huge basketball fan who is ecstatic about having the
opportunity to run his own team, admitted that it was hard watching
the Nets get pummeled. That he had invested more than $120 million
into contract extensions for Marbury and Kerry Kittles within the
past three days certainly did not soften the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to watch because of the way you feel about the
players, the coaches, Cal,'' Katz said. ``This is a terrible
feeling to watch. You could see him on the sideline. It's a
dreadful human emotion to watch a guy give his heart and soul and
the players, and you never feel like you're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, who has repeatedly denied the obvious in stating that
he is not worried about his job, said after the game that he was
not bothered by Katz's refusal to publicly support him. ``I hate
votes of confidence,'' said Calipari. ``A vote of confidence is
ugly. It's like kissing your sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn Wentworth, Katz's co-chairman of the ownership group,
Michael Rowe, the Nets' president, and John Nash, the general
manager, were also present, sitting a few rows behind the Nets'
bench and seemingly analyzing Calipari's every move. It appeared as
if the beleaguered coach, who only a few months ago was being
hailed as the franchise's great fix-it man, was being zeroed in on.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the four Nets' officials met in a room near the
Nets' locker room, presumably to discuss Calipari's future. In the
third quarter, Don Casey, the Nets' assistant who would likely take
over on an interim basis if Calipari is fired, left the bench and
headed toward the area in which the power meeting was taking place.
And after the game, Wentworth met with Calipari for nearly 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about our situation and what's the
solution,'' Calipari said. ``He just wanted to know where we're
going. How we get this thing changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected to be the Nets' coach Tuesday against
Toronto, Calipari said, ``There was nothing said in that meeting
that led me to believe anything different.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the Nets players believe that Calipari is on his way
out, and while no one is fighting to keep him aboard, they denied
conspiring to get him removed. Van Horn, who recorded 15 points and
12 rebounds Sunday, was upset about published reports that the team
held a players-only meeting that ended with a 12-1 vote against
Calipari remaining as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't discussed it at all as a team,'' Van Horn said.
``Some of the stuff that's being written is just so ridiculous. One
guy wrote a whole article on how we had a team meeting that never
existed. We never had a team meeting and voted Cal out of here.
That never took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, who over the years has been one of Calipari's
greatest and most consistent critics, seems to feel sorry for his
coach. ``I'm not in the business one way or the other of making a
man lose his livelihood, so anything I say right now that's
negative against John Calipari would be adding fuel to the fire,''
he said. ``John is in this hole with us all. I'm playing hurt
because I'm not going to leave this hole. We're all in this hole
together, not just one person. This whole team, including Cal.''

AMERICA WEST FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' UNION CHIEF IN TALKS, THEN IN
ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When flight attendants union President Bill McGlashen
squares off in negotiations Wednesday against America West Airlines
management, he'll be fighting for more than a suitable contract.
</P>
<P>
   His job is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, members of the Association of Flight
Attendants Council 66 will choose between McGlashen and two
challengers, Lisa Bunch and Tim Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   With the strike deadline looming at the end of the day Friday,
McGlashen's ability to deliver a good contract or an effective
strike that wins concessions for the 2,400 flight attendants may be
a key factor in whether he's re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen's counterpart during three days of ``supermediation''
will be Greg Garger, America West's vice president of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Garger, who joined America West two years ago, helped negotiate
a contract with the mechanics union that was ratified in October.
He was joined by management labor consultant Jerry Glass during
those discussions, and Glass will be at Garger's side later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Glass has his own consulting firm, J. Glass and Associates, in
Washington, D.C. He was America West's lead negotiator on the
pilots union contract and has represented other carriers, including
Mesa Air Group and Atlantic Coast Airlines, as well as trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Garger, who shuns the spotlight that comes with a high-profile
labor dispute, said he's focused on reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Tempe-based America West, Garger spent 14 years
practicing employment and labor law with Winston and Strawn, a
Chicago firm. A Cornell University graduate, Garger represented
Caterpillar Inc. in a contentious labor battle with the United Auto
Workers that resulted in the longest strike in the heavy-equipment
company's history.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, the UAW ended a 17-month walkout with nothing
gained for more than 8,700 strikers.
</P>
<P>
   While Garger prefers a low profile, McGlashen seems comfortable
when the TV lights go on for live shots during union rallies and
news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   After joining America West as a flight attendant in 1989, he
became involved in organizing the flight attendants in 1994 and
became president of Council 66 last June.
</P>
<P>
   For McGlashen, it was a return to the political arena that he
first entered in 1997 when he immersed himself in Republican
campaigns in his home state of Texas. At age 21, he became the
central Texas youth coordinator for the Ronald Reagan presidential
campaign in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In his Tempe union office, McGlashen has a picture of himself
with President Reagan, who is disdained in union circles for
busting the air traffic controllers union.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen is quick to point out that it was an illegal strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my stripes,'' he said, adding that he has
had disagreements with Reagan's politics over the years.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen also points out that it's not inconsistent to be a
Republican and a union leader. About 40 percent of union members
are Republicans, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his relatives are retired UAW members.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen was born near Flint, Mich., and raised in the Houston
area. He graduated from Houston Baptist College with a history
degree and worked in corporate communications for a Houston
hospital for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen then took a radio job in Albuquerque with KIVA-AM/FM
as a producer and salesman.
</P>
<P>
   His timing in joining America West didn't work out so well.
Within two years, the company filed for bankruptcy. McGlashen had
to take a 10 percent pay cut and his 60 shares of company stock
became worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's union president, McGlashen said he is used to the
ebb and flow of the job, which is similar to what he experienced in
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Once he leaves office, McGlashen is eager to return to flying a
``normal schedule'' as a flight attendant and returning to work
part time at the Poisoned Pen, a Scottsdale mystery bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has an interest in running for the state
Legislature from Tempe's District 27. &QL;

YOU ARE THERE: MEDIA CIRCUS MAXIMUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's March 15 _ ``The Ides of March are come.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Caesar's famous boast to the Soothsayer in William
Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar.'' (``Ay, Caesar, but not gone,'' the
clever devil, who had warned Caesar to beware, shot back.)
</P>
<P>
   The ides are nothing more than the 15th day of March, May, July
and October, and the 13th day of other months. But March 15 marks
the date of one of history's most famous murders _ Caesar's, at the
hands of Brutus and his cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   How word was spread to the rest of the world back in 44 B.C.
isn't known. But if the murder took place today, it's easy to
imagine the media firestorm:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CNN: (Logo with bloody dagger and fallen garland; voice-over
read by James Earl Jones _ `` Rome in Crisis: The murder of
Caesar.'') ``Romans are in a state of shock today after the murder
of dictator for life Julius Caesar. Caesar, a military hero and
successful author, was stabbed to death at the Senate. We'll be
back with round-the-sundial coverage, including a panel of experts
debating Caesar's favor with the gods, after these messages. And
don't forget to tune in tonight for our four-hour special:
``Caesar: From veni, vidi, vici to a violent end.'' (Fade to
profile of slain leader, with ``Caesar, C-XLIV B.C.'' written in
black script; somber music plays underneath.)
</P>
<P>
   Rome Today &UR; : ``Dictator for life Julius Caesar was stabbed to
death at the Senate yesterday. A CNN-``Rome Today'' poll taken
minutes afterward finds that 3 percent of those asked think this is
a bad thing for Romans, 2 percent think it's a good thing, and the
other 95 percent are illiterate and didn't know who Caesar was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Local TV news: ``. . . and more sunny weather is expected
tomorrow! In some sad news: Julius Caesar, dictator for life,
apparently has been murdered. News Chariot XII is at the Senate, so
we'll go live to reporter Cassius Dufus. . . . Cassius?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Clarissa. Witnesses here say that Caesar has indeed
been murdered. As you can imagine, this has caused a traffic
nightmare around the Senate building, so if you're planning to pass
this way, you can save time by taking another route. Try the road
by the temple as an alternate. Back to you, Clarissa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good work, Cassius. Love the tunic. So remember, avoid the
Senate building, at least for the next few hours. And now, in more
weather . . .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Local newspaper: ``G. Julius Caesar, Rome's dictator for life,
was murdered by conspirators at the Senate yesterday. In response,
Josephus Arpaio, Rome's self-proclaimed toughest constable, vowed
to form a `Posse Senatus' made up of retired soldiers, farmers and
vagrants to roam the Senate area on horseback armed with swords and
daggers to help prevent other assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   `` `This is not a publicity stunt,' Arpaio said at a hastily
called (by him) news conference. `Neither were the public
floggings, the pink togas for prisoners or the death-by-hungry-lion
punishment for rabble-rousers. Mark my words: In time, you'll
forget this Caesar fellow, but you'll remember me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Edition &UR; : ``He's sexy, he's powerful. Is he in charge? In
the wake of Julius Caesar's tragic murder, Mark Antony's funeral
speech has his name on all Romans' lips. `Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend me your ears'? Women all over Rome are saying,
`We'll lend you more than that, mister!' ``Inside Edition'' brings
you an exclusive profile of the heroic hunk. And coming up
tomorrow: `Cleopatra _ Why Won't the Rumors Die?' ''
</P>
<P>
   20/20 &UR; : ``Tonight, more from Barbarus Walters' exclusive
interview with Calpurnia, Caesar's widow. Up next:
</P>
<P>
   `` `All that badgering, all those omens, all those warnings _
just before your husband's death, you were a pain in the butt!'
</P>
<P>
   `` `You bet. You bet. But (close-up of her wiping away tear) he
was a really good kisser. I feel so cheap.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `If thou were a tree, what tree wouldst thou be?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Larrius Rex Live &UR; : ``Tonight we have a full slate of guests,
including Marcus Brutus, who will explain why he helped stab his
best friend to death, and Mark Antony, who, I understand, has a
different take on the murder. Assassination _ naked ambition or
good career move? We'll take your calls, so don't go away!'' &QL;

SUSPECT REGISTRATIONS OF DOMAIN NAMES ARE PURGED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network Solutions, the company that assigns Internet addresses,
is again trying to curb what it terms abuses of the registration
system by speculators aiming to turn a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently purged 18,000 registrations that it
suspected were held by speculators. In most cases, the company
says, the domain names, as Internet addresses are known, were
registered by people or companies matching the basic profile of a
speculator, meaning they typically had registered thousands of
names at once.
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly every case where a name was purged, the registrant
had not paid for the name on time, giving Network Solutions the
legal right to reclaim it, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were well-known speculators that had registered
thousands of domains names,'' Christopher Clough, a spokesman for
Network Solutions in Herndon, Va., said. Clough said the company
regularly purged delinquent registrations and specifically targeted
domain name speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate attempt to curb domain name speculation last
month, the company announced a new policy of restricting access to
``root zone'' files, which can alert speculators about when a
domain name will become available. Network Solutions said it would
no longer make the files freely available, but instead would
license them for specific purposes. As a result, many businesses
that help companies secure valuable domain name addresses suddenly
found themselves unable to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Woodward, president of Myinternet.com, a registration
services company, was one of them. Last month he discovered his
company suddenly was unable to access the zone files. After he
threatened to file a lawsuit charging the company with
anticompetitive behavior, his access was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions holds a government-backed monopoly in the
registration of the most popular domains. The market is to be
opened to competition later this year.

NAVAJO NATION STRUGGLES TO PRESERVE MEDICINE-MAN TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ For more than 30 years, Jack Jackson has
warned the Navajo Nation that the number of medicine men on the
nation's largest reservation is dwindling. Some ceremonies, he
says, are in danger of being lost forever. Now the tribe is in the
midst of a pilot program that attracted more than 300 applicants
and provides stipends for young Navajos who want to train to be
traditional healers. But Jackson and others are wondering if it's
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that we once had some 300 ceremonies and now that
has gone down to just 29, and many of these are in danger of being
lost,'' said Jackson, a state senator representing the Arizona
portion of the Navajo Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson was working for the now defunct Navajo Health
Authority back in the 1970s, he began pushing the Navajo Nation
Council to address problems about the declining number of medicine
men.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this century, almost every family on
the reservation had at least one member who was a ``hatathli,''``''
who supervised ceremonies and knew the chants and stories.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1970s, when more and more jobs became available on
the reservation, fewer and fewer young Navajos approached older
medicine men to become their apprentices and learn the various
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Dine Spiritual and Cultural Society, which is
composed of many of the reservation's medicine men, said there were
a number of reasons for this trend. One is that being a medicine
man is hard work. Another is that the pay, which averages about
$15,000 annually for a full-time medicine man, wasn't that great.
Much of it came in the form of sheep or jewelry which had to be
resold.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Navajos also objected to the lengthy training period
_ up to 10 years for some of the longer ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal traditions prohibit the taping of ceremonies or taking
notes, so the learning process is the same today as it was hundreds
of years ago _ listening to the complicated chants over and over
again until they are memorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the Tribal Council in the early 1980s to charter
the medicine men's association but they refused, saying that Navajo
ceremonies were a religion and it wouldn't be proper to mix
religion and state,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson and others argued that the ceremonies were not a
religion but a bona fide healing system comparable to the Anglo
medical system.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Tso, who took over Jackson's cause a few years ago when he
joined the tribe's Dine Language and Cultural Office, was finally
able to change enough minds to get a $180,000 grant in 1997 to
establish the first apprenticeship program to train young Navajos
in the traditional healing arts.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which finally got underway in December, attracted
more than 300 applicants. Seven were chosen to take part in the
pilot project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to concentrate on those ceremonies that are in
danger of being lost forever because those who know it are now in
their 60s or 70s,'' Tso said.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides $350 to medicine men who agree to give up
to 24 hours of training a month; the apprentices receive $300 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The big question now is whether the tribal program can turn
things around.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Walters, chairman for Dine studies at Dine College in
Tsaile and one of the most respected traditionalists on the
reservation, said he sees does see a situation where there are
fewer and fewer medicine men serving more and more Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inevitable because of the population explosion,'' he
said. &QL;

FUN BUILDS AS LEGOLAND CALIFORNIA PREPARES TO OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUE DOERFLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It's an Oz-like fantasy world where yellow
bricks _ and red, green and blue ones, too _ predominate. Lego
bricks, that is. Millions of them.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland California opens Saturday, March20, 30 miles north of
San Diego. It's the third Legoland in the world, the first in the
United States. Spread across 128 acres, it's bigger than Disneyland
and just as colorful, in a primary tone sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Lego designers from Billund, Denmark, where the toy was invented
by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932, pieced together the park, using
the actual plastic blocks that are sold in Lego kits in 138
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, who first made them in wood before turning to
plastic in 1947, called them Lego, which is a contraction of the
Danish words ``leg godt,'' meaning ``play well.'' And, in Latin,
Lego means ``I put together'' or ``I assemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other theme parks that have their share of adult thrill
rides, the $130 million Legoland California is designed for the
younger set, those ages 2 to 12, the ages of most Lego users.
</P>
<P>
   For the $32 adult and $25 child admission price, visitors are
treated to a few rides, some that even all ages will like, but the
main attractions are the 5,000 phenomenal Lego models scattered
throughout the park.
</P>
<P>
   It took 2 million Lego bricks and months to create the 9-foot
tall, 34-foot-long red dinosaur near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein's brain power takes on new proportions in the
Imagination Zone area: 1.2 million gray bricks were used in the
15{-foot-tall representation of his head that fronts one of the
buildings. The 19-foot-tall black and gray animated tyrannosaurus
rex towering nearby required 1 million bricks.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it's called Miniland, this area, a one-twentieth
scale re-creation of the Manhattan skyline, Washington, D.C., San
Francisco, New Orleans and a New England harbor, is made of 20
million bricks. The Empire State Building alone is 200,000 bricks.
The U.S. Capitol required 380,792.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers building horses, bridges and skyscrapers
with Legos as a child could spend hours looking at these creations.
</P>
<P>
   There are gray Lego brick elephants that spray water through
their trunks. Well-fed-looking zebras with black and white zigzags.
Red flamingos. Yes, red. Pink isn't in the Lego brick color
palette.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials could take out most of the rides and add more
models, and most Legomaniacs wouldn't even notice. Visitors still
would be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The model possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102,981,500 ways to combine six 8-stud bricks of the
same color. Three 8-stud bricks can be combined in 1,060 ways.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern California location means fitting in with the
surroundings, thus, there are a few rides, mainly slow-moving ones,
such as a boat ride and a safari-car ride. The roller coaster on
Castle Hill, while faster than other rides at the park, still is no
match for those at Six Flags or even a state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Montgomery, vice president of park operations, is quick to
point out that Legoland California's atmosphere is different than
that of amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about racing up to the next ride,'' he said. ``Our
appeal is very different. The scale and magnitude of Disneyland is
what you're impressed with. What is impressive about us is more
subtle. It's a series of little surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the model of a dog and a fire hydrant. Or the Mount
Rushmore model, where two Lego guys are using a Lego Q-tip to clean
one of George Washington's ears. Or the moving marching band that
parades in front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its more relaxed feel, Legoland shouldn't have trouble
attracting visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Name recognition alone is a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're a very strong brand and because we're a park
that has quite a narrow, specific focus, people will travel a lot
farther to come here than to a thrill ride park,'' Montgomery said.
There are many amusement parks, but only one Legoland in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all children have heard of or played with Legos, he said.
The United States ranks second in sales volume for the company,
topped by Germany, where children receive an average of six to
seven kits a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each hour, 2 million Lego bricks are manufactured at factories
in Denmark and the United States. Through 1998, 189 billion Lego
pieces had been molded.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it does with its toys, Lego is promoting family
interaction throughout the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have has some form of interaction and
decision-making,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   On one ride, called Sky Cycle, kids and their parents have to
work together to pedal a colorful, zany-looking car around an
elevated track. At the Kid Power Tower, they sit in outward-facing
seats and pull on a rope to propel themselves up 30 feet to the top
for a view of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the Imagination Zone, kids _ and their parents _ can build
race cars out of Legos, then compete with each other on a downhill
track. At the Driving School ride in the Fun Town area, young kids
drive electric Lego-looking cars around a streetscape, stopping at
signals and yielding to others.
</P>
<P>
   But what about older children and teens who won't be content to
putter along in cars that don't even bump into each other?
</P>
<P>
   Will older teens be bored? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are flatly not looking to attract and don't expect we'll
see many teenagers at the park,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   But some teens will enjoy bringing younger siblings to the park.
And they are certain to enjoy the restaurants, food booths and the
Lego factory tour that shows how the bricks are made and packaged.
They may even pull out their old Lego sets when they return home
and get creative.
</P>
<P>
   And parents and grandparents? They'll be watching or interacting
with the younger set, when they're not marveling at all the amazing
Lego models. &QL;

ALBANY FACES A NEW REALITY: A LATE BUDGET MEANS LATE PAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One of the most emotionally charged questions
before the state Legislature these days has nothing to do with
welfare, taxes, crime or any other major policy matter. It centers
on a far more personal concern: whether lawmakers will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law enacted late last year, the state must withhold pay
for all 211 members of the Legislature if they fail to approve a
new state budget by April 1, the start of the new fiscal year. The
paychecks of each member will be held in escrow for as long as it
takes both houses of the Legislature to approve a new budget and
send it to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the only one of its kind in the nation, was adopted at
the insistence of Gov. George Pataki, who has presided over the
latest budgets in state history, much to his chagrin _ since he
pledged to deliver timely budgets. In return for approving the
bill, Pataki agreed to give lawmakers a coveted pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   To many lawmakers, the trade seemed like a good idea at the
time, given that they had not had a salary increase in a decade.
But now, with the April 1 deadline approaching and budget
negotiations deadlocked, the policy has stirred protest and concern
in the Legislature, particularly among members who voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, many are bracing for the worst, prepared to take loans
or dip into savings to meet mortgage payments, rents and other
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are genuinely concerned about their family finances,''
said Richard Gottfried, a Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan who
voted against the measure. ``For many members, this is their sole
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the practical concerns, many people inside and outside
the Legislature complain that the new law is akin to extortion,
maintaining that it could seriously impair the Legislature's
ability to do its job impartially.
</P>
<P>
   What of lawmakers who oppose the budget? Should they feel forced
to approve it because their livelihoods hang in the balance, the
critics ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this law is allowed to stand,'' said Alexander Grannis, a
Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan who voted against the
measure, ``people will never be able to know for sure whether their
legislator signed off on a budget because it was the right budget
or because they were worried about getting paid and taking care of
their families. This law is bad government, and it is bad policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The irritation is not limited to Democrats. Sen. James Lack, a
Republican from Long Island, suggested that the public was
inconsistent by clamoring for on-time budgets while demanding that
lawmakers fight to keep funds for particular projects in the
budget. He said the no-pay policy was making the job of legislating
all the more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think legislators should be put in the position of
making those decisions with that sword of Damocles over their
heads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say they doubt that the policy would force lawmakers
to compromise their principles. Rather, they say, the policy should
help prevent negotiations from becoming stalled for weeks, perhaps
months, by partisan posturing, as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that we can't agree to in April that we have
to wait until August to do,'' said Nicholas Spano, a Republican
from Westchester County who voted for the new law. ``The bottom
line is that we have a job to do, and that job is to pass a
budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Late budgets have not always been the rule in Albany. Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller, a Republican, had the cooperation of
Republican-dominated Legislatures for most of his 14 years in
office, insuring that most of his budgets were adopted on time.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed in 1974, when a Democrat, Hugh Carey, was
elected governor and the Democrats took control of the Assembly.
Democrats have held the Assembly ever since, while the Senate has
remained in the hands of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That political divide has made it almost impossible for a budget
to be adopted by the April 1 deadline. Since 1975, Carey's first
year in office, the budget has been late 20 times: six times under
Carey, 10 times under Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, and four times under
Pataki, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation has been particularly embarrassing for Pataki,
because he vowed to put an end to Albany's record of tardy budgets
when he took office. In 1995, in his first year in office, Pataki
tried to withhold the pay of state legislators and their aides
until the budget was passed. But his efforts were successfully
challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he has the law on his side. And that has spurred
protests from lawmakers who accuse Pataki of having displayed
arrogance and contempt for the Legislature's authority when in
December he linked their raises to the no-pay policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has a personal contempt for the Legislature, and
he is entitled to that,'' said Richard Brodsky, a Democratic
assemblyman from Westchester. ``But it is regrettable when he
attempts to undermine the constitutional role of the Legislature.
It is un-American to attempt to influence people on issues
affecting the public by putting at risk their personal
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it is strange to hear that Brodsky voted for the
measure. How does he explain that? ``I'm prepared to forgo my pay
if I can't in good conscience vote for the budget,'' he said. ``I
am not going to expend any political capital fighting the governor
on that issue. I have bigger fish to fry in the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of Brodsky's colleagues were far more cynical. One
lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that he and
other members voted for the measure, figuring that they would
challenge its constitutionality in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe this law will stand up in court,'' the member
said. ``But I'm not going to vote against it at the same time I'm
voting to give myself a raise. That may sound cynical. But it's a
matter of political survival.''

PHOENIX-AREA SKIES ARE JAMMED, AIR PORTS SPUR FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ To the layman, the Phoenix area's flyway chart _ a sky
map for pilots _ is a confusing quilt of circles and arrows, dotted
lines and cryptic symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But a warning, found on the inside flap, is plain enough: The
skies may be friendly, but they sure are crowded.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, more and more planes are flying out
of the Phoenix area's general aviation airports, which are on a
collision course with urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Around the airports, sagebrush and sidewinders have given way to
tile roofs and swing sets. Census figures show the population is
growing steadily, right along with the air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   With more planes flying over more houses, neighborhood activists
say it's only a matter of time before tragedy strikes, and a plane
crashes in a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing that hasn't happened,'' said Don
Hopkins, a Scottsdale resident who has battled the city over
airport noise. ``There have been crashes, but they haven't been
severe enough yet for elected officials to understand there is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, two planes collided near Scottsdale Municipal
Airport, killing two men and peppering an apartment complex and a
golf course with debris.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a plane in a mock dogfight failed to pull out of a
dive and crashed in the desert northwest of Phoenix, killing two.
At least one witnesses observed the crash from the parking lot of
an outlet mall.
</P>
<P>
   In February, high winds dragged a hot-air balloon across
rooftops in Peoria, seriously injuring a passenger and damaging two
homes. Since October, four F-16s flying out of Luke Air Force Base
have crashed near the increasingly populated area, prompting the
base commander to briefly ground his 212 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials note that crashes are fairly rare, and say
safety really doesn't really drive the encroachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying is dangerous,'' said Deer Valley Municipal Airport
Manager Walt Fix, ``because you have to drive to the airport to get
to your airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The key issue, they say, is aircraft noise, which spawns
hundreds of complaints from residents whose homes are beneath the
flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Airport executives take those complaints seriously, mostly
because they can be fatal to small airports. According to a
national aviation group, some 50 to 70 small airports close each
year, and encroachment is the No. 1 reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airports that take the approach `We were here first' are
playing a very short-term game,'' said Scottsdale airport Manager
John Kinney, ``and they'll lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials employ multiple tactics to deal with
encroachment: meeting with residents, encouraging low-density
development and sometimes buying land to block new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   There are also laws that require builders to tell prospective
home buyers about airports, though they don't always work. People
continue to buy homes near airports, some knowingly, some not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a gal on the phone a few months ago, and she literally
was crying because she realized she was too close to the airport
after she built a custom home,'' said Mark Meyers, manager of
Falcon Field in Mesa. ``She didn't realize we were here, and she's
three-quarters of a mile away from the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   As sprawl continues in once-remote areas of Maricopa County,
skirmishes have flared up between homeowners and airports:
</P>
<P>
   In Gilbert, residents are suing U.S. Homes, alleging that the
developer did not disclose the impact of Williams Gateway Airport.
Traffic has steadily increased at the airport, which has been
touted as a future alternative to Sky Harbor for cargo and
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler, the city will ask voters to approve a controversial
plan to lengthen the runway at the city airport. Residents who
oppose the plan say the city's ultimate goal is to attract larger
corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, airport officials abandoned plans for a second
runway, mostly because of noise concerns. The city recently bought
200 acres just south of the airport to stop a development that
would have put 600 homes a stone's throw from the runway. Airports
officials have also restricted training flights at night.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, city officials ended a bitter fight by buying about 134
acres that buffered the residents of Red Mountain Ranch from TRW
Inc., a helicopter plant and nearby Falcon Field.
</P>
<P>
   As those fights play themselves out, the number of people living
near Phoenix-area airports continues to grow, according to census
figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Falcon Field, air traffic has increased 50
percent since 1988. Between 1990 and 1995, the population around
the airport rose 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic at Glendale Municipal Airport has risen 24 percent since
1998. Meanwhile, the population near the airport grew by 142
percent from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the smaller airports has siphoned small air
traffic away from Sky Harbor, leaving more room for larger planes.
General aviation at Sky Harbor dropped 33 percent between 1988 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Johnston, a Sky Harbor spokeswoman and pilot, said small
airports are just ``easier and quicker'' for general aviation
pilots to use.
</P>
<P>
   The airports haven't always been in competition with
neighborhoods. When they were first built, they were in the middle
of nowhere. The military, which used them for training, competed
with creosote bushes and the occasional coyote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the evolution of an airport, it starts in an
isolated area,'' Kinney said. ``Development takes place, in part
because of the airport, in part because of businesses located near
the airport, and it has that ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being surrounded by neighborhoods, airports seem
determined to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale and Deer Valley, there are plans to extend or
improve runways, add hangars and attract more businesses. In the
East Phoenix area, both Chandler Municipal and Williams Gateway are
gearing up to grow.
</P>
<P>
   All the airports are big economic engines for the Valley of the
Sun, as the Phoenixarea is known. A recent study by Arizona State
University found that the Scottsdale airport generates about $119.6
million while Williams Gateway adds $113 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the helicopter plant (recently sold by Boeing to MD
Helicopters), Falcon Field generates about $866 million, while Sky
Harbor has an economic impact of $16 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Torres, one of the Gilbert residents who is suing over
Williams Gateway, said he knows why the city wants to expand the
airport and lure cargo and passenger business from Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the money,'' he said. ``They think that this is the
cash cow that's going to save their city bankrolls, that it will
bring in hotels, industry, and high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to turn it off . . . that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Kinney said officials have worked hard to
encourage low density development, such as golf courses and
industrial parks, around the airport. The city also employs a
full-time noise abatement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Residents) see we don't have horns and a tail and we will
work with them,'' Kinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Hopkins writes off such statements as PR.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are employees of the city of Scottsdale, and it's
their business to keep that airport open and operating and making
money,'' Hopkins said. ``And the bottom of their list is noise
abatement and safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler, George Tandy Cook III says the city airport was
nothing more than a small strip when he moved into his log home in
1986. City officials told him it was going to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one runway, and they didn't have any tower at
all,'' Cook said. ``They didn't have a fence around it. We used to
ride horses on the runway, and sit out there for hours waiting for
a plane to land.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Today, there's a heliport about 100 yards
from Cook's home, though the city has promised to move it.
</P>
<P>
   The little airstrip has grown up into a thriving airport with
nearly 200,000 takeoffs and landings each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't want jets, they just want a bigger
runway,'' Cook said. ``We know that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fix, Deer Valley's manager, says growth is inevitable around
airports, no matter how hard government officials try to manage it.
Even in the once-isolated area around Deer Valley, neighborhoods
are springing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously can't stretch our arms out beyond our land use
boundaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While builders are required to disclose the airport's location
to home buyers, the airport still gets plenty of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become more and more of an issue over the last four and
half years,'' Fix said. ``As the residential areas grow near the
airport like they have, we get more complaint calls . . . and calls
from prospective home buyers wanting to to know more about the
airport before they purchase a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley continues to expand. The airport plans to spend $15
million to build new hangars, remodel the terminal and reconstruct
the south runway.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing compared with business owners, who are preparing
for the arrival of the Outer Loop, which will slice through the
area in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been incredible,'' Fix said. ``Even right across the
street on Deer Valley Road, we have businesses going in, in all the
infill lots across the street, from 19th Avenue to Seventh
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney, the Scottsdale airport manager, says Barry Goldwater
summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You can take an airport and build it in the absolute
middle of the Sahara Desert, and within five years, you'll be
completely surrounded by homes. I guarantee it.' '' &QL;

RIVAL STUDIOS FIND IT USELESS TO RESIST, SURENDER MAY TO DARTH
SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Do you dare compete against the Force?
</P>
<P>
   With ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' a clear threat
to demolish ``Titanic's'' worldwide box office record of $1.8
billion, other studios must now answer that agonizing question.
</P>
<P>
   No one at last week's ShoWest convention of the nation's theater
owners expressed the remotest concern over how the fourth ``Star
Wars'' movie will do. Instead, the big worry is whether moviegoers
will attend any other film after the epic opens May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult to compete because `Star Wars' is
clearly going to appeal across all demographics,'' said analyst Dan
Marks of ACNielsen EDI. ``These are very tough decisions, because
there are millions of dollars at stake. That's why studio
executives get paid well.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Episode I'' is the most anticipated movie since ``Gone
With the Wind,'' rival studios face the prospect of being unable to
take advantage of the usual late spring to midsummer spike in
moviegoing. Should they plow ahead with typical star-driven
``tentpole'' films or throw in the towel and avoid a direct
confrontation?
</P>
<P>
   The early answer: Everyone is getting out of the way. Studios
have already decided to hold blockbuster candidates until June 11,
when New Line's ``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' opens
and Paramount rolls out the John Travolta thriller ``The General's
Daughter.'' Business will start returning to normal on June 18 with
Disney's ``Tarzan,'' Universal's Julia Roberts comedy ``Notting
Hill'' and Paramount's ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   But this summer's only other candidate for mega-hit status _ a
film able to appeal to all audiences _ won't open until July 2,
when Warner Bros. rolls out ``Wild Wild West,'' a reunion of ``Men
In Black'' star Will Smith and director Barry Sonnenfeld. If a
studio opens anything before then, it's going to be targeted at a
well-defined niche audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear from insiders is there's absolutely no question
the new `Star Wars' will surpass `Titanic' domestically and
worldwide,'' said Dan Klusmann, publisher of the Independent
Marketing Edge newsletter, during an interview at ShoWest. ``The
new trailer looked extremely impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are opportunities. Only one in nine of the nation's
34,000 screens will be occupied by the tale of Luke Skywalker's
father. That's because 20th Century Fox, which has generated $1.8
billion in worldwide box office from three previous ``Star Wars''
movies, and director George Lucas have promised not to take every
screen possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early plans are for the studio to place the movie in 3,800 to
4,000 screens _ far short of the 7,000-plus Sony used for
``Godzilla'' last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could probably sell out all 20 screens if we could put the
new `Star Wars' on every single screen,'' said John King Jr.,
manager of Pacific's Winnetka All-Stadium 20 in suburban Los
Angeles. ``It will clearly monopolize our biggest auditoriums for
quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic view is that many of those wanting to see
``Episode I'' will settle for other films. ``The new `Star Wars' is
not a menace _ it is the greatest catalyst for moviegoing ever,''
said Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane. ``Once you start it
rolling, people are going to be drawn to the movies. If you have a
trailer placed before `Star Wars,' you're going to reap huge
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Viane, recalling his days in the exhibition business, said, ``We
used to notice that every time we got a line in front of the
theater, it would always get longer but if there wasn't a line, you
couldn't pay people to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's strategy will be similar to its 1996 campaign for
``Phenomenon,'' which surprised everyone by taking in more than
$100 million domestically even though it opened against
``Independence Day.'' Viane said the studio will aim at older
moviegoers in its push for ``Instinct,'' an adventure-drama
starring Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. due out June 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can attract the people who don't need the instant
gratification of seeing `Episode I' during its first month,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But King, whose theater is among the top 10 grossers nationwide,
admitted he is skeptical. ``What everyone is hoping for is that
there will be a spillover effect,'' King noted. ``But then, there's
not a lot else opening around `Star Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Borys, president of ACNielsen EDI, warned that studios may
be making a mistake to give ``Episode I'' so much space. ``If you
don't take the risk, holding back can become a self-fulfilling
prophecy,'' he said.

LAS VEGAS: prophecy,'' he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Borys noted that during the Atlanta Olympics, studios scheduled
second-tier movies in fear that Americans would be watching the
Games instead of going to movies. ``A Time to Kill,'' one of the
few movies released during the Olympics, became the only movie with
significant business. ``You can counter-program,'' he added. ``You
can't just give up the whole summer to `Star Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Five studios have already given a wide berth to ``Star Wars:''
</P>
<P>
   -- Warner Bros. is releasing nothing after April 23's opening of
the David Spade comedy ``Lost and Found'' until July 2 when ``Wild
Wild West,'' the early favorite to take in the summer's
second-highest gross.
</P>
<P>
   -- Paramount's schedule is vacant from April 23, when it opens
``Election,'' until its June 11 roll-out of ``The General's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Disney is taking a cautious approach with a slate that's
empty for more than two months, between March 31's comedy-drama
``Ten Things I Hate About You'' to June 4's ``Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   -- New Line's slate is empty from April 30, when it rolls out
beauty-queen comedy ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' (formerly ``Dairy
Queens''), until June 11 when ``Austin Powers II'' opens.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fox's slate, understandably, is clear except for ``Episode
I'' during May and June. On April 30, it opens the action-thriller
``Entrapment''; on July 9, it debuts ``The Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Other majors will take a more direct approach:
</P>
<P>
   -- DreamWorks has decided to go mano-a-mano with the Force,
opening romantic comedy ``The Love Letter'' with Kate Capshaw two
days after ``Episode One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thinking is that the primary demographic will be women on
what will be a huge weekend,'' said distribution chief James Tharp.
``We think `The Love Letter' will do well enough for us to expand
it in the following weeks. There should be plenty of screens
available.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks will not open another film until July 23, with ``The
Haunting of Hill House.''
</P>
<P>
   -- MGM will open drama-adventure ``One Man's Hero'' on May 7 and
long-shelved comedy ``The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave'' on May
14. The troubled studio will also roll out an updated version of
``The Thomas Crown Affair'' with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo on
June 4.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sony has placed action-thriller ``Arlington Road,'' in which
Jeff Bridges' character discovers his neighbor is a terrorist, on
May 14. Two weeks later, it opens horror-thriller ``Thirteenth
Floor.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Universal has high hopes for its update of Boris Karloff's
1932 classic, ``The Mummy,'' opening May 7 with Brendan Fraser. It
will debut ``American Pie,'' an ensemble comedy about high
schoolers vowing to lose their virginity, on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   What has the best shot of challenging ``Wild Wild West'' for the
summer's No. 2 spot? Early betting is on ``Austin Powers II,''
which received a strong response after New Line showed its latest
trailer at ShoWest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not an `Austin Powers' fan, but my son made me watch the
video of the original, and now I think the sequel is going to do a
lot better,'' Klusmann said. The 1997 comedy hit $53 million
domestically; marketing chief Al Shapiro told ShoWest the studio is
planning on ``many shag-eriffic sequels.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be counted out is Disney, which is gearing up for
``Tarzan'' and the July 23 release of ``Inspector Gadget.'' Viane
noted both will be able to take advantage of the strong uptick in
family moviegoing during the summer, adding, ``For families during
the summer, every day is a holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has already noticed ``Tarzan.'' A ``unanimously
strong positive'' response at ShoWest led analyst Stewart Halpern
of ING Barings Furman Selz to repeat his ``buy'' rating on Disney
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Disney took the unusual step of showing ShoWest attendees a
nearly completed version of ``Tarzan'' followed by an hour-long
concert by Phil Collins, who is providing the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think `Tarzan' is going to be big,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source tracking service. ``It's oriented
toward teen-agers, but it's going to bring in all audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Other summer break-out contenders include Sony's ``Big Daddy''
with Adam Sandler, due June 25; a pair of Julia Roberts comedies,
``Notting Hill'' and Paramount's ``Runaway Bride'' on July 30; and
the most mysterious movie in many years, the late Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' due July 16 from Warner. &QL;

FOR SOME, RACE IS A STROLL(ER) IN THE PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Ramseyer knows he could have shaved almost an
hour off his time in the L.A. Marathon, if not for that extra 100
pounds in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Ramseyer, of La Canada, was just one of a record 20,630
(unofficial) to run in Sunday's 14th L.A. Marathon at his own pace.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete against time, the 40-year old prefers to
share it with his two children, who accompany their father in a
double-stroller designed for such an occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Ramseyer, who says he used to run the event in less than three
hours, has pushed Cole, 4, in his stroller at the past four L.A.
Marathons. For the past two, they've been joined by sister Lauren,
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of fun,'' Ramseyer said of his eldest. ``They
usually take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ramseyer, running his 12th marathon, comes prepared for
nearly everything. Attached to the back of the aerodynamic stroller
_ fitted with one large, spoked wheel in front and two in back _ is
a compartment which houses the essentials: water, food, toys,
chocolate milk and ``a cell phone, in case we need mom,'' Ramseyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Atmosphere: The main reason spectators Jim and Chris Roberts of
Orange County came to the L.A. Marathon was to root for their
daughter, Heather.
</P>
<P>
   For Jim and Chris, the icing was the marathon's festive climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time you get to walk around downtown L.A.
without any traffic,'' Jim Roberts said. ``It's a big street scene,
it's meeting people, watching all the fun costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Costumes were many in number, with one runner donning a gold
cape and clown mask. Others simply painted their hair loud colors,
while still another juggled five balls during the race.
</P>
<P>
   And, in true L.A. fashion, there was no shortage of runners
talking on their cellular phones during the event.
</P>
<P>
   I will survive: For Frank Vasquez, 63, Sunday's race marked his
51st marathon. He has competed in all but one L.A. Marathon,
missing it in 1996 through no fault of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got run over by a car while training two weeks before (the
marathon),'' said Vasquez, of City of Commerce. ``It was very
disappointing; I go to them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring: There was the man who had a roller skate on his only
leg while pushing himself along with crutches and the blind man
being walked by two volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   While the elite marathoners attracted the crowds, those who
overcame obstacles drew the spectators' attention and admiration.
One elite runner, Kenya's Christopher Cheboiboch, did both.
</P>
<P>
   Stricken with malaria only 10 days prior to Sunday, Cheboiboch
led throughout much of the race but was overtaken by fellow
countryman Simon Bor, who shattered the course record en route to
victory. Cheboiboch finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the diet to eat, I feel restless; I couldn't go
through training as usual,'' Cheboiboch said. ``As you know, when
you don't eat anything, you lose a lot of weight. My body is so
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Said L.A. Marathon president William Burke of Cheboiboch's
performance: ``I had malaria when I was working in Africa ... it
hits you like a baseball bat. It was a heroic, heroic effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Local talent: Runners from the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and
Antelope valleys fared well, with Glendale's Jose Luis Arriaga
(2:25.35) finishing in 17th place. Also from Glendale, Alvaro
Morales (2:29.26) took 21st place.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Country's Brian Spangenberg (2:34.43) and Chuck Teixeira
(2:41.21) finished 32nd and 56th; Sylmar's Roberto Leonardo
(2:35.28), Martin Garcia (2:38.10) and Jose Luis Acuchi (2:38.20)
took 36th, 44th and 45th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Ruiz (2:39.57), of Van Nuys, finished 49th and Palmdale's
Gustavo Mercado (2:45.21) came in 66th.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women, La Canada's Marie Romero (2:59.54) finished in
13th place.

BRAZILIAN ECONOMIST KILLED IN WALDORF-ASTORIA ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man killed Saturday at the Waldorf-Astoria was
identified Sunday as a well-to-do Brazilian economist who ran
agricultural projects in the Amazon rain forest, owned a popular
antiques store and traveled the world several times a year, the
police and his relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was Joao Saboia, 56, a resident of Belem, a city on
the northern coast of Brazil. His throat was slashed and his face
was badly cut and bruised, the police said. They refused to provide
details about Saboia or the circumstances of his death, but in a
telephone interview from Belem, his nephew, Carlos Saboia, 32, said
the police told relatives that about $50,000 was missing from the
hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He traveled all over the world, at least five times a year,''
Carlos Saboia said. ``But he really loved New York. That makes this
even more sad, because it happened in his favorite city.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not unusual for Saboia to travel with a lot of cash, his
nephew said. He said his uncle had stopped in New York on his way
to Atlantic City, where he was well known as a high-stakes gambler
and was often invited as a special guest by casino managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police told us that whoever did this had a fight with my
uncle and then took everything,'' Carlos Saboia said. ``They said
that they did not know who did it, but that it could have been
someone who works at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Joao Saboia was single and had no children, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   His eldest brother died of cancer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to recuperate from my father's death, and now
this,'' Carlos Saboia said. ``We are just in total shock. Everyone
loved my uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives described Joao Saboia as a ``very influential
economist,'' and they said that he and his staff advised
corporations interested in establishing farming or industrial
projects in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Saboia said the police told the family that they
discovered Saboia's body about 5:30 p.m. Saturday after travel
companions reported that they had not seen him for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   When officers went to his room, a ``Do Not Disturb'' sign was
hanging on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives also were told that this was the second attack within
a year at the Waldorf-Astoria, visited by the world's most
prominent dignitaries and long a symbol of New York's opulence.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a 37-year-old guest was injured in a stabbing by a
homeless youth he had invited to his room.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they had no suspects in Saboia's killing
and had made no arrests. An operator at the Waldorf-Astoria said
the manager would not speak about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Saboia's relatives are scheduled to arrive in New York Tuesday _
to discuss the slaying with the police and hotel officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know what happened,'' Carlos Saboia said.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the hotel expressed shock about the killing in their
midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about walking last night to make a show,'' said
Sue Schmitt, of New Albany, Ind., who spent Saturday evening at
``The Phantom of the Opera.'' ``But I guess I was really safer on
the streets than I was in the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Mrs. Schmitt was her daughter Julia. They had
come to New York to celebrate Julia's 13th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really scary,'' Julia said, referring to the killing. ``I
had nightmares all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipping beer and Jack Daniels in the lobby bar Sunday, Kathy and
Bob Foster of Dallas seemed to shrug off the incident after hearing
about it from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend not to worry about things,'' said Foster, 77, decked
out in a pinstripe suit with a striped tie and matching
handkerchief. ``When you're old, most people are really nice to
you.''

KENTUCKY WILL GET A CHANCE TO SEE WALLY'S WORLD  
</HEADLINE>

 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Wally Szczerbiak sat on a table in Miami of Ohio's
locker room when it was over, his right knee wrapped in ice as he
leaned against a wall. The 43-point man of Friday had a sweet
encore Sunday, and he clearly wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, when I'm healthy, I feel like there's not too many
people can stop me,'' Szczerbiak said after the 10th-seeded
Redhawks' 66-58 victory over second-seeded Utah in a Midwest
Regional second-round game at the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I'm in my game and our team's playing our game,''
said the 6-foot-8-inch, 243-pound senior forward, ``then we're a
team to contend with.''
</P>
<P>
   The player they call Wally's World again made the NCAA
tournament his personal stage. ``I just let the game come to me,''
the Long Island native said after a distinctive show of versatility
_ 24 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two blocked shots and a
pair of steals.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Szczerbiak took 33 of his team's 55 shots in Friday's
victory over Washington, Sunday he rationed himself to 11 of 46.
Instead of a shot machine, he became the base from which other
noteworthy things came from.
</P>
<P>
   The focus Utah placed on him helped forward John Estick free up
inside for 18 points and Jason Stewart free up outside to hit four
crucial 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   And then when the Redhawks needed Szczerbiak the most, he
responded with 16 second-half points, as Miami overcame a
three-point halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like in some respects I played better today than I did
the other day,'' said Szczerbiak, who is from Cold Spring Harbor,
N.Y. ``I was forced to work harder to make some things happen. I
wasn't used to being so open the other night. This is a little more
like the games I've been going through during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time for the Redhawks (24-7) among the
tournament's final 16 teams. They play Kentucky, a tense 92-88
overtime winner over Kansas in Sunday's second game, in St. Louis
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (28-5), which had a 23-game winning streak snapped, looked
strong inside in jumping to a 24-13 lead 13 minutes 31 seconds into
the game despite a swollen left hand that hampered its all-America
guard Andre Miller (20 points). The Redhawks called a timeout and
there wasn't much positive going on in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had any confidence,'' Szczerbiak said. ``We needed
someone to pull us out of the dumps and get us going again.''
</P>
<P>
   That someone happened to be Stewart, a substitute swingman who
is the classic example of the guy who never saw a shot he didn't
like. He came in and made the first trio of 3-pointers he
attempted. Suddenly Miami was back in it.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Redhawks will try to buck the tradition and talent of
Kentucky (27-8).
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats needed sterling performances from their three
seniors _ Scott Padgett, 29 points; Wayne Turner, 19, and Heshimu
Evans, 14 _ to advance.
</P>
<P>
   They were down by five with just 1:08 left in regulation. Then
Turner made a pair of free throws and Padgett hit a 3-pointer with
19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The defending national champions asserted themselves in
overtime, led by Padgett's seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sort of willed ourselves to this win,'' Padgett
said. ``We weren't ready to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who set an NCAA record Sunday by playing in his 149th
career game, is trying to become the first non-Duke player to
compete in his fourth Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   This game pitted the collegiate game's two winningest programs
of the 1990'. The difference was that Kentucky has won two national
titles during that span to Kansas' zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the pride and satisfaction that you competed, and the
kids gave it everything they had,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said.
``But it all hurts the same in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Redhawks hope the fun is just starting. ``We're
trying on the glass slipper,'' Szczerbiak said smilingly of his
team's Cinderella tag. ``I'll say this: When you can beat a team
like Utah, obviously you've got to be a good team. We're going to
see how far we can take this.'' &QL;

NEW USE FOR AN OLD FACTORY LIFTS A CITY'S HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEACON, N.Y. _ From the Depression through the booming 1980s,
crowds of men and women wearing blue coveralls thronged each day to
the sprawling factory on the riverfront here. Around the clock they
printed, cut and folded colorful cartons for Ritz crackers,
Milk-Bone dog biscuits, Oreo cookies and other products of what
once was National Biscuit Co.
</P>
<P>
   The presses rumbled so loudly, former workers recall, that a
teen-age worker named Sally, with a nice soprano voice, used to
sing her lungs out at one bench but could be heard only by the
three women standing next to her.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of years, crowds will return to the glass-roofed
brick building after its decade of dormancy. But this time, they
will most likely be wearing stylish black. The industrial clang of
old will be replaced by studied silence as visitors shuffle past
sculptures of glowing fluorescent tubes and rust-orange slabs of
steel, 450-foot-long pieces of Andy Warhol pop art and century-old
Hudson River landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, the Dia Center for the Arts, a private group that
exhibits art in converted New York City warehouses, in the high
desert of New Mexico, at a firehouse in the Hamptons and at other
unorthodox sites around the United States, announced plans to
create a giant new museum in the old factory building _ with nearly
twice the gallery space of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The site is 50 miles north of New York City on the east bank of
the Hudson River, a few steps from the Metro-North train stop.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the factory reflect the changing fortunes of
Beacon and the Hudson River Valley. Prosperity used to come from
riverside docks, railroad lines and the harnessed energy of
tumbling tributaries. Now local officials and business owners hope
it will return in the form of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   For Beacon, the museum should provide the final impetus for
renewal, said Clara Lou Gould, the mayor of this city of 13,000
people, which has no hotels and only one bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The city, with a racially diverse mixture of middle-class and
poor families, has long labored to emerge from a postindustrial
slumber that has left the river end of Main Street largely boarded
up. A recent wave of renovations of Victorian homes has helped.
Then, several years ago, came ``Nobody's Fool,'' a Paul Newman film
that injected money and revived interest a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has happened on a scale like this, Ms. Gould said.
The art center predicts that the museum will draw 60,000 to 70,000
visitors a year once it opens in the spring of 2001. ``It's kind of
mind-boggling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The factory's previous owner, International Paper Co., had been
trying to sell it for several years, with an asking price of about
$2 million. Ms. Gould said there had been inquiries from a
fish-farming company and other businesses, but nothing seemed
promising until a year ago, when the Dia center first considered
the site as a home for most of its extensive art collection. In the
collection are many unwieldy works, including a series of steel
shapes by Richard Serra weighing a total of 750 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Govan, the director of the art center, recalled how he
followed the factory watchman into the main printing hall, with its
football-field breadth and acres of glass skylights facing north _
designed so the printers had the best light.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in that door,'' Govan said, ``my initial
reaction was, if I were going to build a museum from scratch, I
would build it just like this. Concrete and steel. Wood floors.
Space between columns. Perfect light. A Metro-North train stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Dia's staff had been considering other buildings as far afield
as North Adams, Mass., but nothing compared to this, he said,
adding, ``The whole thing was clear in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there were also buckets and drums brimming with water that
dripped from the roof, warped floorboards, broken windows, and
walls shedding so many flakes of paint that they resembled a
Jackson Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, within a few days, Govan began praising the site to
trustees and Dia's stable of artists. In the final deal, the
building is being donated by the paper company. Most of the
estimated $20 million cost of transforming the 70-year-old
structure into a museum will be paid through donations, with about
$2.8 million coming from state and local economic development and
arts programs, Govan said.

shops and bakeries have sprouted over the last few years, the
museum was just about the only topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   A few residents bemoaned the loss of about $25,000 a year in
property taxes from the 26-acre factory tract once it is owned by a
nonprofit group. But many merchants echoed the views of Mayor Gould
about the economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Wicklow, a co-owner of the Little Pie Shop and the
president of the Beacon Business Association, said the Dia center
had shown a commitment to public schools in New York City. ``Now,
schools here will have this in their own back yard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Beacon's other art institution, the Tallix Foundry, the staff
said the museum would perfectly complement its work. As he wove his
way through a crazy assemblage of giant and tiny bronzes of horses,
heroes, frogs, eagles and abstractions, Peter Homestead, the
president of Tallix, said museum visitors would also want to see
the foundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they can go and see the pieces hanging on the wall,'' he
said. ``Here they can see them being made. It's a perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, the 540-foot-long printing plant, with
stalks of milkweed sprouting from its foundation, remains a ghostly
vestige of the past. It fell on hard times in the mid-1980s, when
Nabisco merged with the R.J. Reynolds tobacco conglomerate to
become RJR Nabisco, began trimming costs and sold the plant, former
employees said. In 1991, the large bronze main doors closed
forever. A few years later, the doors themselves were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Now rail tracks come to a dead end at an empty loading dock.
Clocks on different floors are stopped at different hours. In the
high-ceilinged basement, echoes bounce cathedral-like through a
forest of more than 100 soaring concrete columns. ``This is where
they used to teach you how to drive a forklift,'' said Arcangelo
Formichelli, the factory's 63-year-old watchman, who ran printing
presses there from 1957 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, he walked across the broad wooden floor of the cutting
and creasing room, and then pointed to the spot where women once
put the little red strings on the boxes of Animal Crackers shaped
like circus railroad cars. Near the workers' entrance, he paused by
a row of lockers covered in peeling paint, saying, ``This one was
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was tough to watch a building that was so important
to the community slide into disrepair. ``This place bought me two
houses and helped me raise six kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He professed no familiarity with modern art, certainly not with
the works of some of the artists in the Dia collection, like the
earth-filled rooms of Walter De Maria.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not matter, he said. ``One way or the other,''
Formichelli said, ``it'll be great to see this building open up
again.''

RUTGERS RUNS PAST ARIZONA AND INTO THE ROUND OF 16 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ The seedings, the national rankings and a
little insight said Rutgers should have beaten Arizona Sunday night
in the second round of the NCAA women's tournament. But this
easily? By a runaway score of 90-47?
</P>
<P>
   The game was not yet 12 minutes old and third-seeded Rutgers had
a 29-7 lead. Sixth-seeded Arizona tried to be fast, but Rutgers was
faster, quicker and sharper. By halftime, the score was 41-22, and
early in the second half it reached 56-24.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Sutton-Brown, Rutgers' 6-foot-4-inch sophomore center from
Canada, took quick command of both backboards. Shawnetta Stewart
was deadly from long range, and in a 69-second span in the first
half she hit two 3-pointers and a 14-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had been concerned about injuries to its three starting
guards, but the three _ Stewart (jammed finger), Tomora Young
(swollen disk) and Tasha Pointer (bruised calf) _ showed no signs
of infirmity.
</P>
<P>
   Pointer led Rutgers (28-5) with 18 points, seven assists, six
rebounds and four steals. Young and Stewart had 16 points each, and
Sutton-Brown had 13 points and nine rebounds. Angela Lackey, with
12 points, was Arizona's only player to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy crowd at Rutgers's Louis Brown Athletic Center watched
the Scarlet Knights reach the round of 16 for the second
consecutive year. Last year, Rutgers was eliminated by Tennessee,
the eventual national champion, after winning its first two games.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in the Midwest Regional in Normal, Ill., Rutgers
will face the winner of Monday night's game between second-seeded
Texas Tech (29-3) and 10th-seeded North Carolina State (17-11).
</P>
<P>
   The other regional semifinal will match fourth-seeded North
Carolina (28-7) against the winner of Monday night's game between
top-seeded Purdue (29-1), the nation's No.1 team, and ninth-seeded
Kansas &QC; (23-9). Saturday's winners will meet the next Monday, with
the regional champion advancing to the Final Four on March 26 and
28 in San Jose, Calif.

WILLIAM WARWICK, 86, COMMODORE OF QE2 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commodore William E. Warwick, a grizzled Cunard mariner who
became first master of the last great ocean liner, died in England
on Feb. 27. He was 86 and had commanded the Queen Elizabeth 2 on
her maiden voyage 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the QE2, as the ship is known, sailed into New York harbor
for the first time, on May 7, 1969, Warwick could be forgiven if
his whiskers twitched and his broad chest swelled just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   As he strode the wide bridge in his white uniform, a pair of
binoculars slung around his neck, thousands of well-wishers waved
from the shorelines, fireboats arched welcoming sprays of water
into the air, and a flotilla of tugs, pleasure boats and other
vessels swarmed around the 963-foot liner and trailed in her wake,
sounding their horns and sirens in cacophonous greeting.
</P>
<P>
   What made the greeting seem more poignant was the general
awareness that a decade after the advent of the jet age, the era of
trans-Atlantic ship crossings was drawing to a close, and no other
great ships could be expected to follow the QE2, as indeed they
have not.
</P>
<P>
   If the QE2 was sailing against the winds of change, Warwick (the
second ``w'' is silent) was an ideal choice for command. A man who
insisted on spelling his nickname Bil (``The world is full of Bills
with two L's''), he had begun going against the grain early.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Birkenhead, near Liverpool, where his father was an
architect, he had planned on being an architect, too. Then, as a
headstrong 15-year-old, he refused to part his hair the way school
authorities ordered him to and his schooling came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he was sent to a naval training vessel and found a
home for life. Joining the British Merchant Service in 1928, he
earned his Master Mariner's Certificate in 1936 and joined Cunard
in 1937, as third officer on the Lancastria.
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioned in the Royal Naval Reserve the same year,
and after the outbreak of World War II in 1939 served for six years
at sea, first on coastal patrol, then on North Atlantic convoy duty
and eventually in support of the Normandy landings.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, one of his ships was torpedoed south of Iceland
but sank so slowly that in a gesture befitting a future Cunard
master, before abandoning ship he went to his cabin and put on his
best uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Cunard after the war, achieving his first
command, of the cargo ship Alsatia, in the early 1950s, and
commanding his first passenger ship, the Carinthia, in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cunard commissioned the QE2 at the end of 1964, he
had commanded all the line's passenger ships and served as relief
master of both the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth. Two years
later, in December, 1966, as one of 27 Cunard captains, he was
named master of the QE2, then under construction at the John Brown
Shipyard in Clydebank, near Glasgow, and spent the next two years
as Cunard's liaison with the shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
   Cunard had initially planned to call the ship simply Queen
Elizabeth, after the majestic predecessor it was intended to
replace, but the queen, who had been 12 when her mother, then Queen
Elizabeth and now the queen mother, had named the original in 1938,
had ideas of her own. At the launching on Sept. 2, 1968, she
ignored an envelope containing the intended name and declared, ``I
name this ship Queen Elizabeth the Second. May God bless her and
all who sail in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunard then adopted the style Queen Elizabeth 2, rather than
Queen Elizabeth II, to differentiate ship from sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   After his triumphal arrival in New York, Warwick, who was
promoted to commodore the next year, generally had smooth sailing.
More hotel executive than skipper (to prepare for his role he had
studied market research, economics and industrial relations), he
spent most of his time working on papers in his office under the
bridge, but during his three years at sea with the QE2 he regularly
entertained royalty, political and business leaders and
show-business celebrities at the captain's table.
</P>
<P>
   With a competent staff of officers to rely on, he generally made
only token visits to the bridge, but when he arrived in New York
during a tugboat strike in a February freeze in 1970, he refused
even the services of a pilot, and insisted on docking the ship
himself, a task that required repeated rammings to break through
thick Hudson River ice. ``It's my ship,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1975, Warwick spent most of his time at
his home in rural Surrey, far from the sea, with his wife, Evelyn,
a former Cunard hairdresser, who survives him. Other survivors
include three sons, all of whom became ship's officers, and a
grandson, Samuel, who maintains a QE2 Web site
(www.odin.co.uk/qe2/index.html).
</P>
<P>
   The QE2 has long been the only ship to maintain regular
passenger service between Southampton and New York (it spends the
winter on Caribbean, world and party cruises), and Warwick had
intended to be on board for its official 30th-anniversary crossing
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the ship sails into New York harbor on April 20, a
burly, bearded man named Warwick may be on the bridge. It will not
be a ghost, but one of the commodore's sons, Capt. Ronald Warwick,
master of the QE2.

SECOND-SEEDED MIAMI OUSTED BY PURDUE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Purdue's unlikely venture into the NCAA Tournament
continued yesterday with a surprising 73-63 victory over Miami,
which was seeded second in the East Region.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers (21-12) ended the Hurricanes' most successful
season and landed a berth in the East Regional semifinals against
Temple on Friday in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's victory gave the Tournament's 10th seeds a 7-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better teams rated higher that this,'' Purdue coach
Gene Keady said. ``But to come back \Rfrom a 7-9 Big 10 season\S
and play like this the last two games _ I couldn't be prouder.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was marked with statistical anomalies. For instance,
Miami got 27 offensive rebounds, but made 25 of 76 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if went to the offensive boards we could create
problems for them,'' Hurricanes coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``But
to my surprise, we had 13 offensive rebounds in the first half and
still shot 18 percent. I've never seen 20 offensive rebounds we
couldn't put back in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Purdue. But when you
miss 17 point-blank layups, you've got to take some of the blame
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue shut down Miami's Johnny Hemsley, who nailed 9-of-12
3-pointers and scored 31 in a first-round victory over Lafayette.
He only got off two 3-pointers against the Boilers and missed both.
He finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure I was there every time he caught the
ball and make it tough for him to get looks and maybe rush some
shots,'' Boilers guard Alan Eldridge said. ``I'll end up getting a
lot of credit, but the team did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mario Bland hit Miami's only 3-pointer of the game in 14
attempts _ with 1:37 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue closed the first half with a 15-0 run, then outscored
Miami 13-2 when the Hurricanes got to five in the second half.
Brian Cardinal led a balanced attack with 20 points. Purdue scored
its last 19 points from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilers shot 57.9 percent, second-only to a 58.6 night in an
overtime victory over Indiana a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win,'' Keady said. ``We did a lot of good
things _ defense, hitting free throws and we had a couple of spurts
each half. The nine straight shutouts the last of the \Rfirst\S
half probably won the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami (23-7) set a school record for victories and won its
first-ever NCAA Tournament game, beating Lafayette in the first
round.

MIAMI, OHIO, WINS FIRST TRIP TO REGIONALS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Prior to his team's engagement with Miami of Ohio
in the second round of Midwest Region play, Utah's Rick Majerus
cautioned against keying too much on Wally Szczerbiak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the danger of winning the Szczerbiak battle and
losing the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Utah lost both yesterday, as Szczerbiak scored 24 points,
leading the Red Hawks (24-7) to a 66-58 victory and the first Sweet
16 berth in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
   Majerus, watching the Utes (28-5) lose a 23-game winning streak
and a shot at trying to repeat last year's Final Four run, was
philosophical at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intended this to be a rebuilding year and never figured on
us being a No. 2 seed in this tournament,'' he said. ``It's been a
year that I will remember fondly, and the loss is not as
devastating as losing to Kentucky \Rin the NCAA championship game\S
last year. Miami just played harder and with more purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Charlie Coles, who at this time last year was in a
hospital recovering from a heart attack, said he came in ``feeling
that this would be the biggest challenge I've ever been a part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, who buried Washington with a 43-point binge in the
first round, finished this one with 24 points, seven rebounds, five
assists, two blocks and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   While the game ended with Miami's elated fans raising the
familiar chant, ``Wal-lee! Wal-lee!'' this was no one-man job, and
Coles found a helping hand on the bench to help with the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With the Utes holding an 11-point lead in the first half and
seemingly rolling toward a decisive win, Miami sub Jason Stewart
was inserted into the game. He promptly banged in three consecutive
three-point shots, and Utah was swept away with the turning tide.
Miami also got 18 points from John Estick, who successfully battled
Utah's taller forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them before the game that we needed someone to step up
and do something,'' Coles said. ``You know how coaches are _ I was
bluffing and reaching. But Stewart came in and showed us we could
play with these guys, and we were OK after that.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the second half, the Miami lead stood at 11
points, and when the Utes attempted a final charge, Szczerbiak
answered by scoring eight points in the final three minutes to put
them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always there when you need him,'' Coles said. ``He always
knows where to strike, and when.''

JAYHAWKS FALL SHORT IN OT VS. KENTUCKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of a whirring
little battle between Kansas and Kentucky yesterday was that it
arrived too early.
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of game the NCAA Tournament orchestration crew
hopes to present to the world in two weeks _ for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (27-8) won it in overtime, 92-88, and Wildcats coach
Tubby Smith called it ``the kind of game everybody likes to come
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nary a soul among the 15,804 Superdome patrons is likely to
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks (23-10), battered mercilessly by Kentucky in
December, played brilliantly during regulation and battled in
overtime after two starters fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary on these heart-wrenching occasions, Kansas coach
Roy Williams was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fantastic college basketball game,'' he said. ``A
great experience for them, a heartbreaker for us. Once again, we
came so close to getting something we really wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, in fact, was 18 seconds away from a stunning upset when
Kentucky's Scott Padgett fired in a 3-point shot to tie it at 79-79
in regulation. Kansas' Kenny Gregory missed an off-balance shot at
the buzzer, and the game went to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Kansas had lost its starting forwards, Nick
Bradford and T.J. Pugh, both of whom fouled out. But the Jayhawks
got 49 points _ including 10 3-pointers _ from guards Ryan
Robertson and Jeff Boschee.
</P>
<P>
   Boschee tied the game at 84 with a 3-pointer with 2:14 remaining
in the overtime period, but it was the Jayhawks' last gasp. A
putback by Jamaal Magloire and four free throws by Padgett opened a
six-point gap with 45 seconds left. From there, the Wildcats were
on their way to the Midwest Regional later this week in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett finished the game with 29 points and 10 rebounds, while
Robertson _ playing his final game at Kansas _ had a career-high 31
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Robertson said. ``But I was proud of the
way we played this game, after losing to them so badly before.
After Padgett hit that shot to tie, we brought it down and I had
good penetration for a shot, but Kenny yelled for the ball so I
dished to him. I thought he had an open layup, but I misread the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called Padgett's shot, with Kansas leading, 79-76,
``the key play, and a smart move on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   The play began with Wayne Turner (19 points) missing a shot off
a drive. Magloire rebounded and passed to Padgett, standing inside
the three-point arc at the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the shot when I caught the ball,'' he
said, ``but somebody \RGregory\S came flying at me. I gave him a
head fake, then stepped back outside the arc, because we needed a
three. Luckily, it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Williams lavishly praised his team, in spite of a
sometimes disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 11 years of great teams at Kansas,'' Williams said.
``But I am prouder of this team than any I have ever coached. They
have come back from so much adversity, including bad play and bad
coaching in some cases, and I was especially proud of them today.''

Tubby Smith called it ``the kind of game everybody likes to come
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nary a soul among the 15,804 Superdome patrons is likely to
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks (23-10), battered mercilessly by Kentucky in
December, played brilliantly during regulation and battled in
overtime after two starters fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary on these heart-wrenching occasions, Kansas coach
Roy Williams was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fantastic college basketball game,'' he said. ``A
great experience for them, a heartbreaker for us. Once again, we
came so close to getting something we really wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, in fact, was 18 seconds away from a stunning upset when
Kentucky's Scott Padgett fired in a 3-point shot to tie it at 79-79
in regulation. Kansas' Kenny Gregory missed an off-balance shot at
the buzzer, and the game went to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Kansas had lost its starting forwards, Nick
Bradford and T.J. Pugh, both of whom fouled out. But the Jayhawks
got 49 points _ including 10 3-pointers _ from guards Ryan
Robertson and Jeff Boschee.
</P>
<P>
   Boschee tied the game at 84 with a 3-pointer with 2:14 remaining
in the overtime period, but it was the Jayhawks' last gasp. A
putback by Jamaal Magloire and four free throws by Padgett opened a
six-point gap with 45 seconds left. From there, the Wildcats were
on their way to the Midwest Regional later this week in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett finished the game with 29 points and 10 rebounds, while
Robertson _ playing his final game at Kansas _ had a career-high 31
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Robertson said. ``But I was proud of the
way we played this game, after losing to them so badly before.
After Padgett hit that shot to tie, we brought it down and I had
good penetration for a shot, but Kenny yelled for the ball so I
dished to him. I thought he had an open layup, but I misread the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called Padgett's shot, with Kansas leading, 79-76,
``the key play, and a smart move on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   The play began with Wayne Turner (19 points) missing a shot off
a drive. Magloire rebounded and passed to Padgett, standing inside
the three-point arc at the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the shot when I caught the ball,'' he
said, ``but somebody \RGregory\S came flying at me. I gave him a
head fake, then stepped back outside the arc, because we needed a
three. Luckily, it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Williams lavishly praised his team, in spite of a
sometimes disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 11 years of great teams at Kansas,'' Williams said.
``But I am prouder of this team than any I have ever coached. They
have come back from so much adversity, including bad play and bad
coaching in some cases, and I was especially proud of them today.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MUCKLER HAS RANGERS MAJORING IN POSITIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ After the mob of happy Rangers congratulated
Adam Graves for his overtime game-winner Sunday, they skated in a
loose procession to the opposite corner of the rink in Nassau
Coliseum. There, in front of the open exit, stood coach John
Muckler, like the doorman at the China Club, his big grin bright
enough to be seen from the top row.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler greeted his Blue Shirts with handshakes and pats on the
back after their 3-2 victory over the Islanders left them two
points behind the Boston Bruins, who hold the eighth and final
playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. With 15 games left, the
Rangers might not make the playoffs and, even if they do, they
probably won't win even one round of the four-round tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But their persistence over the last few weeks, and their recent
8-3-1 record despite significant injuries, illustrates the
effectiveness of this experienced coach, who is molding a positive
attitude on a rebuilding team.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Rangers were outplayed but managed to win.
Muckler seems to press the right buttons with his players, old and
young alike. He has avoided the finger-pointing and scapegoating
that soured the mood in recent seasons under coach Colin Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Kevin Stevens is playing his best in five seasons, and
rookie Manny Malhotra is taking regular shifts and sparking his
teammates with skill and effort. Both scored early Sunday on power
plays as the Rangers played for the fifth time in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   When the Islanders tied the game in the third period, they might
have sagged and lost. Without Wayne Gretzky, Todd Harvey and Jeff
Beukeboom, with so many games in so few nights, the excuses were
there. But the Rangers found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as excited as anybody else,'' captain Brian Leetch said
of Muckler. ``He highlights the positives. The assistant coaches
and everybody never make it into a feel-sorry-for-ourselves type of
thing. Today, he was very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been negative. In the previous game, Muckler
watched his team squander a lead and lose an important game in the
final three minutes, 5-4 to Boston. But Muckler seemed to shrug it
off, noting that his players tried hard, that young players will
make mistakes, and that the Rangers simply gave up the last goal in
a high-scoring affair.
</P>
<P>
   At age 64, he is the second-oldest coach in the business, behind
only Detroit's Scotty Bowman, who is 65. Although a close friend
and Buffalo neighbor of Bowman's, Muckler operates somewhat
differently. Mike Knuble, who played for Bowman as a Red Wing until
this season, said, ``I can compare and contrast the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is much more approachable,'' Knuble said, comparing Muckler
with Bowman. ``He's positive 95 percent of the time. He has an
open-door policy. Some coaches say it's open door, but you won't go
in and ask anything. Muckler doesn't play mind games, sticking
people on the fourth line and trying to get a rise out of them.
He's done a great job of keeping our ship together. This team could
have gone in the tank in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler expresses faith in his players in different ways with
different people. With Stevens, he warned him on the first day of
camp to get involved in checking and defensive play. At first, he
kept Stevens off the power play. Now, Stevens' good games outnumber
his bad games, and he is back on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muck's been a big part of what I've done,'' Stevens said. ``We
communicate. He tells me when things are bad. He tells me when
things are good. Some coaches back off and don't say much. He's not
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gretzky out since Feb. 22, Muckler has found more minutes
at center for Malhotra, Marc Savard and, especially, Petr Nedved,
who played more than 32 Sunday. Nedved credits conversations with
Muckler for direction.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous time with the Rangers, in 1995, Nedved read
scathing criticisms in the newspapers. Muckler keeps critiques
private. ``He motivates guys,'' Nedved said. ``In one-on-one
meetings, maybe what he has to say is not pretty, but he gets the
point across much clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when Gretzky returns this season, Muckler will have a
delicate chore. He must provide the Great One with enough minutes
to satisfy his professional pride without hurting the other three
centers. No problem, Muckler said. ``Gretz will be a very important
part of this hockey club,'' Muckler said. ``We don't have enough
game-breakers, and Gretz is a game-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, to distinguish his style from previous
regimes, Muckler ran long, hard practices. He has eased off now.
Another major change came on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of commuting home after night games, Muckler keeps his
players on the road, sometimes for a day or two, so that they
socialize and grow as a group. After defeats, Muckler tends to
scowl and growl at reporters, assuming every question about
strategy or personnel is a second-guess. After victories, he is
more willing to share his philosophies and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' he said. ``We're back on track. We're
playing well and we're working. It's thrilling. It's fun. I've
really been enjoying this.'' &QL;

EXPANDED SOUTHWEST FLIGHTS BRING MIXED REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLIP, N.Y. _ Bumped off an overbooked flight home hours
earlier, Jim Mihnovich stood at the end of a long line at Long
Island MacArthur Airport on Sunday morning a grateful man. Grateful
mostly for Southwest Airlines, which started operations at
MacArthur on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was awesome,'' he said, pocketing one of the carrier's
distinctive blue plastic boarding passes for a 12:10 p.m. flight to
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others in Islip who do not share Mihnovich's
enthusiasm. While many frequent flyers said they hoped the arrival
of Southwest would force other large airlines to cut prices to the
Long Island airport, people who live near the airport complained
about the prospect of more jet engines roaring overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the airline will offer 12 nonstops a day from
MacArthur to Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Tampa, Fla. If that
modest beginning stimulates enough interest, the airline may add
more flights later.
</P>
<P>
   That concerns residents like Ronald Falcone, who said he is
already weary of hearing planes flying over his four-bedroom home
in Holbrook, a hamlet bordering the airport's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I use the airport; nobody wants to see it closed,''
said Falcone, 43, a manager for an insurance company. ``We want to
see it prosper. But you could do it with a little bit of class and
consideration for the residents. What's this house going to be
worth in 10 years if this airport takes off?''
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday's large and enthusiastic crop of first-day passengers
was any indication, Southwest may increase the airport's popularity
in much less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Mihnovich's story. With no chance of getting on an
overbooked American Airlines flight at La Guardia Airport on Sunday
morning, he summoned his father from Brooklyn for a car ride out to
Islip, about 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in the car, got on my cell phone, called Southwest and
bought a ticket for $130 _ and that was at the last minute,'' said
Mihnovich, 35, an executive for a Nashville home health-care
company. Less than one hour later, he had his boarding pass.
``That's pretty amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is almost guaranteed to enhance the image of the
no-frills airport, a decaying one-story structure with two
linoleum-tiled concourses and 1970s Muzak piped over the
public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Wise, a 56-year-old lawyer who was also waiting for a
Southwest flight to Nashville, said the airline's new service would
put an end to eight-hour plane-to-train-to-automobile odysseys to
visit friends in Islip. ``It's inexpensive, it's efficient, they
get you where you need to be when you need to be there,'' she said.
``And I love the peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Islip officials said they expect Southwest to generate hundreds
of thousands of dollars in revenue for the town each year. The
town's supervisor, Peter McGowan, said he hoped that the eight
other airlines that serve the airport would cut fares to match
those of Southwest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The traveling public will certainly gain from the spirit of
competition that Southwest will create,'' McGowan said in a
telephone interview. ``It will certainly help the economy of Islip
and all of Long Island. It brings Islip MacArthur Airport into the
next millennium, and it helps to bring Long Island into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents in two adjacent communities believe
Southwest's arrival at MacArthur, which serves more than a million
passengers a year, may be a harbinger of more noise and traffic
congestion. Falcone and other residents have formed the Committee
for the Enforcement of MacArthur Airport Control, which is seeking
to force Islip to cap the number of daily flights to and from
MacArthur and to prohibit late-night flights.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan said the airport's jet traffic complies with federal
noise regulations and will remain within such boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Southwest will be able to draw New York City-based
passengers away from Kennedy International and La Guardia airports
remains to be seen. Though the airline is offering rock-bottom
one-way prices _ $39 to Baltimore, $79 to Chicago or Nashville, and
$89 to Tampa _ MacArthur Airport, on the South Shore of Long
Island, is a good hour's drive from Manhattan even when there is no
traffic.

   MacManus Consolidates P&AMP;G's Account
</P>
<P>
   MacManus Group in New York is consolidating its large Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. accounts by shifting brands from its smaller agency,
N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners, to its larger one, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP;
Bowles Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation, which had been expected, involves brands with
estimated billings of $100 million out of Ayer's estimated total of
$585 million: Folgers and Millstone coffees, Puffs tissues and
Hawaiian Punch and Sunny Delight juice drinks.
</P>
<P>
   They will be added to the Procter brands handled by DMB&AMP;B, which
include Crest toothpaste, Scope mouthwash and Pampers diapers. The
50 to 60 Ayer employees working on the Procter accounts out of the
total of about 400 will join DMB&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as Procter has been paring its agency roster,
consolidating accounts at its biggest shops for greater
efficiencies. The company supports the decision, said Denis
Beausejour, vice president for global marketing at Procter in
Cincinnati, in part because DMB&AMP;B will be ``providing additional
resources and support'' for the brands.
</P>
<P>
   MacManus is also taking advantage of the looser conflict policy
recently adopted by P&AMP;G, which now frees Ayer to pursue accounts
from other marketers. And MacManus has plans to enhance the image
of Ayer as a more creative agency; eliminating a packaged-goods
marketer from the client roster may help Ayer in recruiting
creative talent.
</P>
<P>
   Two Marketers Select New Agencies
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisers have named agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott and its Duffy Design and Interactive unit,
both in Minneapolis, have been selected by IBP Inc. in Dakota City,
Neb., the giant meat packer, to handle a new national assignment,
the introduction of a line of brand-name fresh and prepared beef
and pork products. Billings have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review involving four
agencies. The others, according to Adweek, were: DDB Needham
Chicago, part of the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group;
Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in Chicago, a unit of True North
Communications, and TBWA/Chiat/Day in Playa del Rey, Calif., part
of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   And Onhealth Network Co. in Seattle named three agencies to
handle its general advertising, interactive advertising and public
relations accounts, with combined billings estimated at $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of TBWA/Chiat/Day was named as the
first agency to handle general advertising. Thinking Media in New
York was named to handle interactive advertising, which had been
handled by Quantum Leap Communications in Chicago, part of Leap
Group. And the New York and San Francisco offices of
Fleishman-Hillard, part of Omnicom, will handle public relations.
</P>
<P>
   New-Media Shops Share Honors
</P>
<P>
   Three agencies shared top honors for new-media advertising,
winning the most awards, at a ceremony in New York sponsored by the
One Club for Art and Copy.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, which won three awards apiece at the One Show
Interactive, are CKS Partners in New York, a unit of U S Web/CKS
Group; Ogilvy Interactive Worldwide in New York, part of the Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in
Portland, Ore. Nicholson New York won Best of Show for a
self-promotional campaign featuring an online game called ``Snow
Craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com, Waltham, Mass., to Arnold Communications, Boston,
a unit of Snyder Communications, as the first agency to handle the
account of the Internet-based educational toy retailer. Billings
were estimated at $10 million.

SUSPECTED KILLER SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man in Chatham, N.J., who the authorities said had killed his
estranged wife and their 8-year-old son was shot dead by a police
officer Saturday night after he refused to drop a large kitchen
knife, the police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the officer shot the man, Thomas Spranger, 49, the police
found the bodies of Spranger's estranged wife, Karen Knispel, 44,
and their son, Kevin Spranger, in Ms. Knispel's home on Longhill
Road in Chatham Township, about 10 miles west of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-year-old son, Trevor Spranger, was found alive but
seriously injured from numerous knife wounds. He was listed in
critical but stable condition at Morristown Memorial Hospital, said
Christopher Linne, a spokesman for the Morris County prosecutor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Spranger and Ms. Knispel, who had separated in January, had no
police record of domestic violence, Linne said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Ms. Knispel, a veterinary assistant and daughter of
Theodore Knispel, a former Chatham police chief, became worried
when they could not reach her by telephone to confirm a planned
Saturday evening outing, Linne said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ms. Knispel had told a friend during a telephone
conversation at 9:45 a.m. that she was concerned about Spranger.
</P>
<P>
   When the friend, whom the prosecutor's office did not identify,
tried to call back later in the day, the line was continually busy,
Linne said. The friend became so concerned that she drove to Ms.
Knispel's house about 6:20 p.m. and saw Spranger's car in the
driveway, according to Linne. She called the police at 6:33 p.m.,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When two Chatham police officers, Sgt. George Petersen and
Officer Michael Giannone, arrived at the home and began to search
the back yard, Linne said, Spranger leaped from the bushes wielding
a knife and was ordered by Petersen to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Spranger did not say anything, according to Linne, who declined
to describe Spranger's demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Spranger continued to advance with the knife, Linne said.
Petersen fired two rounds from his .45-caliber semiautomatic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen and Giannone then entered the house and found Kevin
Spranger dead in the living room and Ms. Knispel dead in the
basement, Linne said.

GIULIANI EXPRESSES REGRET OVER POLICE SHOOTING OF AFRICAN
IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the invitation of a coalition of African immigrant
groups, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
attended a religious service in Brooklyn Sunday that was described
by its organizers as an ``interfaith prayer and community healing''
event after the shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the nearly two-hour service, Safir and Giuliani
both spoke emotionally about the death of Diallo, the Guinean
immigrant shot by four police officers, as a profound tragedy
affecting all New Yorkers. The mayor and the police commissioner
addressed an audience of about 150 people at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music after remarks and prayers by several clergy members from
many faiths.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Giuliani stepped from behind the lectern to
be closer to the audience. He expressed regret over the shooting of
Diallo, who was unarmed, and spoke about the importance of
immigrants to New York City. ``The loss of an innocent person, the
loss of anyone, is a terrible, terrible rending tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Guinean Association of America, which is a member of the
coalition that held the service, the United African Congress, and
the Rev. Al Sharpton both distanced themselves from Sunday's event
and said they would continue protests against police brutality
unless the four officers who fired 41 shots at Diallo were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed S. Jalloh, the president of the Guinean Association of
America, said the service did not include the people closest to
Diallo and his family. ``We have nothing to do with it,'' he said.
Of the African Congress, he said: ``They represent themselves. They
are doing this for their agenda and their own purpose. The protests
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Diallo's death, the mayor and the police
commissioner met with the United African Congress and pledged to
work together to bridge cultural gaps between members of the police
force and African immigrants. Safir has continued to meet with the
group in recent weeks, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately after the initial meetings, leaders of
the Guinean Association of America, which represents immigrants
from Diallo's native country, sought to distance themselves from
the United African Congress, complaining that the coalition's
leaders had been too conciliatory toward the Giuliani
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who became an adviser to Diallo's parents and
convinced them to turn down all offers of assistance from the
mayor, has been leading frequent demonstrations against police
brutality since returning from Diallo's funeral in Africa. Sunday,
Sharpton accused the mayor of trying to manipulate public
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group has nothing to do with the Guinean Association or
the family and I think it is a charade to act like you are healing
people when the injured are not involved or invited,'' Sharpton
said. ``The mayor is absolutely trying to politically manipulate
the public by using this group as if any Africans speak for all
Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before attending the service, Giuliani
said he had accepted the invitation ``out of respect'' and accused
his critics of playing racial politics. ``Had I not gone, all the
race baiters would have said the mayor is snubbing the event,''
Giuliani said. ``I have gone through this game with the race
