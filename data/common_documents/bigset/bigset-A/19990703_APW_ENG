<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Chris Brown scored the game-winner in the  
shootout round as the Kansas City Wizards snapped a 16-game road 
losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny in Major 
League Soccer on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Johnston and Preki also scored in the shootout for the  
Wizards. Tampa Bay got shootout goals from Musa Shannon and Dominic 
Kinnear, but tied a franchise record with its fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kansas City's first road victory since beating Dallas 2-1  
in a shootout on May 20, 1998. The Wizards won despite playing the 
final 25 minutes a man down after Scott Vermillion was sent off in 
the 65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparked by a postgame fireworks show, the Mutiny drew their best  
home crowd this season at 20,976. It was the fourth largest home 
turnout in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Bunbury, a Canadian national team member making his first  
start in the MLS, scored Kansas City's goal in the 16th minute to 
put the Wizards up 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay countered in the 32nd minute on Shannon's eighth goal  
of the season.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. 'Body' Takes Over for Hubby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- With husband Jesse Ventura away in  
``testosterone heaven,'' Terry Ventura took over the microphone for 
his weekly ``Lunch with the Governor'' broadcast, which she 
jokingly renamed ``estrogen radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband worked in radio after retiring from professional  
wrestling, but it was the first time Mrs. Ventura braved the 
medium. Still, she wasn't too nervous to try a little homespun 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the sound of my own voice unless I'm saying,  
'Could you put this on a credit card?''' she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ventura did the show from the couple's 32-acre ranch. Her  
husband was in California for a celebrity golf tournament his wife 
termed ``testosterone heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ventura proved to be almost as outspoken as her often  
controversial husband, who shocked political experts with his 
surprise election win last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking with a caller about the plight of Minnesota hog farmers,  
who complain that they are losing money on their livestock, she 
urged shoppers to go to the supermarket and say, ``Hey, why am I 
paying this much for this pork chop when I can buy a whole pig for 
$12?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She paused, then added, ``Uh-oh. Now I'm in trouble, aren't I?  
I'm like the governor. Somebody stop me.''

	NATO Blocks Russian Reinforcements  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia wants to send more troops into  
Yugoslavia for the peacekeeping effort, but NATO says it is 
refusing to allow any planes carrying Russian reinforcements to 
land. NATO officials say Russia wants to change an agreement 
reached in lengthy negotiations last month at Helsinki, Finland, 
that outlined Russian participation in a NATO-led peacekeeping 
force. NATO officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
Russia wants to send some of its troops into sectors of Kosovo 
controlled by other NATO countries.

	Chicago Shooter Still At Large  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black former college basketball coach was shot  
to death while walking with his children -- apparently by a gunman 
who within an hour also wounded six Orthodox Jews walking home from 
synagogue and shot at an Asian-American couple. A white man in his 
late 20s appeared to have carried out the attacks last night over a 
distance of about 10 miles on residential streets in Chicago and 
two suburbs, police said. No arrests had been made today. Witnesses 
to each of the shootings told police the shots were fired from the 
same car -- a light blue Ford Taurus. Officials stopped short of 
labeling the shootings hate crimes because the gunman did nothing 
to indicate his motives.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Questions about whether George W. Bush  
received preferential treatment to gain entry into the Texas Air 
National Guard during the Vietnam War are being resurrected as his 
presidential campaign picks up steam. Bush's service in the Guard, 
where he became a fighter pilot, is well known and has been covered

1988.

	Poll: Public Fed Up With Media  
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- There is further evidence that the  
American public is getting fed up with the news media. A majority, 
53 percent, of those questioned in a survey sponsored by the First 
Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University believe the press has too 
much freedom. That's a 15 percent increase since 1997. The survey 
explores American commitment to the 45-word First Amendment that 
guarantees freedoms of religion, speech, the press, petition and 
assembly. The poll identified freedom of speech as one of the most 
cherished of constitutional rights, followed by freedom of religion 
and the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian soldiers staged afinal assault today  
on Islamic guerrillas occupying a strategic Himalayan peak near the 
Pakistan frontier. For the past week, airstrikes have accompanied 
the fiercest fighting in a seven-week battle between Indian 
soldiers and Islamic fighters holed up in stone and concrete 
bunkers on mountaintops in India-controlled Kashmir. India says 
most of the fighters are Pakistani soldiers who crossed a 1972 
cease-fire line. The hostilities have raised fears of a wider 
conflict between the two rivals. President Clinton agreed to meet 
in Washington with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tomorrow 
to discuss resolving the conflict.

	U.N. May Let Iraq Rebuild Factory  
</P>
<P>
	DAURA, Iraq (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council has agreed to send  
a team of experts to assess whether a vaccine factory ordered 
destroyed in 1996 by U.N. weapons inspectors should be 
reconstructed, an official for the world body said Saturday. 
Experts are scheduled to arrive in Iraq on July 15 to inspect the 
factory, a U.N. official said. The loss of the factory's 
vaccine-making capability left the country ill-prepared to handle 
an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease last year. At least 400,000 
animals have died for lack of the vaccine.

	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- Two boats collided on the St. Croix River  
early today, killing two men. Five to seven people were missing. 
The crash happened shortly after witnesses saw a 28-foot boat with 
five to six people aboard leave PD Pappy's, a waterfront bar and 
restaurant, Sheriff Jim Frank said. The boat struck a 22-foot power 
boat, taking out an entire side. Two men aboard that boat died of 
head and neck injuries, and there may have been a third person

Darren Bragg and Edgar Renteria walked off Byung-Hyun Kim (0-1) in 
the 10th and J.D. Drew reached on a two-out infield hit off Dan 
Plesac. McGwire, who had two homers and five RBIs last night, took 
four straight high pitches from rookie Vicente Padilla to get the 
scoring run.

<HEADLINE> Gerber Kids' Sports Bottle Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gerber Products Co. is recalling about 300,000  
sports bottles that may pose a choking hazard to young children, 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Lil' Sport Spill Proof Sport Bottles'' are being taken off  
the market because a valve inside the cap can detach 
unintentionally. Summit, N.J.,-based Gerber and the CPSC have 
received more than 30 reports of detaching valves, including three 
found in a child's mouth. No injuries were reported, however, 
Friday's announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The items subject to the recall are 12-ounce plastic bottles  
intended for children 18 months and older. They have flip-top lids 
on a curved body that is shaped like sports bottles made for 
adults. A separate screw-top cap sits on top of the lid. The 
bottles come in various solid colors and in a Baby Looney Tunes 
design. They have been sold nationwide since February individually 
and in twin-packs for $4 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised to return the bottles to the store from  
where they were purchased for a refund. For more information, they 
may call Gerber at 1-800-4-GERBER or visit the company's Website at 
www.gerber.com.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Spencer Out on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just when it seemed like Shane Spencer had ended  
the New York Yankees' left-field debate, he was placed on the 
15-day disabled list Saturday with an irregular heart beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, who started 17 of the last 18 games, left Friday  
night's game against Baltimore with dizziness after striking out in 
the sixth inning. He spent the night at a hospital and underwent 
tests Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to get a handle on the situation  
and get him well,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said before 
Saturday's 6-5 win over the Orioles. ``Initially I thought it was 
the flu or something with all the heat. When they told me what it 
was, I was bothered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees team physician Dr. Stuart Hershon said Spencer had no  
prior history of heart problems. He took his last physical in 
spring training. Hershon said Spencer is in good shape and is 
taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say he was ever in danger,'' Hershon said. ``But  
when there is an irregularity in the heartbeat of a 27-year-old, 
you want to find out what's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left field has been a problem for the Yankees all season. Darryl  
Strawberry, who underwent surgery for colon cancer last October, 
was expected to compete for the job until he was arrested on 
charges of possession of cocaine and solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Ledee, who started on opening day, hit .229 with no  
extra-base hits in 48 at-bats. He was just recently recalled from 
the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Curtis has hit .217 and spent the last month mostly as a  
pinch-hitter or late-inning defensive replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you think there is something more to left field than  
the guy who is playing it,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, who finally got a chance to win the position three  
weeks ago, has done the best job of all. He had a seven-game 
hitting streak (11-for-24) before going 0-for-3 Friday and had six 
homers in 107 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee got the nod to start in left Saturday against right-hander  
Sidney Ponson and went 0-for-2. After batting .600 in last year's 
World Series, the Yankees had big expectations for Ledee this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he is lacking in confidence,'' Torre said. ``I  
would like him to think more about the World Series than what went 
on earlier this season. A lot of times this game is mind over 
matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer's spot on the roster was filled by utilityman Jeff  
Manto, who was claimed off waivers from Cleveland on Friday. Manto, 
originally drafted by the Yankees in the 35th round in 1982, jumps 
from one first-place team to another. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a mutual respect for each other,'' Manto said.  
``Neither team is afraid of the other. It was a lot of fun coming 
here and playing the Yankees. I'm sure it will be a lot of fun 
going there to play the Indians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also signed left-hander Allen Watson to a minor  
league contract and assigned him to Triple-A Columbus. Watson, who 
started the year with the Mets, was released Monday by the Seattle 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mike Stanton the only lefty in the Yankees' bullpen, Watson  
could get an opportunity in the majors soon.

</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Viktor Chebrikov, the head of the Soviet-era KGB  
who presided over the downing of a Korean airliner carrying 269 
people over Russia's Far East, died Friday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebrikov headed the Committee for State Security, or KGB,  
during one of the most infamous incidents in the Cold War, the 
shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB ordered the 747 downed after concluding that it was on a  
spying mission orchestrated by U.S. secret services. All 269 people 
aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Chebrikov and then-Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov  
urged that the government keep secret the plane's black boxes, 
which contained information that they said would undercut the 
spying allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov put him at the helm of  
the KGB. He was made a member of the Communist Party Politburo, the 
elite ruling body of the Soviet Union, in 1985 by Andropov's 
successor, Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorbachev ousted Chebrikov from the KGB in 1988, and then  
removed him from the Politburo in 1989.

</P>
<P>
	McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Forrest Mars Sr., who created M&AMP;Ms candies  
and built one of the biggest fortunes in America as head of the 
Mars candy empire, died Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy giant began in 1911 with Frank C. Mars' small business  
in Tacoma, Wash. In 1940, his son, Forrest, devised a candy modeled 
after a British confection: a circle of chocolate covered with a 
crunchy coating. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;Ms -- promoted, as every Baby Boomer knows, as the candy that  
melts in your mouth, not in your hand -- were created as much out of 
meteorological necessity as anything. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy, originally sold in paper tubes, came in brown,  
yellow, orange, red, green and violet, later replaced by tan. 
Beginning in 1950, the candies were stamped with the trademark 
``M'' to assure customers they were getting the real thing. Peanut 
M&AMP;Ms came out in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has 30,000 employees. Besides M&AMP;Ms, its candy  
brands include Skittles, Milky Way, Dove, Snickers and Three 
Musketeers. Other brands owned by the Mars companies include Uncle 
Ben's Rice, the Kal Kan and Pedigree pet food labels, and Combos, 
Kudos and Twix snack foods.

                           *Guy Mitchell    	
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Guy Mitchell, a country-pop artist from the  
1950s whose recordings of ``Singing the Blues'' and ``Heartaches by 
the Number'' skyrocketed to the top of the charts and became 
standards of the era, died Thursday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	He also appeared in movies, on Las Vegas stages and had his own  
television show in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, after Frank Sinatra declined to record ``My Heart Cries  
For You,'' famed band leader Mitch Miller offered it to Mitchell 
and he not only had a million-seller with that Columbia Records 
recording, but another million-seller with the B-side of that 
record, ``The Roving Kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It launched a career that made Mitchell a household name in the  
'50s. He followed it up with ``My Truly Truly Fair,'' in 1952. He 
would go on to have 16 million-selling recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Mitchell starred with Rhonda Fleming in the movie  
``Those Redheads From Seattle,'' and a year later starred with 
Rosemary Clooney in ``Red Garters.'' From 1957-58 Mitchell starred 
on television in ``The Guy Mitchell Show'' and appeared on all the 
major TV shows of that era. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, he released the No. 1 recording of ``Singing the  
Blues,'' and a year later topped the charts again with ``Heartaches 
by the Number.''

                            *Mario Puzo    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Puzo, who won two Oscars for his  
adaptation of his best-selling novel ``The Godfather'' and 
romanticized the Mafia with his depiction of the fiercely loyal and 
honor-bound Corleone family, died of heart failure Friday. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Italian immigrants, who wrote seven other novels and  
assorted Hollywood screenplays, died in his home on Long Island. He 
had just completed ``Omerta,'' the third book in his Mafia trilogy, 
said Neil Olson, his literary agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo was an obscure if critically acclaimed novelist when he sat  
down at his vintage manual typewriter in the late 1960s, determined 
to write a blockbuster that would pull him out of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded. ``The Godfather,'' published in 1969, sold 21  
million copies worldwide and introduced the world to his Corleone 
family, who mingled old-world Sicilian values with new-world 
American violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the screenplays  
for ``The Godfather'' and two sequels; they earned Academy Awards 
in 1972 and 1974 for their work, and the first two films became 
American cinematic classics.

<P>
	SATSOP, Wash. (AP) -- Jim Moore had just closed his furniture and  
appliance store and was preparing to drive home when the building's 
windows blew out and the roof caved in as he watched. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think about it,'' he said after checking the damage to  
his Aberdeen business, ``if I had only been just a couple of 
minutes later getting out of there ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	The region's biggest earthquake in more than 30 years jolted  
residents from Oregon to British Columbia and injured at least four 
people. The quake struck at 6:43 p.m. Friday and was estimated at 
magnitude 5.5 by the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was centered near Satsop, about 70 miles southwest of  
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially the biggest earthquake in this region  
since 1965,'' said Steve Malone, a University of Washington 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The area's second sharp earthquake in two days toppled chimneys  
and ruptured gas and water mains. A hospital reported four people 
with quake-related injuries that were not considered serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff was flying off the shelves,'' said Trudy Donnor, who was  
getting ready to start cleaning the four-story state Insurance 
Building in Olympia when the quake hit. ``I didn't know a concrete 
building could sway like that.''

	Gas leaks and power outages were reported throughout Grays  
Harbor County, said Rob Harper of Washington State Emergency 
Management. The top floor of the three-story county courthouse 
received major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no initial reports of damage to highways or bridges.  
But callers from Astoria, Ore., to British Columbia to Cle Elum in 
central Washington phoned Seattle television stations to say they 
had felt the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the hall and I remembered you're supposed to stand in  
a doorway,'' said Barbara Saben of Olympia. ``Then I thought of 
going outside but I could see all the power lines shaking and I 
felt like that wasn't such a good idea!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents described a rolling, rumbling sensation.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were just sitting down to dinner and the milk started  
slopping out of the glasses and the baby started screaming,'' said 
Bonnie Fluckinger of Hoquiam. ``China from the china hutch started 
coming out at us. It was definitely scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband tried to call 911 but the phones didn't  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Early reports of magnitude differed. The UW lab estimated it at  
5.1 but Malone said the equipment at Golden was better at measuring 
deep quakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A quake Thursday night jolted the south Puget Sound area and had  
a 3.0 magnitude. It was centered near Maury Island north of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a magnitude 5.7 quake rumbled under the Pacific  
Ocean off Vancouver Island, about 115 miles southwest of Port 
Hardy, British Columbia. The quake early Friday was not felt 
because of its distance from land.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Fires Destroy Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Calif. (AP) -- A fire that federal authorities set to  
thin brush got out of control and roared through a mountain hamlet, 
destroying two dozen homes and forcing 500 people to flee. In 
Nevada, a larger but less damaging wildfire was partially contained 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds and hot weather Friday fanned flames of the  
``controlled burn'' beyond a 100-acre expanse of brush and weeds 
and into Lewiston. There were no injuries, but many homeowners who 
fled returned Saturday to little more than smoking rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just exploded,'' said one resident, Rod Robinson.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a few minutes to get out of there,'' he said as he  
examined the smoldering debris of his home. ``I grabbed our coats, 
I grabbed our guns out of the cabinet. I got the '57 Chevy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the house, Robinson lost his workshop, several  
automobiles, motorcycles, and a collection of 85-year-old china. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for this. It just happens sometimes,'' said Doug  
Held, who was in charge of the fire set by the Bureau of Land 
Management to thin out fire-prone overgrowth. ``I think we're going 
to have to re-evaluate our prescription burn program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, the fire had blackened more than 2,000 acres of  
brush and forest land. It was 50 percent contained by the 
afternoon, but there was no estimate of when it would be completely 
under control. Falling temperatures and lighter wind were aiding 
the effort, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Air tanker planes, helicopters and more than 2,000 firefighters  
were at the scene, a rugged swath of the Shasta-Trinity National 
Forest. Lewiston is about 300 miles northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada wildfire was expected to be containted by Sunday  
morning. It had raced through 3,000 acres of dry brush in Reno and 
damaged two homes. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Struggling reliever Gregg Olson was put on the  
15-day disabled list by the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday 
because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson re-established himself last season with 30 saves in 34  
chances, but has blown six of 17 opportunities this season. He 
hasn't pitched since June 22 and is 3-4 with a 4.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, made retroactive to June 23, is a preventive measure.  
Olson had back spasms warming up in the bullpen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona recalled Bobby Chouinard from Triple-A Tucson for his  
third stint with the team this season. Chouinard, a 27-year-old 
right-hander, was 1-0 in four innings with the Diamondbacks, 
allowing two unearned runs in four innings.

<HEADLINE> Carpet Company Fined for Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Election Commission has accepted a  
$200,000 civil fine from a carpet company that admitted reimbursing 
employees for donating to Lamar Alexander's presidential primary 
campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC announced its approval of the fine from Beaulieu of  
America Inc. this week, six months after the Dalton, Ga., company 
pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor counts of directing 36 employees 
to attend a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner in March 1996 for 
Republican presidential candidate Alexander. The employees were 
reimbursed by the company with money disguised as bonuses or 
expense reimbursements. The company paid a $1 million criminal 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election law prohibits corporations from contributing to  
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Bouckaert, the company's chief executive, was one of the  
national finance co-chairs of Alexander's campaign. The campaign 
was not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouckaert, a Republican power broker and Dalton civic leader,  
transformed Beaulieu from an industry upstart to a 7,000-employee 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaulieu is one of three huge carpet makers in Dalton, where  
about one-third of the world's carpet is produced. The industry 
drives the region's economy and wields considerable influence in 
north Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Criticizes Opponent's Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Wimbledon finalist Lindsay Davenport  
criticized the mother of Alexandra Stevenson on Saturday, saying 
her charges of racism and lesbianism on the women's tennis tour 
``sound crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport overpowered the 18-year-old Californian 6-1, 6-1  
Saturday to reach her first Wimbledon final as she tries to match 
her 1998 U.S. Open title. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said she and other players didn't appreciate being  
painted with the broad brush of criticism by Stevenson's mother, 
Samantha, a freelance journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the comments she has made the past few weeks, I'm not  
sure if she's doing it for attention, because they sound crazy,'' 
Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think we appreciate her commenting on our way of  
life. She's calling us in some way almost a name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport urged Samantha Stevenson to back off and let her  
talented daughter play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	`She's enjoying the whole Wimbledon experience, played great and  
all of this stuff has come on her because of her mom,'' Davenport 
said. ``You can't help but feel sorry for her because when you talk 
to her she's nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her daughter is 18, she's an adult now. She'll be fine.''  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Stevenson defended her mother when told of  
Davenport's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever comments my mom made, she is my mother and I think  
she is right and it hasn't clouded anything,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stevensons declined to talk about the revelation on Friday  
by former NBA star Julius Erving that he is Alexandra's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when she'd be ready to talk about it, Samantha Stevenson  
said ``never.'' Her daughter said, ``I don't know. When I feel 
ready, maybe.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Girl Charged With Murder Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl known to wear dark  
Gothic clothing is charged with crafting a scheme to kill 
classmates and teachers at her middle school. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-grader, charged in juvenile court with solicitation  
to commit murder, could be held in juvenile custody until her 18th 
birthday if she is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested June 14, the date she allegedly planned to  
carry out the killings. A judge is hearing her case and is expected 
to issue a verdict in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl allegedly met with friends three days after the April  
20 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and 
showed them a map of the school's security cameras, shared a hit 
list of nine students and school personnel, and described a getaway 
plan involving her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Bartfield, the girl's advanced algebra teacher, testified  
Friday that the girl would say: ``I hate this school. I hate you. I 
hate this class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bartfield's name allegedly appeared on the hit list.  
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Hassett, the defense attorney, argued that none of the  
state's witnesses had seen the girl with weapons or bomb-making 
materials. And a 16-year-old boy -- whom the girl allegedly asked 
for help in the scheme -- testified ``she didn't ask me to kill no 
one.''

<HEADLINE> Virginie Wins Beverly Hills Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Brazilian-bred Virginie nipped 3-10  
favorite Tranquility Lake by a half-length in Hollywood Park's 
$250,000 Beverly Hills Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginie ran 1 1/4 miles over turf in 2:00 1-5 to collect $150,000,  
increasing her career earnings to $360,372. The loss was 
Tranquility Lake's first in four races, following three victories 
by an average of five lengths, including the Gamely Breeder's Cup 
Handicap by 5 1/2 on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Delahoussaye and Tranquility Lake surrendered the lead to  
Virginie in the closing strides after putting away longshot 
pacesetter Courtesan down the backstretch and taking a 2 1/2-length 
lead into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill finished third, three lengths behind Tranquility  
Lake, in the field of six fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Laffit Pincay Jr., aboard Virginie, recorded the 8,762nd victory  
of his career. It was Pincay's first victory in a Grade I race 
since the Hollywood Futurity last December aboard Tactical Cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard had purchased 50 percent of  
Virginie from Rio Claro Thoroughbreds just 30 minutes before the 
race. The sum was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginie, who carried 118 pounds as the 9-2 second choice, paid  
$11.40, $2.80 and $2.10. Tranquility Lake, under high weight of 122 
pounds, returned $2.20 and $2.10. Keeper Hill, with David Flores 
taking over for ailing Alex Solis, paid $2.10 to show.

<HEADLINE> Funding for Private Groups Favored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blending politics and religion, a movement  
seeking to put government money into church-sponsored efforts to 
deal with social ills is gaining headway in Congress and the 2000 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But not without controversy over church-state issues, despite an  
array of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush is for it, and has done it in Texas. Vice  
President Al Gore backs a ``new partnership'' with religious 
charities. Their rivals for the 2000 presidential nominations do, 
too. The House adopted a resolution endorsing the idea, and there's 
a bill to do it, signed by more than 100 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll indicated that 76 percent of  
Americans favor giving federal funds to private groups, including 
religious organizations, to deal with social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare reform law already provides a role for church  
organizations, permitting them to provide social services financed 
by the government while restricting their payrolls to people of 
their faiths. The House bill would extend that to drug treatment 
and other social services. The resolution approved June 22 urges 
steps to ``empower community and faith-based organizations'' to 
work on social needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In simpler words, to subsidize the efforts of religious groups  
against addiction, gang violence, family strains and other ills. As 
supporters point out, church-linked programs are good at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faith-based programs work,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.,  
the chief sponsor of the House resolution. He said their success 
rate in treating addicts is far higher than that of conventional 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to being more successful, faith-based programs are  
almost always cheaper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are more limited and can be more selective, a factor  
in those differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advocates as politically apart as the conservative  
congressman and the Democratic vice president say that 
church-linked programs are grass-roots, community efforts, with a 
moral foundation that helps to make them effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Souder said there should be legislation enabling faith-based  
organizations to ``compete for government funds when they are 
providing services which the government is contracting out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush says, they already are, under an executive order  
and laws he signed as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government should welcome the help of faith-based  
institutions,'' Bush says. ``Church and state should work together 
with respect for our differences and reverence for our shared 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the government should ``explore carefully tailored  
partnerships with our faith community'' to meet social challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that can be done within the constitutional line between  
church and state. ``I believe strongly in the separation of church 
and state,'' Gore said in putting the issue on his agenda two 
months ago. ``But freedom of religion need not mean freedom from 
religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there should be strict safeguards when public money goes  
into church-founded social programs, so that there is always a 
secular alternative, and no requirement that people in those 
programs take part in religious services. 
</P>
<P>
	Those boundaries are the pressure point. The bill proposed by  
conservatives in the House would permit, not preclude, requiring 
that program beneficiaries participate in religious practices and 
follow the rules of the sponsoring church. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would permit faith-based programs with government  
funding to hire addiction counselors without regard to state 
licensing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic critics said in debate on the House resolution that  
would raise both constitutional and policy issues, not about the 
good works of religious organizations but about government money in 
church programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat and a Baptist minister,  
called the measure ``an assault on the separation of church and 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress, open your eyes,'' countered Rep. James Traficant,  
the dissonant Democrat from Ohio. ``They have rolled out the carpet 
in America for the devil with a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo that 
is no more the intent of the founders than pornography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the gentleman from Ohio wants to consider and call the Bill  
of Rights mumbo jumbo ... he has that right,'' Lewis replied. ``I 
am going to stand with the founding fathers.'' 
</P>

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Blue jeans, a cowboy hat, those  
famous sunglasses and, now, Richard Petty takes a water bottle 
wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty, the Winston Cup career leader with 200 victories, got his  
doctor's permission to come to Daytona on Saturday for the Pepsi 
400. Last week, he was hospitalized with a bout of bleeding stomach 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the July race in Daytona for the 34th consecutive  
year, but only on the condition that he not let the hot weather get 
the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the water bottle.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't anybody's decision but the doctor's,'' Petty said.  
``He said it would be OK. I wanted to come. The doctors said go, 
just don't get dehydrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petty said he was taken to the hospital June 23 after passing  
out at his home. By the next day, he was signing autographs from 
his sick bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors replaced about three pints of blood -- ``I was running a  
little low on STP,'' Petty quipped -- and he lost about 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Linda, had expressed concern about him coming to  
Florida because they are planning a trip to Europe in two weeks 
with their granddaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	The lure of Daytona, however, was too strong.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been here every year whether we were running or someone  
else was running,'' Petty said. ``We've always been here for 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would split time during the race in the pits with his  
son Kyle's crew and with that of John Andretti, who drives the car 
owned by Petty Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do anything over there, but I'll be there,'' Petty  
said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOT ROOKIE:* Tony Stewart doesn't drive like a rookie, doesn't  
act like a rookie and certainly knows how to share credit for his 
success like the most experienced veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was legal to marry two people, I'd marry my fiancee, of  
course, but I'd make sure my crew chief was tied in,'' Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 28, is the overwhelming leader in rookie of the year  
points heading into the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He says his pairing with crew chief Greg Zipadelli, along with  
the knowledge gained from teammate Bobby Labonte, has helped make 
his first year on the Winston Cup circuit a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stepped into an established team that finished in the top 10  
the last two years,'' Stewart said. ``Having a teammate to reflect 
off of has really helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the second half of the season, Stewart was in sixth  
place in the driver standings and was 61 points ahead of Elliott 
Sadler in rookie-of-the-year competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadler said Stewart deserves as much credit as his team for his  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, he does have a great team, but give him credit,'' Sadler  
said. ``Finishing every race, and not wrecking or anything counts 
for something.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CALE'S MILESTONE:* Jeff Gordon was trying to win his third  
consecutive race at Daytona on Saturday, a feat accomplished only 
once, by Cale Yarborough in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarborough, who has eight career victories at the track, said  
there was no special secret to his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't had good cars, a good team and a special love for  
the race track, it wouldn't have happened,'' he said. ``I don't 
know why it happened, but I'm certainly glad it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon also was trying to join Yarborough, Lee Roy Yarbrough,  
Bobby Allison and Fireball Roberts as the only drivers to sweep two 
races in one year at stock car racing's most famous track. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd love to think it was all skill, but I'm sure there has  
to be some luck involved,'' Yarborough said. ``Because some of best 
Winston Cup drivers that ever walked the face of the earth have had 
a tough time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW SPONSOR:* Andy Petree Racing announced a sponsorship deal  
with Oakwood Homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Petree signed a two-year deal with Oakwood Homes with an option  
for a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Petree and driver Ken Schrader have known of the deal since  
April, but decided to delay the announcement until U.S. Tobacco 
Co., officially withdrew its Skoal brand from NASCAR sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco company made that announcement earlier in the week,  
ending 18 years of sponsorship with NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARTIN CAR:* Mark Martin was diagnosed with a broken left  
wrist, a result of a crash during practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a cast on the wrist, but plannned to drive in the race  
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians at Goodyear confirmed the accident was caused by a  
cut in his right front tire. They said there was no structural 
damage to the tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin started from the back of the field in his backup car.  
</P>
<P>
	That car was the one he drove in February in the Daytona 500 and  
in April in the DieHard 500 in Talladega. At Daytona, Martin 
started ninth and finished 31st after being involved in a multicar 
accident. At Talladega, he started sixth and finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had an hour of practice before the race started, I'd be  
comfortable it would be as good as the car he had,'' team owner 
Jack Roush said of the backup car.

<HEADLINE> 9 Arrested at Indian Tribe Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITECLAY, Neb. (AP) -- Members of the Oglala Sioux tribe  
converged on this tiny town Saturday to protest alleged treaty 
violations, unsolved murders and alcohol sales, and nine people 
were arrested, including activist Russell Means. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people marched the two miles from the Pine Ridge  
Reservation in South Dakota, and scores of others rode in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	They were met by more than 100 riot-equipped Nebraska state  
troopers, who stood toe-to-toe with the marchers and ordered them 
not to cross a line of yellow tape at the edge of Whiteclay, about 
a city block from the state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Means -- who led a 1973 uprising at Wounded Knee,  
S.D. -- and several other demonstrators crossed the tape and were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	One man riding bareback on a horse skirted the police line and  
rode, hollering, through an adjacent field. Some in the crowd 
shouted at troopers or threw rocks. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration later ended peacefully and most of the  
participants headed back to Pine Ridge. Means and the others who 
were arrested would probably be given misdemeanor citations for 
refusing a lawful order, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The town's 22 residents had been ordered to leave the day before  
by Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns. While tribal leaders said it would 
be a peaceful march, some participants had threatened to occupy the 
village until state officials addressed their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	A rally one week ago in Whiteclay ended with looting and  
burning. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests stem from allegations by American Indian Movement  
leaders and members of the Oglala Sioux that the federal government 
has violated an 1868 treaty that reserved parts of what are now 
North Dakota and South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and Nebraska for 
the Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribe members also are upset that four stores in Whiteclay sell  
more than $3 million worth of beer each year, mostly to Indians 
with drinking problems. Alcohol is banned on the reservation, a 
5,000-square-mile expanse that is home to 15,000 Oglala Sioux and 
has one of the nation's highest alcoholism-related mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, tribe members say local police have not done enough to  
investigate the deaths of two Sioux men whose bodies were found 
June 8 in a culvert near the Nebraska line. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said Nebraska could not offer much help because the  
bodies were found in South Dakota. Federal and tribal police have 
announced a $15,000 reward for information on the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rally before Saturday's march in Pine Ridge, calls for  
militant action in Whiteclay mingled with prayer drums and pleas 
for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had it my way, we'd tear the damn town down to the  
ground, but we can't do that,'' AIM activist Clyde Bellecourt said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is set to visit Pine Ridge on Wednesday, and  
is expected to discuss economic development in Indian communities 
and tour tornado-damaged parts of Oglala.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Seek Niche Behind Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``We're No. 2!''  
</P>
<P>
	Eleven Republican presidential candidates are shouting it from  
their shaky political perches in a loud, desperate chorus. Lost in 
the wake of George W. Bush's political juggernaut, they're treading 
water -- all hoping to emerge as The Alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas-size Bush failure is the only hope for this woe-begotten  
band. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two tiers,'' GOP consultant Rich Galen said. ``Bush.  
And all the rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six months into the 2000 campaign, the Democratic is shaping up  
to be more orderly and perhaps more competitive. Vice President Al 
Gore is the clear front-runner, but sole rival Bill Bradley showed 
that he can mount a serious challenge by raising more than $11 
million by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-Bush Republicans would love to be running that close to  
the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to be the alternative to Bush,'' Sen. John  
McCain's spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly, undeniably the No. 2 to Bush,'' Dan Quayle's  
spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Forbes-Bush race.'' So says Steve Forbes' spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
	On the verge of political bankruptcy, former Tennessee Gov.  
Lamar Alexander is cruising the back roads of New Hampshire this 
weekend in a rented bus called, ``Exceeding expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a poor man's imitation to Bush's sleek charter jet dubbed  
``Great Expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to be the party's nominee,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But the party may not be ready for him, or any other candidate  
not named Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there is still plenty of time to stumble, Bush has built  
himself plenty of room for error. He leads by leaps and bounds in 
GOP polls, and raised twice as much money in four months as the 
sitting vice president raised in six. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Republican candidate who can compete dollar-for-dollar  
is multimillionaire Steve Forbes, who is writing personal checks. 
He is trying to claim the upper hand on poll-tested issues such as 
Social Security, health care and education while courting the 
party's conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a boost Friday when conservative leader Paul Weyrich  
endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is important that voters in the primary have a  
choice other than George Bush,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's aides conceded Forbes' money is a major threat. So  
they're going after Forbes money: They're mailing fund-raising 
letters to Forbes magazine subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	For each letter sent, Bush has received an average contribution  
of $119.20, according to a campaign official. 
</P>
<P>
	After Forbes, there is no sense looking for dollars in the rival  
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, the former vice president, is in debt. But he is buoyed  
by recent polls showing his campaign second to only Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted to cut George Bush's lead to a mere 45  
points. A much more manageable margin,'' read a tongue-in-cheek 
note from the campaign manager Kyle McSlarrow to supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is a favorite of social conservatives and is a  
battle-scarred veteran of the cultural wars. He hopes to raise 
enough money to stay alive until the early primaries, when a 
victory could wipe away questions about his electability. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alexander supporter recently solicited donations with a  
letter saying it might be their ``last opportunity'' to help him. 
He must finish strong in an Iowa straw poll next month to remain in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is using his Senate chairmanship to squeeze contributions  
from lobbyists. The Arizona senator has helped set the 2000 
campaign agenda at several turns, speaking out on the Kosovo 
conflict and capitalizing on Bush's fund-raising prowess to push 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	He will lay low in Iowa and try to ambush the front-runner in  
New Hampshire, where his independent streak might play well. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole lost her hold on the No. 2 spot in some polls  
after the Texas governor hit the campaign trail. Her spokesman 
dismissed the slip as a temporary ``Bush bump.'' A big draw on the 
road, she tacked to the left on gun control and back to the right 
on values with an anti-pornography proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans see her as the perfect No. 2 -- as in a  
Bush-Dole ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio has not raised much money, but he has  
spent less. He has $1.7 million in the bank. Aides say that will 
keep him afloat long enough to bask in the glow of a flaming Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch was so unimpressed with the non-Bush crowd that  
he jumped into the race in June. His strategy: be there if Bush 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he slips, there's going to have to be someone there to pick  
up the gauntlet and run,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes say social conservatives are tired of  
the GOP establishment, a club that includes Bush. They plan to tap 
that animus. 
</P>
<P>
	Arch-conservatives Pat Buchanan and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith  
are considering whether to bolt the GOP. Running under the Reform 
Party banner would give a candidate millions of dollars in federal 
money coming to the party because of Ross Perot's 1996 showing. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would get them out of the race for the GOP's No. 2.

<HEADLINE>  Hundreds Protest Cuban Refugee Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Carrying signs and waving Cuban and American flags,  
nearly 1,000 people gathered Saturday to protest the Coast Guard's 
treatment of six Cuban refugees who frantically attempted to reach 
U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidel Castro, don't feel bad,'' one sign read. ``We are as bad  
as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd repeatedly chanted ``liberty'' and ``justice'' in  
Spanish during the peaceful two-hour demonstration, which was 
organized by 40 Cuban activist groups and held around a Bay of Pigs 
memorial. Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe 
Carollo also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard is investigating its treatment of the six  
refugees. TV reports Tuesday showed officers blasting the men with 
a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers then swarmed them as they jumped overboard and swam  
toward shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Two made it to shore, and four were pulled from the water and  
later transferred to an immigration detention center. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were freed from custody and allowed to remain in the  
United States following large protests by the Cuban community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm going to burst with emotion,'' said Carlos  
Hernandez Cordova, one of three refugees who attended the protest.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The holding company buying Cigna Corp.'s  
property and casualty insurance businesses for $3.45 billion plans 
to eliminate 1,350 jobs by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern Coach Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOKIE, Ill. (AP) -- Ricky Byrdsong, who took Northwestern to  
only its second postseason basketball appearance in school history, 
died early Saturday after being shot near his home. He was 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong's death may have been the result of a hate crime,  
police said. It was among several shootings that occurred late 
Friday in Chicago and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was black, was shot in the back Friday night as he  
walked with his children about a block from their home in this 
northeastern Chicago suburb. He died a few hours after undergoing 
surgery at Evanston Hospital. Byrdsong's children were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all wonder when the gratuitous violence is going to stop,''  
Northwestern athletic director Rick Taylor said, fighting back 
tears. ``If anything good can come out of this, maybe Chicago and 
the country can get together and put an end to this. I hope he's 
remembered for the one simple pure thing that he was, and that was 
that he was a flat-out good man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong's death was among a series of shootings that police  
believe to be the work of one man. Six Orthodox Jews walking home 
from Sabbath services in a north Chicago neighborhood only a few 
blocks from Byrdsong's home were wounded by gunfire. Police suspect 
the same person took shots at but missed two Asian-Americans some 
time later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock,'' said Evan Eschmeyer, who played for Byrdsong  
for two years and was drafted by the New Jersey Nets on Wednesday. 
``It's times like this you realize how small a part of life 
basketball is. He knew that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong compiled an 87-165 record as coach, including 34-78 in  
four seasons at Northwestern. He was fired with seven games left in 
the 1996-97 season, effective at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993-94, his first season at Northwestern, the Wildcats went  
15-14 for their first winning season in 11 years and just the 
second in 25 years. They were invited to the NIT for the school's 
second postseason appearance, losing to Xavier in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	That season was a strange one, and marked Byrdsong forever as  
``that coach who wandered into the stands.'' At Minnesota, Byrdsong 
left the bench and told assistant Paul Swanson to take over. He 
then walked into the stands, chatting with fans and exchanging 
high-fives. An usher had to ask him to leave when he sat down in an 
aisle, and the crowd chanted, ``Byrdsong's nuts!'' as he left. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a 12-day, four-game leave of absence, consulting doctors  
about his physical and mental health. When he returned, for a home 
game against Indiana, he was greeted with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fair coach,'' Eschmeyer said. ``The first thing you  
think of when you hear something like this is what a great person 
he was, what a smart person he was. He had his priorities in the 
right place and he was one of the smartest people I've ever met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong never managed to match his first-year success. He had  
to replace four senior starters his second season, and his team was 
further depleted by injuries and player defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of his 1994-95 team, Kenneth Dion Lee and Dewey  
Williams, were later convicted in a point-shaving scandal and 
sentenced to a month in federal prison. Government prosecutors said 
Byrdsong didn't know about the point-shaving scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing at Iowa State, Byrdsong began his career there as  
an assistant. Over the next 10 years, he did stints at Arizona, 
Eastern Illinois and Western Michigan before being hired in 1988 as 
coach at Detroit Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to be the victim of an apparent hate crime is  
unbelievable,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said. ``Ricky never had an 
unkind word or a thought for anyone. I don't think there was a 
person who met Ricky who did not like and respect him. He was a man 
you couldn't help but admire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong is survived by his wife, Sherialyn, and four children.  
The funeral will be held Wednesday at 7 p.m. at First Presbyterian 
Church in Evanston, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Poll: People Feel Loss of Morality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accompanying the hum of computers and the roar  
of the economy at the end of the 20th century is a nagging feeling 
among many Americans that something has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	They describe it in various ways: an absence of morality, a loss  
of innocence, a lack of trust in others. Almost two-thirds of the 
people in a new poll say their families' lives have improved since 
the 1950s. But fewer than half say the country as a whole is better 
off now and nearly one-third say it is worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more money, but less human caring,'' said Wayne  
Dubrawsky, a government worker from Orchard Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ralph Mittelstaedt, a retired Nebraska farmer: ``Life may  
have gotten better, but people haven't gotten better, especially 
the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press,  
looked at how Americans feel about changes that have occurred over 
the past 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to name the reasons for personal betterment, four out  
of 10 cited the strong economy and one out of six pointed to 
advances in technology and modern conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life in this country has gotten better,'' said Charlene  
Bridges, of North Augusta, S.C., visiting Washington recently with 
her grandchildren. She cites higher salaries, ``the World Wide Web 
and the spread of knowledge and information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for key factors in America's progress, they cite the  
Constitution, free enterprise and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the American way, politically and economically,  
is a remarkable achievement and it does work,'' said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew Research Center. But, he added, the poll 
indicates ``technological and material success is undercut by the 
sense that somehow we have lost our way morally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism extended to nearly all parts of society, but women,  
blacks and people with disabilities are among those who have gained 
the most, according to those polled. More than four out of five 
said the people in those categories are better off than they were 
in the 1950s, and the movements for civil rights and women's rights 
were widely viewed as two of the most positive social developments 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not as much racism,'' said Charles Caldwell, a  
17-year-old street vendor on the Mall in Washington. ``Everybody's 
getting their share of the American pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack Arthur Brown, a 52-year-old retired schoolteacher from  
DeKalb, Miss., remembers what it was like for blacks when he was 
growing up 50 years ago, with segregated bathrooms, schools and 
restaurants in parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Integration came in and things have gotten a lot better for  
blacks in America,'' he said. ``We're able to go where we want to 
go now, without any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also widespread agreement that farmers and  
teen-agers were not as well off as they were a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,546 adults was taken from April 6 to May 6. The  
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. occurred during that period, 
when almost two-thirds of the interviews had been completed. The 
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Littleton shootings did not change the overall  
findings of the poll, they increased the numbers that thought life 
was worse for teens, from 52 percent before to 61 percent just 
after. And the number who thought life is worse in the country in 
general jumped from 25 percent before to 36 percent afterward.

<P>
	Roseland Jones, a 61-year-old homemaker from Plainville, Ill.,  
questioned whether the computer and the Internet are offering 
children as healthy an outlet as the pastimes of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computers probably help, but what are the children learning  
now?'' she asked. ``Are they learning to socialize with other 
people? Are they going to dances? Are they going to church? 
</P>
<P>
	``The lifestyle is too fast. Parents don't have time for their  
children and you can't trust anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes that were viewed less positively included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Two-thirds said increased use of credit cards is a bad trend.  
</P>
<P>
	--Just over half decried the onset of rap music.  
</P>
<P>
	--About half were concerned about the growing ease of divorce.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Wins Tour Prologue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUY-DU-FOU, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong, the two-time Olympian  
who returned to racing after overcoming testicular cancer, scored a 
stunning personal triumph Saturday by winning the prologue of the 
Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Riding for the U.S. Postal Service team, Armstrong won the  
4 1/4-mile time trial in 8 minutes, 2.5 seconds, seven seconds ahead 
of Alex Zulle of Switzerland of the Banesto team. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, 11 seconds behind the winner, was Abraham Olano of the  
Spanish team ONCE. Frenchman Christophe Moreau was fourth, and 
British Chris Boardman, last year's prologue winner, finished 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's success came as the Tour de France struggles to  
emerge from the shadow of the drug scandal that rocked last year's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the scandal, Armstrong said, ``I'm here for the love  
of cycling,'' adding that he hoped ``the other 179 guys are, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his victory, he said: ``With my problems, my  
history, it is incredible. The Tour de France is the greatest race 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 28, of Austin, Texas, won the 1993 world championship  
and competed for U.S. Olympic teams in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 2, 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of rehabilitation and recovery, Armstrong returned  
to racing in February. 
</P>
<P>
	He won stages of the Tour in 1993 and 1995, but has struggled  
through its mountainous middle stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug crisis that enveloped last year's race was still being  
discussed by fans Saturday. Many said this year's race could make 
or break the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is just like nuclear weapons,'' said Queffelec  
Christian, a French fan. ``Bring it all down to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Tour is the opportunity to get rid of all the problems.''  
</P>
<P>
	British fan Martin Burrill, a vacationer from Manchester, said  
he understood the temptations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is their choice, but maybe it isn't,'' he said. ``You're a  
young lad, maybe it's your first contract. The manager says, `Take 
this.' What are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	French cycling star Richard Virenque remains under investigation  
on drug charges. He competed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Tour reluctantly bowed to pressure from  
cycling's governing body and readmitted the controversial rider, 
whom it had earlier barred because ``his presence would be 
incompatible with the image of the Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many top riders are missing. The two previous winners, Jan  
Ullrich of Germany and Bjarne Riis of Denmark, are injured. 
</P>
<P>
	With the field wide open, Armstrong and Virenque, a top climber  
in good form, appear to be the favorites. Another top contender is 
last year's surprising third-place finisher, American Bobby Julich 
of Cofidis. He placed 22nd in the prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-stage race will be about 124 miles shorter than last  
year, and less grueling: it will include an extra rest day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,286-mile race will end with the traditional ride up and  
down the Champs-Elysees July 25.

<HEADLINE> Albright's Brooches on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a brooch you probably won't see pinned to  
the lapel of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- an 18-carat 
yellow gold piece showing a face being punched by a fist. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was made with her in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me diplomacy sometimes becomes a form of verbal punching,''  
said Daniel Jocz, creator of the ``Punch'' pin. ``It is how I see 
Madeleine Albright, as a person able to deliver the ultimate punch 
in negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so maybe it's not the right message for talks on Kosovo.  
</P>
<P>
	But Albright has made a habit of wearing brooches with subtle  
political messages -- like the tangled spider-and-web pin for Middle 
East peace talks, or a serpent brooch as a reproach to an Iraqi 
diplomat after his country's newspapers compared her to a venomous 
snake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read my pins,'' she has quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	In tribute to her political jewelry, 61 artists from 16  
countries have created 71 brooches that they would have Albright 
wear while conversing with the world's top diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	They are being displayed in an American Craft Museum exhibit  
called ``Brooching it Diplomatically: A Tribute to Madeleine K. 
Albright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some brooches make strong political statements, some are  
patriotic and others are simply whimsical. Some are gaudy and huge 
-- as large as 9 inches -- making them unwearable. They are made of 
gold, silver, diamonds, plastic, paper and other objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright agreed to be photographed for the cover of the show's  
catalog, wearing a silver pin of the Statue of Liberty's head. 
</P>
<P>
	A handy piece for her long negotiating sessions with world  
leaders, the 4 1/2-inch brooch has two round watches for the statue's 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gijs Bakker, the Dutch artist who made it, explained that one  
watch is set upside down ``for Mrs. Albright to know how long her 
appointment will last and the other for her visitor to know when to 
leave.''

<HEADLINE> Rudd Gets New Perspective on Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- If it was only about racing, it  
wouldn't much matter which logo was painted on the side of Ricky 
Rudd's car next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In this business-oriented era of stock car racing, however,  
sponsorships mean every bit as much as driving ability. And that 
leaves Rudd struggling to survive after losing his Tide sponsorship 
from Procter &AMP; Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really the first time I've ever experienced anything  
like this,'' said the 24-year Winston Cup veteran, who responded to 
his bad news by qualifying second for tonight's Pepsi 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess racing is growing and it's changing and, hopefully,  
it's all for the better. But I think, unfortunately, a lot of the 
guys who paid their dues and helped create the sport are tending to 
get run over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears Rudd could be one of the victims. He was already  
behind because he runs a one-car team in an era of multicar 
conglomerates. Losing a sponsor of nine years hurt his cause 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is likely to move its sponsorship to Precision  
Preparation Inc., a company best known for its CART team, one that 
won't put a car on a NASCAR track until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever drives that car will take the logo that belonged to  
Rudd, who has one of the most impressive records in the sport. He 
has won at least one race for 16 seasons straight, from 1983-98. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Rudd is mired in 38th place in the points standings  
without a top-10 finish. He says sales and promotion had been the 
last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably guilty of working way too many hours and worrying  
way too much about this race team, instead of going up with a fancy 
briefcase and a nice powerpoint presentation,'' Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
	PPI owner Cal Wells said he didn't mean to stir up bad feelings  
with Rudd, who has been very critical of Wells, or with other 
NASCAR drivers who might feel like he is barging in on their turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry Ricky feels the way he does,'' Wells said. ``We're  
not here to kick him or anyone else off. We're here to build a 
strong foundation in this sport and in this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside Rudd in tonight's race will be Joe Nemechek, another  
underdog who nonetheless has the manpower of Felix Sabates' Sabco 
racing team at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows back are Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon and Dale  
Jarrett, who, in different ways, symbolize where the sport has gone 
in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do a lot outside of what you do on the racetrack  
to keep everyone happy and sometimes even that isn't enough,'' 
Jarrett said. ``Everybody wants to be on the side of a winning car 
and as we know, that's not really possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Rudd is out of the Winston Cup points chase, Jarrett,  
Gordon and Earnhardt are in the thick of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who will start 12th, holds the lead by 157 points over  
Bobby Labonte heading into the second half of the season. Gordon 
has four victories, more than anyone in the field, but stands 314 
points behind Jarrett in his bid for a third straight title. Gordon 
will start 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt is in seventh place. He ran second at Daytona in  
February and earned his lone victory this year at Talladega.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tops S. Korea in Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Kevin Freeman, Chris  
Carrawell and the rest of the U.S. men's basketball team at the 
World University Games eventually might prove to be worthy heirs to 
their predecessors, winners of five straight gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	They just didn't look like it Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, a member of Connecticut's NCAA champions, scored 18  
points as the United States struggled for a half before beating 
South Korea 96-77 in the opening game for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team will try to play its best against us, every game we  
have a target on our chests,'' U.S. coach Oliver Purnell said. 
``The scary part of a tournament like this is that we haven't seen 
any of these teams play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea, giving away much height and strength, traded the  
lead with the Americans early in the game with the help of good 
outside shooting. Jung-Lae Lee's 3-pointer at the start of the 
second half brought the Koreans within 43-39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans have four players with NCAA Final Four experience,  
but the team seemed to play down to the game's setting: a tiny gym 
with tattered nets and plastic deck chairs that served as benches. 
</P>
<P>
	Tougher perimeter defense in the second half and a strong inside  
game helped the United States pull away with runs of 16-6 and 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going into games blind, and their style was difficult  
for us to match up with,'' said Purnell, who coaches at Dayton and 
had less than two weeks to prepare his players for this tournament. 
``We showed versatility adjusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan and league scoring champion Allen  
Iverson are among the current NBA stars who helped build the U.S. 
University Games winning streak that the current crop extended to 
33 games Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see that everyone before you has won, you don't want  
to be the ones that lose,'' said North Carolina center Brendan 
Haywood, who had 15 points and nine rebounds before fouling out 
with 4:04 to play. Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin also had 15 points, 
while Duke's Carrawell had eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States faces Nigeria, a 66-61 loser to Lithuania, on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain turned in the most dominating performance, a 113-51  
victory over Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 athletes will participate in 12 sports at the games,  
which officially opened Saturday night with a torch-lighting 
ceremony at the new $25 million Son Moix Stadium. The games close 
July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The first gold medal went to Russia in the women's team  
gymnastics competition, as all-around world champion Svetlana 
Khorkina led the way. The Russians totaled 113.487 points for the 
four disciplines. Ukraine took the silver with 112.974. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team was fifth with 109.012 points. Three Americans,  
led by ninth-place Heidi Louise Moneymaker, had individual scores 
among the top 24 and qualified for Monday's all-around competition. 
Moneymaker, a UCLA senior, was third at the NCAA Championships in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's volleyball, the United States beat Norway 25-17, 25-11,  
25-13.

<HEADLINE> Course Architect Jones Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Renowned golf course architect  
Robert Trent Jones was resting comfortably Saturday, four days 
after being hospitalized for an undisclosed condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 93, entered Holy Cross Hospital on Wednesday and his  
condition is not critical, a hospital spokeswoman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. She would not disclose the reason for his 
hospitalization, citing confidentiality guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Sportsline, on its GolfWeb site, reported that Jones  
suffered a stroke and is paralyzed on his left side. Sons Robert 
Jr. and Rees, noted golf architects in their own right, were 
summoned to Florida to see him, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left by The Associated Press at companies run  
by Robert Jr. and Rees Jones were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has designed or rebuilt some 400 golf courses in 43 states  
and 34 countries during a career that has spanned seven decades. 
More than three dozen have played host to national or international 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his best-known courses are Peachtree Golf Club in Atlanta;  
Spyglass Hill in Pebble Beach, Calif.; Firestone Country Club in 
Akron, Ohio; Hazeltine National in Chaska, Minn.; and Valderrama in 
Sotogrande, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	He also left his mark on redesigns at Augusta National, site of  
the Masters, and four U.S. Open sites -- Baltusrol Golf Club in 
Springfield, N.J., Oakland Hills Country Club in Birmingham, Mich.; 
Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y., and The Olympic Club in 
San Francisco.

<P>
	More than 50,000 people attended the first meet at the Stade de  
France, the site of several games of last year's soccer World Cup. 
A European record in the women's pole vault highlighted the meet 
but was overshadowed by Bailey's poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey held the world record of 9.84 seconds in the 100 until  
Maurice Greene broke it with 9.79 two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey ruptured an Achilles tendon playing basketball last  
September and has been unimpressive in races this season, including 
a third in the Canadian championships last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Dwain Chambers won Saturday's race in 10.12. Bailey  
ran 10.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The top performance came in the women's 100 hurdles, with  
Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina beating a strong field in a season best 
of 12.47. U.S. champion Gail Devers was second in 12.58 and 
finished fifth in the 100, which was won by Ukraine's Zhanna 
Pintesevich in 10.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's Angela Balachnova cleared 14 feet, 11 inches, in the  
women's pole vault, bettering the record she set last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Javier Sotomayor won the men's high jump at 7-8.  
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 200, the Bahamas' Debbie Ferguson beat French  
star Christine Arron in 22.19.

<HEADLINE> Boat Crash Kills 2, Several Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- Two boats collided on the St. Croix River  
early Saturday, killing two men. Five to seven people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened shortly after witnesses saw a 28-foot boat  
with five to six people aboard leave PD Pappy's, a waterfront bar 
and restaurant, Sheriff Jim Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat struck a 22-foot power boat, taking out an entire side.  
Two men aboard that boat died of head and neck injuries, and there 
may have been a third person aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragedy that we lost two people,'' Frank said.  
``There's probably five to seven more gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The area, about 25 miles east of Minneapolis, is a popular  
boating destination, especially during the Fourth of July weekend. 
Campfires dot the shoreline at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue crews raised the bigger boat from the water Saturday  
afternoon. The vessel was about two weeks old and had no 
registration, Frank said, making it difficult to identify those who 
were on it when it went down. It had a large hole on its left side. 
</P>
<P>
	The murky water in the river was also making the search for  
bodies difficult. Divers planned to use sonar to aid their efforts 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash has not been determined.

<HEADLINE>  Pele Torn by U.S.-Brazil Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- He's the greatest player from the most  
successful soccer nation, Brazil. He's the man who sparked the 
development of the sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	So who better to analyze Sunday's Women's World Cup semifinal  
between the Americans and Brazilians than Pele? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a very difficult situation,'' Pele said Saturday in an  
exclusive interview with The Associated Press. ``My heart is with 
Brazil, but on the other hand, I'm very happy the U.S. team has 
done so well. I was active with my soccer camps years ago and 
teaching the `beautiful game' to young girls across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This leaves me in a very emotional state. I only wish this was  
the final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final will be at the Rose Bowl next Saturday, with the  
winner of the China-Norway semifinal meeting the survivor from 
Stanford Stadium. Pele, who is the soccer spokesman for official 
sponsor MasterCard, hopes to see either Brazil or the United States 
win at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, however, he is reliving the emotions of July 4, 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember feeling this way five years ago during the men's  
World Cup '94, when Brazil played the U.S. in the second round,'' 
Pele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil won that game 1-0 and went on to win its fourth world  
title, a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele was a guiding force for U.S. soccer during the 1970s. After  
leading Brazil to its first three World Cup titles, he joined the 
Cosmos of the North American Soccer League and started a soccer 
boom on the professional level that lasted into the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, his work through clinics and as an ambassador  
for the sport was instrumental in establishing grass roots 
programs. Those programs produced the players who will take the 
field Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	And he likes what he is seeing on the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased to see how much attention the tournament has  
received worldwide,'' Pele said. ``The level of play has been 
fantastic, very open, just the way I like it. This tournament no 
doubt will provide a tremendous lift to women's soccer around the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the makeup of the teams, Pele sees something very  
special: inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil showed a lot of heart after allowing Nigeria to tie the  
game,'' he said of the Brazilians' 4-3 overtime victory in the 
quarterfinals after they blew a 3-0 halftime lead. ``Sissi has been 
a true leader and the key to Brazil's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will need to shore up the defense against the Americans  
in order to keep it close, because the U.S. team has so many strong 
finishers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Americans have displayed great depth, always a key  
to going far in a tournament involving five games in two weeks just 
to get to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Brazil, they have a big star.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mia Hamm, she is terrific to watch,'' Pele said. ``She has  
great ball control and moves so well on the field, always sure of 
herself. She plays the game with Brazilian flair and style. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. also showed tremendous heart and a great will to win  
against the Germans. Their bench is very solid, with players like 
Shannon Macmillan, who seems to be in the right place at the right 
time -- all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who does Pele favor for this final that is causing him so  
much emotional distress? 
</P>
<P>
	Silence. He'll just watch and enjoy.

<HEADLINE> Indians Put Karsay on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steve Karsay, the Cleveland Indians' most  
effective relief pitcher this season, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list Saturday with a strained left oblique muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay (7-1) was hurt Thursday night when he felt a sharp pain  
in his left side after retiring Minnesota's Corey Koskie on a 
grounder to first in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was made retroactive to Friday. Right-hander Jeff Tam  
was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo to replace Karsay on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, 27, has a 2.63 earned run average in a team-high 37  
games. He has pitched 54 2/3 innings, second among all relievers in 
the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like somebody stuck something in my side,'' Karsay  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander had been on the DL three times before because  
of elbow injuries and surgeries. He had ``Tommy John'' surgery on 
his elbow in 1997 and has never pitched more than 133 innings in 
one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tam, 28, claimed off waivers from the New York Mets on June 18,  
has a combined 1-2 record and 3.00 ERA in 22 games with Buffalo and 
Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Sapphire n'Silk Wins Prioress Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jockey Pat Day rode Sapphire n'Silk to a  
two-length victory in Saturday's 52nd running of the $150,000 
Prioress Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Day's second straight win in the Prioress Stakes after he  
won aboard Hurricane Bertie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Marley Vale finished second on Saturday, three lengths ahead of  
Confessional. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapphire n'Silk carried 121 pounds six furlongs in 1:09 2-5 to  
earn the $90,000 winner's share. It was the fourth win in five 
career starts of the daughter of Pleasant Tap. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapphire n'Silk returned $7.30, $3.80 and $3.30. Marley Vale  
paid $4.60 and $3.80 and Confessional was $5.90 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob'n Gin took only 1:32 4-5 to carry Jorge Chavez and 118  
pounds a mile to win the co-featured 15th running of the Poker. It 
was the third-fastest time in the history of the Poker, bettered 
only by Elusive Quality's track record 1:31 3-5 last year and the 
1:32 3-5 recorded by Dominant Prospect in 1994. Bomfim was second 
of eight in the Poker two lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was Rob'n Gin's first in four starts this year. With it  
he earned the $69,120 winner's share of the $115,200 purse for 
Sabine Stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob'n Gin returned $5.40, $3.10 and $2.50. Bomfim paid $3.80 and  
$2.70 and Wised Up was $4.50 to show.

<HEADLINE> Minorities Shot at in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former college basketball coach was slain and  
six Orthodox Jews were wounded in a series of drive-by shootings 
that may have been committed by the same person, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities appeared to be targeted in the crimes Friday night,  
and each shooting was linked to a blue car. Two Asian-Americans 
were shot at as they rode in their vehicle but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate arrests. The shootings -- all within  
approximately 12 miles of each other -- began in the northern 
Chicago neighborhood of Rogers Park and ended in the suburbs of 
Skokie and Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Byrdsong, who was fired as basketball coach by  
Northwestern University in 1997, was shot in the back as he jogged 
with his children near his home in suburban Skokie. He died at 
Evanston Hospital early today following surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Skokie police Lt. Barry Silverberg said at least seven shots  
were fired at Byrdsong, a 42-year-old black man. His children were 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the shots appear to have come from a light blue car.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Orthodox Jews were wounded in six separate  
locations as they walked home from Sabbath services in Rogers Park. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the wounds was considered life threatening. One man and  
a 15-year-old boy were in serious condition, two men were in fair 
condition and two others were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person in the neighborhood was shot at but was not  
wounded as the bullet passed through the person's clothing, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told Chicago police all of the shots came from a blue  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final incident, Northbrook police said a motorist pulled  
up beside another car on a major thoroughfare and fired several 
shots at the two Asian-Americans inside. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message from Northbrook police said the shots came  
from a light blue car. The driver was said to be a white man in his 
30s. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Pat Camden said today that ``preliminary  
indications seem to indicate'' that the shootings were the work of 
one person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shell casings from three locations that will be  
analyzed and will tell us if the offender is one and the same,'' 
Camden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong was fired after four unsuccessful and occasionally odd  
seasons with the Wildcats. During one 1994 game at the University 
of Minnesota, Byrdsong roamed the stands, chatting with fans and 
waving to the crowd while an assistant led the team. He was kicked 
out of a seat as the crowd chanted ``Byrdsong's nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bizarre motivational ploy by a man feeling the  
pressures of big-time college basketball. Byrdsong took a 12-day 
leave after that game, consulting doctors about his mental and 
physical health. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong's four-year record at Northwestern was 34-78, including  
10-62 in the Big Ten Conference. His 1995 team was linked to a 
point-shaving scandal, but government prosecutors said he was 
ignorant of the scheme.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Graf in Wimbledon Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- On the surface she once thought  
suitable only for grazing cows, Lindsay Davenport reclaimed the No. 
1 ranking and reached her first Wimbledon final against seven-time 
champion Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and Graf put the brakes on the rocket rise of two of  
the most talented teens to come along in recent years, 18-year-old 
Alexandra Stevenson and 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's wondrous Wimbledon debut ended Saturday with a 6-1,  
6-1 drubbing by Davenport, whose deep, flat groundstrokes pinned 
her behind the baseline and kept her from charging the net as she 
had against everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic, at No. 134 the lowest-ranked woman to reach a Grand Slam  
semifinal, gave Graf a scare but succumbed 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-3 after 
the 30-year-old German strung together five straight games from 4-4 
in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	While Davenport will be seeking her second Grand Slam title,  
Graf will be going for her 23rd a month after capturing her sixth 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than amazed and surprised,'' Graf said of her surge  
back toward the top of tennis after missing most of 1997 and 1998 
with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport won the first 11 points in her 48-minute romp over  
Stevenson, then let loose a scream of delight when she closed out 
the last game at love with four straight service winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' she said of the scream, ``was winning 1 and 1 in the  
semifinals, getting to my first Wimbledon final, and doing it on a 
surface I used to hate in '93 and '94.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Davenport had never gone beyond the Wimbledon  
quarterfinals in six appearances, losing twice in the second round, 
once in the third and once in the fourth. She grew up on hardcourts 
in California, and won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta and the 
U.S. Open last year on that surface. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davenport overcame her aversion for the slippery nature of  
grass, and came to Wimbledon this year with a different attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get to the Wimbledon final, it just means so much to me,''  
she said. ``I came into this tournament being relatively 
overlooked, but knowing myself that I was playing well. I knew that 
I can beat every player when I'm playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually didn't think about the No. 1 ranking until I got  
back to the locker room, and I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, I got it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport finished 1998 as No. 1 and held that spot for 17 weeks  
before Martina Hingis took it back on Feb. 8. With Hingis losing in 
the first round at Wimbledon, Davenport will be No. 1 again in the 
new rankings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's mother, Samantha, blamed the loss in part on her  
daughter having a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just didn't have the serve, she didn't have her gun,''  
Samantha Stevenson said. ``Her shoulder was sore after playing so 
many matches, but we didn't want to say anything. We wanted to keep 
it quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alexandra Stevenson rejected that excuse, saying her  
shoulder felt ``OK.'' Her coach, Craig Kardon, also said there was 
nothing wrong with her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``My serve wasn't my serve today,'' she said. ``It's not going  
to happen again. I'm going out to practice hitting a lot more 
serves. It's just that it was a tough match. Lindsay played very 
well and showed she's No. 1. I didn't feel nervous out there. I 
rushed a lot. I was rushing everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport had some sharp words for Stevenson's mother, who has  
stirred controversy with her allegations of racism and lesbianism 
on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if she's doing it for attention or just saying  
these things, because they sound crazy, some of them,'' Davenport 
said. ``All this stuff that she's calling all of us ... I don't 
think the players really appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her daughter is a great girl, she's smart and she can play  
tennis. She should just leave her alone and not bring her into all 
these controversies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson also claimed Davenport was scared before the  
match, a suggestion that made Davenport laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I wasn't scared,'' she said. ``Actually, I kind of wanted  
to play Stevenson more than (Jelena) Dokic. Dokic is really fast, 
gets a lot of balls back, keeps the ball really low. Stevenson can 
make a ton of errors and doesn't move particularly well. I knew if 
I hit a few good shots, maybe the point was won. And if I could 
return her serve, I felt pretty comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, who graduated from high school last month, was  
considered little more than a promising talent two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 86, she won three qualifying matches to get into the  
main draw. Then she swept through five matches to make the 
semifinals on tennis' biggest stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other player, John McEnroe in 1978, ever reached the  
Wimbledon semifinals as a qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's remarkable run came despite numerous questions that  
her natural father might be basketball great Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility was raised last week when the Sun-Sentinel of  
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., published a copy of her birth certificate. 
Though it listed her father as Julius Winfield Erving II, Erving's 
legal name, he initially denied being her father. On Friday, the 
Hall of Famer confirmed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic's low ranking didn't reflect the strength and maturity of  
her game. She continuously put pressure on Graf's serve with return 
winners, and in the first set alone there were eight breaks of 
serve. In the tiebreak, Lucic overpowered Graf with a series of 
punishing groundstroke winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gives absolutely no rhythm,'' Graf said, describing  
Lucic's go-for-broke style. ``She played some incredible shots, and 
she made easy mistakes. Obviously she likes pace and taking charge 
of the points, and she did that very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one break in the second set, with Lucic losing  
serve in the final game. She blew an easy forehand volley on set 
point, slapping the ball wide. 
</P>
<P>
	From 4-4 in the second set, Graf won five straight games to go  
up 3-0 in the third set. Lucic had a chance to break back with Graf 
serving for the match at 5-3, 15-30. But she netted an easy 
backhand volley at the net, sailed a forehand way long and 
surrendered the match by netting a forehand return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience is always important,'' Graf said, ``but the way she  
was going for her shots, she really took a lot of risk. It didn't 
seem like she was getting nervous at any stage, and that's very 
impressive to me.''

<HEADLINE> American Chosen To Head Interpol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Clinton administration official was  
chosen as the next head of Interpol, and if confirmed will be the 
first American to lead the international police organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpol's executive board nominated former Treasury  
Undersecretary Ronald K. Noble on Friday as secretary general of 
the 177-member organization. Formal ratification is expected in 
November, and Noble is scheduled to take over next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer's bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa is a case in  
point of why the United States needs to participate in 
international crime fighting, Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding ... our citizens are in need of great police  
work wherever they might go,'' Noble said in a telephone interview 
from Lyon, France, where Interpol is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble, 42, is a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at New  
York University Law School. As Treasury undersecretary for 
enforcement from 1993 to 1996, he was in charge of the Secret 
Service, the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpol, known formally as the International Criminal Police  
Organization, was founded in 1923 to track fugitives and 
investigate international crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble was picked from a field of eight candidates to succeed  
Raymond E. Kendall of Britain, who has held the post for 14 years.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Fed Up With Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- There is further evidence that the  
American public is getting fed up with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority, 53 percent, of those questioned in a survey  
sponsored by the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University 
believe the press has too much freedom. That's an increase of 15 
percentage points since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a humbling reminder that fundamental rights of expression  
can disappear if the press and public are not vigilant,'' said Ken 
Paulson, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, released Friday to coincide with the July 4th  
weekend, explores American commitment to the 45-word First 
Amendment that guarantees freedoms of religion, speech, the press, 
petition and assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll shows most Americans celebrate the 208-year-old  
freedoms but are not entirely comfortable with them, particularly 
when practiced on emotionally charged issues such as burning the 
American flag, school prayer, sexually explicit material on the 
Internet, public display of offensive art and protests by groups 
such as white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll identified freedom of speech as one of the most  
cherished of constitutional rights, followed by freedom of religion 
and the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, when asked to name any of the specific rights  
guaranteed by the First Amendment, 49 percent could not. 
Sixty-three percent said their own knowledge of the amendment was 
poor or ``only fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That worries some constitutional scholars.  
</P>
<P>
	``Those who follow such things know that the First Amendment is  
under incredible assault on a daily basis, whether from adverse 
court decisions, proposed laws, scholarly studies or citizen 
initiatives,'' Paul McMasters, the center's ombudsman for the First 
Amendment, wrote in an analysis of the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``... The evidence is substantial that the state of the First  
Amendment is not good. Further, we must be mindful that where 
attitudes go, action is seldom far behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freedom of the press took the hardest hit in the survey, which  
McMasters said indicates ``the news media is in deep trouble with 
the American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 65 percent said newspapers should be able to publish freely  
without government approval of a story -- down from 80 percent in 
the 1997 survey. 
</P>
<P>
	By notable majorities, Americans also said the news media should  
not be allowed to endorse or criticize political candidates, use 
hidden cameras for newsgathering or publish government secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Even student journalists suffer from the fallout. Support for  
high school newspapers being able to print controversial material 
went from 45 percent in 1997 to 37 percent in the current poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey doesn't address why,'' Paulson said, ``but common  
sense tells you the airwaves and newspaper columns have been filled 
with Monica Lewinsky, Marv Albert and the aftermath of the O.J. 
Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all contributed to a sense that the American press has  
lost its perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted in February and March, was based on  
telephone interviews with 1,001 adults by the Center for Survey 
Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut. Margin of 
error is plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Spending Bill Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Democratic senators from farm states  
helped slow an agriculture spending bill in a fight over managed 
health care, upsetting some Republican colleagues and farm 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	A compromise last week will allow lawmakers to consider the  
patients' rights legislation independently of the agriculture bill 
when Congress returns from its Fourth of July break. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the maneuvering by Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and  
Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota, did not go 
without comment. Dorgan offered an amendment that would place more 
controls on HMOs and Daschle helped with Senate floor procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when we're starting to make progress ... we get undercut  
by our own colleagues from agricultural states,'' complained Rep. 
John Thune, R-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Held, administrative director for the South Dakota Farm  
Bureau, said he was surprised to see farm state Democrats behind 
the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked ... especially after all of the rhetoric about  
which side was doing the most for farmers and ranchers,'' Held 
said. ``I thought they would let someone from a non-farm state 
bring it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dennis Wiese, president of the South Dakota Farmers  
Union, defended Democrats' actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No harm is being done. That (health care) would be an extra  
bone we could gain,'' Wiese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats counter that health care is a crucial issue in rural  
America, and they note the spending bill does not take effect until 
Oct. 1, so there is plenty of time for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accuse Republicans of showing little sympathy for  
farmers trying to cope with record low prices and failing to 
support a $6.5 billion emergency aid package that Dorgan and Sen. 
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, want to add to the agriculture spending 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were especially critical of Republicans for their  
recent rally at the Capitol, where, against a backdrop of farm 
tractors, they said Democrats were slighting farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's absolutely without any basis,'' Daschle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said he was angered by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., and ``all these folks out there that wouldn't know a corn 
cob from a corn dog telling us about agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans have said they believe additional money is  
needed for farmers -- but they do not want to pass it until 
President Clinton makes a formal request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received any request from the administration as to  
a number,'' said Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accuse Republicans of stalling, saying GOP leaders  
agreed to additional defense money in a recent supplemental bill -- 
despite Clinton's request for less of an increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not willing to support the kind of emergency support  
that we've been advocating,'' Daschle said. ``I think the big 
question is can we make it a better bill.''

<HEADLINE> Look at Tour de France Prologue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A look at Saturday's first stage of the 86th Tour  
de France: 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAGE:* Prologue, 4 1/4-mile time trial in Puy-de-Fou, France.  
</P>
<P>
	 *STAGE WINNER:* Lance Armstrong, United States. Armstrong, a  
two-time Olympian who has returned to racing after overcoming 
testicular cancer, marked another notch in his comeback, winning 
the prologue in 8 minutes, 2 1/2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOW OTHERS FARED:* Alex Zulle, Switzerland, was second, seven  
seconds back; Britain's Chris Boardman, last year's prologue 
winner, was fifth, 16 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOUR TIDBITS:* Many top riders are missing this year, notably  
the last three winners, Italy's Marco Pantani, Denmark's Bjarne 
Riis and Germany's Jan Ullrich. Pantani was disqualified from the 
recent Tour of Italy after a blood test seemed to indicate he was 
using a stamina-increasing drug. Riis and Ullrich are injured. The 
top-ranked rider in the world, Laurent Jalabert of France, is 
boycotting the race to protest the treatment of riders. ... Last 
year's third-place overall finisher, American Bobby Julich of the 
Cofidis team, was 27th in the prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUOTE OF THE DAY:* ``With my problems, my history, it is  
incredible. The Tour de France is the greatest race in the world.'' 
-- Lance Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEXT STAGE:* First stage: Montaigu to Challans (129 miles).

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Burn Caps for Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bad bullpens are often called arson squads.  
On Saturday, there were some real flames in the Los Angeles 
Dodgers' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours before Saturday's game against San Francisco,  
Dodgers players gathered in their bullpen and burned the white caps 
the club adopted in spring training along with other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, whose $79.2 million payroll was baseball's  
second-highest on opening day, lost 9-1 and has dropped six 
straight for the first time since May 16-21, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The last-place Dodgers fell 10 games below .500 (34-44) for the  
first time since finishing the 1992 season 63-99. They have lost 
nine of 11 and 11 of 15, falling 10 1/2 games behind first-place San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Davey Johnson said Kevin Brown and Gary Sheffield came  
up with the idea in an attempt to change the team's luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a weight has been lifted off all our shoulders  
now,'' outfielder Trenidad Hubbard said after the burning. ``Let 
the winning commence. It's time to rid ourselves of our 
unproductive evil past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Dodger players did not want to talk about the bonfire.  
Brown and Sheffield declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no point in talking about it,'' right fielder Raul  
Mondesi said. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the Dodger front office, who didn't want to be  
identified, walked around the clubhouse smoking a huge cigar and 
blew smoke in every corner of the clubhouse, saying he was chasing 
evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	It's more likely that the Dodgers' anemic hitting and porous  
pitching is the reason for the collapse. During the losing streak, 
the Dodgers have been outscore, 44-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just hard to imagine that things would happen this way  
for us,'' Sheffield said. ``I'm not usually one to bring home what 
happens at the ballpark, but I've been bringing it home a lot this 
season. I've spent a lot of time trying to analyze what's going on. 
It's hard trying to figure this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, naturally, don't feel for their rivals.  
</P>
<P>
	``The worse they play, the better it is for us,'' San Francisco  
manager Dusty Baker said. ``You don't get any sympathy in this 
game. They have some good guys over there, but they haven't been 
able to get the job done.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Hayes on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- San Francisco Giants third baseman Charlie  
Hayes was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday and probably 
will have surgery on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes will return to San Francisco on Sunday to be examined by  
hand specialist Gordon Brody. If the examination goes as expected, 
Giants manager Dusty Baker said Hayes will have arthroscopic 
surgery Monday to have loose cartilage removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just looks like it's time to get it done,'' Hayes said. ``I  
had an MRI (Friday) and it showed the piece of cartilage in there. 
Every time I bend the wrist, it pinches. Hopefully, I can come back 
the last couple months of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he has surgery, Hayes is expected to be out 3-4 weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Hayes was hurt during the first week of the regular season while  
making a play against San Diego. He's played in pain since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes is hitting .183 in 61 games with two homes with 31 RBIs.  
He went 6-for-18 (.333) in his last 10 games, but had hit only .139 
(14-for-101) in his previous 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been playing hurt since the end of spring training,''  
Baker said. ``We thought we'd have time to get him well. Then our 
regular third baseman, Bill Mueller, got hurt in his first at-bat 
of the year and we had to press Charlie into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's continued to be a run producer. It's tough to drive in  
runs when you're hitting under .200. It's time for him to get this 
taken care of. They can scope it, so hopefully he'll be out less 
than a month. He's one of our most positive spiritual leaders. He's 
been hurting, but you see him going around every day asking other 
guys how they're doing. We need him back.''

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Cajuns Celebrate Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- Teachers scolded Ruby Melancon and  
classmates constantly teased her because she spoke only French when 
she started school in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun country. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always said we were stupid, poor and uneducated,'' said  
Ms. Melancon, who has now spoken English for 63 of her 69 years, 
but still has a French accent. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's cool to be Cajun, and they're planning their second  
Congres Mondial Acadien Louisiane, or World Acadian Congress 
Louisiana, for tens of thousands of French-speaking Americans and 
Canadians, plus friends and relatives from as far away as Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	After generations of discrimination, Cajun culture has become  
famous worldwide for its spicy food and foot-stomping fiddle music. 
And instead of the harassment that Ms. Melancon suffered, 
kindergartners in Lafayette now get intensive French classes to 
preserve their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers bill the Congres as the world's largest gathering of  
Acadians, a series of family reunions, conferences and concerts 
during this month and August. The first was held in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so glad I lived long enough for it to be stylish to  
be a Cajun,'' said Ms. Melancon, who will host one of the 83 family 
reunions, some of them scheduled to last days and draw thousands of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	For some people with Acadian roots from other states, eastern  
Canada and Europe, it will be their first visit to the rich, flat 
farmland and marshy bayou country of southern Louisiana known as 
``Acadiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a time for them to learn about their history, and  
show others they don't deserve being stereotyped as uncouth people 
who live in swamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to see how well we've done in Louisiana, even  
though we were kicked out of Canada,'' said Waylon Thibodeaux, 
``Louisiana's Rockin' Fiddler'' and the winner of a contest to 
perform the Congres' theme song. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say Cajuns should be seen as survivors who maintained  
their unique identity despite extreme hardships and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Acadians settled in Nova Scotia, but were rounded up  
by the British in the 1760s after they refused to declare 
allegiance to England. About 10,000 were deported and 3,000 ended 
up in Louisiana, then a Spanish territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Acadians -- mainly fishermen, farmers and trappers -- carved  
out an existence in a part of America few others wanted to settle, 
said Carl Brasseaux, a history professor at the University of 
Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one who didn't have to came here voluntarily,'' Brasseaux  
said. ``You had to face alligators, serpents and mosquitoes, yellow 
fever and endemic malaria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Acadians thrived, and now about 700,000 of Louisiana's 4  
million residents say they have Cajun or Acadian roots, Brasseaux 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The journey toward mainstream acceptance was difficult. In 1921,  
all languages except English were banned in Louisiana's state 
constitution. Teachers belittled and punished children for speaking 
French and business owners banned their employees from speaking the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	The language suppression helped reinforce the viewpoint that  
Cajuns were backward and different. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were seen as primitive swamp dwellers, in much the same  
way poor whites were viewed in Appalachia,'' Brasseaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that times have changed, and Cajuns have gotten widespread  
respect with the promotion of their food and music, many Cajuns say 
their biggest challenge is making sure young people continue 
learning French. For example, Thibodeaux sings in French but 
doesn't speak it well. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Reid constantly tries to get her grandchildren to say  
``merci'' instead of ``thank you.'' She's also feverishly 
organizing one of the family reunions, for the Baudoin family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to say thank you to our ancestors for making us  
what we are today,'' Reid said with a smile and a thick Cajun 
accent. ``We were dumped here and had nothing but hard times, but 
we survived.''

<HEADLINE> Island Fantasy Wins Meadowlands Prep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Island Fantasy and Badlands Hanover  
dueled to the wire, with Island Fantasy hanging on for his first 
victory of the year, winning Saturday night's preview of the 
upcoming Meadowlands Pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Island Fantasy, the 1998 2-year-old pacer of the year, prevailed  
by a neck at the wire in the $30,000 3-year-old open, paying $4.60, 
$2.60 and $2.20. He covered the mile in a lifetime best 1:50.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover finished second by a head for the second  
straight week to pay $2.40 and $2.10. Washington VC, three lengths 
back in third, was worth $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``He raced very well,'' Mike Lachance, the winning driver, said.  
``He gives it his all out there. I brushed him hard to the third 
quarter to tighten him up because he's going to have to be ready 
for next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million Meadowlands Pace is scheduled for July 17, and  
the eliminations are next Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Vs. U.S. in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Five years to the day since the U.S.  
national soccer team sought to make World Cup history against 
Brazil, it will do so again. 
</P>
<P>
	With just the slightest difference: gender.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and maybe one other: The Americans are favored.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the U.S. women play their semifinal match at Stanford  
Stadium against the Brazilians. At the same site in the 1994 men's 
tournament, Brazil edged the United States 1-0. It went on to win 
its fourth world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women remember that game well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Going back to 1994, well, as some of you know I am a huge  
soccer fanatic,'' defender Brandi Chastain said Friday after most 
of the U.S. squad was given the day off, ``so I did a lot of 
traveling that summer to all the games in California. Today I had a 
flashback as the bus was driving in on the Embarcadero of me 
driving to the USA-Brazil match in 1994 with a big American flag 
draped on my car. And I was thinking how exciting it is to have 
people driving that same route to come see us play in such a 
similar and important game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The '94 game was considered the most significant in U.S. soccer  
history. This match has the makings of such import, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. men did very well in that game, almost falling back  
into a bunker style defense,'' midfielder Julie Foudy recalled. ``I 
remember it was hot. I remember the enthusiasm of the crowd and 
that it was just packed on July 4 and very patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping for that same kind of atmosphere, and I'm very  
confident we will achieve the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except they expect to win. Of course, so does Brazil, which blew  
a 3-0 lead to Nigeria before advancing on Sissi's overtime free 
kick goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans are very well trained and prepared for this  
championship,'' said Sissi, who leads the tournament with seven 
goals. ``We are the stage that whatever the results, we can hold 
our heads high and be proud of our results and the push for women's 
football in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``But yes, of course, we will approach the game with the  
Americans to win, and with confidence we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1994 Fourth of July extravaganza was a mere blip on  
the soccer screen for Brazil, it showed just how worked up 
Americans can get about what millions still consider ``a foreign 
sport.'' Organizers are hopeful for another sellout at Stanford, 
and believe a crowd of 30,000 is possible for the other semifinal, 
between Norway and China at Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an historic game for sure, and a very honorable game  
for the U.S. against the tournament champions,'' coach Tony DiCicco 
said of Brazil's tight victory five years ago. ``The game was in 
the balance for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``American's love the challenge of playing a team of that  
quality on the Fourth of July, and it's what we are looking for 
also. The only difference really is that the men's team had a lot 
of naturalized Americans on the field, and we will be a true 
All-American team. We are going to go after this victory as hard as 
any we have ever gone after.''

<HEADLINE> Harvard, Princeton Crews Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENLEY-ON-THAMES (AP) -- Harvard and Princeton crews rowed to  
victories at the Henley Regatta on Saturday and qualified for the 
semifinals of the Temple Cup for university eights. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard edged Dartmouth an all-American quarterfinal, while  
Princeton beat Oxford Brookes University by 2 3/4 lengths to advance 
to the final four. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Koven, former world sculling champion, rowing for the  
Riverside Boat Club of Boston, reached the final of the Diamond 
Sculls with a 2 3/4-length win over England's Richard Briscoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Koven, the defending champion, will face Germany's Marcel Hacker  
in the final. Hacker beat 1997 champion Greg Searle in his 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be an all-American final in the Wyfold Cup for double  
sculls between two crews from the Augusta Sculling Center, made up 
of national sculling crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	One crew, Conal Groom and Steve Tucker, was forced to wait seven  
hours before its semifinal because of a collision with a women's 
crew in the warm-up area. 
</P>
<P>
	The wait was worthwhile because the pair scored an easy victory  
over a local crew from Henley. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Augusta crew of Ian McGowan and Nick Peterson beat the  
London-based double from Auriol Kensington and Queen's Tower by 2 3/4 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	A third Augusta Center crew won twice Saturday in quadruple  
sculls. After beating an English composite crew from the Leander 
Club and University of London, the Americans took the semifinals 
over the Belgian national squad, racing as Nautische Sporten 
Oostende and Union Nautique de Liege. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's events, the U.S. national eights squad, competing  
as the Arco Training Center of San Diego, lost to the British 
national squad crew in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, winners of the inaugural Invitation Challenge  
last year, was edged by one length. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Ladies Plate for open eights, University of California  
earned a place in Sunday's final with a narrow win over an English 
composite from Nottinghamshire County and Oxford Brookes 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley crew will race another English composite crew from  
Cambridge University and Queen's Tower in the final.

<HEADLINE> Monument Honors Killed Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An aluminum sculpture honoring African slaves  
killed en route to America was dedicated Saturday before being 
dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a gravestone for the millions of bones on the ocean  
floor,'' said fashion designer Wayne James, the project's creator. 
</P>
<P>
	James, in a white gown, was one of dozens dressed in traditional  
African clothes for the blistering hot afternoon dedication 
ceremony in Harlem's Riverbank State Park. More than 500 people 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	The arch-shaped monument was created in the Virgin Islands by a  
multiracial cooperative of artists. The aluminum sculpture stands 
12 feet high and 17 feet wide, and was constructed in two parts -- 
symbolic of the past connecting with the future. 
</P>
<P>
	James and others involved in his Middle Passage Monument Project  
planned to lower the monument into the Atlantic Ocean precisely 427 
kilometers (265 miles) east of New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Each kilometer represents one of the bodies in an 18th-century  
African cemetery that was unearthed in Manhattan during 
construction of an office building in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Ducks' Selanne Not Hurt in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Teemu Selanne, the NHL's top goal  
scorer last season, escaped injury after crashing into a car driven 
by Finland's hockey chief, who was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne, a right wing for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks who turned 29  
Saturday, collided with a car driven by Kalervo Kummola, president 
of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation and a member of parliament. 
The accident happened Friday while Selanne was practicing for a 
road rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Kummola was accompanied by former NHL player Raimo Helminen, two  
of Selanne's friends from Anaheim, and the son of Selanne's 
co-driver. The other passengers also were brought to the hospital, 
where they were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Kummola was expected to recover from undisclosed injuries. He  
was being held at least over the weekend in a hospital near Ikalis, 
about 130 miles from Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Selanne's car was traveling 80-90 mph when it hit  
the other vehicle after the hockey star reversed direction. Police 
said Selanne probably would be charged with severely endangering 
the road safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incident was my fault,'' Selanne admitted. ``I was so  
eager going with the fantastic car that I forgot that one car was 
coming after me, and I turned and went off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne is known for his fondness for cars and fast driving, and  
has competed among professionals in three World Championship 
rallies in Finland and other endurance events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, accidents happen everyday in all areas of the  
world,'' Rob Scichili, a Mighty Ducks spokesman said. ``In this 
case, we are thankful that there were no major injuries to anyone 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne had 47 goals last season, his seventh in the NHL.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Heats Up Again in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The pitch was up and inside, one of those ugly  
balls that can send batters ducking for cover or make them contort 
their bodies as if they were rubber cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa saw something about that pitch he liked. When  
Slammin' Sammy sees a ball he likes, look out, because it won't be 
around for long. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, with one powerful swat, that ball was out of  
Wrigley Field in a shot, sailing over the wall in left field and 
bouncing down Waveland Avenue for the game-winner. Home run No. 30 
-- and the All-Star break was still two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he gets the barrel of the bat on the ball, it's amazing  
what that ball does,'' said Mickey Morandini, the Chicago Cubs' 
second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more amazing is that Sosa is having this kind of season  
again. After hitting 66 home runs last year and teaming with Mark 
McGwire for the greatest longball derby ever, Sosa hasn't dropped 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit his major league-leading 30th home run in his 74th game,  
just as he did last year. He's homered nine times in his last 17 
games, including a stretch of four straight contests, to power past 
Jose Canseco and Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I had a great year last year, but last year is over.  
This is a new year,'' said Sosa, last year's NL MVP. ``In that 
category, I'm never satisfied. I always stay humble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was unbelievable. But it doesn't make any difference  
if you come in here and don't do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for McGwire, well, things haven't gone quite so well. Unlike  
last summer, when he led the home-run race almost uninterrupted 
from start to finish on his way to 70, his 25 shots are fifth-best 
in the majors. His 66 RBIs are barely enough to get him on the NL 
leaders' list. 
</P>
<P>
	In McGwire's defense, he has been slowed by a series of  
injuries. But he doesn't seem any more comfortable with the crush 
of attention than he did last year. After ending a 32-at-bat slump 
with a three-run shot last month, he left the clubhouse without 
talking about the drought or the homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, on the other hand, will talk to just about anyone,  
anytime. Just like the popular song, he's ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' 
and loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
	There he was last Wednesday, showing his good friend President  
Clinton around the Cubs' clubhouse after hitting No. 30. There's a 
pile of cards, posters and balls for him to sign every day. He's 
followed by earsplitting chants of, ``Sam-mee! Sam-mee!'' whenever 
he steps on the field, and he leads the NL in voting for the 
All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run hop is back. So are the heart taps and kisses to  
his mother. The boy who once sold oranges and shined shoes in the 
Dominican Republic to help his family now has his own cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' he said when asked if he's having as much fun as  
it looks. ``I've been blessed by God in many different ways. It's 
great. I'm having fun because my family's great. My kids, my wife, 
everyone at home is great and I'm doing great. I don't have any 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, it would be much better if we were in a different place  
or if we start winning like the way we know we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was the first to tell everyone in spring training they  
shouldn't expect a repeat of last season. After all, Roger Maris' 
record of 61 homers stood for 37 years before McGwire and Sosa 
passed it. It would probably be years before anyone, even McGwire 
and Sosa, could match what they did in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But just like last year, as the temperature got hotter, so did  
Sosa. He hit 13 home runs in both May and June, best in the majors. 
He now has 30 home runs for a sixth season, second most in Cubs' 
history; Ernie Banks had seven 30-homer seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was batting .294 going into the weekend, with a slugging  
percentage of .645. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been outstanding,'' manager Jim Riggleman said. ``He's  
playing MVP-type baseball, not just All-Star baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Morandini: ``He's on pace to hit close to 60 again,  
probably. To do that one year, it's unbelievable. To do that two 
years in a row, it's almost sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sosa doesn't just hit homers. While Canseco can swing away  
as Tampa Bay's designated hitter, Sosa needs to do more for the 
Cubs, who are struggling at about .500. 
</P>
<P>
	He's driven in 67 runs and has drawn 34 walks. He's also made  
several nice defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other aspects of his game are overlooked,'' Morandini  
said. ``I've seen him when we've needed a base hit, get a base hit. 
Or when we've needed a walk to get on base and start something, 
he's drawn a walk. So there's a lot more than just power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take his swing. While most big hitters just rely on their  
strength to send the ball over the fence, Sosa has refined his 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his success last year came because he took hitting coach  
Jeff Pentland's advice. Sosa stopped swinging at pitches no one 
could hit and also started hitting to right field. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Pentland's seen an improvement in Sosa's hands. His  
swing is shorter, smoother and much quicker. It's become a pure 
stroke instead of a crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Sosa can still crush a ball, but he's got a finesse to his  
swing now that most power hitters lack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told him a couple of times this year, `You don't need me  
anymore. You've got a great handle on what you're doing,' '' 
Pentland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's sometimes scary to watch him work. To be around  
him and realize this guy is still getting better, he's still 
improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it should be, Sosa said. For as much fun as the  
home-run race was last year, taking Chicago to the playoffs for the 
first time since 1989 was even better. He wants the Cubs to be 
playing in October again, and he knows coasting on his numbers from 
last year won't get them there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what happens yesterday,'' he said. ``What's  
in the past is in the past. It's over; it's finished. You're never 
going to rewind it. You've got to go forward every day.''

<HEADLINE> Drought Behind Huge Md. Fish Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARNOLD, Md. (AP) -- Some 200,000 fish in two Chesapeake Bay  
tributaries have died in the past week, one of the state's worst 
fish kills in years and one authorities are blaming on a regional 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths in shallow creeks and coves of the Patapsco and  
Magothy rivers are due to low oxygen levels in the water, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such widespread oxygen depletion has not been seen in more than  
a decade, said Charles Poukish, an environmental specialist with 
the state Department of the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths affected all fish species living in the affected  
areas, including menhaden, silversides, perch, mummichogs, 
pickerel, catfish and sunfish. Most were young, between 2 or 3 
inches long. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have ruled out the influence of Pfiesteria piscicida,  
a toxic microbe blamed for wiping out huge numbers of fish in the 
Chesapeake Bay.

<HEADLINE> Navy Commander Can Stay in Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A Navy officer who was relieved of  
command on a destroyer after a female sailor accused him of sexual 
misconduct is being allowed to remain in the service. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy Board of Inquiry concluded last week that, while wrong,  
Cmdr. Thomas Rossi's behavior did not warrant a discharge. The 
board also noted his 19 years of outstanding service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossi, removed last October from his post on the USS John  
Hancock, is now stationed at the Naval War College in Newport, 
R.I., and will be eligible to retire with full pension when he 
completes his 20th year in the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer 3rd Class Laura Solomon, a former gunner's mate on  
the Hancock, accused Rossi of harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Solomon, 23, said that after bumping into Rossi last  
October at a Navy club in Virginia, while their ship was docked at 
Yorktown, she was summoned to Rossi's cabin on the Hancock and 
found him lying down, wearing shorts and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Solomon said he asked her about her marriage, suggested  
that she lie down, and kissed her. She said she left and 
immediately reported what had happened to the ship's senior 
enlisted member and executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Rossi later apologized.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Solomon's lawyer, Jay Howell, questioned the decision to  
let Rossi retire with full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is not enough to deter this kind of conduct in the  
future,'' he said. ``The Navy has an obligation to protect its 
sailors.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Closer Franco on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets closer John Franco was put on the  
15-day disabled list Saturday, a day after injuring his finger 
while mopping up the team's most lopsided shutout loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander strained a tendon on the middle finger of his  
pitching hand while pitching the ninth inning of the Mets' 16-0 
loss to Atlanta on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt something pop,'' he said before Saturday's game  
against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets trailed 12-0 when manager Bobby Valentine summoned the  
38-year-old reliever to get some work. Franco quickly gave up a 
run, and was pulled after a pair of two-out walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, the NL's career saves leader with 416, might have been  
in line for a spot on the All-Star team. Instead, he will be 
sidelined past the July 13 game at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco has converted 19 of 20 save opportunities this season. He  
is 0-2 with a 3.45 ERA in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Franco, the Mets will probably use Armando Benitez as  
their closer. He is 0-2 with three saves and a 1.50 ERA, along with 
67 strikeouts in 42 innings. Benitez led Baltimore with 22 saves 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets feature one of the best bullpens in the majors. Along  
with Dennis Cook, Turk Wendell and Greg McMichael, New York leads 
the NL with 26 saves and its relievers are second in the league 
behind Cincinnati with a 3.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefty Rigo Beltran was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to take  
Franco's spot. He was 1-1 with a 3.52 ERA in 14 games in two stints 
for the Mets this season, and 2-1 with a 1.69 ERA at Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> `Godfather' Author Mario Puzo Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Puzo was an obscure author saddled with a  
$20,000 debt and the task of supporting a wife and five children 
when he sat down to write his third novel. He decided that art was 
out and commerce was in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really time to grow up and sell out,'' Puzo recalled of  
those days in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo, who died Friday at the age 78, sold plenty: the 1969 book  
was ``The Godfather,'' which sold 21 million copies worldwide and 
spawned a pair of classic American films that collected nine 
Academy Awards. Before long, ``an offer he can't refuse'' was part 
of the American lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo, the Italian immigrants' son who turned the Corleones into  
the Mafia's first family of fiction, died of heart failure at his 
Long Island home. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Oscar winner, who wrote seven other novels and  
assorted Hollywood screenplays, had just completed the third book 
in his Mafia trilogy, ``Omerta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an absolutely wonderful man,'' said Francis Ford  
Coppola, director of the ``Godfather'' movies. ``This is a personal 
loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo, working on his vintage manual typewriter, conjured up his  
mob story without ever meeting a mobster. His Corleones mingled 
old-world Sicilian values with new-world American violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo and Coppola co-wrote the screenplays for ``The Godfather''  
and two sequels, earning Academy Awards in 1972 and 1974 for their 
work. The first two films each won the best-picture Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corleones were brought to life on screen by Marlon Brando as  
the Don, Vito Corleone, and James Caan, Al Pacino and John Cazale 
playing sons Sonny, Michael and Fredo. In ``The Godfather, Part 
II,'' Robert De Niro played the young Vito. 
</P>
<P>
	The first screenplay contained some of the classic lines in film  
history: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Don't ever take sides, with anyone, against the family.''  
</P>
<P>
	``His talent was obvious,'' said Caan, who played the volatile  
Sonny Corleone. ``I had the good fortune of working with him on 
`The Godfather,' and the misfortune of not knowing him better. ... 
He will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo's romanticized account of a Mafia family actually wound up  
influencing the real thing. Gambino family underboss Sammy ``The 
Bull'' Gravano, the turncoat antithesis of Puzo's tight-knit mob, 
once recalled the afternoon when he saw ``The Godfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I left that movie stunned,'' he remembered. ``I mean, I  
floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, 
that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a 
multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo was born Oct. 15, 1920, in New York's Hell's Kitchen, the  
son of illiterate Italian immigrants. His father deserted a wife 
and seven children when Puzo was 12, and the youth took a job with 
the New York Central Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	By age 16, Puzo had decided to become a writer but World War II  
interrupted. After serving in Germany, Puzo came home and began 
writing pulp stories for now-defunct men's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	His literary ambitions were much higher, and he published his  
first novel, ``The Dark Arena,'' in 1955. The Saturday Review 
praised Puzo as ``a new talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo spent nine years on his next book, ``The Fortunate  
Pilgrim,'' an autobiographical piece about the Italian immigrant 
experience. Although cited as ``a small classic'' by The New York 
Times Book Review, it languished. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 45 and in debt, Puzo took a $5,000 advance from Putnam and  
opted to forgo literature for a best seller. ```The Godfather' is 
not as good as the preceding two (novels),'' he once said bluntly. 
``I wrote it to make money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Godfather'' exploded to the top of the best-seller lists.  
Puzo was often asked if he had ties to organized crime -- and his 
answer was always no. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been preferable to be in the Mafia,'' he said in  
1996. ``I'm glad I'm a writer, but it's hard work. Nobody likes to 
work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writer and Puzo friend Gay Talese said ``The Godfather'' struck  
a powerful chord. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an America that has lost touch with family life, `The  
Godfather' book and `The Godfather' films emphasized the importance 
of family, the idea of fidelity to family and vengeful reaction to 
those who are disloyal to family,'' Talese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo's Oscar-winning work on the ``Godfather'' series led to  
other screenplays, including two Superman movies, ``The Cotton 
Club,'' and ``Christopher Columbus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo's other books included ``Fool's Die,'' a 1978 effort on  
casinos; the No. 1-best-seller ``The Sicilian'' in 1984; ``The 
Fourth K,'' a futuristic political thriller about a fictional 
member of the Kennedy family, in 1992; and ``The Last Don'' in 
1996, a return to his favorite topic, the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	That book became another runaway best-seller and was the basis  
for a highly rated television miniseries. It was also the second 
book in his Mafia trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo spent the last three years on ``Omerta,'' which is about a  
mob family on the brink of legitimacy. ``Omerta'' is the word for 
the mob's code of silence. The book is due out in July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	When not writing, Puzo lived what he liked to call the  
``bourgeois life,'' splitting time between his homes in Los Angeles 
and Long Island. He loved tennis, sports and gambling; he loved to 
visit Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzo is survived by his children, Anthony, Dorothy, Eugene,  
Virginia and Joseph; a sister, Evelyn Murphy, and brother, Anthony 
Cleri; his companion of 20 years, Carol Gino; and nine 
grandchildren. His wife, Erika, died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A private service was scheduled for Monday.

<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- It looks like Wimbledon will finish on  
time after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Once 150 matches behind schedule, the championship was catching  
up fast Saturday after two fine days and play on all 18 courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers had to schedule both singles finals Sunday, with  
Steffi Graf facing Lindsay Davenport in the women's final at noon -- 
two hours earlier than usual -- followed by Pete Sampras against 
Andre Agassi in the men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually the women's final is played Saturday and the men's  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weather office says that Sunday will start cloudy  
before brightening about the time the women's final starts. But 
there also is the risk of a light shower during the afternoon.

	Cops: Hate Motivates Chicago Shooter  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black former college basketball coach, several  
Orthodox Jews and two Asian Americans were all the targets of what 
police say is a lone white gunman motivated by racial hatred. The 
attacks were carried out over a distance of about 10 miles in 
Chicago and its suburbs, police said today. Former Northwestern 
University coach Ricky Byrdsong died after being shot in the back 
while walking with his children. The Jews, walking home from 
synagogue, were wounded but none of the injuries appeared to be 
life-threatening. No one else was hurt in the shootings last night, 
and no arrests have been made.

	NATO Nixes Russian Reinforcements

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO thwarted Russian attempts to fly  
reinforcements to its peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia because the 
Kremlin wants to revise the agreement giving Russia a role in 
policing the peace, alliance and U.S. officials said today. Russia 
wants to change an agreement reached in lengthy negotiations last 
month at Helsinki, Finland, that outlined Russian participation in 
a NATO-led peacekeeping force. NATO officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity said Russia wants to send some of its troops into 
sectors of Kosovo controlled by other NATO countries. Separately, 
Russia wants to water down NATO's command of Russian forces.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing a $1 trillion tax cut proposal, the  
Republican Party marked the Fourth of July holiday today by calling 
for ``financial independence'' for America's families. House 
Republicans say the federal budget surplus is so huge that Congress 
can cut taxes by nearly $1 trillion and still brace Social Security 
and Medicare for baby boomer retirements. Democrats and some 
moderate Republicans, however, say the surplus should first be used 
to increase spending on education and other programs once Medicare 
and Social Security are safeguarded and the national debt is 
erased.

Minister Bertie Ahern yesterday challenged the Ulster Unionists,

in Central Africa. The meeting was to be followed by a gathering of 
regional defense and foreign ministers to endorse concessions on 
several key points, Zambian mediators said. After meeting for six

who returned to racing after overcoming testicular cancer, scored a 
stunning personal triumph today by winning the prologue of the Tour 
de France. Riding for the U.S. Postal Service team, Armstrong won 
the 4 1/4-mile time trial in 8 minutes, 2.5 seconds, seven seconds 
ahead of Alex Zulle of Switzerland of the Banesto team. With the 
field wide open, Armstrong and French cycling star Richard 
Virenque, a top climber in good form, appear to be this year's 
favorites. Another top contender is last year's surprising 
third-place finisher, American Bobby Julich of the Cofidis team. He 
placed 22nd in the prologue.

<HEADLINE> No Brit Champ Again at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Maybe Britain will find a man to win  
Wimbledon in the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this rate, in 2001 I'll be the clear favorite,'' said  
Britain's Tim Henman, ousted Saturday in the semifinals by 
five-time champion Pete Sampras 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. It was Henman's 
second Wimbledon semifinal loss in two years to Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	The last British man to win Wimbledon was Fred Perry in 1936.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing,'' said Henman, who annually is built up  
wildly in the British tabloids as Wimbledon approaches. ``It's 
another semifinal and I lost to the better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Pat Rafter wasn't as let down as Henman about going  
out as Andre Agassi won 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was on for him,'' Rafter said. ``He was very  
strong. He was very powerful with everything he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``His serve was the best I've seen him serve -- very strong from  
the baseline. He never gave me a chance to control the points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Rafter's first Wimbledon semifinal after reaching the  
fourth round three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a step in the right direction,'' Rafter said. ``I've very  
happy to be in the semifinals here -- finally.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FATHER TALK:* Alexandra Stevenson isn't ready to talk about her  
father, former basketball star Julius Erving. She hasn't ruled it 
out, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, when I feel ready -- maybe,'' the 18-year-old  
Californian said Saturday, one day after Erving acknowledged he was 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about her parentage became an issue this week as  
she marched through the tournament -- with her highly visible 
mother, Samantha, by her side -- to become the first woman qualifier 
in Wimbledon history to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, who has answered only ``no comment'' to questions  
about Erving, was asked Saturday when she would be ready to talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW VOLVO:* What will Alexandra Stevenson do with the $154,700  
she won in her first tournament as a professional? 
</P>
<P>
	She'd like a Volvo convertible. First, she might buy her mother  
a washer and dryer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in an apartment building and we don't have our own,''  
Alexandra said. ``She's always complaining because the neighbors in 
the apartment come in and take her laundry out, so she wants her 
own instead of a communal one.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POOR JANA:* Last year, Jana Novotna earned $749,728, after  
winning the women's singles and doubles titles at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't have such a good payday this time. She lost in  
straight sets to Lindsay Davenport in the singles quarterfinals, 
and didn't make it to the doubles final when she and Larisa Nieland 
lost 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 to Mariaan de Swardt and Elena Tatarkova in 
Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport has a chance to match Novotna's double triumph Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	If she beats Steffi Graf in the singles final, she will collect  
$655,200, and if she and Corina Morariu defeat De Swardt and 
Tatarkova, she will get $134,216, a total of $789,416. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OTHER FINALS:* The top-seeded Indian doubles team of Mahesh  
Bhupathi and Leander Paes -- French Open winners -- are in the 
Wimbledon doubles final against No. 8-seeded Paul Haarhuis and 
Jared Palmer. In the boys' singles, Kristian Pless of Denmark faces 
Jurgen Melzer of Austria, and Iroda Tulyaganova Uzbekistan meets 
Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* If Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi win their  
finals Sunday, it will be the first time since 1925 that the same 
man and woman will hold the French Open and Wimbledon titles. ... 
Agassi vs. Pete Sampras will be the 13th all-American men's Grand 
Slam in the Open era and the fifth at Wimbledon. The last 
all-American Wimbledon final was in 1993, also on July 4, when 
Sampras beat Jim Courier. ... At least one American man has been in 
the final since 1992. ... Graf is trying to become the first woman 
to win the French and Wimbledon back-to-back five times. ... 
Lindsay Davenport is the first American-born woman in the final 
since Zina Garrison-Jackson in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Agassi in Wimbledon Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- From striplings in the juniors to  
finalists at Wimbledon in the twilight of their careers, Pete 
Sampras and Andre Agassi have stalked each other with fear and 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
	No one neutralizes Sampras' serve like Agassi. No one  
demoralizes Agassi and breaks down his ground game like Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	They meet again Sunday on Centre Court for the 24th time as  
pros, both seeking one more piece of history, one more piece of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made me a better player,'' Sampras said Saturday after  
a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 semifinal victory over Britain's Tim Henman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've caused a lot of grief for each other,'' said Agassi, who  
shredded the serve-and-volley game of two-time U.S. Open champion 
Patrick Rafter, 7-5, 7-6 (5), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras was No. 1 for six years. Agassi will take over the No. 1  
ranking on Monday, win or lose in their all-American final on the 
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is the defending Wimbledon champion and five-time  
winner. If he wins again, for the sixth time in seven years, he 
will tie Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam titles and pass 
Bjorn Borg to own more Wimbledon titles than any man in the open 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	If Agassi wins, he will become the first man since Borg in 1980  
to capture the French Open and Wimbledon back to back. At the 
French last month, Agassi became only the fifth man in history to 
complete a career Grand Slam, which included the 1992 Wimbledon 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously different in a lot of ways,'' Sampras said,  
``but we are similar. We are both hungry, competitive, want to win 
Slams. But as people, our lifestyles are as different as night and 
day. That doesn't mean we can't get along. When I see him in the 
locker room, it's not like he's the enemy. He is a competitor I 
have respected over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Agassi started beating him more frequently a few years ago,  
Sampras said, ``I had to add things to my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was controlling my service games, and I had to develop a  
backhand and chip and charge a little more,'' Sampras said. ``He is 
very tough to beat from the back. He can take my serve away, and 
not too many guys can do that consistently over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has a 13-10 record against Agassi. But they haven't met  
in a Grand Slam final since the 1995 U.S. Open, where Sampras won 
in four sets. In their only previous match at Wimbledon, Sampras 
won in five sets in the 1993 quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to see contrasts in play, contrasts in personality,  
two guys who have basically grown up together, and who somehow have 
managed to bring out the best in each other's game,'' Agassi said. 
``The stage is set. It's time to go out there and not miss our 
cue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They set that stage doing what they've always done best, Sampras  
punching volleys against Henman, Agassi counterpunching returns and 
groundstrokes against Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras struggled at the start, failing to hold serve until his  
third service game, for 2-4. But after getting treatment for a sore 
groin muscle on two changeovers early in the second set, Sampras 
took control. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, normally so stoic, even did a little dance when Henman  
double-faulted to concede the second set. He then won eight of the 
next nine points and cruised to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second set went away from me very quickly,'' said Henman,  
who had hoped to be the first British man to win Wimbledon since 
Fred Perry in 1936. ``And in the third, he went up a gear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henman expects the final to be a ``classic confrontation''  
between perhaps the best serve-and-volleyer in history and the best 
returner and baseline player. 
</P>
<P>
	On grass, Sampras ought to have the edge, Henman said. But not  
necessarily against Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agassi on any court is going to be very, very difficult to  
beat,'' he said. ``And the court is bouncing much, much higher than 
usual. I think that suits him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter looked shell-shocked after seeing so many of Agassi's  
returns speed past him or land right at his feet. And Agassi served 
so well, Rafter couldn't break him even once. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter's spirit was sapped in the second-set tiebreaker, a set  
in which he always struggled to hold serve. Rafter had to fight 
mightily in the ninth game of that set to hold off nine break 
points as the game went to deuce eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing Rafter so deflated after that tiebreaker, Agassi pounced  
on him, breaking him twice in the third set -- the last time in the 
final game when Rafter whacked an overhead wide to end the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was on for him today,'' Rafter said. ``He was very  
powerful with everything he did. It's the best I've seen him serve. 
He never really gave me a chance to try to control the points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's run to the final continued his remarkable resurgence.  
In November 1997, he dropped to No. 141 and played in low-tier 
Challenger events to work his way back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi stunned even himself by winning the French Open last  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre is the hottest player on tour right now, and for him to  
win the French and come here and be in contention is a heck of an 
effort,'' Sampras said. ``He's going to be very tough to beat.''

<HEADLINE>  Norway Seeks Berth in Soccer Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Linda Medalen, who's been through this  
before, says the younger players on Norway's women's soccer team 
have no idea what it's like to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	She'd like to help them find out.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Norway will play China on Sunday in the World  
Cup semifinals at Foxboro Stadium. With a victory, the Norwegians 
would earn a berth in their third consecutive World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their 1995 championship, Norway played for the  
title in 1991, losing to the United States 2-1. Only Medalen, 
midfielder Hege Riise and goalkeeper Bente Nordby remain from that 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's special, because we have been there before,'' Riise said.  
``We know what to do and we know how much fun it is. We try to get 
our experience over to the younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tone Gunn Frustol, Ann Kristen Aarones, Marianne Pettersen and  
Anne Nymark Andersen also remain from the 1995 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have some players with international  
experience at a high level,'' Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans ``can show themselves for the younger players -- at  
the matches and between the matches,'' he said. ``Their way of 
showing concentration at training and matches, how you prepare 
yourself. You can see them set a good standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hogmo doesn't ask anything extra of his veterans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is equal,'' Medalen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Midfielder Solveig Gulbrandsen doesn't remember much about the  
1991 title game; she was only 10 at the time. She then watched the 
1995 World Cup final, unable to even imagine that she would be 
playing alongside Riise four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's so good,'' Gulbrandsen said of her fellow midfielder,  
who was awarded a golden ball and silver shoe in the 1995 
tournament. ``I hope I would be as good as her someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Norway still has to beat China to reach the final,  
the excitement already is building back home. TV ratings are as 
high as 10 percent, press officer Jon Jamessen said, despite games 
that start about midnight local time. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's far different from what would happen should Norway  
win it all. After the 1995 victory, the team plane was escorted 
back from Sweden by an F-16 military jet and celebrating crowds 
welcomed them back home. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also got to meet the prime minister.  
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Linda Medalen, who's been through this  
before, says the younger players on Norway's women's soccer team 
have no idea what it's like to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	She'd like to help them find out.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know the feeling,'' Medalen said of the seven remaining

good it makes you feel, and how happy.

<HEADLINE> DEA, FBI Suspend Online Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI  
suspended their contracts with a major law enforcement database 
company partly because of the reputation of the company's founder 
and major stockholder, The Miami Herald reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	DBT Online, based in Boca Raton, compiles public records  
worldwide and provides dossiers on investigative targets for about 
1,500 police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The DEA and FBI halted their contracts with the company in May,  
partly over concern that founder Henry Edward Asher was suspected 
in the early 1980s of flying illegal drugs to the United States 
from the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies also were concerned that the company could monitor  
investigations, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no evidence has been found that any cases have been  
compromised and DBT executives say such a prospect is impossible 
because of its intricate security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher, 49, has never been arrested or charged with any crime.  
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Friday that Asher had agreed to sell his  
majority ownership in an effort to save DBT's law enforcement 
contracts, which account for 25 percent of the company's $60 
million in yearly revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The DEA and FBI told their agents May 18 to stop using  
information services from DBT's Database Technologies subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	A DEA statement said that a routine internal inspection of the  
agency's Miami field office in 1998 ``raised significant concerns'' 
about the database company. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher issued a statement through his lawyer denying any criminal  
activity and saying unfair disclosures to the Herald were timed to 
affect the value of his $148 million in company stock.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Kevin Orie Injures Thigh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins third baseman Kevin Orie was placed  
on the 15-day disabled list Saturday night with an injured left 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Orie hasn't played since leaving Wednesday's 12-7 loss to the  
New York Mets after feeling soreness in the thigh. He took batting 
practice before Friday night's 6-1 win over Montreal, but an MRI 
detected a partial tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Orie was batting .266 with five homers, 16 doubles and 25 RBIs.  
He was placed on the DL, retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins will recall second baseman Amaury Garcia from  
Triple-A Calgary, but rookie Mike Lowell is expected to get the 
bulk of Orie's playing time.

<HEADLINE> July 4th Celebrants Plan Photo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *By Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- On the fourth minute of the seventh hour  
Sunday, a flash bulb will capture the faces of a century and the 
future of the millennium in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Peering through the camera lens, the photographer will see  
whites laughing with blacks; wrinkled hands touching young babies; 
descendants of immigrants standing side-by-side with Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, these 112 people who were born on July 4 throughout  
the 1900s, will make up the ``Photo of the Century'' in front of 
Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They will include twins, triplets and quadruplets, a man and his  
dog, a mother and daughter, and a husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is historical, and I'm the one. I'm the oldest one. What  
an honor,'' said Betty Marx, of Belleair Bluffs, Fla., who was born 
in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver-haired woman's five caretakers helped pack a suitcase  
filled with red, white and blue outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years, I've never celebrated with a bunch of people  
who have the same birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the participants will be old enough to understand the  
historical value of the event -- especially the newborn to be chosen 
between midnight and 7:04 a.m. But the ones who are say Hollywood 
couldn't have scripted a more dramatic or compelling birthday 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Karolyn Grimes, who played Jimmy Stewart's daughter in the film  
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' will represent the year 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't help but think it's such a privilege. Not only being  
in that wonderful classic film, but living in this country -- 
America -- makes it a wonderful life,'' Ms. Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo will be posted on the Internet, and officials will  
eventually find a place to permanently display the photo in 
Philadelphia and other interested cities, event spokeswoman 
Danielle Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Philadelphia was bombarded with photos and essays  
from people around the country vying to be a part of the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Alton Cotton, 40, of Brownwood, Texas, secretly sent an  
application in for his mother, Liberty Bell Cotton, 63. 
</P>
<P>
	``She raised nine kids by herself and she's never ever been out  
of Texas. I figured it was a pretty good once-in-a-life-time 
event,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After officials picked the participants, the city put together a  
weekend of freebies for the birthday girls and boys: round-trip 
plane rides and hotel rooms, special barbecue and prime rib meals, 
VIP passes to city museums, tickets to a Phillies game, concerts 
and a parade.

<HEADLINE> Biffle Wins at NASCAR Diehard 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Pole starter Greg Biffle spotted his  
rivals a botched pit stop and still was able to race back through 
the field to capture Saturday's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series 
DieHard 200 at The Milwaukee Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle was eighth after his final stop on the 137th of 200 laps  
when he overshot his pits and his crew subsequently dropped the 
jack from underneath his Ford before service was completed. Biffle 
then chased down Jack Sprague and Rick Crawford to become the 
tour's first three-time winner this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Vancouver, Wash., native, in his second season  
with Roush Racing, took the lead for the final time with 19 laps to 
go, passing Crawford as the pair exited the one-mile speedway's 
fourth turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trucks touched briefly, causing Crawford's Ford to slew  
sideways. Sprague took advantage of the opening to grab second but 
was unable to challenge Biffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle, who earlier won races at Memphis, Tenn., and Portland,  
Ore., carried a 1.880-seconds advantage to the finish. He averaged 
a race record 106.714 mph for 200 miles and won $46,350. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think there was time to catch them,'' Biffle said.  
``We were so tight in the center of the corner but my Ford was able 
to cut under them in the middle and I'd get a run off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a championship team. All we've got to do is  
finish in front of him (Sprague), lead laps and get bonus points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague, who led just once for three laps during the first round  
of green flag pit stops, was pleased with his effort. ``I just 
didn't have enough to beat him (Biffle),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's finish made Biffle just the third driver in the  
series, and first since 1996, to win races on a short track, 
superspeedway and road course in a season. The victory moved him to 
second in the driver standings, 102 points behind Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth in points entering the season's 13th race, Biffle vaulted  
past Stacy Compton and Ron Hornaday, who slipped to third and 
fourth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford's third was his best of the season. Mike Wallace, who  
earlier battled Biffle for 20 laps to keep from going a lap behind, 
took fourth, his Ford aided by the first of the race's two caution 
periods. Mike Bliss, the winner's Roush stablemate, completed the 
top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Setzer, Hornaday, Randy Tolsma, Jay Sauter and Compton  
completed the top 10. Twelve of the 28 finishers completed 200 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drivers swapped the lead 10 times, although Biffle was the  
dominant driver, heading the field five times for 109 laps.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Vs. U.S. in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Five years to the day since the U.S.  
national soccer team sought to make World Cup history against 
Brazil, it will do so again. 
</P>
<P>
	With just the slightest difference: gender.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and maybe one other: The Americans are favored.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the U.S. women play their semifinal match at Stanford  
Stadium against the Brazilians. At the same site in the 1994 men's 
tournament, Brazil edged the United States 1-0. It went on to win 
its fourth world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women remember that game well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Going back to 1994, well, as some of you know I am a huge  
soccer fanatic,'' defender Brandi Chastain said Friday after most 
of the U.S. squad was given the day off, ``so I did a lot of 
traveling that summer to all the games in California. Today I had a 
flashback as the bus was driving in on the Embarcadero of me 
driving to the USA-Brazil match in 1994 with a big American flag 
draped on my car. And I was thinking how exciting it is to have 
people driving that same route to come see us play in such a 
similar and important game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The '94 game was considered the most significant in U.S. soccer  
history. This match has the makings of such import, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. men did very well in that game, almost falling back  
into a bunker style defense,'' midfielder Julie Foudy recalled. ``I 
remember it was hot. I remember the enthusiasm of the crowd and 
that it was just packed on July 4 and very patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping for that same kind of atmosphere, and I'm very  
confident we will achieve the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except they expect to win. Of course, so does Brazil, which blew  
a 3-0 lead to Nigeria before advancing on Sissi's overtime free 
kick goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans are very well trained and prepared for this  
championship,'' said Sissi, who leads the tournament with seven 
goals. ``We are the stage that whatever the results, we can hold 
our heads high and be proud of our results and the push for women's 
football in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``But yes, of course, we will approach the game with the  
Americans to win, and with confidence we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1994 Fourth of July extravaganza was a mere blip on  
the soccer screen for Brazil, it showed just how worked up 
Americans can get about what millions still consider ``a foreign 
sport.'' Organizers are hopeful for another sellout at Stanford, 
and believe a crowd of 30,000 is possible for the other semifinal, 
between Norway and China at Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an historic game for sure, and a very honorable game  
for the U.S. against the tournament champions,'' coach Tony DiCicco 
said of Brazil's tight victory five years ago. ``The game was in 
the balance for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``American's love the challenge of playing a team of that  
quality on the Fourth of July, and it's what we are looking for 
also. The only difference really is that the men's team had a lot 
of naturalized Americans on the field, and we will be a true 
All-American team. We are going to go after this victory as hard as 
any we have ever gone after.''

	Minorities Shot at in Chicago  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former basketball coach of Northwestern  
University was slain and six Orthodox Jews were wounded in separate 
drive-by shootings last night that may be the work of the same 
person or group. Minorities were targeted in multiple incidents, 
and each shooting was linked to a blue car. Two Asian-Americans 
were shot at as they rode in their vehicle but were not injured. 
There have been no arrests. The shootings -- all within 
approximately 12 miles of each other -- began in the northern 
Chicago neighborhood of Rogers Park and ended in the suburbs of 
Skokie and Northbrook.

	Kosovo Celebration Turns Deadly

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A celebration of ethnic Albanian  
pride turned deadly early today after British troops fired on a car 
of revelers, killing two people and injuring two others. A British 
forces spokesman said a group of British soldiers was providing 
security for about 50 Serbs, when a car carrying eight people drove 
by and gunfire was heard. He said the soldiers, ``believing their 
life was in danger,'' opened fire on the car. The spokesman said an 
automatic weapon was found in the car. The shooting in Kosovo's 
capital, Pristina, happened while thousands of ethnic Albanians 
celebrated in the streets, honking horns and waving Albanian and 
U.S. flags.

	N. Ireland Pols Given Two Weeks  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish prime  
ministers last night gave Northern Ireland's politicians two weeks 
to back an ambitious blueprint for their peace accord. But plans 
for the new Protestant-Catholic government will depend on the 
ability of Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble to sell the 
plan to his divided supporters. Ken Maginnis, one of Trimble's most 
moderate lieutenants, today called the plan unacceptable. ``Tony 
Blair has betrayed us at the 11th hour,'' he said, objecting 
because the plan rules out the power to expel the IRA-allied Sinn 
Fein party from government if the Irish Republican Army failed to 
disarm.

colleagues. Attorney General John Farmer said the report found that 
minority and female troopers often did not receive ``fully 
respectful'' treatment -- and that there were enough stories and 
lawsuits alleging discrimination or harassment to cause concern. 
Supervisors and troopers themselves have done too little to address 
the problem, Farmer said yesterday.

	WHITECLAY, Neb. (AP) -- Oglala Sioux leaders plan to march in  
peace today, a week after activists staged a violent protest 
against alleged treaty violations, unsolved murders and the sale of 
alcohol to American Indians. With President Clinton visiting the 
nearby Pine Ridge Indian Reservation next week, tribal leaders said 
it was important to show the tribe can solve problems without 
resorting to violence.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Seven people were arrested today on  
involuntary homicide and other charges in connection with a fire at 
a seaside summer camp that killed 19 children and four adults. 
Mosquito coils appeared to have sparked the blaze that gutted the 
camp dormitory on Wednesday, investigators said. Meanwhile, police 
were expanding their probe into local government officials 
suspected of taking bribes in return for lax enforcement of safety 
checks at the Sealand Youth Training Center, 60 miles southwest of

confident that the International Monetary Fund would soon release a 
$4.5 billion loan to Russia. ``A loan will be given to us,'' 
Stepashin said before addressing the Federation Council, the upper 
house of parliament. An IMF team that visited Moscow this week 
praised Russia's economic performance and indicated that lending 
could be resumed, allowing Russia to pay off debts due this year 
and avoid a potentially disastrous default.

<HEADLINE> 'Red Hots' Back After 4-Year Layoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back after a  
four-year layoff following severe drug relapses and another switch 
in guitar players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles group consisting of Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Chad  
Smith and rehired former guitarist John Frusciante have come out 
with a new album ``Californication'' and the band is back on the 
road doing concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That we should make it to the same place and time together  
again,'' Kiedis says in the August issue of Spin magazine, ``and 
the fact that we didn't die or become spiritually crippled in the 
process of going through all these hardships means there was really 
something in the air that wanted this (reunion) to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointed with weak sales of their last album ``One Hot  
Minute,'' the band scattered. Flea spent a lot of time in Central 
America, Kiedis went on a spiritual quest in India. In 1997, former 
Jane's Addiction guitarist left the band, setting up the return of 
Frusciante, who played on the group's hit 1991 album ``Blood Sugar 
Sex Magik'' before slipping in heavy heroin use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived very close to death in the last few years, from every  
angle,'' Frusciante said. ``I didn't mind dying, but the spirits 
that have made me do what I've done with my life up to this point 
didn't want me to -- and they've ended up being right.''

	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Steffi Graf, saving herself for  
Sunday's Wimbledon final against Lindsay Davenport, pulled out of 
Saturday's mixed doubles semifinal with John McEnroe.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Shooter Motivated by Hate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black former college basketball coach was shot  
to death while walking with his children -- apparently by a gunman 
who within an hour also wounded six Orthodox Jews walking home from 
synagogue and shot at an Asian-American couple. 
</P>
<P>
	A white man in his late 20s appeared to have carried out the  
attacks Friday night over a distance of about 10 miles on 
residential streets in Chicago and its suburbs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests had been made Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses to each of the shootings told police the shots were  
fired from the same car -- a light blue Ford Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman used two weapons as he fired at six different  
locations in Chicago before traveling on to the nearby suburbs of 
Skokie and Northbrook. Tests showed the bullets used in the Chicago 
shootings matched the bullets found in Skokie. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Terry Hillard said the crimes appeared to  
be motivated by racial hatred, although investigators later stopped 
short of labeling the shootings hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying it's not a hate crime,'' police spokesman Pat  
Camden said. ``What we are saying is at this particular moment in 
the investigation, the elements for a hate crime are not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings began Friday evening in Chicago's Rogers Park  
neighborhood as the Orthodox Jews were returning home from Sabbath 
services. Police said the victims were easily identifiable by their 
traditional dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said a man got out of his car and fired on two people  
from about 15 feet away, wounding one. After that, shots were fired 
from a car, Police Lt. Nick Nickeas said. In all, six people were 
wounded, but none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, former Northwestern University coach Ricky  
Byrdsong died after being shot in the back while walking near his 
home in the suburb of Skokie. Two of his four children were with 
him. They were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, 43, had been working for an insurance company since he  
was fired by Northwestern in 1997 after four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Then within an hour of the Chicago shootings, shots were fired  
at two Asian-Americans riding in a vehicle in Northbrook. They were 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Byrdsong's quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood  
said they were shaken by the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a neighborhood throwback to the 50's,'' said Mara  
Roveda, who lives across the street from where Byrdsong was shot. 
``It's full of kids. We all know each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers Park residents were reluctant to speak with a reporter  
Saturday because of the Sabbath, but those who did said the 
neighborhood has become known for its safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly frightening because there is nobody to blame  
here,'' said Harry Maryles as he left a synagogue Saturday. ``You 
can't blame the city. But I suppose you can blame a society that 
produces a monster like this.''

<HEADLINE> Blind Unemployment at 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Even as the nation's unemployment rate nears a  
29-year low, the jobless rate of blind Americans has been stagnant 
for about a decade, according to Department of Labor statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates blame discrimination by employers, lower Braille  
literacy rates and new technology for the problem, saying all three 
factors prevent 70 percent of the blind who want to work from 
landing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pity-based discrimination,'' said Barbara Pierce,  
spokeswoman for the National Federation of the Blind, which is 
holding its annual convention in Atlanta through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans with Disabilities Act seems to have had no  
impact on this,'' Ms. Pierce said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA, which was passed in 1990, bans discrimination based on  
disability and orders employers to ``make reasonable 
accommodation'' to qualified disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, technology has made things much easier for blind  
people. Converting text to Braille, once a painstaking process, can 
now be handled by computers, and some office equipment is available 
with Braille-embossed buttons. 
</P>
<P>
	But other technology has hurt the employment chances of the  
750,000 blind Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blind people once worked as traditional receptionists,  
taking dictation and answering the phone for managers and 
executives. But voice mail and e-mail have changed the job 
description of receptionists, requiring more computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Graphic-based software that requires the user to move around the  
screen with a mouse and click on icons is nearly impossible for the 
blind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could work in Powerpoint and things that handle graphics,  
but getting someone to put it in a format that I can understand is 
tough,'' said Peg Halverson, who has been out of a job for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be employed, I want to contribute to society,'' said  
Ms. Halverson, 44. ``I'm thinking, `I have a business degree, I 
have basically 20 years of administrative experience and I can't 
even get a customer service job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the blind people who are working, 30 percent are  
significantly underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems has been a decline in the number of blind  
children learning Braille. During the past 30 years, the percentage 
of blind children learning Braille in the United States has fallen 
from about 50 percent to less than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two decades, there has been a push to get blind  
children out of special schools and mainstream them with the 
regular population. 
</P>
<P>
	``That all too often means they are plunked down in the regular  
classroom and they have very little support services,'' Ms. Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And some teachers pamper blind children, refusing to challenge  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers just kind of let you slip through the cracks. They  
didn't put any expectations on you,'' said Dr. V. Inez Brasher, 42, 
who lost her vision at age 9 but earned a chiropractic degree and 
owns her own practice in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Many school systems saw mainstreaming as a chance to cut costs  
by hiring fewer teachers for disabled students. In some schools, 
students receive Braille instruction only once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the convention, blind people attended workshops helping with  
resumes, interviewing skills and dealing with discrimination 
issues. Blind educators, lawyers, computer scientists, mountain 
climbers and journalists are there to share their experiences and 
give outlines for success. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Mattioli, a hospital dietitian in Baltimore, said she  
doesn't try to talk around her blindness during job interviews. 
Instead, she tells employers how her condition will affect her 
approach to the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a blind person, you kind of have to be that much better,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-Era Questions Haunt Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Questions about whether George W. Bush  
received preferential treatment to gain entry into the Texas Air 
National Guard during the Vietnam War are being resurrected as his 
presidential campaign picks up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's service in the Guard, where he became a fighter pilot, is  
well known and has been covered in Texas newspaper and magazine 
stories going back to at least 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 story examined whether Bush and other sons of prominent  
Texas families received preferential treatment in gaining entry to 
National Guard units. It noted that the son of Lloyd Bentsen, a 
former senator, vice presidential nominee and Treasury Secretary, 
was in the same unit as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bentsen was running for vice president that year and  
subsequently debated his Republican counterpart, Dan Quayle, whose 
own entry into the Indiana National Guard was being questioned at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Later stories by other publications covered similar ground.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported in Sunday's editions that a  
review of 200 pages of Bush's military records, along with 
interviews with a number of people who served with him, provided 
fresh details. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper concluded that Bush lacked the military experience and  
aviation skills that some other applicants had when he was admitted 
to the elite ranks of those training to be fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	After basic training, he received an instant commission making  
him a second lieutenant and was sent to pilot training. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times also said many of his former comrades and  
superiors in the Guard remember Bush as a bright young leader who 
worked hard. Echoing Bush's own statements, they said that he would 
have gone to Vietnam had his Guard unit been called up. 
</P>
<P>
	And it said it found no evidence of illegality or breach of  
regulations in connection with Bush's National Guard career. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter B. ``Buck'' Staudt, a retired guard brigadier general who  
was Bush's commanding officer, repeatedly has denied over the years 
that any influence was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush also has denied helping his son in  
military, business or political careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times noted the issue of Bush's military service has already  
come up in the current campaign with one of his rivals for the 
nomination, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joking that as a prisoner of 
war in North Vietnam he slept more soundly knowing that Bush was 
defending the shores of Texas from invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a Yale graduate, has said he joined the National Guard  
rather than volunteer for Army combat duty because he wanted to 
learn how to fly jet fighters. His father was a World War II 
fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to fly just like his daddy,'' Staudt told  
the Times. ``Neither his daddy nor anybody else got him into the 
Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In service reports, Staudt, described Bush as a ``quiet,  
intelligent young man'' who ``meets all the requirements 
established for this appointment program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our information is there was absolutely no special deal,''  
David Beckwith, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, told the Times.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Streak Turns Season Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Maybe it won't be a bummer summer in San Diego,  
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	With the afterglow of their World Series appearance gone, the  
Padres fell to the bottom of the NL West and weren't expected to be 
contenders again until close to 2002, when their new downtown 
ballpark opens. 
</P>
<P>
	They obliged, looking downright awful at times. Injuries made  
things worse, with Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner and Reggie Sanders 
being knocked out of the lineup. And they had lost many of their 
other stars from last season because the team couldn't afford to 
keep them. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in June, the Padres looked more like a glorified  
version of the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars than the team that won the 
NL pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the veterans slowly returned, the youngsters who remained  
got better and the Padres became a summertime sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	They had won 14 straight games before Saturday's 12-10 loss at  
Colorado -- a club record and the longest streak in the majors since 
1994 -- to jump back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of baseball has to be surprised, especially the  
underachieving division rival Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six times in 10 days, the Padres left the Dodgers blue. San  
Diego jumped from last to third place in the NL West to get over 
.500. The Dodgers, whose payroll is $31.2 million higher than San 
Diego's, dropped into last place. 
</P>
<P>
	``A realistic goal for us was to get back to .500 by the end of  
the season,'' said scrappy outfielder Eric Owens, who along with 
fellow newcomers Damian Jackson and Reggie Sanders leads an offense 
that has caught up with solid starting pitching and an airtight 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought we'd go on a streak like this. This is a good  
way to get started in July. We need to run with this, and if we can 
get into August, we can make a pennant race of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy said the Padres played just as hard when  
things were going bad. Still, the players met a few weeks back to 
discuss attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a conscientious effort as a group that we're going to  
play hard and let things fall where they may; in a sense, not have 
any regrets,'' said reliever Trevor Hoffman, who blew three saves 
early -- two more than he did all of last year -- then nailed down 11 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no prima donnas in the Padres clubhouse, just guys who  
play the game the way it's supposed to be played. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalysts, Owens and Jackson, don't even make as much as  
$300,000 each. The Padres have been without Gwynn since the third 
game of the streak. The batting star is sidelined again by a calf 
injury and remains 18 hits short of 3,000 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1998 Padres were a station-to-station team that waited  
for Greg Vaughn or Ken Caminiti to go deep, these Padres aren't 
afraid to stick their faces in the dirt to take an extra base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres hit and run, steal and double-steal. Jackson, a  
rookie, thrilled his teammates when he raced from first to third as 
pitcher Andy Ashby fooled the Dodgers in a bunt situation by 
chopping a ball though the infield and into left. 
</P>
<P>
	They use their speed on defense, too, banging into fences and  
tracking down balls others might not get. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go about it relentlessly,'' Joyner said of his  
speed-blessed teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers, who sacrificed power for speed  
when he sent 50-homer man Vaughn to Cincinnati for Sanders and 
Jackson, called it ``a more exciting brand of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are getting dirty,'' he said. ``We have seven or eight  
guys in the lineup who come into the clubhouse after games and you 
can't see the `Padres' on their uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, San Diego's speed was enough to withstand  
Colorado's power in an 8-7 win. The Padres raced to a club-record 
nine stolen bases, with Jackson tying the team mark with five. 
They've already blown past last year's total of 79 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate coming in here clean after a game,'' said Jackson, who  
has filled in at shortstop for the injured Chris Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hasn't had a day off since May 28. Bochy offered to let  
him sit out last Sunday's game. He declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need a rest,'' he said. ``I'm going to ride this cloud  
as long as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Owens, who has yet to play a full major league  
season but quickly earned the respect of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tony was gone and Eric was playing every day, he was  
awesome,'' catcher Phil Nevin said. ``If we had a vote right now, 
I'm sure he'd be the MVP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gwynn: ``He's been the poster child for this turnaround.''  
</P>
<P>
	Owens took Gwynn's advice that he needed to make a lasting  
impression in order to make the transition from bench player to 
starter. He did it headfirst, of course, when he got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this all my life,'' Owens said.  
``There's not a day that goes by I don't remember those days 
sitting in Triple-A and knowing that I can play with the guys up 
here but not knowing which way my career's going to go after last 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It came to San Diego, where by having to juggle his lineup  
virtually every day, Bochy has put himself into contention for his 
second NL manager-of-the-year award in four seasons. Through 77 
games, including the suspended game in Houston on June 13, Bochy 
has used 72 different starting lineups. The opening day lineup has 
not been together since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, sure I'd like to have a set lineup, but I also like  
having a flexible lineup where you use everybody,'' Bochy said. 
``It creates a sense of unity. The whole 25-man roster has been 
involved in the play. It helps bring everybody together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towers, who watched as Caminiti, Steve Finley and Kevin Brown  
left as free agents, said he'll consider adding power for the 
stretch run if the Padres are still around .500 at the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	And the players will continue making up for lost time.  
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about a 12- or 13-game streak,'' Hoffman said.  
``It's about playing 162 games with this type of preparation and 
attitude. It's a grind and we want to be part of it. And we want to 
realize that last year wasn't a one-year deal.''

<HEADLINE> Man Exits Lavish Life Over Y2K Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- How concerned is Jamie O'Rourke about  
the Y2K computer bug? 
</P>
<P>
	Enough to sell his million-dollar home near Nashville with its  
pool and tennis courts, pack up his wife and children, and move 
into a double-wide trailer on 350 acres near the Alabama state 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough to start stockpiling supplies and have his children learn  
to farm so the family can raise food if none is available 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough to ignore those who say what he is doing seems crazy.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Rourke, a successful businessman, believes it's possible that  
computer problems will be so widespread on Jan. 1 that power grids 
will fail throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean no running water for many people, no way to keep  
food fresh or frozen, no ATMs dispensing cash. Grocery store 
shelves would be cleaned out within days. And that could cause 
panic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have a very real potential for anarchy and chaos,  
which we've seen in our times. Watts. The L.A. riots. When the 
Chicago Bulls win. It doesn't take much,'' said O'Rourke, 47. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is sure how serious any problems related to the Y2K bug  
may be. The glitch could occur if computers originally programmed 
to recognize only the last two digits of a year assume it is 1900 
instead of 2000. Utilities, government agencies and businesses are 
spending billions to test and prepare their computers for New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	While O'Rourke agrees the worst-case scenario of failed electric  
grids leading to anarchy is farfetched, he isn't taking any 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question becomes, what can you assume? And in the final  
analysis, I think that you cannot assume the power will be on,'' he 
said. ``Therefore, in order to prepare, you have to assume it's 
going to be off. That's where I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So O'Rourke; his wife, Cyd, and eight of their nine children,  
ages 4 to 21, moved from their 9,000-square-foot home in Brentwood, 
about 15 miles south of Nashville, to a 2,000-square-foot mobile 
home. The couple's eldest daughter lives with her husband in 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The location of their new home -- which O'Rourke does not want  
publicized -- is so out of the way he still sometimes gets lost 
trying to find it. The family's closest neighbors are Amish. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after moving in, O'Rourke's younger children spent a  
morning happily gathering hens' eggs in a blue wire basket and 
washing them at the sink. But the family couldn't cook them: They 
hadn't unpacked the frying pan yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Five tractor-trailers out back contained family belongings, and  
the beige double-wide was packed with furnishings and boxes. A 
playpen was stuffed with clothes. A picnic table served as the 
dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Rourke said her friends joke that she's like Eva Gabor  
from the old ``Green Acres'' TV comedy about urban sophisticates 
taking up a rustic life. 
</P>
<P>
	Even within the family, the decision seemed strange at first,  
her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, some of the older children said, `What's  
going on?' But as we've discussed it as a family, I think they've 
realized this is what we should do,'' O'Rourke said. ``Now, if we 
voted whether to move to a farm, and Y2K were not an issue, they 
would probably have been against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move now completed, 15-year-old Michael said it was a big  
change. But, he added, ``I actually like this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 11, said it's hard leaving his friends, but ``it's kind  
of fun learning new things,'' like how the trailer's plumbing works 
and how fresh cow's milk tastes. ``Better than store-bought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline, 6, likes milking the family's three cows, gathering  
eggs and catching butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	To help prepare for the move, daughter Shawn, 21, moved back  
from Phoenix last year and spent a week with Daniel working on a 
farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. She set up the O'Rourke farm, 
buying and caring for the livestock and planting the family's 
vegetable gardens. At one point during the transition, the 
mansion's tennis court became an impromptu home for their first 
brood of chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn said she never expected to spend her time ``wringing the  
necks of chickens,'' but the new life has its pluses. She met her 
new husband while learning to can vegetables near the O'Rourkes' 
new home. They live in a trailer on the farm while they build a 
house there. 
</P>
<P>
	How did all of this change come about?  
</P>
<P>
	It got started a little more than a year ago when friends  
mentioned the millennium bug to O'Rourke, and at first he did not 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, if it's a computer problem, I have computer  
people and ... they'll let me know,''' said O'Rourke, who employs 
30 at his Brentwood office and another 100 at a plant in Mexico. 
His company, Kidpower, makes swimming pool floats, glow-in-the-dark 
flying discs and other toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's kind of where I left it,'' he said, until last  
summer when some of his customers -- Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target and 
Toys R Us -- sent letters asking whether his company would be Y2K 
compliant. His bank asked, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He read more about Y2K and started paying close attention when  
``credible'' people like Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan talked about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he found that some people he knew were stockpiling food and  
buying wood stoves, just in case. He was disappointed they hadn't 
told him but understood why. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want to be thought of as foolish or extremist,''  
O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does O'Rourke, but he's speaking out anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	``The guy who walks into this thing saying there won't be any  
problems worries me more,'' said Tim Wilson, publisher of the Y2K 
News Magazine, noting that O'Rourke is not alone in taking the 
extreme step of moving his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, when O'Rourke decided to move his family from their  
home of 12 years and settle on the rural property, he set aside 
part of the land for friends worried about Y2K, selling them 
five-acre parcels at cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The O'Rourkes bought a five-bedroom trailer because he didn't  
want to sink a lot of cash and time into building a house. They got 
a wood stove and dug a well that is pumped manually. They bought 
long-burning candles, enough food to make it until the next 
harvest, and non-hybrid seeds to ensure their plants continue 
reproducing if no new seeds are around to buy. They bought a 
diesel-fueled generator, to be backed up by a windmill and a solar 
power system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do some heroic things in January, but they won't mean  
much compared to the semi-heroic things we do today to encourage 
people to be prepared, just in case,'' O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't forgotten his employees. Kidpower, which has had its  
computers retrofitted and tested, will shut down from Dec. 20 until 
at least Jan. 20. Before then, workers will get their bonuses and 
the opportunity to cash in vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
	The last few months have been a strain, O'Rourke acknowledges,  
but he speaks proudly of how his family has adjusted. Even if 
nothing happens on Jan. 1, he said the move has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all get our Eagle Scout badges, as it were,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Opens Under Cloud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the biggest cycling race in the world  
are desperately hoping that attention on this year's Tour de France 
will be focused not on drugs, but on the sport itself. 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed unlikely, if not impossible.  
</P>
<P>
	Even as the 180 riders on 20 teams were gathering for today's  
prologue at Puy-du-Fou, recriminations from last year's 
catastrophic doping scandal were still flying. 
</P>
<P>
	The former director of Festina, the team at the heart of the  
scandal, spoke of drug use among riders, including former team 
member and French star Richard Virenque, who denies having used 
illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno Roussel, one of two Festina officials banned from the  
sport, said the drug demands of the riders became ``incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given their state of dependence, it was no longer possible to  
talk to them, to do anything,'' Roussel in Friday's L'Equipe 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Virenque remains under investigation on drug charges,  
but he planned to be riding today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the tour reluctantly bowed to pressure from  
cycling's governing body and readmitted the controversial rider, 
barred because ``his presence would be incompatible with the image 
of the tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union, citing a technical error,  
ordered organizers to rescind the ban. Race director Jean-Marie 
Leblanc called the order a ``takeover by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Virenque, now with the Italian team Polti, the  
cycling union ordered Tour officials to rescind a ban on Manolo 
Saiz, sporting director of Spain's ONCE team. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Leblanc tried to strike a positive tone, telling a  
news conference he hoped that from now on, people ``won't talk 
anymore about doping, but about the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque, for his part, kept silent when pursued by journalists  
seeking his views on this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	As this year's tour begins, nobody is happy. Riders are furious  
about what they continue to see as a witch hunt; sponsors are wary 
of supporting a discredited sport; and many fans are fed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things worse, many top stars are not competing.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Marco Pantani is one of them. The Italian  
said the course didn't suit him, but his place would have been in 
jeopardy anyway after he was kicked out of the Tour of Italy last 
month. A blood test showed he might have used a drug that increases 
stamina. 
</P>
<P>
	The two previous winners, Jan Ullrich of Germany and Bjarne Riis  
of Denmark, both are injured. 
</P>
<P>
	With the field wide open, Virenque, a top climber in good form,  
is a favorite along with last year's surprising third-place 
finisher, American Bobby Julich of the Cofidis team. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American to watch is Lance Armstrong, the two-time  
Olympic cyclist who has returned to racing since overcoming 
testicular cancer. He'll be racing for the U.S. Postal Service 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Other strong contenders: climber Christophe Rinero of Cofidis,  
Tour of Italy winner Ivan Gotti of Polti, Alex Zuelle of Banesto 
and Abraham Olano of ONCE. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's prologue, a 4-mile time trial at Puy-du-Fou, in  
western France, time trial specialist Chris Boardman of Britain was 
the favorite. Boardman won last year's Tour de France prologue in 
Dublin, but had to abandon the race in the second stage because of 
a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-stage race will be about 124 miles shorter than last  
year, and less grueling: it will include an extra rest day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,286-mile race will end with its traditional ride up and  
down the Champs-Elysees on July 25.

<HEADLINE> Attendants Call Off Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Air traffic controllers on Saturday joined Alitalia  
flight crews in calling off a walkout set for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders for the air traffic controllers suspended their  
strike call pending further talks, the Italian news agency ANSA 
reported. A complex contract dispute was behind the strike call. 
</P>
<P>
	Transport sectors have been plagued by sporadic strikes for  
months now as workers protest government plans to overhaul work 
schedules and trim personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's transport minister, Tiziano Treu, said he was hopeful  
last-minute efforts to resolve labor disputes would result in at 
least some of the strikes being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more hopeful than in the past,'' when peak travel times  
were marred by multiple strikes, Treu was quoted as saying by the 
Italian news agency ANSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Alitalia pilots had also called a walkout for Monday, but on  
Friday called off their strike, Italy's main airline said. The 
pilots' union agreed not to strike after reaching agreement for pay 
hikes based on productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants also called off their walkout.  
</P>
<P>
	Still threatening nationwide strikes for next week are municipal  
bus and tram drivers. They are to strike for four hours on 
Wednesday, with the exact times varying from city to city. 
</P>
<P>
	For Thursday, railway workers have called a 24-hour strike.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern Coach Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOKIE, Ill. (AP) -- Former Northwestern coach Ricky Byrdsong  
died today, the victim of one of three drive-by shootings in 
suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong was shot in the lower back while jogging with his  
children near their home Friday night. He died at Evanston Hospital 
after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Orthodox Jews walking home from Sabbath services were  
wounded in separate drive-by shootings that might have been the 
work of the same person or group, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Night nursing staff at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago said  
two 31-year-old men were treated and released, while another 
31-year-old man and a 34-year-old man were in fair condition early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-year-old boy was taken to Children's Memorial Hospital,  
where he was in serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other victim, a 40-year-old man, was taken to Saint Francis  
Hospital in Evanston, where he was listed in serious but stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots also were fired into a car carrying two Asian-American men  
in nearby Northbrook, police said. They were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message from Northbrook police said the shots came  
from a light blue vehicle. The driver was said to be a white man in 
his 30s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going pretty slow, it looked like he was going to shoot  
people,'' a man named Michael told the Chicago Sun-Times about the 
shooting of the Jews. The man said he saw the man shoot his 
neighbor and drive off. He said he didn't want his last name used. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate arrests. The shootings were all within  
approximately 12 miles of each other. They began in the northern 
Chicago neighborhood of Rogers Park and ended in the suburbs of 
Skokie and Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Skokie Police Lieutenant Barry Silverberg said Byrdsong, a  
black, was jogging about a block from his home, when someone in a 
car fired at least seven shots at him, apparently with a 
.22-caliber handgun. The children were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all getting the same vehicle description,'' Silverberg  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, 42, was fired by Northwestern in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	He was let go after four unsuccessful and occasionally odd  
seasons with the Wildcats. During a 1994 game at Minnesota, 
Byrdsong roamed the stands, chatting with fans and waving to the 
crowd while an assistant led the team. He was kicked out of a seat 
as the crowd chanted ``Byrdsong's nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took a 12-day leave after that game, consulting doctors about  
his mental and physical health. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong's four-year record at Northwestern was 34-78, including  
10-62 in the Big Ten Conference. His 1995 team was linked to a 
point-shaving scandal. Government prosecutors said he was ignorant 
of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong took Northwestern to the NIT in 1994, his first season.  
Player defections and injuries prevented the Wildcats from 
continuing their success. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong spent 10 seasons as an assistant at Arizona, Eastern  
Illinois, Western Michigan and Iowa State, where he played college 
basketball for the Cyclones. He later coached at Detroit Mercy.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- The Senior PGA Tour has been dominated  
lately by players under the age of 60, so the older guys on the 
circuit now have their own little competition during tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Players 60 and older compete in the Super Seniors, battling two  
rounds for an extra $175,000 that is not included on the overall 
money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Dill pocketed $30,000 on Saturday, shooting a 4-under-par  
68 in the second round of the State Farm Seniors Classic. Dill, who 
turned 60 in May, had a two-day total of 139, one shot better than 
Orville Moody. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not official, but I've noticed at the bank they take the  
money,'' Dill said. ``Everyone talks about winning a paycheck on 
Sunday. Now we do it on Saturday and Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Dill's first victory in six tries. He also stands to make  
a few thousand dollars on Sunday, too, as he will begin the day in 
an eighth-place tie behind leader Christy O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SLAP SHOT:* Allen Doyle developed his unorthodox swing from his  
days as a hockey player, but he bristles when compared to the Adam 
Sandler character in the movie, ``Happy Gilmore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the comedy, Gilmore was a former pro hockey player who took  
his brash style to the links. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a little goofy. That's fiction,'' Doyle said.  
</P>
<P>
	This much is fact: Doyle was a member of the Norwich University  
sports hall of fame as a hockey player, and his golf swing was 
further altered by the fact that he practiced during the winter in 
a room with a low ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, who ranks second on the money list, shot a 71 Saturday  
and is seven strokes behind O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUMMERHAYS FADES:* Bruce Summerhays couldn't come up with an  
ample encore this week in a bid to successfully defend his victory 
in last year's inaugural State Farm Senior Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Summerhays opened the event Friday with a 69, the same score he  
shot in 1998 en route to a 206 total and a one-shot victory over 
Walter Hall and Hale Irwin. But he carded a 75 Saturday and will 
enter Sunday's final round 13 strokes behind O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	He made up a three-shot deficit last year on the final day,  
leaping over six players to win. This time, however, he's tied for 
40th.

``Refused U.S.'' Clinton said this will assure that food rejected 
at one U.S. port is not slipped past inspectors at another.

Republicans said the federal budget surplus is so huge that 
Congress can cut taxes by nearly $1 trillion and still brace Social

security for about 50 Serbs, when a car carrying eight people drove 
by and gunfire was heard. He said the soldiers, ``believing their

by telephone with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who 
raised no objections, said a White House official who asked not to 
be identified by name. ``All agreed the situation is dangerous and 
could escalate if not resolved quickly,'' the White House press 
office said in a statement.

	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iranians scattered flowers in  
the sea and Tehran radio swore never to forgive the United States 
as the nation paid homage today to 290 people killed when a U.S. 
warship shot down an Iranian passenger jet 11 years ago. The 
cruiser USS Vincennes fired at the Iran Air Airbus A-300 on July 3, 
1988, shortly after it took off from Bandar Abbas for Dubai in the 
United Arab Emirates. Washington said the Vincennes mistook the 
airliner for a hostile Iranian fighter jet.

	Poll: Space Race Tops Achievements  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The radio brought Americans fireside chats  
with President Roosevelt, television and the Internet let them see 
the world, but it was America's blast off into space that many 
people choose as the nation's greatest feat of the 20th century. 
When Americans glance in the rearview mirror at the past 100 years, 
four in 10 people in a recent poll cite technological advances as 
America's top achievement. Another 7 percent mention such medical 
breakthroughs as the antidepressant Prozac or Viagra, the 
blockbuster drug for impotence. But overall, the single most-cited 
success is the space program, chosen by about one in five 
Americans.

	Abu-Jamal Protest Ends With Arrests

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Supporters of death row inmate Mumia  
Abu-Jamal blocked the entrance to the Liberty Bell at the start of 
the busy Fourth of July weekend today, and 55 people were arrested. 
The landmark was closed to the public for about three hours. The 
demonstration came on the 17th anniversary of the sentencing of 
Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther and radio journalist convicted of 
killing a Philadelphia police officer. He contends he is innocent 
and blames his conviction on a biased judge and an ineffective 
lawyer.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tiger Woods birdied three holes on the back nine  
for a 4-under 68 and a commanding 4-stroke lead in the Western Open 
today. Woods, who was at 14-under 202 after three days, has won six 
of the seven tournaments he's led going into the final round. 
Stuart Appleby bogeyed four holes and finished with an even-par 72 
to put him four strokes back at 206. The day was marred when 
Garland Dempsey, John Maginnes' caddie, collapsed as he walked down 
the 15th fairway. Dempsey's heart stopped and paramedics used a 
defibrillator to get his pulse back. Dempsey is in critical but 
stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Dad Had Insurance Policy on Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- Despite a report that he took out a  
six-figure life insurance policy on his young son, Ronald 
Shanabarger was still likely motivated by revenge in allegedly 
killing the boy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to authorities, Shanabarger, 30, has confessed to  
smothering his infant son to get back at his wife, Amy, over a 
grudge that began before they were married. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a story published Saturday, The Courier-Journal of  
Louisville, Ky., reported another possible motive: The suspect had 
taken out a policy worth $100,000 and was spending the money ``in 
his head'' after the death of the 7-month-old boy, Tyler. The paper 
quoted Wendy Heim, described as a close friend of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Police Chief Harry Furrer told the newspaper that  
investigators know about the policy, but he declined to confirm its 
dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said police still believe Shanabarger was motivated by  
revenge, not money. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told police several times -- including at least two  
tape-recorded interviews -- that he planned the crime to punish his 
wife for not cutting short a cruise vacation with her parents after 
his father died in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shanabarger, 29, wouldn't discuss the case with the  
newspaper. She has left the couple's home in Franklin, an 
Indianapolis suburb, and is living with her parents in 
Martinsville. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heim told the Kentucky newspaper that Mrs. Shanabarger told  
her and family members about the insurance policy, that she put its 
value at $100,000, and discussed what her husband said about the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her he already had $50,000 of it spent in his head,''  
Heim said. She said the policy was valued at $100,000, but that she 
didn't know when Shanabarger bought it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shanabarger said her husband wanted to spend the money and  
asked her if they could continue their marriage without the boy, 
Heim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also reported that Shanabarger refused to  
accompany his wife to the hospital when she gave birth last 
November and that he repeatedly complained she spent too much money 
on toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger is being held without bond. Through public defender  
Richard Tandy, he declined to be interviewed.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest Cuban Refugee Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Carrying signs and waving Cuban and American flags,  
nearly 1,000 people gathered Saturday to protest the Coast Guard's 
treatment of six Cuban refugees who frantically attempted to reach 
U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidel Castro, don't feel bad,'' one sign read. ``We are as bad  
as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd repeatedly chanted ``liberty'' and ``justice'' in  
Spanish during the peaceful two-hour demonstration, which was 
organized by 40 Cuban activist groups and held around a Bay of Pigs 
memorial. Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe 
Carollo also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard is investigating its treatment of the six  
refugees. TV reports Tuesday showed officers blasting the men with 
a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers then swarmed them as they jumped overboard and swam  
toward shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Two made it to shore, and four were pulled from the water and  
later transferred to an immigration detention center. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were freed from custody and allowed to remain in the  
United States following large protests by the Cuban community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm going to burst with emotion,'' said Carlos  
Hernandez Cordova, one of three refugees who attended the protest.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The radio brought Americans fireside chats  
with President Roosevelt. Television and the Internet let them see 
the world. But it was America's blast off into space that many 
people choose as the nation's greatest feat of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	When Americans glance in the rearview mirror at the past 100  
years, four in 10 people in a recent poll cite technological 
advances as America's top achievement. Another 7 percent mention 
such medical breakthroughs as the antidepressant Prozac or Viagra, 
the blockbuster drug for impotence. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, the single most-cited success is the space program,  
chosen by about one in five Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, national pride swelled in July 1969 with the Apollo 11  
moon shot. Families sat glued to television sets, watching in awe 
as astronaut Neil Armstrong called his step onto the lunar surface 
``one giant leap for mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great. It's opened up many opportunities to study  
the world from the top down, rather than the bottom up,'' Skip 
Needham, 63, of Midway City, Calif., said at a subway stop during a 
visit to Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the poll of 1,546 Americans conducted in April and  
May by The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 
revealed that people see the passing century as a time of economic, 
social and technological progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent describe the radio and the automobile as  
positive innovations, and nearly as many put the computer in the 
same category. 
</P>
<P>
	The only scientific advances not endorsed by those questioned  
are nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Just under half say the 
development of nuclear energy was a change for the better, and 
fewer than one in five say nuclear weapons were a positve idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things in history that I wish we could  
rewrite. It always puts us on the cusp of ending us, ending human 
life -- all life on this planet,'' says Patrick Karayan, of 
Glendale, Calif., a college graduate searching for a job in sports 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans polled also are somewhat uneasy about some recent  
breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology. Just slim pluralities 
view Prozac and Viagra as changes for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Blunt, a single professional woman from Washington, says  
she's convinced that so many people are taking Prozac because 
toxins they've ingested with food have caused imbalances in their 
brain chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a sedated society. We live in a numb society,'' she  
laments. ``I don't see much difference between street drugs and 
pharmaceuticals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half of Americans polled also see the cloning of sheep as  
a change for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human technology is outrunning the ethics -- the ability of  
humans to control it. There are no real checks on all this stuff,'' 
says Chris Booker, 49, a social researcher from Washington. ``Do 
you clone people to do certain kinds of labor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men and women hold divergent views about cloning. Almost  
two-thirds of women say the cloning of sheep is a change for the 
worse compared to one-third of men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think it's right,'' says Debbie Mahony, a former  
accountant and mother of four from Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Her friend, Barbara Alleman, a 35-year-old single woman from  
Scott, La., chimes in: ``I think they're taking it a little bit too 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those polled give a thumbs-up to e-mail, the Internet, cell  
phones and cable. But enthusiasm for these new communications 
technologies splits along generational lines. Three quarters of 
those under age 50 say the Internet is a change for the better, 
compared to half of those ages 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior citizens generally are less excited than younger  
Americans about newfangled technological inventions. The one 
exception is cable TV, which ranks atop the list of changes for the 
better among those ages 65 and older.

<HEADLINE> Posh Spice To Marry at Irish Castle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A steady stream of cars and vans swept  
through electronic gates at Luttrellstown Castle, where 
preparations for the weekend wedding of Posh Spice and her soccer 
hero fiance took lavish shape Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spice Girls singer Victoria Adams and David Beckham arrived at  
Dublin airport by private jet Friday night, accompanied by their 
families. The pair, both 24, have a 4-month-old son, Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge marquee for Sunday's celebrations was already in place at  
the 560-acre estate outside Dublin, an exclusive private conference 
center. A covered walkway was being built to shield famous guests 
from airborne cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The rental helicopter business in the capital area boomed as  
news photographers made their own preparations to capture the 
famous pair on film. The Irish Aviation Authority has reminded 
pilots that it expected increased activity aroung the castle and 
reminded them it was illegal to fly low over groups of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other Spice Girls and Sir Elton John were expected  
guests 
</P>
<P>
	Beckham's teammates from the top Manchester United soccer team  
and the English national team -- among Britain's biggest celebrities 
-- arrived and signed autographs at the airport before headng for

<HEADLINE> INS Officer Reassigned Amid Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An investigation has begun into allegations that  
Border Patrol officers forced two Cuban refugees to pose with a 
photo of Cuban President Fidel Castro and taunted them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday said it has  
already reassigned one of its officers over the incident. The 
unidentified officer will not have contact with INS detainees. 
</P>
<P>
	``INS does not condone or in any way tolerate unprofessional  
behavior on the part of its employees,'' the INS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duviel Rodriguez, 17, and Carlos Hernandez Cordova, 29, were  
among six refugees who frantically tried to swim past Coast Guard 
boats earlier in the week. Their four companions were pulled from 
the water and taken to an INS detention center. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were freed and allowed to remain in the United States  
amid large protests from the Cuban community. Rodriguez and Cordova 
made their accusations against the officers Thursday on Spanish 
radio WQBA. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they were forced to look into a camera while holding a  
photo of Castro. When they protested, they were told to hold the 
photo higher. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also taunted and cursed at, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	```This is our country,' they told us,'' Hernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Janet Reno said she was ``deeply troubled'' by the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for abusive conduct among the ranks of our  
law enforcement personnel,'' Ms. Reno said in a joint statement 
with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. ``We take these, and all 
such allegations, extremely seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice said the allegations will be reviewed  
by its Office of Inspector General and its Civil Rights Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard also is investigating its treatment of the six  
refugees. Television reports showed the Coast Guard blasting the 
men with a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 
yards from shore.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Davenport Reach No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- As well as reaching the Wimbledon  
singles finals, Andre Agassi and Lindsay Davenport took over the 
No. 1 world rankings Saturday -- the first time two Americans have 
jumped to the top on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi guaranteed going to No. 1 by beating Australia's Pat  
Rafter in Saturday's semifinals. Rafter would have been No. 1 had 
he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi last topped the rankings in February 1996. He supplants  
Pete Sampras, coincidentally the player he meets in Sunday's final, 
and will stay No. 1 even if he loses. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's final, the order at the top of the rankings will  
be Agassi, Rafter, Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport, who won the U.S. Open last year, went to No. 1 in  
October and dropped behind Martina Hingis in February. Now she 
replaces Hingis at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf, her opponent Sunday, will stay No. 3 even if she  
beats Davenport.

<HEADLINE> Former Mayor Koch Has Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Mayor Ed Koch actually suffered a  
moderate heart attack when he experienced chest pains that sent him 
to the hospital, his spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch, 74, is expected to remain in the hospital for about six  
more days and will restrict his diet in the future, said George 
Arzt, former press secretary to Koch and a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors said the heart attack would not mean any major changes  
in his lifestyle ... ,'' Arzt said. ``He plans to be back in the 
gym in four weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koch was taken to the hospital on Thursday. Doctors found a  
blocked artery and performed angioplasty to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-term mayor was briefly hospitalized for low blood  
pressure in March. That was the first heart problem he suffered 
since having a pacemaker inserted in 1991. In 1987, he suffered a 
minor stroke.

<HEADLINE> NBC Set To Unveil 'Passions' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Does the world need another soap opera? NBC  
apparently thinks so, and the network is premiering a brand-new 
soaper with the appropriate title of ``Passions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can't imagine what goes on in the seemingly ideal community  
of Harmony, Maine. You can find out by tuning in weekdays, starting 
Monday, July 5, following ``Days of Our Lives.'' That would be at 2 
p.m. EDT in most areas, but times will vary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Passions'' replaces ``Another World,'' which apparently ran  
out of gas after 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is sinking millions into the new starter, which has already  
shot locations and background scenes in Paris, France; Camden, 
Maine; and Oxnard, Calif., just up the coast from Malibu. But most 
of the drama is produced at Studio City's CBS Studio Center, 
onetime home of ``Gunsmoke,'' ``My Three Sons,'' ``The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show'' and other classics. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Reilly, the soap guru who pushed ``Days of Our Lives''  
to the top of the ratings with his outrageous plots, applied his 
talents to ``Passions.'' He has called the show ```Peyton Place' 
meets 'Dark Shadows' meets 'The X-Files.''' Fasten your seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Studio Center, ``Passions'' occupies Stages 4 and 5, which  
are crammed with sets -- a carnival, a hospital office and sick 
room, a cafe, a wooded area, an apartment, plus the town's leading 
family's mansion, including the kitchen, a room that apparently has 
been missing from soap operas in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The other day the company was shooting a scene in which actress  
Dana Sparks raced frantically through woods made spooky by 
injections of fog-simulating smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul, where are you?'' Sparks cried, stumbling through the  
greenery. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was captured quickly by three cameras, eliminating the  
need to reshoot from different angles. Time is precious on soap 
operas, which film at the rate of five one-hour dramas per week. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the cast of 22, two are carrying on family legacies: Juliet  
Mills, daughter of John Mills and sister of Hayley; and Liza Huber, 
daughter of Susan Lucci, longtime Emmy daytime loser yet this 
year's winner for ``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, 57, first came to films as a 10-month-old in ``In Which  
We Serve,'' the wartime flag-waver by Noel Coward, who was her 
godfather. She has spent the last few decades in the United States, 
appearing opposite Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder's ``Avanti,'' in the 
TV series ``Nanny and the Professor'' and in theater productions 
with husband Maxwell Caulfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Huber, 23, graduated in communications from the University of  
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and studied drama in New York City. 
``Passions'' is her first big break. Neither actress has appeared 
in soaps before. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, who plays Tabitha Lennox -- ``everybody's next-door  
neighbor'' -- was in her dressing room, poring over her lines; 
Huber, who co-stars as the well-educated, independent and romantic 
Gwen Hotchkiss, was in the makeup room, her hair in rollers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems to be one thing and is quite another,'' Mills said  
of her character. ``She seems to be the sweet little Tabitha, next 
door baking cookies; underneath she's a bit of a nightmare, 
practicing sorcery and meddling in everybody else's affairs. The 
thing that I love about it is she's so awful she's funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwen is the ``exclusive girlfriend of Ethan Crane (Travis  
Schuldt), the handsome son of the wealthiest family in town,'' 
Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
	If ``Passions'' takes off, it could be a Susan Lucci kind of  
engagement -- 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She definitely holds the record,'' Mills said. ``She's grown  
up in the part. I would grow ancient in the part. I don't know how 
long I will stay, but it will certainly hold my attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huber thinks the show has what it takes to last -- ``Fantastic  
storytelling, a wonderful cast, and everyone-- executives, cast and 
crew-- is enthusiastic and genuinely throwing 1,000 percent of 
themselves into the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soaps, unlike other series, are tough on the actors because they  
need to learn a huge amount of lines each week. How do the two 
actresses cope? 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you give up drinking to start with,'' said Mills. ``It's  
the total focus of my time at the moment. Even when I'm not at the 
studio, I'm at home studying the work for the week over and over. 
It's the only way I've been able to learn lines: cram them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huber said she doesn't have a problem learning lines. ``I must  
have gotten a gene from my mother. ... It's like doing a play a 
day. It keeps me on my toes. I love being busy.''

<HEADLINE> Lighting Strike Disrupts Air Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A lightning strike at an air traffic control center on the eve  
of the holiday weekend delayed flights across the Northeast for 
hours and tangled travel plans for thousands of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike at 3:40 p.m. Friday at the Air Route Traffic Control  
Center in Nashua, N.H., affected inbound and outgoing traffic at 
dozens of airports across New England, said Arlene Salac, a Federal 
Aviation Administration spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes bound for Europe from Kennedy International Airport in  
New York were also delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashua center controls flights at altitudes of more than  
14,000 feet, which includes most commercial jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
	After the strike, the center immediately switched to a backup  
system that allows controllers to continue tracking planes, but at 
reduced speeds. There was no fire and no one was injured, Salac 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem led the delay of many flights headed to New

<HEADLINE> Phi Beta Doc Wins Lamplighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Phi Beta Doc had an easy 4 1/2-length upset  
victory in the $75,000 Lamplighter Handicap at Monmouth Park on 
Saturday, 
</P>
<P>
	Phi Beta Doc finished the 1 1-16-mile race over soft turf in  
1:45. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Fee was second in the field of seven 3-year-olds, with  
North East Bound third. Crash Course, the 17-10 favorite, finished 
fourth before a crowd of 13,351. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I rode this horse and (again) today I knew I was  
going to win,'' Ramon Dominguez, Phi Beta Doc's jockey, said. ``All 
I needed both times was room and racing luck and everything fell 
into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Fee's rider, Dale Beckner, claimed foul against Dominguez  
for interference in the stretch. The claim was not allowed. Phi 
Beta Doc, who won his second straight stakes, paid $23 to win. He 
combined with Green Fee for a $90.20 exacta.

<HEADLINE> Second Quake Shakes West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SATSOP, Wash. (AP) -- The second sharp earthquake in two days  
jolted an area from Oregon to British Columbia Friday night, 
toppling chimneys and rupturing gas and water mains. At least four 
people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which hit at 6:43 p.m., was estimated at magnitude  
5.5 by the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially the biggest earthquake in this region  
since 1965,'' said Steve Malone, a University of Washington 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was centered near Satsop, about 68 miles southwest of  
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff was flying off the shelves,'' said Trudy Donnor, who was  
getting ready to start cleaning the four-story state Insurance 
Building in Olympia when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first one I've ever felt in my life, and I didn't  
think it was funny at all. I didn't know a concrete building could 
sway like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital reported four people with quake-related injuries that  
were not considered serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof of a furniture store collapsed in Aberdeen, about 20  
miles west of the epicenter. Owner Jim Moore, 47, said he had just 
closed the store and was pulling away in his car when the quake 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think about it,'' he said, ``if I had only been just a  
couple of minutes later getting out of there ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gas leaks, toppled chimneys and power outages were reported  
throughout the area of Grays Harbor County, said Rob Harper of 
Washington State Emergency Management. The top floor of the 
three-story county courthouse sustained major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no initial reports of damage to highways or bridges,  
said Clarissa Lundeen of the state Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers from Astoria, Ore., to British Columbia to Cle Elum in  
central Washington phoned Seattle television stations to report 
they had felt the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the hall and I remembered you're supposed to stand in  
a doorway,'' said Barbara Saben of Olympia. ``Then I thought of 
going outside but I could see all the power lines shaking and I 
felt like that wasn't such a good idea!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early reports of magnitude differed. The UW lab estimated it at  
5.1 but Malone said the equipment at Golden was better at measuring 
deep quakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A quake Thursday night jolted the south Puget Sound area and had  
a 3.0 magnitude. It was centered near Maury Island north of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a magnitude 5.7 quake rumbled under the Pacific  
Ocean off Vancouver Island, about 115 miles southwest of Port 
Hardy, British Columbia. The quake early Friday was not felt 
because of its distance from land.

<HEADLINE> FCC OK's SBC Purchase of Comcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission said  
Friday it had approved SBC Communication's purchase of the cellular 
telephone operations of Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, originally Southwestern Bell and one of the seven so-called  
Baby Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, is one of the 
nation's largest local phone companies. The San Antonio-based 
company has about 6.5 million cellular subscribers in 16 states and 
the District of Columbia, while Comcast has about 850,000 cellular 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.7 billion acquisition should not hurt competition because  
the two companies do not compete with each other in the same 
markets, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, regulators did note that there could be some overlap if  
SBC's proposed merger with Ameritech Corp. is approved. The FCC 
said it would deal with any competitive problems during its current 
review of the SBC-Ameritech merger.

<HEADLINE> Carter Signs With Embattled Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors  
extended his agreement with embattled agent Tank Black through 2011 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the NBA Rookie of the Year last season, is Black's only  
client in the NBA, while the agent has about 30 clients who play in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Black could lose his license to do business in the NFL due to a  
disciplinary complaint filed by the NFL Players Association, which 
regulates agents for the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA accused Black of paying former Florida football  
players before their eligibility had expired. Former Gator Johnny 
Rutledge has publicly admitted to receiving money from Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the players Black represents, including Carter and  
Jacksonville Jaguars running back Fred Taylor, have showed the 
support for Black, saying they never had inappropriate contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have looked forward to playing in the NBA for a long time,''  
said Carter, a Daytona Beach native. ``Tank is helping me realize 
all the goals I set for myself as a professional athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the deal with Carter was a major boost to his  
company, Professional Management Inc., especially considering his 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel good to know that the people I actually work  
for feel comfortable enough to do this,'' Black said. ``Even with 
all the things going on, it says Vince knows what kind of person I 
am and what kind of company he's dealing with.''

<HEADLINE> McLachlan Proud of Concert Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying farewell to Lilith Fair, the all-woman  
summer concert tour she created, Sarah McLachlan is proud of the 
tour's surprising success after its early battles for acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to defend Lilith every step of the way,'' McLachlan says  
in the August issue of Spin magazine. ``I came under fire from the 
media, who asked, `Why do you hate men?' I was like, `What does 
putting this on have to do with hating men? It has nothing to do 
with you guys. Sorry.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lilith Fair, which is in its final year, has showcased some of  
the top female names in popular music, including Paula Cole, Jewel, 
Natalie Merchant and hip-hop star Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott. 
Early on, doubters said fans wouldn't turn out for an all-female 
bill. They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	So why bring such a good thing to an end?  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a three-year plan from the beginning, and I'm a firm  
believer in ending on a high note,'' McLachlan said. ``It's 
incredibly rewarding, but it's also a huge amount of work. I think 
we're all ready to have kids now, so it's one or the other.''

<HEADLINE> State Department Denies Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government official whose reassignment has  
held up a key ambassadorial nomination was transferred because of 
an unsatisfactory job performance report, not because she was a 
whistleblower, the State Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's position in the case of Linda Shenwick, a  
former budget and administrative officer at the U.S. mission to the 
United Nations, was outlined in a letter to Sen. Charles Grassley. 
The Associated Press obtained a copy Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, R-Iowa, has defended Shenwick, contending the  
department decided to transfer her because she gave information to 
members of Congress about waste and mismanagement at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a transfer would violate a whistleblower protection law  
that Grassley sponsored. Her dispute with the department dates back 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley has been holding up the nomination of U.N.  
Ambassador-designate Richard Holbrooke in an effort to pressure the 
State Department to resolve the dispute over Shenwick. The letter, 
referring to Grassley's action on Holbrooke, said the Shenwick case 
should not be influenced by unrelated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was written by the assistant secretary of state for  
legislative affairs, Barbara Larkin, who said reassignment or 
demotion is required by law in cases where a member of the Senior 
Executive Service, such as Shenwick, receives an unsatisfactory job 
performance appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The department has no authority to deviate from this  
requirement,'' Larkin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach Grassley on Friday night were unsuccessful.  
Earlier this week, the senator's office acknowledged receipt of the 
letter but declined to make it public. A spokeswoman said Grassley 
raised the issue in a letter last fall but that the letter was 
ignored by the State Department for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a review process, the department assigned Shenwick to  
a supply procurement position in Washington in October 1997. 
Because of a lengthy appeal process as well as efforts to reach a 
negotiated settlement, the assignment did not become official until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin disputed an assertion by Shenwick's lawyer that the new  
assignment is a ``made-up job of ordering furniture.'' She called 
the position ``key to the procurement of goods and services that 
are needed to support the department's worldwide operations.'' The 
position involves contracts valued at $900 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley has said Shenwick should be reinstated to her previous  
position in New York. But he said he would settle for a ``mutually 
acceptable'' agreement between Shenwick and the State Department.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Engineer Ignored Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An Amtrak engineer whose train ran a  
red warning light and struck another train had been warned of the 
oncoming train about 15 minutes before the accident, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people suffered minor injuries early Thursday when the  
engineer's train, traveling at about 55 mph, hit another moving at 
about 14 miles per hour. Four engines and seven cars derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	An official with the National Transportation Safety Board, which  
is investigating the mishap, said the unidentified engineer had 
been warned prior to the accident that another train would be 
coming in the opposite direction. The engineer was told to stop his 
southbound train to let the northbound train move into a siding, 
said lead investigator Russ Gober. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all knew what to do, where to do it and how to do it,''  
Gober said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer has been too distraught to talk with investigators,  
Gober said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show that the red signal light, which could have been seen  
for two miles and required a full stop, was working properly. The 
brakes on the trains also have been tested and they were 
functioning properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Gober said the engineer radioed seconds after the accident,  
saying ``I made a bad mistake. I used bad judgment. We're turned 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trains, both called the Silver Palm, were carrying a total  
245 passengers, 17 service personnel and six crew members. The 
trains originated in Miami and New York City and collided near 
downtown Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Supremacist's Law License Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Matt Hale doesn't hide his white  
supremacist views. He says his honesty is keeping him from becoming 
a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Peoria man's appeal for his law license was rejected  
when a state hearing board decided his beliefs and character make 
him ill-suited to practice law, and unable to follow the state's 
rules of conduct for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said Friday he planned to appeal his case to the state  
Supreme Court and file a federal civil rights lawsuit. He said he 
believes many practicing lawyers share his racist beliefs but keep 
them hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are a racist, as am I, then they're saying you don't  
have the right to say what you believe and be a lawyer. That's a 
denial of free speech,'' Hale said. ``If someone doesn't like what 
I have to say, I don't have a problem with that. But why can't I 
practice law?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason, according to the commissioners who decided against  
granting Hale's appeal, is that his beliefs are in ``absolute 
contradiction'' to the required conduct of lawyers as regulated 
through disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale is the leader of a white supremacist group called the World  
Church of the Creator, a movement that couches inflammatory racist 
language in religious tones. 
</P>
<P>
	After he graduated from Southern Illinois University law school  
and passed the bar exam, an Illinois Supreme Court panel that 
decides the fitness of would-be lawyers denied him his license in 
December. The panel cited a ``gross deficiency in moral 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale appealed to the full Committee on Character and Fitness, a  
board of five lawyers and judges. 
</P>
<P>
	In its six-page report released Wednesday, the committee quoted  
racial slurs from Hale's own Web site as evidence of his ``bad 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hale cannot wrap himself in the First Amendment and avoid  
any inquiry into his character and fitness,'' the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is absolutely entitled to hold these beliefs, but at the  
same time the public and the bar are entitled to be treated fairly 
and decently by attorneys.''

<HEADLINE> Norway Seeks Berth in Soccer Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Linda Medalen, who's been through this  
before, says the younger players on Norway's women's soccer team 
have no idea what it's like to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	She'd like to help them find out.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know the feeling,'' Medalen said of the seven remaining  
members of the team that won the gold medal in 1995. ``We know how 
good it makes you feel, and how happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the other girls have a clue what it will feel  
like until it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Norway will play China on Sunday in the World  
Cup semifinals at Foxboro Stadium. With a victory, the Norwegians 
would earn a berth in their third consecutive World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their 1995 championship, Norway played for the  
title in 1991, losing to the United States 2-1. Only Medalen, 
midfielder Hege Riise and goalkeeper Bente Nordby remain from that 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's special, because we have been there before,'' Riise said.  
``We know what to do and we know how much fun it is. We try to get 
our experience over to the younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tone Gunn Frustol, Ann Kristen Aarones, Marianne Pettersen and  
Anne Nymark Andersen also remain from the 1995 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have some players with international  
experience at a high level,'' Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans ``can show themselves for the younger players -- at  
the matches and between the matches,'' he said. ``Their way of 
showing concentration at training and matches, how you prepare 
yourself. You can see them set a good standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hogmo doesn't ask anything extra of his veterans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is equal,'' Medalen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Midfielder Solveig Gulbrandsen doesn't remember much about the  
1991 title game; she was only 10 at the time. She then watched the 
1995 World Cup final, unable to even imagine that she would be 
playing alongside Riise four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's so good,'' Gulbrandsen said of her fellow midfielder,  
who was awarded a golden ball and silver shoe in the 1995 
tournament. ``I hope I would be as good as her someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Norway still has to beat China to reach the final,  
the excitement already is building back home. TV ratings are as 
high as 10 percent, press officer Jon Jamessen said, despite games 
that start about midnight local time. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's far different from what would happen should Norway  
win it all. After the 1995 victory, the team plane was escorted 
back from Sweden by an F-16 military jet and celebrating crowds 
welcomed them back home. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also got to meet the prime minister.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't meet the king, but he sent congratulations,''  
Medalen said. 
</P>
<P>
	How about if they win again?  
</P>
<P>
	``You never know,'' she said. ``He always congratulates us.''

<HEADLINE> Pele Torn by U.S.-Brazil Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- He's the greatest player from the most  
successful soccer nation, Brazil. He's the man who sparked the 
development of the sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	So who better to analyze Sunday's Women's World Cup semifinal  
between the Americans and Brazilians than Pele? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a very difficult situation,'' Pele said Saturday in an  
exclusive interview with The Associated Press. ``My heart is with 
Brazil, but on the other hand, I'm very happy the U.S. team has 
done so well. I was active with my soccer camps years ago and 
teaching the `beautiful game' to young girls across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This leaves me in a very emotional state. I only wish this was  
the final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final will be at the Rose Bowl next Saturday, with the  
winner of the China-Norway semifinal meeting the survivor from 
Stanford Stadium. Pele, who is the soccer spokesman for official 
sponsor MasterCard, hopes to see either Brazil or the United States 
win at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, however, he is reliving the emotions of July 4, 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember feeling this way five years ago during the men's  
World Cup '94, when Brazil played the U.S. in the second round,'' 
Pele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil won that game 1-0 and went on to win its fourth world  
title, a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele was a guiding force for U.S. soccer during the 1970s. After  
leading Brazil to its first three World Cup titles, he joined the 
Cosmos of the North American Soccer League and started a soccer 
boom on the professional level that lasted into the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, his work through clinics and as an ambassador  
for the sport was instrumental in establishing grass roots 
programs. Those programs produced the players who will take the 
field Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	And he likes what he is seeing on the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased to see how much attention the tournament has  
received worldwide,'' Pele said. ``The level of play has been 
fantastic, very open, just the way I like it. This tournament no 
doubt will provide a tremendous lift to women's soccer around the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the makeup of the teams, Pele sees something very  
special: inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil showed a lot of heart after allowing Nigeria to tie the  
game,'' he said of the Brazilians' 4-3 overtime victory in the 
quarterfinals after they blew a 3-0 halftime lead. ``Sissi has been 
a true leader and the key to Brazil's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will need to shore up the defense against the Americans  
in order to keep it close, because the U.S. team has so many strong 
finishers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Americans have displayed great depth, always a key  
to going far in a tournament involving five games in two weeks just 
to get to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Brazil, they have a big star.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mia Hamm, she is terrific to watch,'' Pele said. ``She has  
great ball control and moves so well on the field, always sure of 
herself. She plays the game with Brazilian flair and style. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. also showed tremendous heart and a great will to win  
against the Germans. Their bench is very solid, with players like 
Shannon Macmillan, who seems to be in the right place at the right 
time -- all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who does Pele favor for this final that is causing him so  
much emotional distress? 
</P>
<P>
	Silence. He'll just watch and enjoy.

	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton and 74 other

said Michael Hardy, the minister's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpton and the protesters knelt on the roadway put up no  
resistance when they were arrested and taken away in a police bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had diverted traffic from the demonstration before it  
began. Still, traffic headed into Atlantic City was backed up for 
as much as 3 miles from the exit where it was diverted off the 
expressway. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration was called to attract attention to racial  
profiling, the targeting of specific minorities for traffic stops. 
Sharpton says Gov. Christine Whitman has been slow to acknowledge 
the existence of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough had no comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the people arrested were the mother and sister of Stanton  
Crew, a black motorist who was shot to death by police on 
Interstate 80 last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration came one day after a review team released a  
report that said state police have done little to fight harassment 
and discrimination within the ranks and have lagged in recruitment 
of women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also called for the creation of a permanent civilian  
review panel to oversee state police.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson's Wimbledon Run Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Millions of kids who grew up in the 1980s  
idolized Dr. J, a treasure from the moment he first soared higher 
with a basketball than any man before him. 
</P>
<P>
	His breathtaking artistry on the court was matched by his  
ambassador skills away from it. Talent, sportsmanship, articulation 
and gentlemanly behavior; what else could a child want in a role 
model? 
</P>
<P>
	Or in a father?  
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning revelation for one of the world's most famous  
athletes, Julius Erving said Friday he is the father of 18-year-old 
tennis sensation Alexandra Stevenson. His statement by telephone to 
The Associated Press came shortly after Stevenson made history on 
another continent, becoming the first female qualifier to advance 
to the Wimbledon semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a momentous day for the young, captivating player from  
California and for Erving, the former Philadelphia 76ers star who 
is now a vice president with the NBA's Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I acknowledge a relationship with her mother in 1980,'' Erving  
said from his office in Florida. ``My wife, who has known from the 
beginning, and children are aware of this situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All matters concerning Alexandra since her birth have been  
handled privately through counsel. I am pleased to see Alexandra, 
at 18, doing so well and I applaud her mother's efforts and 
courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Erving was Stevenson's father was raised  
this week when the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., published 
a copy of her birth certificate. Though it listed her father as 
Julius Winfield Erving II, Erving's legal name, the basketball 
great initially denied being her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, whose middle name is Winfield, has taken Wimbledon by  
storm with her game and presence and also by the controversy that 
has shadowed her run to the semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Samantha Stevenson, is a free-lance journalist who  
covered the 76ers while Erving starred on the team. She stirred 
Wimbledon with accusations of racism and lesbianism on the WTA Tour 
and with a dispute over prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother and daughter declined comment Friday when asked several  
times about Erving's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Stevenson's remarkable run at Wimbledon ended today in  
the semifinals when he was beaten by Lindsay Davenport 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson had advanced by beating another qualifier, 16-year-old  
Jelena Dokic, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. She hopped and skipped to the net 
after the final point, clapping with one hand on her racquet 
strings and curtsying four times to the crowd on Court 1. 
</P>
<P>
	More than overpowering serves and mammoth ground strokes, she  
exudes a natural-born talent for playing to the crowd. She is an 
aspiring stage performer and ballet dancer. At one point this week, 
she sang her own version of the song ``Sandra Dee'' -- from the 
musical ``Grease'' -- to television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	An ocean away, Dr. J said: ``I haven't talked to her. I only met  
her once, and she was 3 years old. She was brought to me at a 
basketball clinic at a public school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, a Basketball Hall of Famer, was respected and admired  
not only for his extraordinary basketball talents, but for his 
grace in public life. He was Michael Jordan before Jordan came 
along, revolutionizing the game during a 16-year career in the ABA 
and with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the epitome of class off the court -- patient,  
considerate and always gracious to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	If he was watching his daughter on television, there's no way he  
could have missed her crushing serves at speeds up to 113 mph and 
the way she peppered the court with mighty, one-handed backhands 
that are rare in women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	But while her contemporaries idolized Dr. J, his own daughter  
had different ideas. Her idol is Pete Sampras, and she learned that 
devastating backhand from his old coach, Pete Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he would make no further comments about Stevenson.  
Asked if he wanted to meet her again, Erving said, ``I think it's 
probably her call. I've discussed this with my wife and children. 
Of course, I'd be open to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving and wife Turquoise have been married since 1972 and have  
four children. He said he has been supporting Alexandra Stevenson 
financially since her birth. 
</P>
<P>
	News of his statement swept Philadelphia, where Erving is still  
respected and beloved. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a recent tabloid headline screamed, ``Dr. Dad,'' and  
Erving's story led newscasts on radio and television. Many radio 
callers expressed disappointment that Erving's only contact with 
his daughter had been through lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Erving has been successful in business since  
leaving the NBA in 1987. Long gone is the big Afro from his playing 
days; his executive demeanor is accented by prim eyeglasses, 
pinstriped suits and closely cropped, slicked-back hair that is 
streaked with gray. 
</P>
<P>
	He is co-owner of Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., had a  
stake in a cable television company and worked for NBC as an NBA 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he hoped coming forward would ease the distractions  
that have shadowed Stevenson's run at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match  
today,'' Erving said. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving won two championships and two MVP awards in the ABA  
before moving to the NBA. He played 11 seasons for the Sixers, 
winning MVP honors in 1981 and leading Philadelphia to its last 
professional sports championship, in 1983.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Millions of Brazilians tied up the  
nation's telephone lines by testing a new long distance service 
launched Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Brazil's first day of private competition for  
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the new system began at midnight, there have been an  
average of 1 million calls an hour -- double the typical volume -- 
according to Embratel, the former state long-distance carrier that 
lost its monopoly Saturday and is now owned by MCI WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of the calls were made by people who tied up  
lines by using incorrectly a new menu of phone numbers for long 
distance calls, according to the government's National 
Telecommunications Agency, Anatel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be problems, but we didn't think it would  
reach this dimension,'' Anatel President Renato Guerreiro said.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Computer hackers broke into a  
government Internet site for the second time in two weeks, a news 
agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers gained access to the homepage of the Ministry of  
Science and Technology. They then re-directed users to their site, 
which was filled with criticism of the government of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 17, the same group hacked their way into the Internet  
site of Brazil's Supreme Court and the presidential palace, urging 
users to protest against Cardoso's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said they are trying to identify the

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Dallas man has begun his second  
attempt to make a 3,100-mile trip to Hawaii on a wooden raft, 
tracing a route believed to have been used by an ancient tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-man crew led by John Haslett of Dallas left Friday night  
from Costa Rica's Pacific coast in a 46-foot-long raft. The trip 
could last three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The raft is almost a replica of that used by the Mantenos, a  
little-known tribe dating back to 500 B.C. that lived in what is 
now Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scholars believe that the Mantenos had a maritime empire  
that traded with the Aztecs in Mexico. The raft replica could show 
whether the Mantenos had the ability to undertake long voyages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are serious adventurers determined to prove the value of a  
civilization mostly ignored in the books and by scholars,'' Haslett 
said. 
</P>

	An earlier effort was aborted in March.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- In an effort to cut costs, the Costa  
Rican government said Saturday it will close four embassies and 
four consulates.

	The embassies will be closed in Greece, South Korea, the Czech  
Republic and Romania. The consulates will be closed in the U.S. 
cities of San Francisco, San Antonio and Tampa, Fla., and in the 
Ecuadorean capital of Quito.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Scorch Nevada, California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A wildfire whipped by gusty wind roared  
through tinder-dry brush and sagebrush in the southeast part of the 
city, damaging two homes and blackening 3,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was 60 percent contained today, even though wind  
continued blowing at a steady 20 to 30 mph with stronger gusts, 
said fire spokeswoman Jocelyn Biro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been full bore all night,'' Biro said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a forest fire pushed by 20 mph wind  
burned out of control near the town of Lewiston, destroying 23 
homes and charring more than 2,000 acres by early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 500 residents and tourists were evacuated because of the  
California blaze. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno fire heavily damaged two homes and destroyed a garage  
as it raced through 3,000 acres, Biro said. Officials earlier had 
said the fire burned 6,000 acres. Two firefighters suffered minor 
injuries, said Steve Frady of the Nevada Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a little tiny brush fire that was about half mile away  
by the road,'' said Sharon Stanley. ``Within 10 minutes, it had cut 
us off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley said the family loaded up their dogs, turned on their  
lawn sprinklers and were leaving their home when the flames 
surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter dropped water and an air tanker doused them with  
fire retardant, she said. The home was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very fortunate,'' Mrs. Stanley said. ``The people next  
door lost their house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of firefighters tackled the fire, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the California blaze about 300 miles north of San Francisco,  
most evacuees found refuge with relatives or friends, but about 100 
people spent the night at a nearby school, said state fire 
spokeswoman Mike Bretagna. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire spread into the Shasta-Trinity National Forest when a  
controlled burn got out of hand because of high wind, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in this community is just furious because we've had  
five days of over 100-degree heat. Nobody is allowed to burn 
anything,'' said Connor Nixon, owner of a local inn. ``Here these 
turkeys get out in an open field with trees all around and do a 
controlled burn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no estimate of when the fire would be contained.

<HEADLINE> 75 Arrested in Expressway Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton and 75 other  
people were arrested Saturday when they converged on the Atlantic 
City Expressway to protest racial profiling by state police. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpton arrived with five busloads of protesters wearing  
T-shirts emblazoned with ``New Jersey, the Police State'' on the 
front and ``Stop the Korrupt Kop Killers, Christine Whitman and her 
Hitmen'' on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters knelt on the roadway and put up no resistance  
when they were arrested. They were taken away in police buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had diverted traffic from the demonstration before it  
began. Still, traffic headed into Atlantic City was backed up for 
as much as 3 miles from the exit where it was diverted off the 
expressway. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration was called to attract attention to racial  
profiling, the targeting of specific minorities for traffic stops. 
Sharpton says Gov. Christine Whitman has been slow to acknowledge 
the existence of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to keep the pressure on,'' Sharpton said. ``We will  
stay on her case until we get justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough had no comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the people arrested were the mother and sister of Stanton

<P>
	The protesters were charged with violating the city's ``peace  
and good order'' ordinance, which carries a maximum penalty of one 
year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Sharpton was also charged with 
obstructing a highway.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-Era Questions Haunt Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Questions about whether George W. Bush  
received preferential treatment to gain entry into the Texas Air 
National Guard during the Vietnam War are being resurrected as his 
presidential campaign picks up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's service in the Guard, where he became a fighter pilot, is  
well known and has been covered in Texas newspaper and magazine 
stories going back to at least 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 story examined whether Bush and other sons of prominent  
Texas families received preferential treatment in gaining entry to 
National Guard units. It noted that the son of Lloyd Bentsen, a 
former senator, vice presidential nominee and Treasury Secretary, 
was in the same unit as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bentsen was running for vice president that year and  
subsequently debated his Republican counterpart, Dan Quayle, whose 
own entry into the Indiana National Guard was being questioned at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Later stories by other publications covered similar ground.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported in Sunday's editions that a  
review of 200 pages of Bush's military records, along with 
interviews with a number of people who served with him, provided 
fresh details. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper concluded that Bush lacked the military experience and  
aviation skills that some other applicants had when he was admitted 
to the elite ranks of those training to be fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	After basic training, he received an instant commission making  
him a second lieutenant and was sent to pilot training. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times also said many of his former comrades and  
superiors in the Guard remember Bush as a bright young leader who 
worked hard. Echoing Bush's own statements, they said that he would 
have gone to Vietnam had his Guard unit been called up. 
</P>
<P>
	And it said it found no evidence of illegality or breach of  
regulations in connection with Bush's National Guard career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News also reviewed Bush's military history  
and said the records showed that while Bush's unit in Texas had a 
waiting list for many spots, he was accepted because he was one of 
a handful of applicants willing and qualified to spend more than a 
year in active training, and lots of time after training, flying 
single-seat F-102 fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter B. ``Buck'' Staudt, a retired guard brigadier general who  
was Bush's commanding officer, repeatedly has denied over the years 
that any influence was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush also has denied helping his son in  
military, business or political careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times noted the issue of Bush's military service has already  
come up in the current campaign with one of his rivals for the 
nomination, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joking that as a prisoner of 
war in North Vietnam he slept more soundly knowing that Bush was 
defending the shores of Texas from invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a Yale graduate, has said he joined the National Guard  
rather than volunteer for Army combat duty because he wanted to 
learn how to fly jet fighters. His father was a World War II 
fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to fly just like his daddy,'' Staudt told  
the Times. ``Neither his daddy nor anybody else got him into the 
Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In service reports, Staudt, described Bush as a ``quiet,  
intelligent young man'' who ``meets all the requirements 
established for this appointment program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our information is there was absolutely no special deal,''  
David Beckwith, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, told the Times.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Vanderbilt Star Deiderich Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GALLATIN, Tenn. (AP) -- George Deiderich, an All-America guard  
for Vanderbilt in 1958, is dead after a long battle with cancer. He

</P>
<P>
	Deiderich, who died Friday, was an offensive and defensive guard  
for the Commodores and a two-time All-SEC selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Deiderich, selected in the 23rd round of the 1959 NFL draft by  
the Los Angeles Rams, spent two seasons with the Canadian Football 
League's Montreal Alouettes. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been scheduled to represent Vanderbilt this year during  
the Legends Dinner at the Southeastern Conference football 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be Monday at Alexander Funeral Home.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pitches for Baseball Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DYERSVILLE, Iowa (AP) -- Taking up the cause of infamous baseball  
legend Shoeless Joe Jackson, presidential hopefuls Bill Bradley and 
John Kasich came to the town where ``Field of Dreams'' was filmed, 
declaring Saturday that baseball's hierarchy may have barred an 
innocent star from the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly think (Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud)  
Selig should take a look'' at whether Jackson was treated unfairly, 
Democrat Bradley said during a weekend of baseball and celebrity 
softball. ``It should be re-evaluated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the guy got ripped off,'' said Kasich, R-Ohio. ``He  
was done wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banned from baseball after being accused of throwing the 1919  
World Series while playing for the Chicago White Sox, Jackson was 
later acquitted of criminal charges. The movie ``Field of Dreams'' 
popularized his plight, with actor Kevin Costner pointing to 
Jackson's stellar performance in the 1919 Series as proof that one 
of the game's greatest hitters never took a dive for gamblers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking part in a celebrity baseball game, Bradley didn't do too  
poorly himself, cracking a home run to left field and drawing 
admiration from teammate Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the mojo right now ,'' Kasich said, as Bradley  
trooped across the plate with his home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just doing a day's work,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kasich sought to answer, but flied out to center field.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bradley declared, ``This must be heaven, this is Iowa,''  
stealing a line from the Costner film, in which the long-dead 
Jackson and other baseball greats play on a field that Costner has 
built for them by clearing his cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller autographed baseballs, and  
lobbied for Jackson's admission to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the third-greatest hitter in history'' and ``he deserves  
to be in there,'' said Feller, a Republican who invited Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who helped launch a celebrity baseball  
game, has written Selig asking for Jackson's case to be reopened 
and has introduced a resolution in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich chuckled that Jackson's banishment from the game  
``probably was some kind of independent counsel, a Ken Starr type 
of thing. He was made an example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dyersville was turned into something of a memorial for Jackson,  
with parades and traveling baseball exhibits, along with displays 
of Shoeless Joe memorabilia. Kasich bought four shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Former National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Bradley  
deadpanned that ``I agreed to play only one inning'' in the 
celebrity game. ``To do otherwise would be to put the other team at 
a serious disadvantage. I have blinding speed on the basepaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in the state where precinct caucuses launch the presidential  
nominating season, Bradley took time out from a rain-drenched 
parade in Independence to declare his allegiance to ethanol, 
important in corn-rich Iowa. Kasich urged big new tax cuts based on 
new projections of a growing surplus.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Pat Ireland laced up a new pair of  
sneakers and hobbled out of the hospital on his own two feet. No 
wheelchair was needed for the survivor of the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The image of Ireland's bloody, limp body falling from a school  
window on April 20 was captured on national television, giving the 
nation an unforgettable glimpse of the horror behind the school 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 10 weeks later, Pat stood in front of Craig Hospital on  
Friday, a testimony to healing and success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really exciting that I've made it this far and going home  
is just the next step,'' he said. ``I'm doing good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat, 17, was one of the most critically wounded victims. He was  
shot once in the foot and twice in the head. One bullet grazed his 
scalp but another lodged into his brain, causing severe trauma that 
has left him partially paralyzed on his right side. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces months of rehabilitation in addition to the hundreds of  
hours he has already spent working with physical and speech 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
	When Pat began therapy, he had difficulty with movement tasks  
because of the partial paralysis on his right side. He had to 
relearn how to eat, dress himself and walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's doctor, Dr. Alan Weintraub, described his recovery as  
``impressive'' though expected. ``For Pat, his goal is full 
recovery,'' Weintraub said. ``Might it be different? We just don't 
know. It's too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat says he intends to join his fellow classmates at Columbine  
when the school year begins in August. He also hopes to back on 
water skis -- one of his passions -- by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to get out to the lake and water ski, that's  
been the biggest disappointment up to this point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 25 people were wounded and 13 killed by teen gunmen Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold, who took their school by storm before 
turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the attack, donations have poured in from around the world  
and several funds have been established to help pay for victim and 
community needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Healing Fund, initiated by Mile High United Way, grew to  
$3.8 million and an advisory committee was formed to decide how to 
best spend the money. On Friday, officials announced how the money 
would be doled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest portion -- $1.46 million -- will be paid in lump sums  
to victims. John Ireland said the payment was a good beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start to the rehabilitation process for each one  
of these kids here and obviously there's going to be more and more 
needed all the time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, today's Denver Post reported that ballistic testing  
done by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation bolsters earlier 
indications that Harris and Klebold were the only people firing 
guns in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on ballistics examinations, there is no indication of a  
third shooter,'' an unidentified source told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> 1994 World Cup No Party for U.S.A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Same countries. Same day.  
</P>
<P>
	Only it didn't turn into a Fourth of July party at Stanford  
Stadium on July 4, 1994, not for the Americans, whose World Cup 
ride ended with a 1-0, second-round loss to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	For many players, it was the pinnacle of their soccer lives. The  
careers of Tab Ramos, Tony Meola and John Harkes have never been 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep building from here,'' Paul Caligiuri said  
after the deflating defeat. ``Four years from now, we have to go 
beyond what we accomplished here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Americans were embarrassed at the 1998 World Cup in  
France: A veteran team was crippled by dissension and went 0-3, 
finishing last in the 32-team field. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything seemed to be going right five years ago. Crowds  
at the pool of the Holiday Inn in Palo Alto, Calif., cheered the 
Americans as they walked by to board the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win tomorrow, people will think of us as a team that can  
play in the World Cup and win the World Cup,'' Meola said before 
the game. ``People will be wondering how far this team can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, coach Bora Milutinovic had all 11 players on defense,  
and the Americans resembled the terrified college kids by 
Czechoslovakia four years earlier in the first World Cup match for 
the U.S. in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil outshot the Americans 16-4, and even though the game was  
scoreless at halftime, there was a feeling it was only a matters of 
time until the South Americans broke through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put up a good fight,'' said U.S. forward Roy Wegerle. ``In  
the second 45, they proved too strong and too smart for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian defender Leonardo, who has gone on to a stellar career  
with AC Milan in Italy, was ejected in the final minute of the 
first half after elbowing Ramos in the left temple and causing a 
skull fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos came back, but twice blew out his knee in the following  
four years, and has never been the same player. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil dominated the entire second half despite its disadvantage  
and scored in the 70th minute. Romario outran Thomas Dooley in the 
center of the field, went around Cobi Jones, to the side of Alexi 
Lalas and sent the ball across to Bebeto at the right side of the 
penalty area. He beat Meola to the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going a hundred miles an hour,'' Lalas said. ``These  
guys are dribbling maniacs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Harkes lost his job as captain of the U.S. team and  
was traded from D.C. United to the New England Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola appeared just twice for the national team, failed to make  
the New York Jets as a kicker, acted Off-Broadway and tore his knee 
ligament in March, putting him on the sidelines for the entire MLS 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The careers of Lalas, Caligiuri, Balboa and Hugo Perez  
floundered. Fernando Clavijo retired from international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the starters, only Thomas Dooley, Mike Sorber, Jones and  
Ernie Stewart went on to better days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we can do. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough  
today,'' Meola said. ``I think there are probably a lot of people 
that are really proud of what we did, that hold their heads up high 
that we now have a national team that can compete with the rest of 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Meola's statement has proven true only in  
exhibitions. In the World Cup, the Americans still haven't proven 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with saying we failed,'' Lalas said  
after the debacle in France. ``If we're saying we want to be viewed 
as a progressive soccer-playing nation, we want to be viewed along 
with the best teams, we have to be honest -- both when we succeed 
and when we fail. If we're just going to continue saying, `Rah, rah 
for the red-white-and-blue, and we played well and we showed 
things,' we might as well have orange peels at halftime and it'll 
be a youth league.''

<HEADLINE> Lee Movie Depicts Summer of Sam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was a deranged serial killer, a heat wave,  
a citywide blackout, looting and terrorist bombs. Subway cars were 
covered with graffiti and the South Bronx was on fire. Disco and 
punk rock headed for a showdown; the Yankees headed for their first 
World Series victory in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's summer of 1977 was unforgettable for anyone who lived  
through it. Now, more than two decades later, director Spike Lee 
has revived the terror and turmoil in a controversial new movie, 
``Summer of Sam,'' which opened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything happened that summer,'' Lee said in an interview  
with The Associated Press. ``It was one of the hottest summers ever 
in New York City. Disco, Studio 54, CBGBs, Plato's Retreat, Reggie 
Jackson's first year in the Yankees -- that summer has always been 
very memorable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lee's has done more than bring back the memories -- he's also  
brought back the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	David Berkowitz, the serial killer who sent taunting notes  
signed ``Son of Sam,'' complained about the movie in a prison 
interview with The New York Times, which put his remarks on its 
front page. Some families of his victims are angry at Lee and have 
said so in the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to bury the man,'' Neysa Moskowitz, mother of  
Berkowitz's last victim, said from her home in Miami. ``How dare 
he? God forbid something happened to one of his children, would he 
like someone to write about it? It just opens up a can of worms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lee has defended his artistic right to portray  
historic events, saying the families wrongly assume the film 
glamorizes violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This film is not really about David Berkowitz,'' Lee said.  
``This film does not trace the mind of a serial killer. This film 
is about the effect he had on the mental state of 8 million New 
Yorkers at the same time as one of the city's most brutal, hot 
summers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz's string of random shootings -- which left six dead and  
four wounded, most of them young women with long, dark hair sitting 
in cars with their dates -- unfolded over the course of a year. By 
the time he struck his last four victims -- on June 26 and July 31 
of 1977 -- police were conducting one of the largest manhunts in 
city history. 
</P>
<P>
	``NO ONE IS SAFE!'' a New York Post headline screamed.  
Restaurant and night club business suffered. Skittish brunettes 
bleached their hair or wore blonde wigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz was arrested Aug. 10 after police tracked down a  
parking ticket he got at the last murder scene. He claimed he'd 
been ordered to kill by the dog of a neighbor named Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	The killer, who says he's a born-again Christian, declined an  
interview request from the AP but sent two letters with his views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely nothing against Spike Lee,'' he wrote from  
the Sullivan Correctional Facility. ``While I do not like the idea 
of this movie coming out and so much of the ugly past having to 
resurface again, as for Mr. Lee, I pray for him and his family and 
I wish them God's blessings in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is furious that Berkowitz's opinions have even been sought  
by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think he and I had switched places!'' Lee said.  
``When does his become a voice of moral reasoning? Why go to this 
crazy man and say, 'What do you think of this movie?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Son of Sam was only one cause for hysteria that summer. On Aug.  
4, terrorist bombs linked to Puerto Rican nationalists went off in 
two midtown office buildings, killing one man and hurting seven 
more. A heat wave set four records with temperatures as high as 104 
degrees. And on July 13, at 9:34 p.m., a 25-hour blackout began, 
followed by widespread looting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a formative time for Lee, who spent the night of the  
blackout sitting on the front steps of his family's home in 
Brooklyn. He was 20, and had just finished his sophomore year at 
Morehouse College in Atlanta. The city was still reeling from the 
effects of near-bankruptcy two years earlier. Inflation was up and 
employment was down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't find a job,'' said Lee, whose ``Do the Right  
Thing'' also depicts a city neighborhood during a heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent the whole summer running around New York with a  
Super-8 camera I got. At the end of the summer, I decided, `I'm 
just going to become a filmmaker.'''

<HEADLINE> Caddie Stable After Heart Stopped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Caddie Garland Dempsey was in critical but  
stable condition Saturday after his heart stopped and he collapsed 
on the 15th hole during the third round of the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey, John Maginnes' caddie, was conscious and breathing on  
his own at Palos Community Hospital, said Rich Stech, the assistant 
chief of the Lemont Fire Protection District. The family has 
requested that no other information be given, said Barbara Bianchi, 
assistant director of nursing at Palos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news seems to be quite positive,'' Stech said. ``He's  
still in critical condition, but he is stable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes looked shaken and drained as he walked off the course  
after shooting a 1-under 71, leaving him eight strokes behind 
leader Tiger Woods. Maginnes got an update from Stech and then went 
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is for Garland right now,'' Maginnes said in a  
statement. ``I'm hoping he is OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why Dempsey, 51, collapsed, but the temperature  
was in the 90s, with the humidity making it feel over 100 degrees. 
Dempsey was walking up the fairway on the 15th hole when he 
collapsed. Maginnes yelled for help and then ran to Dempsey's side. 
Maginnes and Matt Moore, a spotter for ABC, performed CPR until 
paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel him going. I could definitely feel him going,''  
said Moore, a former lifeguard. ``He was going in and out. It was 
the strangest feeling to feel a human being's pulse and then it 
leaves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics used a defibrillator to restore Dempsey's pulse,  
Stech said. He was given an IV and, when stabilized, was loaded on 
a stretcher and taken from the course in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was doing much better,'' Moore said. ``I don't think he was  
fully conscious, but he was responding to the medication, the IV 
they gave him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes, who was five shots off the lead when Dempsey  
collapsed, continued playing, with another ABC crew member, Patrick 
Fitzgerald, replacing Dempsey as caddie. But Maginnes looked dazed 
as he played the rest of the round. When he finished the 15th hole, 
he stood off to the side, looking up to the sky and running a hand 
over his face. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked toward the 18th green with his head down, and gave a  
weak smile when the audience applauded as he finished his round. 
His playing partner, Mike Hulbert, patted Maginnes on the back as 
the two shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a hard time concentrating on the last few holes, but  
golf is not as important right now,'' Maginnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey has been Maginnes' caddie for the past year. He also  
carried Maginnes' bag from 1992-94 on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second year in a row a caddie has collapsed during  
the Western Open. Last year, Greg Kraft's caddie collapsed with 
heat stroke during the third round at Cog Hill Golf and Country 
Club. Mark Hensel was taken to a hospital for IV fluids and was 
back carrying the bag for the final round.

<HEADLINE> Astros Put Bergman on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Houston Astros put pitcher Sean Bergman on  
the 15-day disabled list Saturday with tightness in his right 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros called up right-hander Jose Slusarski from Triple-A  
New Orleans to take his place. Slusarski was 0-3 with a 4.144 
earned-run average in two starts and 23 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman developed soreness last month and was dropped from the  
rotation for rest. The Astros moved reliever Scott Elarton into his 
place in the rotation.

<HEADLINE> Leius and Fryman Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Scott Leius of the Kansas City Royals and  
Travis Fryman of the Cleveland Indians were injured in separate 
plays and removed from the second game of Saturday's day-night 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius dislocated his right shoulder while making a throw from  
first base in the second inning. Fryman sprained a ligament in his 
right knee in a collision with Leius' replacement, Jeremy Giambi, 
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius fielded David Justice's grounder and was prepared to throw  
home in an attempt on Enrique Wilson, who was running from third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible ligament damage,'' Royals manager Tony Muser  
said. ``They took him to the hospital and they popped it back in 
tonight, and he'll go to Kansas City and have an MRI tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Don Wengert, who had broken from the mound to try and  
field the grounder, blocked Leius, who double pumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Wengert ducked and Leius did make the throw, then doubled over  
in pain, clutching his right arm. The throw to catcher Tim Spehr 
was too late and Wilson scored the sixth run of Cleveland's 
eight-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, Fryman grounded out to third baseman Joe Randa,  
whose throw caused Giambi to reach to his right. Fryman ran into 
Giambi and straddled the first baseman for an instant before being 
hurt as he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius was taken to Lutheran Hospital for treatment. Fryman, who  
sprained his medial collateral ligament, will have an MRI at 
Lutheran Hospital on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Led Century of Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After two weeks of stops and starts, skidding and sliding, rain  
occasionally interrupted by sunshine, the grass at Centre Court of 
the All England Club is just about worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparse in some spots, invisible in others, scuffed at the  
service line, beat up at the base line, it still provides the 
setting for great tennis theater, the finals of the fortnight, the 
Wimbledon Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Grand Slam tennis on its most glorious stage.  
</P>
<P>
	In 115 years of the competition on the outskirts of London, no  
woman has dominated that cathedral of tennis more thoroughly than 
Martina Navratilova, who won nine singles championships there. 
</P>
<P>
	Navratilova ruled Centre Court majestically, a master of the  
grass who scooped up some blades as a keepsake after her last final 
there in 1994. She won Wimbledon in 1978 and 1979, then every year 
from 1982 through 1987, and again in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Five times, her victim was old pal Chris Evert, her longtime  
rival in one of the great sports soap operas this century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was special because she had her following and I had mine,''  
said Evert, at Wimbledon for NBC. ``They were different groups. Her 
fans appreciated what she stood for and my fans appreciated what I 
stood for. It was about how we looked, how we acted, our style, 
where we came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navratilova and Evert faced each other 80 times during their  
careers, with Martina holding a 43-37 edge. Nine times, the setting 
was Wimbledon and five of those were in the finals. They split four 
semifinals, Evert winning in 1976 and 1980, Navratilova in 1987 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	But each time they played with the Wimbledon championship at  
stake in 1978, 1979, 1982, 1984 and 1985, Navratilova prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sort of a given that I would play her,'' said  
Navratilova, who now broadcasts the event for HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, Martina planned for their matches, knowing that sooner  
or later, Evert would show up on the other side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, though, that strategy backfired.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Evert and Navratilova seemed headed to a third straight  
showdown. Certainly, Martina thought so. But a funny thing happened 
on the way to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Hana Mandlikova beat Evert in the semifinals, leaving  
Navratilova surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had geared up for Chris for two weeks,'' she said. ``When  
she lost to Hana, it threw me. Now I had to change tactics from 
practicing chips and charges and long baselines. Suddenly, I had a 
serve-and-volleyer on my hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``You prepare for Chris and two days before, it's a total  
U-turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navratilova adjusted her plans, beating Mandlikova 7-6, 6-3 for  
the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wound up winning and that's what counts,'' she said. ``But  
it taught me a lesson about planning for an opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evert won this event three times -- never, however, when  
Navratilova was on the other side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always at a disadvantage there,'' she said. ``Elsewhere,  
I felt it was 50-50. But there, with the grass, that was her best 
surface and my least effective. I always felt I was swimming uphill 
against the tide there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stillshe appreciated the significance of the matches and the  
setting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always got excited,'' she said. ``The adrenaline was  
flowing. I knew every part of my game had to be on. The grass 
created more pressure on my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evert treasures the memories and the matches she played there.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon to me transcends tennis,'' she said. ``The English  
know how to do occasions, whether it's a royal wedding or Ascot or 
Wimbledon. You sense the ghosts that have played there. It's the 
only grass around. The rivalry with Martina made it more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as she played on grass, Navratilova said Wimbledon's  
lawns did not make Evert an easy opponent. 
</P>

	``I was better against her on other surfaces,'' she said. ``It  
was hard to create much against her on grass. On a surface with a 
high bounce, I did better. She knew it was easier for me to serve 
and volley. Her ball was low and deep, easier to attack on a slower 
court. It was more difficult for her to hit a passing shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, perhaps, playing Evert at Wimbledon did not add  
that much to the rivalry for Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing Chris was special enough all by itself,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once, early on in their careers, Evert and Navratilova played  
doubles together, a master of the baseline and a serve-and-volley 
expert in what seemed an almost unfair alliance. They won the 
French Open in 1975 and a year later took the Wimbledon 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they went their separate ways, destined to meet again in  
singles matches all over the tennis world, but rarely in one as 
regal as Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> Panel Finds Bias in NJ State Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A state panel that concluded some State  
Patrol officers target drivers on the basis of race has found that 
minority and female troopers are mistreated by their own 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General John Farmer said the report found that minority  
and female troopers often did not receive ``fully respectful,'' 
treatment -- and that there were enough stories and lawsuits 
alleging discrimination or harassment to cause concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisors and troopers themselves have done too little to  
address the problem, Farmer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A significant cause of concern is not that a substantial  
number of troopers exhibit bigoted and discriminatory conduct but 
that the few who do in subtle and not so subtle ways are able to 
continue to get away with it,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said troopers linked to offensive behavior have  
been promoted to positions of authority. It blamed state police 
leaders for not aggressively recruiting female and minority 
troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second and final report from a review team that in  
April concluded highway patrol troopers had been practicing 
``racial profiling.'' That report mandated new training and written 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report does not require a management shakeup nor does it  
impose sweeping changes in how troopers do their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to issue this report and say the problem is  
leadership, and to make no changes in the present leadership, means 
that this report is not worth the paper it is written on,'' said 
the Rev. Reginald Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council 
of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman said nothing in the report convinces her  
that a new superintendent could not be hired from within the ranks. 
Whitman fired the previous superintendent in February for published 
remarks she regarded as racially insensitive.

<HEADLINE> Food Industry Opposes Recall Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The food industry, which now decides when to  
recall tainted products, objected Saturday to President Clinton's 
push for government authority to force recalls of unsafe meat and 
poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should grant'' the Agriculture Department ``the  
authority to impose civil penalties and to order mandatory recalls 
of unsafe meat and poultry,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government mandates may score political points but they won't  
make the system safer,'' said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the 
Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade association of brand-name 
food companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Grabowski said that whenever there have been beef recalls, the  
companies, in order to maintain ``consumer trust,'' move more 
rapidly than the government ever could to address problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies have every incentive to act swiftly and responsibly  
in protecting the world's safest food supply,'' said Grabowski. The 
lobbying group represents 132 of the largest food companies in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said in his weekly radio address that he is acting  
to ward off a potential health hazard by assuring that food 
products rejected at one U.S. port are conspicuously marked and not 
easily slipped past inspectors at another -- a practice known as 
``port shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a right to know that the food they serve their  
families is safe, whether it comes from the far corners of the 
world or the corner produce stand,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is ordering the Customs Service and the Food and  
Drug Administration to ``rigorously enforce and expand our policy 
of destroying imported food that poses a serious health threat 
rather than risk letting it reach our grocery stores or the global 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he does not want to be unduly alarmist.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no evidence that these fruits and vegetables are less  
safe than those grown here in the United States,'' Clinton said. 
``But some recent outbreaks of food-borne illness have been traced 
in imported foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to the secretaries of the Treasury and Health and  
Human Services departments, Clinton noted that food imports have 
doubled over the past seven years and that a further 30 percent 
increase is expected by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	And he called attention to a recent General Accounting Office  
report which concluded that some food importers are sidestepping 
the laws ``and getting contaminated foods across our borders and 
onto our kitchen tables. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes only one 'bad apple' to spoil the whole bunch, only  
one shipment of contaminated food to threaten hundreds, even 
thousands of Americans,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress should vote the full $72 million he requested  
to increase the number of inspectors and checks of high-risk food 
products in the United States and increase the number of 
inspections of food processors around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Tucker Foreman, head of the Consumer Federation of  
America, applauded Clinton's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``With today's announcement, the president has done just about  
all he can do through the executive branch to assure the safety of 
imported foods,'' she said in a statement. ``With Americans eating 
increasingly from an international plate, this is an important 
issue for all of us.''

<HEADLINE>  1994 World Cup No Party for U.S.A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Same countries. Same day.  
</P>
<P>
	Only it didn't turn into a Fourth of July party at Stanford  
Stadium on July 4, 1994, not for the Americans, whose World Cup 
ride ended with a 1-0, second-round loss to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	For many players, it was the pinnacle of their soccer lives. The  
careers of Tab Ramos, Tony Meola and John Harkes have never been 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep building from here,'' Paul Caligiuri said  
after the deflating defeat. ``Four years from now, we have to go 
beyond what we accomplished here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Americans were embarrassed at the 1998 World Cup in  
France: A veteran team was crippled by dissension and went 0-3, 
finishing last in the 32-team field. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything seemed to be going right five years ago. Crowds  
at the pool of the Holiday Inn in Palo Alto, Calif., cheered the 
Americans as they walked by to board the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win tomorrow, people will think of us as a team that can  
play in the World Cup and win the World Cup,'' Meola said before 
the game. ``People will be wondering how far this team can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, coach Bora Milutinovic had all 11 players on defense,  
and the Americans resembled the terrified college kids by 
Czechoslovakia four years earlier in the first World Cup match for 
the U.S. in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil outshot the Americans 16-4, and even though the game was  
scoreless at halftime, there was a feeling it was only a matters of 
time until the South Americans broke through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put up a good fight,'' said U.S. forward Roy Wegerle. ``In  
the second 45, they proved too strong and too smart for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian defender Leonardo, who has gone on to a stellar career  
with AC Milan in Italy, was ejected in the final minute of the 
first half after elbowing Ramos in the left temple and causing a 
skull fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos came back, but twice blew out his knee in the following  
four years, and has never been the same player. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil dominated the entire second half despite its disadvantage  
and scored in the 70th minute. Romario outran Thomas Dooley in the 
center of the field, went around Cobi Jones, to the side of Alexi 
Lalas and sent the ball across to Bebeto at the right side of the 
penalty area. He beat Meola to the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going a hundred miles an hour,'' Lalas said. ``These  
guys are dribbling maniacs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Harkes lost his job as captain of the U.S. team and  
was traded from D.C. United to the New England Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola appeared just twice for the national team, failed to make  
the New York Jets as a kicker, acted Off-Broadway and tore his knee 
ligament in March, putting him on the sidelines for the entire MLS 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The careers of Lalas, Caligiuri, Balboa and Hugo Perez  
floundered. Fernando Clavijo retired from international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the starters, only Thomas Dooley, Mike Sorber, Jones and  
Ernie Stewart went on to better days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we can do. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough  
today,'' Meola said. ``I think there are probably a lot of people 
that are really proud of what we did, that hold their heads up high 
that we now have a national team that can compete with the rest of 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Meola's statement has proven true only in  
exhibitions. In the World Cup, the Americans still haven't proven 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with saying we failed,'' Lalas said  
after the debacle in France. ``If we're saying we want to be viewed 
as a progressive soccer-playing nation, we want to be viewed along 
with the best teams, we have to be honest -- both when we succeed 
and when we fail. If we're just going to continue saying, `Rah, rah 
for the red-white-and-blue, and we played well and we showed 
things,' we might as well have orange peels at halftime and it'll 
be a youth league.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WAKEFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A man who was declared unfit to stand  
trial on weapons charges was charged again after his mental 
capabilities appeared fine in a 10-month Internet romance with an 
undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the relationship showed that Stephen DiCenso  
had faked mental incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCenso, 24, was charged in federal court Friday with possessing  
a machine gun, unregistered firearms and a gun with an erased 
serial number. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCenso had faced the same charges in February 1997, but a judge  
ruled he was incompetent to face the charges after a heroin 
overdose apparently left him brain damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The overdose occurred the day after police found tissue, blood  
and hair from his ex-girlfriend, Aislin Silva, in a trash bin in 
Danvers, a community north of Boston. Several empty bags of lime, 
which can speed decomposition, were also found in the bin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Silva, 19, vanished in November 1996. Although DiCenso was  
not charged in her disappearance, prosecutors said she had been 
cooperating with investigators on a gun-possession case against 
DiCenso. 
</P>
<P>
	His re-arrest Friday came after an agent from the U.S. Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- posing as a female student from the 
University of New Hampshire -- spent months on the Internet trying 
to get DiCenso to talk about Ms. Silva's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit filed by ATF agent John A. Mercer Jr.,  
DiCenso spoke in e-mails of making $100,000 as a marijuana dealer 
for the Mafia and bragged about his involvement in Ms. Silva's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Mercer arranged for an undercover female officer to  
pose as a student and meet DiCenso at a restaurant. At the meeting, 
DiCenso showed newspaper clippings about Ms. Silva's disappearance 
and the remains found in the trash bin, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychiatrist testified in court Friday that the e-mails, a  
videotape of the restaurant meeting and DiCenso's medical records 
show he is competent to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes $1 Trillion Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing a $1 trillion tax cut proposal, the  
Republican Party marked the Fourth of July holiday Saturday by 
calling for ``financial independence'' for America's families. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long, you've been asked to sacrifice so that  
Washington could supposedly do more,'' Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., 
said in the party's weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans say the federal budget surplus is so huge that  
Congress can cut taxes by nearly $1 trillion and still brace Social 
Security and Medicare for baby boomer retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some moderate Republicans, however, say the  
surplus should first be used to increase spending on education and 
other programs once Medicare and Social Security are safeguarded 
and the national debt is erased. 
</P>
<P>
	A tax package to be written in less than two weeks by the House  
Ways and Means Committee will include reduction of the marriage 
penalty, an end to the death tax and safeguards so that Americans 
aren't penalized for investing and seniors don't suffer for working 
past age 65, Hayworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our common-sense majority in Congress wants to declare  
financial independence for America's families,'' said Hayworth. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ways and Means member, Hayworth criticized President Clinton's  
plan to provide a prescription drug benefit to all Medicare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have questioned whether government-subsidized  
prescription drug benefits are truly needed by all 39 million 
Medicare beneficiaries, when two-thirds already have drug coverage 
-- mainly from privately purchased insurance or retirement benefits 
from employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my constituents got it right when she said that under  
the president's plan she'd be subsidizing the likes of Donald Trump 
and Ross Perot,'' Hayworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare can best be strengthened by attacking waste, allowing  
recipients more control over their health care and providing 
prescription drug benefits to low-income seniors, Hayworth said.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA's Future Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The trial of four Columbia/HCA  
Healthcare Corp. executives in Florida is over, but the jury is 
still out on the future of the nation's largest hospital chain and 
the investigation dogging it the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials were convicted Friday of defrauding the government  
through billing practices at one hospital. One was acquitted and 
jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a mixed verdict that there's not a strong signal  
either way,'' Mary Grealy, chief Washington counsel for the 
American Hospital Association, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston/Robertson Stephens  
in New York, said the verdict ``clearly means the government was 
able to convince ... someone that something was rotten'' but added, 
``it's got to be a sigh of relief for Columbia they couldn't trace 
the trail directly up the line (to top executives).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Jarrell, CEO of the company's Southwest Florida division,  
and Robert Whiteside, an official in Columbia's Nashville 
headquarters, were found guilty of conspiring to defraud government 
health programs at Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Neeb, who was the hospital's chief financial officer,  
was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury could not reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick, the chief  
financial officer at Columbia's Central Florida division, who was 
accused of conspiracy. Prosecutors are expected to decide this week 
whether to seek another trial. 
</P>
<P>
	When the initial indictments were unsealed in the summer of  
1997, federal prosecutor Charles Wilson said the charges marked 
``phase one'' of the government's sweeping investigation of 
Medicare and Medicaid overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he said the investigation will continue and that  
additional indictments are possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government expected a clean sweep, but when you take  
everything into account, we're very pleased,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mixed verdict could slow the Justice Department's  
enthusiasm for pursuing the case elsewhere. Department spokeswoman 
Chris Watney declined to speculate on how the verdict could affect 
negotiations with Columbia for a civil settlement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two convictions were small in the scope of an investigation  
that saw FBI raids of Columbia hospitals and related offices in six 
states, sparked at least 11 state probes and led to an unknown 
number of civil lawsuits against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared to be no proof presented that linked what was  
happening at Fawcett to other Columbia hospitals or to the 
company's leadership at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia ousted its top two executives after the investigation  
began. The company also stopped an aggressive acquisition program 
and began a major downsizing, trimming from a high of 345 hospitals 
to 220. 
</P>
<P>
	The company won't decide what to do about its convicted  
executives until after the case is appealed, spokesman Jeff 
Prescott said.

<HEADLINE>  Umpire Suspended for Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in memory, a league president  
suspended an umpire for bumping a player, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion was given three days off without pay Friday by NL  
president Len Coleman for his actions last weekend during an 
argument with Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials couldn't recall another suspension of an  
umpire for an on-field dispute, but they didn't have enough time 
for enough research to rule it out. Umpires union head Richie 
Phillips said it had not happened in his 21 years as general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a player takes a machete out, they get two games and it  
gets cut to one,'' Phillips said. ``And that's with pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, NL president Bill White was prepared to suspend umpire  
Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the 
field, but commissioner Fay Vincent intervened and no discipline 
was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute last Saturday began when Rockies pitcher Mike  
DeJean, while walking to his dugout after an inning, complained to 
third base umpire Terry Tata about a check-swing call. Hallion, 
working at home plate during the game in San Diego, told DeJean to 
get in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean said he told Hallion he was going to the dugout. At that  
point, DeJean and manager Jim Leyland were ejected. During the 
ensuing argument, it appeared Hallion made contact with Reed and 
May, a charge Tata denied after the game on Hallion's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	No Rockies were penalized. Hallion, in his 14th NL season,  
stands to lose about $2,500 of his salary, which is $140,000 
according to the salary scale in the umpires' labor agreement. The 
suspension is scheduled to start July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion, ranked 14th among the 36 NL umpires in a players  
association survey, declined comment Friday as he walked into the 
ballpark at Cincinnati before a game between the Astros and the 
Reds. He had no controversial calls at third base in Houston's 7-5 
win, 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, meanwhile, was released after Colorado lost to San Diego  
15-3 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom did nothing on the field that day which would warrant the  
imposition of a sanction of any kind,'' Phillips said. ``If any 
discipline was warranted, it should have been levied against the 
pitcher, catcher and manager who incited the situation, physically 
and verbally threatened the umpire and flaunted the umpire's 
authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean took a conciliatory approach before Friday night's game  
between Colorado and San Diego at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just Tom Hallion and Terry Tata. We were all to  
blame,'' DeJean said. ``My beef wasn't with Tom Hallion. I don't 
have a problem with him now and I didn't then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he hasn't been penalized, DeJean expected to be  
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure there is going to be a fine,'' he said. ``I would  
hate to see something happen to him, then get off scot-free,. They 
will be saying that players get away with anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires contended the penalty resulted from internal politics in  
baseball. Commissioner Bud Selig wants to switch authority over 
umpires next year from the leagues to Sandy Alderson, an executive 
vice president in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some concern that umpires are out of control,  
which were sentiments by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson, and I think 
Len is falling into that trap,'' umpires president Jerry Crawford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips took a similar view, saying the suspension was  
``nothing more than an act of expediency designed to pander to the 
people in baseball calling for the centralization of control of 
umpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion is appealing the penalty, and Coleman will hold a  
hearing Thursday in Philadelphia, where the umpires union is 
located. When players are suspended for on-field disputes, league 
presidents also hear the appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably will be wasting our time,'' Crawford said.  
</P>
<P>
	Owners and umpires appear headed to another labor confrontation  
after the season. In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the 
first 86 games of the regular season. They also struck and missed 
the first seven weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games 
of the 1985 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also threatened to strike the 1996 postseason, but were  
stopped when owners obtained an injunction in federal court.

<HEADLINE> Execs Guilty of Insurance Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A two-year investigation into the billing  
practices of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. has resulted in the 
conviction of two executives charged with defrauding Medicare and 
other health-insurance programs of nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted a third executive Friday and could not reach  
a verdict on a fourth defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside were found guilty of conspiring  
to defraud and of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid, which serve the 
elderly, poor and disabled, and CHAMPUS, which is medical insurance 
for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Neeb was acquitted.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury could not reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick, who was  
accused of conspiracy. A decision is expected next week on whether 
prosecutors will seek another trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia/HCA, once one of the fastest-growing hospital companies  
in the nation, ousted its top executives after the investigation 
began in 1997. The company also stopped an aggressive acquisition 
program and began a major downsizing, trimming from a high of 345 
hospitals to 220. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of the Nashville-based company involved at  
least six states and relied on multiple agencies, including the 
FBI, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Florida's 
Medicaid fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has operations in 31 states, England and  
Sweden, has been negotiating with federal authorities to settle a 
civil lawsuit filed over its billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell and Whiteside were found guilty of six of seven counts  
by jurors who decided they improperly categorized interest payments 
on reimbursement requests for Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	They each were found innocent on one count of trying to obstruct  
an auditor. Jarrell's attorney, Peter George, said he would seek a 
new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell and his wife, Mijeong, eyes red from crying, encountered  
prosecutors as they left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you happy? Are you happy?'' Mrs. Jarrell asked. ``Are you  
proud of what you've done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell and Whiteside each face maximum sentences of 30 years in  
prison and $1.5 million in fines. They are scheduled to be 
sentenced Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Neeb did not know if he would remain with Columbia/HCA.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been away from my kids for a while,'' Neeb said. ``I  
can't think beyond my family right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants testified that they believed the payment requests  
were accurate, and their attorneys categorized the dispute as a 
difference in opinion about complicated Medicare regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital industry watchers expressed a need for regulation  
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure tax dollars are used efficiently,'' said  
Mary Grealy, chief Washington counsel for the American Hospital 
Association. ``(But) the government has to be just as serious about 
making compliance easier by making these rules much more clear.''

<P>
	In recent years, Iberia has permitted smoking in restricted  
areas on flights of more than 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Iberia said in a statement that it decided on the total ban due

<HEADLINE>  Umpire Suspended for Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in memory, a league president  
suspended an umpire for bumping a player, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion was given three days off without pay Friday by NL  
president Len Coleman for his actions last weekend during an 
argument with Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials couldn't recall another suspension of an  
umpire for an on-field dispute, but they didn't have enough time 
for enough research to rule it out. Umpires union head Richie 
Phillips said it had not happened in his 21 years as general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a player takes a machete out, they get two games and it  
gets cut to one,'' Phillips said. ``And that's with pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, NL president Bill White was prepared to suspend umpire  
Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the 
field, but commissioner Fay Vincent intervened and no discipline 
was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute last Saturday began when Rockies pitcher Mike  
DeJean, while walking to his dugout after an inning, complained to 
third base umpire Terry Tata about a check-swing call. Hallion, 
working at home plate during the game in San Diego, told DeJean to 
get in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean said he told Hallion he was going to the dugout. At that  
point, DeJean and manager Jim Leyland were ejected. During the 
ensuing argument, it appeared Hallion made contact with Reed and 
May, a charge Tata denied after the game on Hallion's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	No Rockies were penalized. Hallion, in his 14th NL season,  
stands to lose about $2,500 of his salary, which is $140,000 
according to the salary scale in the umpires' labor agreement. The 
suspension is scheduled to start July 9.

<HEADLINE> McCray No Longer Works at Louisville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Scooter McCray, a former player and  
longtime assistant to Louisville basketball coach Denny Crum, has 
left his job as special assistant to athletic director Tom Jurich. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who was at the center of an investigation of the  
basketball program, was reassigned to Jurich's office after the 
NCAA blamed him for rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wants to discover some new areas and venture into  
some new opportunities,'' Jurich said Friday. ``I think he's got a 
lot of those in the works. With all he's been through at the 
university, it's a good time to move on and try something new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, 39, whose contract ended Wednesday, could not be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Cardinals' 1980 national championship  
team and was an assistant coach under Crum for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was involved in the NCAA's investigation into improper  
benefits the school provided Fred Johnson, father of forward Nate 
Johnson. McCray arranged for Fred Johnson to reside at a local 
hotel for a discounted rate, then provided his personal credit card 
to ensure Johnson wouldn't be evicted when he was delinquent paying 
his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA originally placed the school on three years' probation,  
stripped the program of two scholarships and banned the Cardinals 
from postseason competition last season. It also imposed a 
``show-cause'' clause on McCray, requiring any school interested in 
hiring him to clear the move through the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	But in February, the NCAA Infranctions Appeals Committee  
repealed the postseason ban and limited McCray's penalty to time 
served. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurich said McCray could have continued working at Louisville.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, he could've come back, but it was time to move on,'' he  
said. ``He wants to get on and move along with his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurich said he would help McCray land another job, even in  
coaching.

<HEADLINE> Blind Unemployment at 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Even as the nation's unemployment rate nears a  
29-year low, the jobless rate of blind Americans has been stagnant 
for about a decade, according to Department of Labor statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates blame discrimination by employers, lower Braille  
literacy rates and new technology for the problem, saying all three 
factors prevent 70 percent of the blind who want to work from 
landing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pity-based discrimination,'' said Barbara Pierce,  
spokeswoman for the National Federation of the Blind, which is 
holding its annual convention in Atlanta through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans with Disabilities Act seems to have had no  
impact on this,'' Ms. Pierce said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA, which was passed in 1990, bans discrimination based on  
disability and orders employers to ``make reasonable 
accommodation'' to qualified disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, technology has made things much easier for blind  
people. Converting text to Braille, once a painstaking process, can 
now be handled by computers, and some office equipment is available 
with Braille-embossed buttons. 
</P>
<P>
	But other technology has hurt the employment chances of the  
750,000 blind Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blind people once worked as traditional receptionists,  
taking dictation and answering the phone for managers and 
executives. But voice mail and e-mail have changed the job 
description of receptionists, requiring more computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Graphic-based software that requires the user to move around the  
screen with a mouse and click on icons is nearly impossible for the 
blind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could work in Powerpoint and things that handle graphics,  
but getting someone to put it in a format that I can understand is 
tough,'' said Peg Halverson, who has been out of a job for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be employed, I want to contribute to society,'' said  
Ms. Halverson, 44. ``I'm thinking, `I have a business degree, I 
have basically 20 years of administrative experience and I can't 
even get a customer service job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the blind people who are working, 30 percent are  
significantly underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems has been a decline in the number of blind  
children learning Braille. During the past 30 years, the percentage 
of blind children learning Braille in the United States has fallen 
from about 50 percent to less than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two decades, there has been a push to get blind  
children out of special schools and mainstream them with the 
regular population. 
</P>
<P>
	``That all too often means they are plunked down in the regular  
classroom and they have very little support services,'' Ms. Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And some teachers pamper blind children, refusing to challenge  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers just kind of let you slip through the cracks. They  
didn't put any expectations on you,'' said Dr. V. Inez Brasher, 42, 
who lost her vision at age 9 but earned a chiropractic degree and 
owns her own practice in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Many school systems saw mainstreaming as a chance to cut costs  
by hiring fewer teachers for disabled students. In some schools, 
students receive Braille instruction only once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the convention, blind people attended workshops helping with  
resumes, interviewing skills and dealing with discrimination 
issues. Blind educators, lawyers, computer scientists, mountain 
climbers and journalists are there to share their experiences and 
give outlines for success. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Mattioli, a hospital dietitian in Baltimore, said she  
doesn't try to talk around her blindness during job interviews. 
Instead, she tells employers how her condition will affect her 
approach to the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a blind person, you kind of have to be that much better,''  
she said.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The search for a new coach for the Cleveland  
Cavaliers has been reduced to Minnesota Timberwolves assistant 
Randy Wittman and former Charlotte coach Dave Cowens, a published

<HEADLINE> Black Couple Can't Find Egg Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Married 14 years and yearning to have their  
own baby, Cathy and David, a young black couple from suburban 
Philadelphia, thought their prayers were answered when a black 
woman agreed in 1996 to donate her eggs so they could conceive. 
</P>
<P>
	But their dream was dashed when the would-be donor backed out of  
her contract. The reason: She was scared of needles. 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-year search for another donor, they again hit pay  
dirt. Or so they thought. This time, the donor got pregnant days 
before she was to begin the donation procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the couple, who asked that their real names not be used  
for this article, still is looking for a black woman willing to 
donate her eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been an emotionally and financially draining three-year  
ordeal. Especially galling for them is knowing that if they were 
white, the search for an egg donation would almost certainly have 
been easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's determination to have a child whose skin color is  
like their own brought them face to face with a racial squeeze in 
the rapidly growing field of assisted fertility -- a severe lack of 
black and other racial minority donors of eggs or sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were white, we would have had a child years ago,'' said  
the father-in-waiting, a 44-year-old clergyman. ``White people have 
so many options. They can pick the height, weight, eye color -- just 
about anything they want for a donor. We have almost no options -- 
none. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't blaming anyone. We aren't crying discrimination or  
anything like that. It's just the way it is. But it's been a very 
sad situation for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively few members of minority groups seek out donors for  
assisted fertility. But those who do find their options on donor 
characteristics extremely limited compared with whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a concern among some in this field, but since the  
number of blacks seeking out donors is small, the issue has been 
hidden,'' said Dr. Abraham Munabi, founder of the Reproductive 
Science Institute near Philadelphia, a leading fertility clinic. 
``Black and other minority infertile couples seeking help are 
suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plight of black couples seeking black egg or sperm donors is  
borne out on Web sites that list potential donors, including their 
race, ethnicity, height, eye color, educational background and 
blood type. 
</P>
<P>
	The sperm donor Web site of OPTIONS National Fertility Registry,  
a Los Angeles-based fertility clinic, lists no blacks, two 
Hispanics and one Asian among the 32 sperm donor profiles. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Northwest Andrology &AMP; Cryobank Web site, there are no  
blacks, Hispanics or Asians among 24 donors. And the Rainbow Flag 
Health Services Web site, which states, ``We are especially 
interested in finding African-American and Jewish donors,'' has one 
Asian and no blacks or Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a black man comes in and says he wants to be a donor, we  
get very excited because they are so few and far between,'' said 
John Olson, president of Cryogenic Laboratories Inc. in Minnesota, 
one of the nation's oldest and largest semen banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of individuals seeking black sperm donations is  
small but those people have virtually nowhere to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson, whose facility had six blacks, 14 Asians and three  
Hispanics on its donor list, said that because of stringent 
screening requirements, the sperm donation shortage cuts across 
racial lines but is most severe among minorities. His facility's 
acceptance rate for sperm donors is about 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could get 50 healthy black donors through my door today,  
I would love it. We might not use it today, but it would be like 
money in the bank because we could save it to build a better 
backlog of black donors,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing costs around $1,500 per donor, said Olson. The sperm of  
Jewish men is the most highly sought after, but all donors -- who 
are asked to give four deposits each month -- receive the same pay: 
$40 per deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says the number  
of children born with assisted techniques has grown nearly 
tenfoldin recent years -- from 250 babies in 1985 to 21,198 in 1996, 
the most recent year for which figures are available. Racial 
breakdowns were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Munabi suggested that several issues may underlie the dearth of  
black donors: a lack of knowledge about the science of assisted 
fertility, religious prohibitions against masturbation, a 
skepticism of medical authorities in general and a fear of being 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in general aren't aware of how they can help another  
couple,'' Munabi said. ``Others are very suspicious of the medical 
establishment and fear the commitment. They don't want to be 
tracked down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing Cathy and David wanted to track down was an egg  
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	They used the OPTIONS facility and, at a cost of $12,000 for  
finding a donor and conducting medical exams, found a young black 
woman who said she was willing to provide her eggs. The couple 
spent another $3,500 for the woman's medications. But she backed 
out when she saw the needle used for the procedure.

	Prospective egg donors take a combination of hormones to  
stimulate egg maturation. A long needle is inserted through the 
vagina to remove a few eggs from the ovaries. Sperm from the father 
are then combined with the egg and implanted into the mother's 
uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	``After waiting so long, I was completely frustrated with the  
process,'' David said. ``You build your hopes and dreams along the 
way. Everything is moving like clockwork right down until it's time 
to take the injection and everything falls apart. It was complete 
heartbreak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Cathy wanted to try again.  
</P>
<P>
	Terry Royal, director of OPTIONS, said she has found prospective  
black egg donors are less likely to go through with the procedure 
than their white counterparts. While 97 percent of white, Asian and 
Hispanic women complete the donation, only about 25 percent of 
black women do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in constant search for (black) women who have empathy for  
the couple and aren't the type who will walk away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal said some agencies she declined to name won't work with  
black women donors because so few complete the process. A firm can 
lose $10,000 to $20,000 in medical screenings and legal fees when a 
donor backs out, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The black donors we talk to tell us they were turned down by X  
company or Y company and they are happy to find we talk to them,'' 
Royal said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, OPTIONS found another would-be black egg donor for  
Cathy and David. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the couple spent $7,500 in fees and medication for the  
woman, the donor began complaining of stomach cramps. In a cruel 
irony, she had just gotten pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	By November, the couple totaled their losses at more than  
$24,000. 
</P>
<P>
	One of their worst moments occurred when Temple University  
students laughed at and taunted them as they handed out homemade 
fliers on campus seeking potential black egg donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Also troubling was the coolness of their own relatives, they  
said. The couple thought they'd find compassion. They got 
indifference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our situation became a kind of conversation piece, but no one  
wanted to help,'' Cathy said. ``Their attitude was, 'I'm not going 
to ruin my body for you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For David, the fight was over. ``I was moving her towards  
adopting. That was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last six months, Munabi located another prospective  
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems to be the kind of person we want. She wasn't overly  
concerned about money,'' David said. ``She has had a baby and said 
she wants to help another family experience the joy of having a 
baby. We want it to work out badly but we've learned to be 
patient.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Shooter Still at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black former college basketball coach was shot  
to death while walking with his children -- apparently by a gunman 
who within an hour also wounded six Orthodox Jews walking home from 
synagogue and shot at an Asian-American couple. 
</P>
<P>
	A white man in his late 20s appeared to have carried out the  
attacks Friday night over a distance of about 10 miles on 
residential streets in Chicago and two suburbs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests had been made by late Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses to each of the shootings told police the shots were  
fired from the same car -- a light blue Ford Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter used a .22-caliber gun and .380-caliber  
semiautomatic weapon as he fired at six different locations in 
Chicago before traveling on to the nearby suburbs of Skokie and 
Northbrook. Tests showed the bullets used in the Chicago shootings 
matched the bullets found in Skokie. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Terry Hillard said the crimes appeared to  
be motivated by racial hatred, although investigators later stopped 
short of labeling the shootings hate crimes because the gunman did 
nothing to indicate his motives. The FBI was assisting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying it's not a hate crime,'' police spokesman Pat  
Camden said. ``What we are saying is at this particular moment in 
the investigation, the elements for a hate crime are not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings began Friday evening in Chicago's Rogers Park  
neighborhood as the Orthodox Jews were returning home from Sabbath 
services. Police said the victims were easily identifiable by their 
traditional dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said a man got out of his car and fired on two people  
from about 15 feet away, wounding one. After that, shots were fired 
from a car, Police Lt. Nick Nickeas said. Of the six people 
wounded, three were in fair condition, a 15-year-old boy was in 
good condition and two were released. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, former Northwestern University coach Ricky  
Byrdsong was shot in the back while walking near his home in the 
suburb of Skokie. Two of his four children were with him. They were 
not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, 43, had been working for an insurance company since he  
was fired by Northwestern in 1997 after four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Then within an hour of the Chicago shootings, shots were fired  
at two Asian-Americans riding in a vehicle in Northbrook. They were 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League said the attacks were ``clear and  
despicable acts of anti-Semitic and racist hate violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Byrdsong's quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood  
said they were shaken by the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a neighborhood throwback to the 50's,'' said Mara  
Roveda, who lives across the street from where Byrdsong was shot. 
``It's full of kids. We all know each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Rogers Park, residents were reluctant to comment because of  
the Sabbath, but those who did said the neighborhood has become 
known for its safety. Police tightened security around the 
neighborhood's synagogues Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Carroll, a former state senator who lives in the  
neighborhood, said many people were convinced that the victims were 
chosen because of their ethnic and religious background and the day 
was chosen because of the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Friday night -- you know Orthodox Jews are going to be  
out walking around the neighborhood or to the synagogue,'' said 
Carroll, who is Jewish but not Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Added another resident, Aaron Grossman: ``This makes no sense,  
but we have to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, the American Jewish Committee offered a  
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shocking,'' said Michael Kotzin, executive vice  
president of the Jewish Federation in Chicago. ``But when you have 
people with hatred in their hearts and weapons in their hands it is 
not aberration.''

<HEADLINE> Krause Crowned King Pit-Spitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAU CLAIRE, Mich. (AP) -- Rick ``Pellet Gun'' Krause took in a  
deep breath, curled his tongue around a cherry pit and let go a 
mighty spit Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pit bounced to a stop 67 feet, 2 inches away, giving Krause,  
45, his 11th International Cherry Pit Spitting Championship title 
and a measure of revenge against his son, Brian, who beat him last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first spit I got off a pretty good one and put pretty good  
pressure on him,'' Krause said. ``Last year, he did that to me when 
he beat my record. That put the pressure on me. This time I spit 
first and put the pressure on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Krause, 20, who broke his father's record last year with a  
spit of 72 feet, 11 inches, finished fifth Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Krause said the keys to pit spitting are lung  
capacity, cleaning the pit off completely before spitting, and the 
ability to curl the tongue around the pit ``to get a good seal.''

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Protest Ends With Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Supporters of death row inmate Mumia  
Abu-Jamal blocked the entrance to the Liberty Bell at the start of 
the busy Fourth of July weekend on Saturday, and 55 people were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark was closed to the public for about three hours.  
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration came on the 17th anniversary of the sentencing  
of Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther and radio journalist convicted 
of killing a Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	He contends he is innocent and blames his conviction on a biased  
judge and an ineffective lawyer. His jail writings about the 
justice system -- and efforts to win a new trial -- have given him 
worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Police carried away demonstrators who sat arm-in-arm in front of  
entrances to the glass-enclosed Liberty Bell Pavilion and others 
who entered the building and kneeled in front of the historic bell. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service rangers used a forklift to remove two  
people from a ledge where they held a banner that read ``Freedom 
for Mumia.'' Rangers also had to break chains that demonstrators 
placed on the doors, trapping a group of about 30 tourists inside 
for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose the Liberty Bell because it symbolizes freedom,''  
said Diane Nicholas, a spokeswoman for the demonstrators. ``Let 
freedom ring for Mumia, because he has been denied a fair trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One tourist, Joe Bass, 59, of Boston, confronted demonstrators  
after he was turned away from the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get out of the way so we can see the Liberty Bell,'' he  
screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't they be civilly disobedient 20 feet away so people  
can see the Liberty Bell?'' asked Bass' wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they planned to return Sunday before a Liberty  
Medal presentation to South Korean President Kim Dae Jung. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters who were arrested were to be charged with failure  
to obey a lawful order, federal prosecutor Richard Goldberg said.

<HEADLINE> Man Sues City Over AIDS Postcard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A man acquitted of an indecent exposure  
charge has filed a $5 million lawsuit against police, claiming they 
slandered him by sending him a postcard recommending he be tested 
for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	In his lawsuit, filed this week, Johnny Lee Bodrick, Jr., 50,  
said the postcard falsely implied that he had committed a felony 
and that he had ``a contagious disease offensive to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The card reached him before he was acquitted in April, when  
computer records showed he had been at work at the time he was 
accused of exposing himself in a city park. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had mailed more than 50 similar postcards to men charged  
with sex-related offenses as part of crime clean-up operation in 
parks.

<HEADLINE> Jacobs Sets 1,000-Meter Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- Regina Jacobs set an American record for  
the 1,000-meter run Saturday night in the Distance Festival meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who set a national record in the 5,000 in last year's  
meet, set the 1,000 record in 2 minutes, 31.80 seconds, 1.13 
seconds faster than Suzy Hamilton's record set four years ago in 
Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Masterkova of Russia set the world record of 2:28.98 in  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're lucky that you got the opportunity to see an American  
record be broken on American soil,'' Jacobs said to a child seeking 
an autograph after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, 35, ran the 5,000 last year in 14:52.49.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those nights that every athlete hopes to have  
and you don't know if you're going to get it or not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs won a Volvo for last year's record and got another one  
Saturday night. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Royals' Leius, Indians' Fryman Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Scott Leius of the Kansas City Royals and  
Travis Fryman of the Cleveland Indians were injured in separate 
plays and removed from the second game of Saturday's day-night 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius dislocated his right shoulder while making a throw from  
first base in the second inning. Fryman sprained his right knee in 
a collision with Leius' replacement, Jeremy Giambi, in the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius fielded David Justice's grounder and was prepared to throw  
home in an attempt on Enrique Wilson, who was running from third. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Don Wengert, who had broken from the mound to try and  
field the grounder, blocked Leius, who double pumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Wengert ducked and Leius did make the throw, then doubled over  
in pain, clutching his right arm. The throw to catcher Tim Spehr 
was too late and Wilson scored the sixth run of Cleveland's 
eight-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, Fryman grounded out to third baseman Joe Randa,  
whose throw caused Giambi to reach to his right. Fryman ran into 
Giambi and straddled the first baseman for an instant before being 
hurt as he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Leius was taken to Lutheran Hospital for treatment. Fryman will  
have an MRI at Lutheran Hospital on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Boy Tests Positive for TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 13-year-old Honduran boy who made up a story  
of traveling to New York in search of his father has been 
hospitalized after testing positive for tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Sabillon was admitted to a Long Island hospital late  
Thursday. The skin test indicates that he may have been exposed to 
the disease, but it does not conclusively show infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The determination of whether this is an infectious, active  
case of tuberculosis or just representation of a prior exposure has 
to be made,'' Dr. Neal Cohen said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin is expected to stay in the hospital another week.  
</P>
<P>
	The boy duped police and city officials with his tale of a  
fantastic journey hitchhiking and riding buses from Central America 
to New York City to meet a father he never met. He had said his 
mother, brother and grandfather were killed in a mudslide last year 
when Hurricane Mitch pummeled Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	But interviews conducted by The Associated Press showed that  
Edwin's mother is alive and living in Honduras, his father died of 
AIDS last year, and that he had been living in Florida with an aunt 
since March.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jim Thome of the Cleveland Indians hit the  
longest home run at Jacobs Field, a drive Saturday night against 
Kansas City that was estimated at 511 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome connected on a 3-1 pitch from Don Wengert in the second
