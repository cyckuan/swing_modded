   BELMONT, Mass. (AP) -- In the Mormon church's new Boston temple,
one room is illuminated by 12 sparkling chandeliers and
three-story-high stained-glass windows. In another, a Jacuzzi-sized
baptismal pool rests on the backs of 12 life-size sculptures of
oxen.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior is Italian marble and granite. The interior is
filled with luxurious sofas and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty and opulence of the $30 million temple, to be
consecrated Sunday, masks an ugly battle between church leaders and
the town's residents regarding the temple's size. The
69,000-square-foot structure stands on a hilltop surrounded by
private homes.
</P>
<P>
   Temples, where Mormons perform sacred ordinances like eternal
marriage and baptism of the dead, differ from the more common
meeting halls where regular services are held. They are typically
soaring, dramatic structures in large cities such as Los Angeles or
Dallas. Belmont has a population of about 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   The temple has particular significance to the Mormons because it
is the 100th built. Mormon church President Gordon B. Hinckley said
in 1997 that his goal was to have 100 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But three residents of the surrounding neighborhood filed a
lawsuit against the Mormons, asking that the church be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like having a Wal-Mart built in your neighborhood,'' said
Charles Counselman, one of the three. ''I wish it had never been
built.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints took advantage of a law that applies lower zoning
restrictions to religious groups. So far the suit has been denied
by two federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors' lawyer, Michael Peirce, asked the U.S. Supreme
Court this month to take up the matter again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The neighborhood I live in is zoned for single-family,
detached residences,'' Counselman said. ''This church is enormous
and out of scale with the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say that while the structure is large, the size
of the crowd attending the temple at any one time isn't.
</P>
<P>
   But Peirce thinks differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't build a 200-car parking lot and a building that
large if you don't expect to get a lot of people there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peirce said he knows of no case in which a fully constructed
religious building was taken down as a result of a lawsuit. But he
hasn't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't presume to know what a court would do in the remedy
phase of a hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church had planned to build a temple 50 percent
larger than the one that now stands in Belmont. It was to have six
enormous spires. But the plans, though approved by the town's
zoning board, caused an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with strong opposition, temple officials scaled down the
design and put much of the structure underground. But after
changing several major details, they had ''run out of
compromises,'' as church member Kent Bowen put it.
</P>
<P>
   The church never considered backing off the Belmont location
entirely, in spite of the lawsuit which was first filed in May
1997, a month before the groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to be as accommodating to the neighbors as we could.
We wanted to do the fair thing,'' said Loren C. Dunn, president of
the Boston temple. ''But once the site was designated, we felt it
was going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate lawsuit prevented construction of the temple's
proposed 13-story steeple, even though it, too, was approved by the
town's zoning board.
</P>
<P>
   Only church members with a temple ''recommend'' -- sort of a
Mormon membership card -- will be allowed inside the temple once it
is consecrated. Recommends can only be obtained by those who follow
church tenets and contribute 10 percent of their income to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Those donations allowed the Boston temple to be completely paid
for in advance. The temple includes four ''sealing rooms,'' where
marriages can take place; four ''endowment rooms,'' in which
Mormons learn to follow the ways of their church; the enormous
''celestial room,'' which, with its white and beige furnishings, is
supposed to represent heaven; a cafeteria; administrative offices;
and changing rooms, where those who enter must change into
all-white dresses or shirts, pants and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Selectman Bill Monahan sought to distinguish between
locals' opposition to the temple and anti-Mormon feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the ugly head of bigotry has shown its face, but I
think that's a small minority of people,'' Monahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the structure was finished, the Mormons invited neighbors
to visit. Though many praised the beauty of the building, others
still weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great deal of frustration on both sides, by those
who didn't want anything built there, and those who didn't want
anything grandiose there, and those who wonder why it has taken so
long to do something so important to them,'' Monahan said.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian President Addresses Nation  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia's president blamed a rash of
violent protests on cocaine traffickers, saying Thursday that
they're trying to destabilize Bolivia in order to protect their
drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Banzer said in an address Thursday evening that
the government will stand firm in its effort to eliminate cocaine
trafficking in the country. But violent protests of the government
effort has left 10 people dead and more than 100 injured in the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to stop the eradication of coca leaves is to turn over
the nation to cocaine traffickers,'' Banzer said. ''We will not
surrender in our fight against cocaine trafficking, and those who
believe we will are wrong. We will not tolerate any more violence
and disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were the first since coca leaf growers and farmers
began setting up roadblocks throughout the country to protest the
eradication effort. On a separate front, public school teachers
went on a general strike this week to protest government layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing acts of sedition that are being led by sectors
backed by cocaine traffickers,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   A clash with soldiers Thursday killed two farmers and a school
teacher in the Lake Titicaca border town of Huarina. Two coca
farmers were killed Wednesday in the Chapare region. Confrontations
between soldiers trying to lift roadblocks and protesting coca
producers, farmers and teachers left five others dead this week.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 acres of coca leaf remain in the Chapare, a lush
tropical region 380 miles east of La Paz. It's about 5 percent of
what existed four years ago. Farmers are feeling the loss their
main cash crop -- the base ingredient used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer has said Bolivia will no longer be producing cocaine by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks went up two weeks ago in the Chapare, after coca
farmers demanded the government stop its eradication of coca plants
and abandon plans to build three military barracks in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks spread to the Bolivian Andean highlands, where
farmers demanded revision of land reform legislation and an end to
coca leaf eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They have interrupted traffic to Argentina, Chile, Peru and
across the country, and left hundreds of trucks and buses stranded.
Thousands of tons of food have been dumped and left rotting because
of the roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables and fruit have nearly disappeared from city markets.
Meat, dairy and other food products have been flown in from
producing areas.
</P>
<P>
   Government estimates of losses due to protests have surpassed
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government mobilized thousands of soldiers and police to end
the blockades, but new roadblocks go up as soon as old ones are
cleared.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore says all those hits he's taking about exaggerating
aspects of his past are, well, exaggerated. ''In a campaign, you know, if you
get a fact wrong, all of a sudden you are accused of committing some horrible
offense,'' he said Thursday on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' a touch defensive
during a mostly smooth hour. The Democratic presidential candidate and his wife
Tipper appeared on King's show two nights after Republican George W. Bush and
his wife Laura came on to answer questions from the talk show host and a few

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Favoring the 125-year old krone, Danish voters on
Thursday rejected the European Union's common currency. The referendum --
closely watched because Britain, Sweden and Greece also plan votes on euro
adoption -- was an embarrassment to the European Union which has pressed for a
monetary union. ''The Commission regrets this decision,'' said Romano Prodi,

FDA OKs Abortion Pill RU-486

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government Thursday approved use of the abortion pill
RU-486, capping a bitter 12-year battle. The pill is a major victory for
abortion-rights advocates that could dramatically alter abortion in this
country. The long-expected decision by the Food and Drug Administration allows
Americans an early-abortion method already used in France, Britain, China and 10
other countries. The action is expected to make abortion in the United States
more accessible and more private.

<HEADLINE> Streisand bids fans adieu, closing live career to standing ovation  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It was a bittersweet farewell Thursday night as
Barbra Streisand performed what she said was her last live
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like time to say goodbye to this part of my life,''
Streisand said during her parting words at a sold-out Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd seemed touched, but as the long standing-ovation might
attest, was reluctant to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a magic about her. Chills just go down through your
spine. It's hard to let her go,'' said Alan Zaslow, who came from
Philadelphia for Streisand's curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   The show, titled ''Timeless,'' was a retrospective of her varied
life and long career. Between songs, Streisand shared memories of
her early days playing small clubs in Greenwich Village, singing
with Benny Goodman's orchestra and doing duets with Judy Garland
and the Bee-Gee's Barry Gibb.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened with a skit of Streisand, portrayed by
15-year-old Lauren Frost, and her mother at the young singer's
first recording session.
</P>
<P>
   As Streisand recalled, the piano player and songwriter told her
she would never make it because she was ''too undisciplined,'' that
she ''could never sing the same way twice.'' Streisand then joined
Frost on the stage for a duet of ''Something's Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't trying to be difficult; it just came naturally,'' she
said of the recording session.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand, whose live performances have been few-and-far
between, also explained to the audience why she couldn't bring
herself to perform live for nearly thirty years.
</P>
<P>
   She described playing in Central Park in the late 1960's where
she was hit by such tremendous stagefright that she wasn't able to
remember the words to three songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so traumatized, I couldn't perform in front of a paying
audience for close to thirty years.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has performed live a handful of times since the early
1990s, and appeared to be over the stagefright Thursday, quickly
warming up and singing in synch with a full orchestra backing her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Streisand at times seemed flat, or her notes clipped,
for the most part she was vintage Barbra, performing with dazzling
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand performed a 28-song set, including many of notable
numbers like ''There's a Place for Us;'' ''Send in the Clowns;''
''As Time Goes By;'' ''Don't Rain on My Parade,'' from the show
''Funny Girl;'' and closing with her signature ''People.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Streisand even performed a duet with herself,
standing in front of a screen playing a scene from the movie
''Yentl.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand closed the show by reminding the crowd that she had no
intention of retiring, but that she wanted ''what everybody else
wants: more time to do things for myself and to live my life. I
have been working since I was 11 years old.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, Yankees 3  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The last-place Tampa Bay Devil Rays
did all they could to prevent the New York Yankees from leaving
town with another AL East title.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Rekar (7-10) pitched seven strong innings and Ozzie
Timmons, Aubrey Huff and Bobby Smith homered off Roger Clemens as
the Devil Rays completed a three-game sweep of the two-time World
Series champions with an 11-3 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the fourth straight and 12th in 15 games for the
reeling Yankees, outscored 24-5 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DiFelice also homered for the Devil Rays, who have won five
straight -- all against playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (13-8) allowed six runs and seven hits in four innings.
Timmons homered for the second straight night in the second, and
Huff and Smith hit back-to-back homers off the Yankees starter for
a 6-1 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   New York, outhomered by the Devil Rays 8-2, was its lead cut to
3&AMP;frac12; games over second-place Boston. The Yankees need just one more
win or a Boston loss to clinch their fourth division title in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay homered three times in an 11-1 victory Wednesday
night, and the first sign it was going to be another long night for
the Yankees was in the second inning, when Jose Canseco walked and
Tino Martinez doubled before both were thrown out at the plate
during a bizarre sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams chased down Martinez's hit off the wall in
center, turned and threw to shortstop Felix Martinez, who relayed
the ball to DiFelice to catch a sliding Canseco trying to score
from first base.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez took off for third on the throw to plate and
headed home when DiFelice's throw skipped past Huff, the Devil
Rays' third baseman, into foul territory. Huff retrieved the ball
and threw to the plate to get Martinez, bailing Rekar out of a
potential jam.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the second didn't go well, either.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff drew a leadoff walk before Timmons lined his fourth
homer into the left-field stands for a 2-0 lead. Randy Winn's RBI
single made it 3-1 in the third and the back-to-back homers by Huff
and Smith added three more runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who until Tuesday had been questionable to make his
scheduled start because of a bruised right hamstring, lost for just
the second time in 11 decisions since coming off the disabled list
against Tampa Bay on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar yielded Derek Jeter's RBI single in the third, but didn't
allow a New York runner past first after that, beating the Yankees
for the first time in five career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams drove in New York's second run with an
eighth-inning double off Doug Creek. Glenallen Hill, added a solo
shot in the ninth off Trevor Enders.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees finished 6-6 against the Devil Rays after going
11-1 and 9-4 against them the previous two seasons. ... Tampa Bay
homered for the 10th straight game, a team record. ... The Devil
Rays are 6-1 in the last seven games after losing 16 of their first
18 games this month. ... The Yankees have lost 17 of their last 18
games when scoring three runs or fewer. ... Clemens (3,504) moved
within four strikeouts of Walter Johnson for seventh on the career
list.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Games Rescheduled  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With American League teams bunched closely and
home-field advantage at stake, the commissioner's office has
rescheduled two rainouts for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins, long eliminated from postseason contention,
must go to New York to play the Yankees at noon EDT, making up a
July 15 washout.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, competing for the AL West and a wild card berth, will
play at Tampa Bay at 6:05 p.m. That makes up for the game missed
Sept. 17 because of Hurricane Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's fine with me,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ''The
only problem is I've got a dentist appointment Monday. But I'm a
firm believer that you play the entire schedule if you can. It
would be nice to go up there and play a meaningful game in front of
a packed house.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Derrek Lee wasn't as eager for the road trip,
which would require the Marlins to charter a flight following
Sunday afternoon's game against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''That wouldn't be any fun unless we had a chance to knock the
Yankees out of the playoffs,'' Lee said. ''Hopefully we won't have
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins can figure on paying between $50,000 and $75,000 to
charter the plane, plus the cost of about 50 hotel rooms on short
notice -- including a few extra ones because of the expanded roster
-- and per diem for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we need are some hotel rooms and an airplane and we'll be
all set,'' said Bill Beck, the Marlins' traveling secretary. ''I
guess I have a few phone calls to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have perhaps the most difficult potential schedule
of all. It's theoretically possible Oakland could finish its series
with Texas on Sunday, play at Tampa Bay on Monday night, return to
Oakland for a tiebreaker game on Tuesday to determine the wild card
team or AL West -- and then open the playoffs on the road Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of things that could happen, but I think if we
just take care of our end, we won't have to worry about any of
that,'' Jason Giambi said. ''We win three games this weekend, and I
think you'll see things working out in our favor. If we've got to
go to Tampa, we'll do it, but we'd probably prefer not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland traveling secretary Mickey Morabito told reporters he
couldn't give them any of his customary help finding hotel rooms on
the Athletics' potential travels. He was too busy planning for
every contingency for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what makes this time of year exciting,'' Oakland
manager Art Howe said. ''You'd rather be wondering where you're
going than knowing you're going home.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chicago has clinched a playoff berth and home field in
both rounds of the AL playoffs, Seattle (89-70), Oakland (88-70)
and the Yankees (87-71) are tightly bunched, with Cleveland (87-72)
still in contention for the wild card and Boston (84-75) still
alive in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess you could look at it as our postseason,'' Devil Rays
manager Larry Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which needs one win or Boston loss to clinch the AL
East, intends to pitch Denny Neagle against the Marlins, while the
Devil Rays plan to start Cory Lidle against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do what we have to do, whatever we're told to do, and go
from there,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ''I don't want to
hear it any more. I've heard too many scenarios, and it's
interfering with what we need to do, win a ballgame. I just shut
myself off. Wherever they tell me to go, I'm going to make sure I'm
at the end of the line getting on whatever plane.''
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out the makeups have no affect on either playoff
teams or home field, baseball probably would decide this weekend to
call them off.
</P>
<P>
   The AL playoffs are scheduled to start Tuesday at Chicago and at
the home park of the division winner with the second-best record.
If a tiebreaker game is needed Tuesday to decide the wild-card
berth, the start of the AL playoffs would be pushed back.

<HEADLINE> China Dominate Again at Diving Pool  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Ho hum, another dominating day at the
Olympic diving pool for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Tian Liang and Hu Jia ranked 1-2 after the preliminaries of
men's 10-meter platform Friday (Thursday night EDT), setting up
China to capture its record fifth diving gold medal of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Americans David Pichler and Mark Ruiz also qualified for the
18-man evening semifinal. The last diving medals of this Olympics
will be determined in the finals on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're good prelim divers. Their mistakes are small,''
Pichler said of the Chinese. ''We'll see what happens. They're not
unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again. The Chinese have won four straight diving golds in
Sydney, taking advantage of an expansion in the program.
</P>
<P>
   From 1928-96, there were four diving events at the Olympics. The
lineup was doubled to eight this year with the addition of
synchronized diving.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only nation to win four diving golds at
a single games, doing it six times -- most recently at Helsinki in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese won three of four events at both Barcelona in 1992
and Atlanta four years ago. In Sydney, they have two individual and
two synchronized golds, taking silver in the other three events.
</P>
<P>
   Tian, fourth on the platform at Atlanta four years ago,
performed a list of dives that was equaled by only one other
competitor in degree of difficulty. He earned perfects 10s on three
of his six attempts to finish with 503.16 points.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate was next at 485.43. Little is known about the
17-year-old Hu, whose official Olympic biography provides only his
age, height and weight.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic and world champion Dmitry Sautin of Russia was
closest to the Chinese with 471.27.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, of Butler, Pa., had a strong first dive and overcame a
poor showing in round four to compile 440.91, good enough for
seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to hit all my dives,'' he said. ''I know I have to do
that to be in the top three. If I do that, I'll end up on the medal
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, of Orlando, Fla., failed to put together a huge-scoring
dive but was consistent enough to get to the semis in 10th with a
total of 432.36.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really tired,'' Ruiz said. ''I slept too much last
night. I like to get myself nervous, and I overslept.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, considered America's most promising diver at age 21, is
trying to bounce back from seventh-place finishes in 3-meter
springboard and synchronized platform, where he teamed with
Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get a medal real bad,'' Ruiz said. ''The pressure is
all on me. All I want is to have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One consolation for the Americans: scores from the prelims don't
carry over to the finals -- if they make it that far.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese can hit all the dives they want right now,'' Ruiz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only diving medal for the Americans at the Sydney
International Aquatic Center was Laura Wilkinson's surprising gold
in the women's platform.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men haven't won an individual platform title since Greg
Louganis in 1988. The last medal was a silver by Scott Donie at
Barcelona eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-man preliminaries lasted nearly four hours, making it
hard for the divers to stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six dives is mentally grueling,'' Pichler said. ''By the time
you're done, you're exhausted.''

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Tigers 5  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jermaine Dye reached base twice in a
seven-run eighth inning as Kansas City rallied against closer Todd
Jones to beat Detroit 8-5 Thursday night in the Royals' final home
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (0-4), who set a Tigers record and is tied with Boston's
Derek Lowe with a league-leading 41 saves, came in with one out and
runners at second and third and the Tigers leading 5-1. He gave up
RBI singles to Mark Quinn and Jorge Fabregas, making it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Zaun's pinch infield single loaded the bases for Johnny
Damon, who hit a high bouncer to Hal Morris at first base. But
Jones was late getting to the bag to take Morris' throw and Damon
was safe, making it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Dee Brown then lined a ball barely fair off third
baseman Dean Palmer's glove, who was charged with an error as two
more runs scored to put the Royals ahead 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has blown four saves in 45 chances as the Tigers lost for
the 16th time in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dye drove in a run with a 6-4 forceout, then Joe Randa's single
off Jones' leg made it 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was Jose Santiago (8-6), who pitched 1 2-3 innings of
one-hit relief. Ricky Bottalico worked the ninth for his 16th save
in 24 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who lost a 5-1 lead against the Royals on Tuesday
night, went ahead 5-0 Thursday on solo home runs by Bobby Higginson
and Rob Fick, two RBI singles by Deivi Cruz, and another
run-scoring single from Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki held Kansas City to six hits and one run through
six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals finished 42-39 at Kauffman Stadium, their first
winning home record since 1994, and swept the Tigers there for the
first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki gave up a run in the sixth on Randa's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals 2B Febles made the defensive play of the game in the
third when Billy McMillon hit a hot shot to his right. Febles did a
bellyflop to knock down the ball, jumped to his feet and made an
off-balance throw to barely nip him. ... Higginson's total of 80
outfield assists in his first six seasons is surpassed by only six
other players in baseball history. ... Palmer atoned for an earlier
throwing error with a fine defensive play in the sixth, running in
for a shoestring pickup of Quinn's infield chopper and throwing him
out by a step to save a run.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 FSU Defeat Maryland 59-7  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- As the game reached a merciful
conclusion, Chris Weinke watched the action in a chair beyond the
end zone, his left foot immobilized and elevated.
</P>
<P>
   The scene put a damper on an otherwise delightful night for No.
2 Florida State and its record-setting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke threw three touchdown passes before leaving early in the
third quarter with an apparent sprained ankle, and the Seminoles
cruised to a 59-7 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   William McCray scored on two short runs and Atrews Bell caught
two TD passes for the Seminoles (5-0, 3-0 ACC), who built a 32-7
halftime lead en route to their 17th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke left after his third touchdown pass made it 38-7. With
rival Miami next on the Seminoles' schedule, coach Bobby Bowden was
probably ready to pull his senior quarterback anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the injury was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ''I inverted my ankle on the second series, then I re-injured it
in the second quarter,'' Weinke said. ''I did not feel comfortable
dropping back and putting pressure on it in the third quarter.
We'll find out tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Seminoles have an extra bit of time for the injury
to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it's a minor thing. Thank goodness it's a Thursday
night game,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke went 11-for-15 for 234 yards. His final TD pass gave him
58 for his career, breaking Danny Kanell's school record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't even know I set the record, to be honest,'' he said.
''It's a honor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 25-0 before Maryland (2-2, 0-1) got its initial first
down, on a 74-yard touchdown run by LaMont Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished with 114 yards rushing, his first 100-yard game
of the season, but Maryland managed only eight first downs, four on
the final drive of the game. Calvin McCall, who was victimized by
several dropped passes, went 10-for-27 for 100 yards and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance to show the country what we are made of, and
instead all those people watching on TV are saying it's the same
old Maryland Terps,'' said linebacker E.J. Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing's changed with Florida State,'' Maryland coach Ron
Vanderlinden said. ''It's the most talented football team in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is 11-0 against Maryland, winning by an average of
34 points. The Seminoles have scored at least 48 points in eight of
the last nine games between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   After the Terrapins took the opening kickoff and gained only 1
yard in three plays, the Seminoles quickly covered 59 yards to go
up 7-0. Weinke went 3-for-3 for 36 yards before McCray ran in from
the 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to set the tempo early tonight. We wanted to score a
touchdown on our first drive, and we did that,'' Weinke said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland again did nothing on offense, and a 28-yard punt return
by Clevan Thomas set up a career-long 44-yard field goal by Matt
Munyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins' next possession featured two dropped passes, and
after the Seminoles' first punt, a botched pitchout by McCall was
recovered by FSU at the Maryland 16. Although the Seminoles
couldn't convert, a coffin-corner punt by Keith Cottrell set up a
safety for a 12-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the free kick, Robert Morgan slipped behind
Curome Cox on the right sideline and hauled in a 58-yard touchdown
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins not only found it impossible to get a first down,
but they couldn't help giving the ball away. An interception by the
Seminoles' Chris Hope led to a 2-yard touchdown run by McCray and a
25-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland ended its first-down drought and snapped the shutout
with one play, Jordan's lengthy touchdown run off a block by tight
end Jeff Dugan.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the Seminoles made it 32-7 on a 2-yard pass from
Weinke to Bell with 14 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a good portion of the 47,044 at Byrd Stadium
headed for the exits. It was the biggest crowd at Maryland since
1995.

<HEADLINE> A Special Silver for Isler, Glaser  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- J.J. Isler's two daughters will be
there for the ceremony and Pease Glaser will get a mate for the
medal she thinks her husband squirreled away in his sock drawer.
</P>
<P>
   All because they guessed right about Sydney Harbor's shifting
winds.
</P>
<P>
   The California sailors won the silver medal in the women's 470
class on Thursday (Wednesday night EDT), taking a flyer on a wind
shift and moving from seemingly no chance to second place overall
on the final leg of the 11th and deciding race.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than an hour later, on the same course, Paul
Foerster of Rockwall, Texas, and crew Bob Merrick of Portsmouth,
R.I., earned the men's 470 silver by winning the final race over
Australia, which nonetheless won the gold. The 470 women's gold
also went to the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   Isler, of San Diego, is now a repeat Olympic medalist, having
taken the 470 bronze in 1992. In the interim, she sailed in an
America's Cup and had two daughters, both of whom are with her in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of Megan, 2, interrupted Isler's Olympic training,
although she and Glaser came back and won the U.S. trails last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 2-year-old isn't going to remember anything, but Marly
will remember it and that she was there at the opening ceremonies
and saw me march in,'' Isler said of her 6-year-old. ''I think I
put a little too much pressure on myself to win a medal because I
really wanted to stand on that podium so she could see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Isler and Glaser were underdogs, having finished no better than
seventh in any previous regatta this year. Plus, they hadn't won a
race until they got to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   When she medaled in Barcelona, Isler was coming off a world
championship and was one of the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really fun to be an underdog,'' Isler said. ''It's
stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Isler and Glaser will receive their medals Saturday on the
forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, as will Foerster and Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   Isler's husband, Peter, had a pretty big sailing accomplishment
in Australia back in 1987, helping Dennis Conner win back the
America's Cup in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, 38, of Long Beach, failed in three previous attempts to
make the Olympic team before hooking up Isler. Her husband, Jay,
won the silver medal in the Tornado class in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there aren't any plans to display the medals together.
</P>
<P>
   ''His is in his sock drawer or something,'' Glaser said. ''I'm
not sure I've ever seen it, to tell you the truth. Your peers know
that you have it. That's more important than actually looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The move that paid off so well involved sailing close to
Bradley's Head on the north side of the harbor to take advantage of
wind puffs, and passing four boats on the spinnaker run to the
finish. Isler and Glaser finished sixth, enough to beat Ukraine by
one point for the silver. Ukraine finished third in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Isler knew to look for the puffs because other boats had passed
her on previous downwind legs by doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were definitely teams out there that were faster than
us, but we were really good at the racing thing,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster won the silver medal in the Flying Dutchman class in
1992, then saw it knocked out of the Olympic lineup. Merrick was in
his first Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were fortunate to sail a really good regatta, and even to
have a chance to win the gold medal on the last day, you can't ask
for anything more than that,'' Foerster said.
</P>
<P>
   After lurking in the middle of the Star fleet much of the week,
four-time Olympian Mark Reynolds of San Diego moved into bronze
medal position with two races to sail. Reynolds finished second and
fourth on Friday (Thursday night EDT), and after nine fleet races
trailed Brazil's Torben Grael by five points and Great Britain's
Ian Walker by nine points. Organizers also hoped to get in the 10th
fleet Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds won the gold medal in 1992 and the silver in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Visits Sparks Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Barely visible behind a wall of riot troops,
the leader of Israel's hard-line opposition toured a Jerusalem holy
site hotly contested in Mideast peace talks and sparked clashes
that left police officers and Palestinian protesters injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the burly leader of the Likud party, said he
successfully demonstrated that Israel is in charge of the walled
compound revered by Muslims and Jews alike. The Palestinians said
the tour backfired because it underscored Israel's lack of control
over what is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as
Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Sharon and six other Likud legislators left the site
-- to shouts of ''Murderer, go home'' -- hundreds of infuriated
Palestinians broke into the compound and hurled rocks, bottles,
chairs and trash cans at helmeted officers who beat back the crowd
with clubs and fired rubber-coated steel pellets.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Israeli officers were injured by stones.
Three Palestinians were struck by rubber bullets, among them a
teen-age boy with his school bag on his back, who slumped to the
ground, pressing his hands to his bloodied mouth. Four protesters
were hit in the head by clubs, including two senior Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes -- and West Bank protests later Thursday -- served as
a bleak reminder of what could be in store if peace talks fail, and
exerted new pressure on the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a message to the Palestinian delegation not to make
concessions on Jerusalem,'' said university student Palestine
Kamel, 23, as she and dozens of fellow protesters hurled stones at
Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Ramallah. Five
Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets fired by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are in Washington this week,
holding separate talks with U.S. mediators who have been trying to
resolve the key sticking point -- rival claims to the Jerusalem
compound, once the site of the biblical Jewish Temple, the holiest
shrine of Judaism, and now home to two major mosques that mark the
spot where tradition says the Prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon denied he tried to provoke the Palestinians with his
visit to the compound -- the site of bloody clashes in 1990 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Temple Mount is in our hands and must stay in our hands as
the holiest place for the Jewish nation,'' the opposition leader
said before donning a skullcap during a visit to the nearby Western
Wall, a remnant of the Jewish Temple.
</P>
<P>
   He was cheered by Jewish worshippers and greeted by the sound of
rams' horns, a part of Jewish ritual. Sharon is not an observant
Jew, though he has forged close ties with ultra-Orthodox religious
parties who back his hawkish agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The former defense minister said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak made a ''major mistake'' when, during peace talks, he offered
to hand parts of Jerusalem to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said Sharon's visit only proved that Israel is
not the real sovereign over the holy site.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Sharon) thought that this place belongs to the Israelis,
but the way he entered, with thousands of police protecting him,
was clear proof to all the world that the Israelis have no
sovereignty here,'' said Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian
official in charge of Jerusalem who was hit in the head during a
scuffle with police.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said that in light of Sharon's
visit, Arab and Islamic nations should mobilize to protect the
shrine. The visit drew condemnation from the Arab world, including
the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, raised for the first time the possibility of
establishing a Palestinian capital, to be called Al Quds, alongside
Jerusalem, according to excerpts of an interview with him published
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Jerusalem Post daily, Barak did not say spell
out what the boundaries of Al Quds, Arabic for ''The Holy,'' would
be.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has said in the past he wanted to redraw Jerusalem's
city limits to include Jewish West Bank settlements and was ready
to transfer control over some of the city's Arab neighborhoods to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a peace treaty, Barak said, ''there will also be
a Palestinian capital that will be called Al Quds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be Jerusalem and Al Quds, one next to the other, as
two capitals,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will also include what we agree upon (in the negotiations),
but the final result will be that Jerusalem will include (the West
Bank settlements of) Givat Zeev, Maale Adumim, Gush Etzion -- big in
territory, including all, of course, the Jewish neighborhoods, and
as a result it will make Israel stronger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The full interview was to be published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's clashes came only hours after assailants believed to
be Islamic militants set off two bombs near an Israeli army convoy
in the Gaza Strip, killing an Israeli soldier and wounding an
officer. No group has claimed responsibility, but Barak demanded
Arafat do more to rein in Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> Residents Adopt Tornado Chickens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTON, Ohio (AP) -- The state's largest egg producer on Thursday
shut down its rescue operation of chickens trapped in barns damaged
by a tornado last week, leaving about 600,000 hens trapped in
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg Farm said a specialist representing the American
Humane Association ''determined that the work being performed to
rescue our hens had become physically and emotionally dangerous to
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The humane association said that Buckeye Egg has
mischaracterized its assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado destroyed 12 barns Sept. 20 at three Buckeye Egg
sites near this community 25 miles northeast of Columbus. About 1
million chickens have been trapped in metal cages without food and
water since then.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has removed 400,000 chickens. Most have been
euthanized while rescue groups had saved about 10,000, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Humane association spokesman Jack Sparks said its recommendation
was to put safety measures in place so that the largest number of
animals could be rescued with as little harm as possible to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said workers did not have the proper safety equipment,
such as hard hats. ''It's unfortunate that our role has been
characterized this way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg said all possibilities for rescuing more birds have
been exhausted. It said it is seeking input from the state on its
next step.

<HEADLINE> Road Bikes, Handlebar Part Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trek Bicycle Corp. is recalling about 13,600
road bikes and about 4,700 handlebar stems that were sold
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday the bolts
on the bicycles' handlebar stems can break, causing the handlebars
to detach and riders to lose control and crash.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission said Trek Bicycle Corp. of Waterloo, Wis.,
has received three reports of handlebar stems breaking. Two riders
suffered injuries, including a concussion and a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   The Icon brand Havana and Bordeaux stems were sold separately
and installed on various 1999 model Trek and Klein road bikes. Only
Icon stems that measure 0.75-inch or 17 mm to 22mm across the front
of the top clamp are part of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   The model year 1999 road bikes included in the recall are 520;
2200; 2200T WSD; 2200T; 2300; 2300T; 2500; 2501; 5000; 5000T; 5200
Pear White; 5200 Blue; 5200T Pear White; 5200T Blue; 5500 Black,
5500 USPS; Y Foil 66; Y Foil 66T; and Y Foil 77.
</P>
<P>
   Trek and Klein dealers nationwide sold these handlebar stems and
the road bikes with these stems from June 1998 through May 1999.
The stems sold separately for about $70 and the road bikes with
these stems sold for between $1,000 and $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advised consumers with bikes that have
these handlebar stems to stop riding them immediately and take them
to a Trek or Klein dealer for a free inspection and replacement
stem if needed. Only road bikes are part of this recall. No Trek or
Klein mountain bikes or Icon mountain bike stems are included.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to find the nearest dealer, call Trek at

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- They may be battling for fourth or fifth
place in the presidential race, but the three candidates who showed
up for the season's first debate focused on winning.
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the Natural Law Party candidate, Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Howard Phillips of the Constitution Party
were the only candidates to participate in Thursday's two-hour
debate. Minnesota's Independence Party Gov. Jesse Ventura played
host.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura told the 150 audience members he would not have been
elected if not for the exposure he gained from debates. host
</P>
<P>
   ''The more parties, the more candidates, the more you have
people involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips opened by blasting the Food and Drug Administration's
approval Thursday of the abortion pill RU-486 and demanded that GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush and other Republicans ''get
to work'' to overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Browne pushed for smaller government. ''I want you to be free to
live your life as you think best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin said his top priority is to remove the influence of
special interests from government. ''Our democracy is under
siege,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates gave their most passionate answers in response to
a question from a student in the audience who asked why they were
running. All three said no vote is a wasted vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two ways of winning,'' Hagelin answered. ''One is in
the marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the first thing they would do if elected, Hagelin said he
would ban unlimited campaign contributions. Browne said he would
issue unconditional pardons for all federal prisoners serving time
for nonviolent drug offenses. Phillips said he would strip members
of Congress of their ability to set their own pay.
</P>
<P>
   The three men ran for president in 1996 and debated each other
several times then. None received more than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out a message -- Browne's is based on shrinking
government -- is the reason they gave for showing up when bigger
names, such as Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Pat Buchanan of
the Reform Party, declined. Bush and Democrat Al Gore also declined
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Television coverage was limited to C-SPAN, but the candidates
were excited nonetheless. ''Not only are C-SPAN viewers likely
voters, they're likely Hagelin voters,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The television time is very, very valuable,'' Browne agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of network coverage wasn't the only humbling feature.
Instead of a high-profile broadcaster, the moderator was a
little-known editor of a local Internet site. Even Ventura would
not commit to staying for the whole two hours; he left after the
first hour.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, Hagelin, Browne and Phillips share a sense that the
system is skewed against third-party candidates, and all oppose
trade deals such as NAFTA to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   Browne would eliminate the income tax -- he says tariffs and
excise taxes would provide plenty of money to pay for a small list
of essential government services.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin wants to decrease defense spending, but increase funding
for environmental programs and health care. He would legalize
marijuana for medical use and put a national moratorium on
genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips says America has forgotten the laws of God. He calls
for ending AIDS prevention education and says he would close
agencies such as the Department of Education and cut government
spending sharply.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Teachers Authorize Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 43,000 teachers, librarians, counselors
and nurses in the nation's second-largest school district have
authorized a walkout if contract talks fail to progress, the union
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Members overwhelmingly favored a strike in voting that began
Monday, union officials said Thursday. With nearly 70 percent of
members casting ballots, 95 percent authorized a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are giving the least amount of money to the people that
do the most work,'' said John Perez, vice president of United
Teachers Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Genethia Hayes said, ''We believe that
both sides are bargaining in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers want a 15 percent one-year pay raise and a ''classroom
bill of rights'' to ensure clean classrooms and adequate supplies
and textbooks. The district has offered an increase of 16.8 percent
to 21.8 percent in pay and benefits over three years.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been troubled by labor discord lately. Bus drivers
and rail operators walked off the job Sept. 16, and janitors and
commercial actors walked off the job earlier this year. While
janitors eventually settled, the actors remain on the picket lines.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Injured on Cruise Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A huge wave shattered windows on a cruise liner in
the Atlantic, flooding cabins and injuring several passengers, the
shipping company said.
</P>
<P>
   The 76,000 ton liner Oriana was undergoing repairs in mid-ocean
after the accident on Thursday, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, carrying 1,525 passengers and 800 crew from New York
to the English port of Southampton, ran into gale-force winds about
600 mileswest of Ireland, said the company, P&AMP;O.
</P>
<P>
   A wave about 40 feet high smashed through toughened glass in six
cabins, causing flooding inside. Three passengers suffered minor
injuries from broken glass and four people had to be treated for
shock, P&AMP;O said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Schoolbooks Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Ask Karam Jamil about Jerusalem,
just a few miles away from his school, and the first-grader's hand
flies up: ''It's the capital of Palestine, and it's where we
pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about Israel and Karam -- indeed, the whole first grade --
stares blankly.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising -- their brand new civics textbook does not
mention Israel at all, and the Jewish state is notably absent from
the map on the classroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the ''education for peace'' outlined in peace
agreements, say Israeli critics who have demanded sanctions against
the Palestinians -- and who have now been joined by first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, fighting a close Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Jewish groups on Tuesday, Clinton called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is also the education
minister, to remove what are alleged to be anti-Semitic passages in
Palestinian textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All future (U.S.) aid to the Palestinian Authority must be
contingent on a strict compliance and an immediate good-faith
effort to change textbooks in all grades,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The textbooks have also become an issue for Prime Minister Ehud
Barak as he seeks to complete a permanent peace agreement with the
Palestinians. The leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, whose
backing for a deal could be crucial, says the textbooks must first
change.
</P>
<P>
   ''The textbooks of the Palestinian Authority tell how to kill
and destroy the Jewish people,'' Shas leader Eli Yishai told
reporters Wednesday. ''I don't see how we can support an agreement
if this continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials deny that their textbooks contain
anti-Jewish references, and believe that Clinton -- otherwise
considered a friend of the Palestinians -- has been co-opted by
hard-line Israelis to win New York Jewish votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ''has to be very careful about where she gets her
reports from,'' Deputy Education Minister Nabil Abu Hommos told The
Associated Press. ''If she wants more information about the
curriculum we can get it for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may have been referring to ''Our Country, Palestine,''
by Arab historian Mustapha Mghad al-Dbaa, which advocates Israel's
destruction and denies any Jewish connection to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Material distributed here and in the United States recently by
hard-line Israeli groups charges that the book is used as a
standard text. In fact, although widely read among Palestinians, it
is not part of curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new Palestinian textbooks -- colorful, glossy
notebooks used for the first time this year-- stirred much
controversy when Israelis discovered their country was not
mentioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Palestinian schools have relied on old Egyptian and
Jordanian texts, which include anti-Semitic stereotypes -- although
the Palestinians insist that teachers did not refer to the
stereotypes in class.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, who have appreciably altered their textbooks to
include sympathetic portrayals of Palestinians, had hoped that the
new textbooks would adhere to the commitment to ''educate for
peace'' outlined in the breakthrough Oslo accords of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In its chapter on tolerance, the civics textbook used in Jamal
Husam's sixth grade civics class in Beituniya shows a Muslim imam
and a Catholic priest shaking hands, and includes passages from the
New Testament and the Quran. Jews aren't mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   When references to Israel arise during classroom discussion,
they are oblique and ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Husam tells his pupils that ''other religions'' besides Islam
and Christianity merit tolerance. Eleven-year-old Mohammed Jamil,
reviewing last week's lesson for the class, says the Arab nations
would come together to defend Palestine and its borders -- but he
does not say against whom.
</P>
<P>
   Husam denies that the text or his lessons are anti-Semitic,
saying: ''The Jews aren't even mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the attitude that infuriates even moderate
Israelis. In a statement, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin -- an
architect of the Oslo accords -- described the omissions as
''inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say it's natural for their first self-published
textbooks to focus on instilling a sense of nationhood in a people
long dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hommos defended the emphasis on Muslim-Christian relations,
saying those were the two religions of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each curriculum in every country talks about its own people,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Abortion Pill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion foes bitterly denounced government
approval of the abortion pill RU-486 and vowed to continue to fight
a drug they called ''baby poison'' and a threat to women's health.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug
Administration, ending a battle that has involved two presidents,
several countries and heated debate for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the drug gives American women a pharmaceutical
abortion method already in wide use in France, Britain, China and
10 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But since the FDA action took place in the closing weeks of a
national political campaign, it drew quick and heated comments from
both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
called the FDA decision ''wrong'' and said he feared that the
availability of RU-486 ''will make abortions more and more
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts, however, said abortions did not increase after
the drug was introduced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman said a president cannot order drugs
off the market, but, if elected, Bush would appoint an FDA
commissioner ''to make sure the FDA considered the risk and did not
take this action as a result of political pressure from the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, supported
approval of the abortion pill, saying the decision was ''not about
politics, but the health and safety of American women and a woman's
fundamental right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was developed in France and became available there in
1988. In 1989, Bush's father, President George Bush, ordered the
FDA to ban importation of the drug for personal use. In 1993,
President Clinton ordered a re-evaluation of the ban and sought
ways to provide RU-486 for U.S. researchers after its French
manufacturer refused to supply it.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponent Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., called the abortion
pill ''baby poison,'' adding that ''RU-486 is not just poison for
babies, it is potential poison for the mothers who take it.'' He
said it can cause prolonged bleeding and severe cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., promised legislation calling for
severe limits on which doctors could administer the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the drug
provides an abortion method ''that avoids invasive surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a day that women should remember because their health
and their choices are finally being respected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, known chemically as mifepristone and by the brand name
Mifeprex, will be available to doctors within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone blocks a hormone vital to sustaining pregnancy and
works only during the first seven weeks of pregnancy, when an
embryo is about one-fifth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after taking mifepristone, women take a second drug
that causes cramping and bleeding as the embryo is expelled, much
like a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who choose to have an early termination of their
pregnancy, this is a reasonable medical alternative,'' said FDA
Commissioner Jane Henney. She approved mifepristone based on
studies that found it 92 percent to 95 percent effective in causing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say complications are rare, with serious bleeding in
1 percent of women. The pharmaceutical abortion does require three
doctor visits and the FDA restricted prescribing RU-486 to doctors
with certain training. The agency required that detailed
patient-information brochures be given to every woman.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith claimed in a statement that a French study showed that
out of 950 women who used the drug, 270 required narcotics to
control intense pain and seven required blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hausknecht, medical director of Danco Laboratories,
marketer of mifepristone, called it ''a very, very safe drug.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At long last, science trumps anti-abortion politics and
medical McCarthyism,'' said Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist Majority
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone may ''turn the tide against anti-choice
intimidation,'' because doctors not offering surgical abortion can
use the pill in private offices instead of protester-targeted
clinics, added Planned Parenthood president Gloria Feldt.
</P>
<P>
   A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 767 physicians found that a
third of doctors who don't now provide surgical abortions would
consider prescribing RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-abortion groups pledged to continue their opposition,
with Judie Brown of the American Life League saying: ''We will not
tolerate the FDA's decision to approve the destruction of innocent
human persons through chemical abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill's journey to the United States began in 1995, when
French manufacturer Roussel-Uclaf turned over U.S. rights to the
drug to the nonprofit Population Council of New York. The council
began clinical trials needed for FDA approval and created Danco
Laboratories to market mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in 1996 declared mifepristone a safe and effective early
abortion method, but delayed full approval because Danco had
problems satisfying manufacturing and other final requirements.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the FDA's four-year investigation shows
the decision was ''purely one of science and medicine.'' He said
the FDA ''bent over backward to do a lot of serious inquiries.''

<HEADLINE> Streisand Bids Fans Adieu  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a bittersweet farewell Thursday night as
Barbra Streisand performed what she said was her last live
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like time to say goodbye to this part of my life,''
Streisand said during her parting words at a sold-out Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd seemed touched, but as the long standing ovation might
attest, was reluctant to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a magic about her. Chills just go down through your
spine. It's hard to let her go,'' said Alan Zaslow, who came from
Philadelphia for Streisand's curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   The show, titled ''Timeless,'' was a retrospective of her life
and career. Between songs, Streisand shared memories of her early
days playing small clubs in Greenwich Village, singing with Benny
Goodman's orchestra and doing duets with Judy Garland and the
Bee-Gee's Barry Gibb.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened with a skit of Streisand, portrayed by
15-year-old Lauren Frost, and her mother at the young singer's
first recording session.
</P>
<P>
   As Streisand recalled, the piano player told her she would never
make it because she was ''too undisciplined,'' that she ''could
never sing the same way twice.'' Streisand then joined Frost for a
duet of ''Something's Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand, whose live performances have been few and far
between, also explained to the audience why she couldn't bring
herself to perform live for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   She described playing in Central Park in the late 1960's where
she was struck by such tremendous stage fright that she couldn't
remember the words to three songs. ''I was so traumatized,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand appeared to be over her stage fright Thursday, quickly
warming up and singing with a full orchestra backing her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Streisand at times seemed flat, or her notes clipped,
for the most part she was vintage Barbra.
</P>
<P>
   She performed a 28-song set, including many notable numbers like
''There's a Place for Us,'' ''Send in the Clowns,'' ''Don't Rain on
My Parade'' from the show ''Funny Girl,'' and closing with her
signature ''People.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Streisand performed a duet with herself, standing
in front of a screen playing a scene from the movie ''Yentl.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand reminded the crowd that she had no intention of
retiring, but that she wanted ''what everybody else wants: more
time to do things for myself and to live my life. I have been
working since I was 11.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves Energy-Water Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has agreed on a major conservation
bill that could double federal land acquisition and preservation
spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, while significant, still left Congress entering
the new fiscal year with 11 of 13 spending bills unfinished,
disputes with the White House on issues ranging from Cuba sanctions
to Missouri River water levels and increasing pressure to end the
session as the election nears.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations interior panel, said the land deal he helped
engineer is ''the greatest increase in resources for conservation
in the history of the country.'' While less costly than a $3
billion-a-year plan championed by President Clinton, it would
budget $1.6 billion next year for land acquisition and
conservation, with that figure rising to $2.4 billion a year by
2006.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on the land issue opened the way for passage next week
of a $19 billion bill to fund the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some progress was also made Thursday when the House, by 301-118,
approved a $23.6 billion measure for water and energy programs. But
that vote was clouded by a threat from Clinton to veto the bill
because it would block administration plans to allow a springtime
rise in the Missouri River to protect endangered fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is only a small part of a bill that allots $13.5
billion to atomic energy defense activities and $3.2 billion to
Energy Department science programs. But a veto could have
election-year repercussions in the swing state of Missouri, where
farmers and the barge industry worry about floods and other
problems if the river ebbs and flows more naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make our day,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said
when asked about Clinton's veto threat. ''He loses Missouri to
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   With no votes scheduled for Friday, the start of the Jewish New
Year, Congress will enter the new fiscal year on Sunday with only
two spending bills, both defense-related, signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of the government shutdown of 1995, the Senate
on Thursday, following House action, voted 96-0 to keep government
programs running through Friday, Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would sign the temporary extension, but prodded
Republicans: ''I ask Congress to finish the work they were sent
here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With House Republicans in particular in danger of losing the
majority they won six years ago, the GOP leadership was eager to
wrap up for the year so lawmakers could hit the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that good will in the Senate now is needed to finish
our job. The American people want us to do our job,'' said Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, Senate Appropriations Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, ranking Democrat on the
committee, took his colleagues to task for the recent trend of
leaving spending bills for end-of-the-year, marathon bargaining
sessions that exclude most members. ''We are not performing that
watchdog function when we invite the White House behind closed
doors and play five-card draw with the people's tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Interior Department bill, negotiators were
close on two other major spending bills to fund transportation and
agriculture programs.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up the agriculture bill were final negotiations on two
controversial issues -- easing sanctions on sales of food and
medicine to Cuba and allowing pharmacists and drug wholesalers to
reimport U.S.-made prescription drugs that are sold cheaper in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation bill is to include language setting a
national standard of 0.08 percent blood alcohol content for drunken
driving. It would withhold some federal highway money from states
that don't impose the tougher standard. The bill would also
postpone, for at least a year, new federal rules on trucker
operating hours aimed at reducing accident-causing trucker fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The energy-water measure was just one example of how the
late-session rush to complete budget bills was resulting in a
bipartisan spending bazaar. The measure was $2.4 billion higher
than last year's bill and $890 million larger than Clinton had
requested.
</P>
<P>
   It included dozens of projects that were neither requested by
Clinton or approved by the House and Senate in earlier versions of
the bill. These included $25 million to clean groundwater in the
San Gabriel basin near Los Angeles, inserted by Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif.; $4.5 million to deepen the Columbia River channel between
Oregon and Washington state; and nearly $2 million for the Fox
Point hurricane barrier in Rhode Island.

   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia's president blamed a rash of violent protests
on cocaine traffickers, saying Thursday that they're trying to destabilize
Bolivia in order to protect their drug crops. President Hugo Banzer said in an
address Thursday evening that the government will stand firm in its effort to
eliminate cocaine trafficking in the country. But violent protests of the
government effort has left 10 people dead and more than 100 injured in the last
week. His remarks were the first since coca leaf growers and farmers began
setting up roadblocks throughout the country to protest the eradication effort.

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Favoring the 125-year old krone, Danish voters on
Thursday rejected the European Union's common currency. The referendum --
closely watched because Britain, Sweden and Greece also plan votes on euro
adoption -- was an embarrassment to the European Union which has pressed for a
monetary union. ''The Commission regrets this decision,'' said Romano Prodi,

Abortion Foes Denounce Government Approval of RU-486
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion foes bitterly denounced government approval of
the abortion pill RU-486 and vowed to continue to fight a drug they called
''baby poison'' and a threat to women's health. RU-486 was approved Thursday by
the Food and Drug Administration, ending a battle that has involved two
presidents, several countries and heated debate for 12 years. Approval of the
drug gives American women a pharmaceutical abortion method already in wide use
in France, Britain, China and 10 other countries.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MP3.com Inc. is launching a political campaign to support
a bill that would make it legal to store music digitally and listen to songs

charges of copyright infringement. Dubbed the ''Million E-mail March,'' the
campaign supports a bill introduced this week by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., and
three Republican co-sponsors. The bill would amend federal copyright laws to

<HEADLINE> Sydney Police To Advise Athens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The police force responsible for the
largely crime-free environment at the Sydney Olympics is going to
share the secrets of its success with Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have asked for assistance, in the general area of
security,'' New South Wales Police commissioner Peter Ryan told
reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said New South Wales police would likely provide the
''know-how, the technology, the planning (and) the logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   But first the police have to try to make sure the Sydney Games
finish without a major security incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 13 days of the games, street crime in downtown
Sydney has actually dropped -- a surprise to law enforcement
officials who set up two courts to run 12 hours a day throughout
the games dealing only with Olympics-related crime. Both the courts
have been almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   The last major headache for police is Sunday's closing ceremony,
which will feature a spectacular fireworks show running the length
of Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line the harbor
to watch the event.

<HEADLINE> Water Polo: Russia 11, U.S. 10  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The United States won't get to play in
the big pool.
</P>
<P>
   A game after its strongest Olympic performance, the American
men's water polo team showed both its brilliance and boneheadedness
in losing 11-10 to Russia in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had a two-on-one break in the final minute,
but Tony Azevedo could not hold on to the ball as Russian goalie
Nikolai Maximov swam to cover up.
</P>
<P>
   Russia ran out the clock for the victory and spot in the medal
round.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which finished seventh in Atlanta, falls to
the second group of four to compete for fifth through eighth spots
at the Sydney Games held at the Ryde .
</P>
<P>
   Russia, undefeated at 5-0-1, moves to the Sydney International
Aquatic Center at Olympic Park, four times the size of 4,000-seat
Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seemed to have their confidence back after blowing
out Greece 9-3 on Wednesday. But they carried none of it into their
opening quarter against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They dumped balls to scorer Chris Humbert that were easily
collected by Russian defenders. They left Alexander Erychov open
twice for simple goals. And goalie Dan Hackett let in a shot from
three-quarters of the pool away -- a typical last-chance try that
almost never works -- as time ran out for Russia's 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But as quickly as the United States gave away goals, it got them
back over the next two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Tony Azevdo put in a short shot from the left side, it was
3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The United States led 7-6, it's only lead of the game, on
Humbert's assist to Wolf Wigo.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't last, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Garbouzov scored two of his three goals in a second-half
stretch as Russia went ahead 9-7. The Americans tried to play catch
up the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo's goal from the left side cut the lead to 9-8 with six
minutes to go, but Erychov, who scored four goals, restored the
two-goal lead a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo brought the United States again within a goal, 11-10,
with 1:26 to go. The U.S. team's youngest-ever player at 18 looked
like he would be its biggest hero of the Sydney Games when he and
Chris Oeding swam in on a tying break.
</P>
<P>
   But Azevedo, who finished with three goals, could not grip the
ball and never got the chance to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will play the loser of the Spain-Croatia
match. Russia will meet the winner as it tries for its first water
polo medal as a federation. The Soviet Union won the 1988 bronze.
The Unified Team did the same four years later.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Subtracting two teammates could add up
to disappointment Down Under for U.S. gold medalist Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, winner of the 100 and 200-meter sprints, had her eye on
five gold medals in Sydney. But word came down Friday (Thursday
night EDT) that half of the U.S. 400-meter relay team -- Inger
Miller and Gail Devers -- would miss the race with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has already flown home from Sydney, while Devers leaves
this weekend. Both suffered hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the pair leaves the U.S. team vulnerable, and puts Jones'
hopes for an unprecedented Sydney sweep in danger. She hopes to win
the long jump, the 400-meter relay and the 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Jones rested for the long jump while her healthy
teammates won their 400 relay heat. Also advancing were top rivals
Jamaica and the Bahamas; Australia was ousted by a dropped baton.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 50-kilometer walk, Robert Korzeniowski of Poland
completed a sweep of the men's walking medals. Korzeniowski, who
received gold in the 20-kilometer walk last week when Bernardo
Segura of Mexico was disqualified, finished in 3 hours, 42 minutes,
22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   American Maurice Greene and his teammates on the 400-meter relay
squad sped to a time of 38.15 seconds -- fastest in the first round
Friday. The semifinals were set for later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jones remained unflappable and unbeaten in Australia, breezing
to her second gold medal in the 200 Thursday. Unfazed by the
firestorm created by her husband's alleged steroid use, she flashed
a wide smile after an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   With husband C.J. Hunter watching from the stands, Jones took an
early lead before blowing the field away in 21.84 seconds. After
winning by the biggest margin in 40 years, Jones interrupted her
victory lap to plant two kisses and a hug on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the world shot put champion, has denied knowingly taking
anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 200 was a washout for the Americans. When Coby Miller
and John Capel finished seventh and eighth, it marked the first
time since 1928 that the U.S. team was shut out in the event during
a boycott-free games.
</P>
<P>
   American Chris Huffins, after leading for much of the two-day
decathlon, wound up with a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans remained atop the medal chart with 76 (32 gold, 18
silver, 26 bronze). Russia followed with 58 (19-18-21), while China
had 56 (26-15-15).

   -- SOCCER: The American women, defending gold medalists and World
Cup champions, lost a 3-2 overtime nail-biter Thursday to nemesis
Norway. The stunning defeat came just 12 minutes after the United
States, with barely seconds left in injury time, tied the game at
the end of regulation on a header by Tiffeny Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   But momentum and luck were not with the U.S. women. A
twice-deflected ball landed at the feet of Norway's Dagny Mellgren,
who slid the ball off the left hand of outstretched goalie Siri
Mullinix for the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett, who tied the game off a pass from Mia Hamm, also
scored the first U.S. goal.
</P>
<P>
   The victory leaves Norway as the only nation with an all-time
winning record (15-13-2) against the United States. The Norwegians
are also the only team to beat the Americans in a World Cup or
Olympic tournament, the other victory coming in the 1995 World Cup
semifinals.

   -- GYMNASTICS: Romanian Olympic Committee president Ion Tiriac is
quitting after watching gymnast Andreea Raducan stripped of her
gold in the all-around gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Tiriac, who said his decision would become official in the next
three weeks, had introduced a harsh life-ban policy for any
Romanian athlete found guilty of doping. In the Raducan case, where
the teen lost her medal over a cold remedy provided by a team
doctor, Tiriac vociferously argued against penalizing Raducan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the person who replaces me will be smarter than me and
include some clause (in the doping suspension rules) so we don't
have ridiculous situations like this,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   -- WATER POLO: A last-ditch bid came up short as the U.S. men
lost 11-10 to Russia in the Olympic quarterfinals, eliminating them
from Sydney medal competition. A two-on-one break with under a
minute left collapsed when Tony Azevedo couldn't hold on to the
ball, and the undefeated Russians claimed victory.

   -- TENNIS: It was all in the family for Venus and Serena
Williams. The sisters teamed up to take the Olympic gold in
doubles, easily dispatching Dutch players Miriam Oremans and
Kristie Boogert 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier, in her first Olympic trip, Venus had captured
the gold in singles. The straight-set victory made them the first
sisters to capture a gold in Olympic doubles.
</P>
<P>
   And Venus became just the second woman to win a gold in singles
and doubles, joining 1924 Olympian Helen Wills of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BASKETBALL: In another surprisingly tough game, the NBA
all-star U.S. team beat Russia 85-70 to advance into the Olympic
semifinals. Though the Americans cruised in the second half, they
led by just five at the half -- their smallest lead ever after 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett led the Americans with 16.
</P>
<P>
   They will next play the Lithuanian team that threw a major scare
into the Americans, losing by the closest margin ever to a ''Dream
Team'' -- nine points in a preliminary round game.
</P>
<P>
   Host Australia, led by Andrew Gaze's 27 points, advanced to the
semifinals with a 65-62 victory over Italy. Gaze, a starter on the
1989 Seton Hall NCCA Final Four team, scored 13 of the last 15
Australian points to become the second-leading scorer in Olympic
history.

<P>
   -- TAEKWONDO: In a come-from-behind victory, American Steven
Lopez captured the first U.S. gold medal in taekwondo.
</P>
<P>
   A Lopez kick in the final period tied his bout 1-1. When that
wound up as the final score, the Sugarland, Texas, resident
received the win because South Korean Sin Jun-sik had penalties
during the fight.

<P>
   -- WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: They were good, but not good enough for
gold. The U.S. women, a surprising semifinalist, lost a five-setter
to the favored Russians 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-28, 15-8. The
Americans, longshots for a medal coming in, face Brazil for the

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in
the seventh inning and San Francisco beat the Los Angeles Dodgers
5-3 Thursday night, giving the Giants the best record in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for home-field advantage in the playoffs, the Giants
improved to 95-64, a game ahead of Atlanta and St. Louis (each
94-65).
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Crespo homered in the eighth inning, the Giants'
franchise record 222nd, one more than the New York Giants hit in
1947, when Johnny Mize led the team with 51.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Fultz (5-2) pitched 1 2-3 innings of one-hit relief, and
Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 40th save, his 27th in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-2, the Giants regained the lead in the seventh when
Bill Mueller, who went 3-for-5, singled off Terry Adams (6-9) and
Bonds followed with his 49th homer of the season. It was the 494th
of his career, moving him ahead of Lou Gehrig into 17th place.
</P>
<P>
   Crespo pinch hit in the eighth and connected off Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Kevin Brown allowed two runs and six hits in
five innings, striking out eight in his final start of the season.
He finished 13-6 with a 2.58 ERA, third-best in the majors behind
Boston's Pedro Martinez (1.74) and Arizona's Randy Johnson (2.38).
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 216 strikeouts were third behind Johnson (342) and
Martinez (284). Brown received three runs of support or fewer in 11
of 33 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Shawn Estes gave up three runs -- two earned -- and
four hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield was ejected in the eighth by umpire
Chris Guccione for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco took a 2-0 lead in the fourth on J.T. Snow's RBI
single and a run-scoring wild pitch by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley hit an RBI grounder in the bottom half and Los
Angeles, held to one hit in the first five innings, tied it in the
sixth on Hundley's RBI single. Paul Loduca followed with a
sacrifice fly off Fultz for a 3-2 lead.
Notes: Dodgers executive Tommy Lasorda, making a triumphant return
to Dodger Stadium after managing the U.S. Olympic baseball team to
the gold medal, received a standing ovation from the crowd of
44,513 when he was introduced on the field during the third inning.
Organist Nancy Bea Hefley serenaded Frank Sinatra's old pal with a
few choruses of ''My Way.'' ... For the second time in Brown's two
seasons as a Dodger, the team reached the 3 million mark in home
attendance on the night he made his final start. They've reached
that figure in each of the last five years and 15 times overall.
... Estes induced his major league-leading 40th ground-ball double
play. ... Green is homerless in 22 consecutive games through

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Praises Sydney Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- What he avoided saying in Atlanta, Juan
Antonio Samaranch is ready to proclaim in Sydney four years later.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the International Olympic Committee told a German
newspaper that the 2000 Olympics get his stamp as ''the best games
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Something could still happen before Sunday. But if I had to
close the games today, I would say: 'Best games ever,''' Samaranch
told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted Thursday in Sydney and published in
the newspaper's Friday edition in Germany. The Sydney Games end
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, IOC vice president Dick Pound gave the Sydney
Games a rating of ''10 out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These games are well on their way to being games straight from
central casting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch gave the distinction of ''best ever'' to the Olympics
in his native Barcelona in 1992. The Atlanta Games four year later,
marred by a bombing and other problems, only received the ''most
exceptional'' description in Samaranch's closing ceremony speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is that the athletes were very satisfied in
Barcelona, but here they are even more satisfied with the
organization, and so are the international sports federations,''
Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many doping cases, Samaranch said, the Sydney
Olympics have been ''cleaner than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that you should congratulate us every time a doping
athlete is discovered,'' Samaranch told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed suggestions that weightlifting, hit by many drug
cases, should be thrown out of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This federation, like the athletics (track) federation, fights
very hard against doping,'' Samaranch was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> USATF Would Hand Over Drug Program  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Under fire for allegedly suppressing
positive drug tests, USA Track &AMP; Field proposed that its entire
doping control program be handed over to an independent world body.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, executive director of USATF, suggested Friday
that the World Anti-Doping Agency handle all in-competition and
out-of-competition tests for American athletes and investigate any
positive cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who heads the world agency,
endorsed the idea and said it should be extended to all countries
and all sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, that's probably the best way for all this to be
played out -- that all testing, for all national and international
federations and national Olympic committees, be handled by an
independent third party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said WADA's executive board would meet sometime after the
Sydney Games to decide on its formal response, but made clear he
had no objection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my view this is where we should end up,'' he said. ''I
think it's a big step forward, especially for an American
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   USATF also announced it was forming a special commission to
review its drug-testing procedures and address allegations that a
number of positive cases have been covered up.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, the anti-doping chief of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, said last week that USATF had withheld
information on 12 to 15 positive tests in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Masback denied any cover-ups, insisting that USATF was bound by
American confidentiality laws and rules preventing the disclosure
of names of athletes who test positive until due process has run
its course.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said no U.S. athletes competing in the Sydney Games had
failed drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   He said the majority of cases still under wraps involved
substances for which athletes had medical waivers, others involved
cold-medicine products, and the rest were still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   USATF's policies came under intense scrutiny following
disclosures this week that shot put world champion C.J. Hunter,
husband of sprint star Marion Jones, had failed four drug tests in
Europe this summer. The news was confirmed only after leaks in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee officials criticized the U.S.
policy and urged USATF to come clean on all test results. White
House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey also called for a full,
public accounting of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Masback met this week with Pound, chairman of the World
Anti-Doping Agency. The body was set up last year to coordinate a
global program of out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''After my meeting with Dick Pound, it was apparent to me that
in spite of our best efforts in the doping control area, Mr. Pound
and others do not have total confidence in how we have handled
doping matters,'' Masback said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''USATF has been a pioneer in drug testing and has never covered
up a positive test. Our Olympic team is the most-tested group of
athletes in history. We believe that WADA control of our
anti-doping program will ensure international confidence in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate letter to Pound, Masback said he was unable to
find a way to run a drug control program subject to the competing
jurisdictions of the IAAF and the U.S. Olympic Committee. He also
cited ''shortcomings'' of certain IOC-accredited testing labs and
the challenge of working within the confines of U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I propose that WADA take over USA Track &AMP; Field's entire
doping control program,'' Masback wrote. ''WADA would administer
and conduct our in-competition and out-of-competition drug testing
programs and adjudicate all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Masback's proposal, WADA would render a final decision to
USATF, whose only role would be to take any disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, WADA's role has been limited to funding and
controlling out-of-competition testing. It has not conducted
in-competition testing and has had no role in prosecuting positive
cases, leaving that up to the international sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   But Pound said he envisioned no problems in expanding WADA's
role, and predicted that WADA could control all testing at the next
Summer Games in Athens in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai also backed the USATF
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good idea,'' he said. ''This would make things
more transparent and help get rid of all the accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, USATF announced the formation of a panel to assess
the federation's compliance with anti-doping rules.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will be comprised of Micki King, U.S. diving gold
medalist at the 1972 Olympics and current Assistant Athletic
Director at the University of Kentucky; Curtis H. Barnette,
Chairman Emeritus of Bethlehem Steel Corp. and a lawyer in
Washington D.C.; and Richard H. McLaren, a law school professor at
the University of Western Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren, who has been a long-standing member of the Court of
Arbitration for Sport, will chair the panel. Masback also invited
Pound to appoint a WADA delegate to sit on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The review will be completed in 90 days and its findings made
public, Masback said.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Driver Returns Missing Medal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Rachael Taylor went out on
the town to celebrate winning an Olympic rowing silver medal
without one important item -- the medal itself.
</P>
<P>
   After getting out of a taxi on Oxford Street, Sydney's busiest
nightclub strip, Taylor realized she left the medal inside and only
could watch in horror as the vehicle pulled away Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It all ended well, with the taxi driver known only as Raj
returning the medal to her on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said she never really worried about losing the medal, and
continued to party with her teammates into the wee hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was confident (of getting it back) because I think most
people know the significance of one of these medals,'' Taylor said.
''It's not like losing a mobile phone and I'm sure that whoever
would have found it would understand what it means to me. To anyone
else it's worth nothing. To me, it's priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The taxi driver could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor won the medal with teammate Kate Slatter in the women's
coxless pairs last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just absolutely flabbergasted at my own stupidity,''
Taylor said. ''I just don't understand how you could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen again, she promised, because the medal was ''not
going anywhere'' from now on.

<HEADLINE> Bidding County Stadium Adieu  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Warren Spahn and Del Crandall came full circle
Thursday, helping close down Milwaukee County Stadium, the timeworn
ballpark they helped open in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   And Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker delivered a moving eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was here that boys became men,'' Uecker said. ''And men
became champions, and champions became legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Spahn, the winningest left-hander in baseball history with 363
victories, threw the ceremonial first pitch to Crandall, his
batterymate on opening day with the Milwaukee Braves 48 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the curtain's falling,'' said Spahn, 79, who tossed
a two-bouncer from about 30 feet away Thursday. ''The party's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Spahn and Crandall, who managed the Brewers from 1972-75 after
his playing days were done, were among more than 40 former Brewers,
Braves and Green Bay Packers taking part in the festivities. The
Brewers move next year to Miller Park, under construction beyond
County Stadium's outfield fence.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron, decked out in his old Milwaukee Braves uniform, was
the first one introduced in a postgame celebration following
Cincinnati's 8-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davis, a defensive end with the great Green Bay teams of
the 1960s, was next and rumbled around with a football tucked under
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Robin Yount rode in on his Harley-Davidson
motorcycle and circled the field just like he did after the 1982
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When all were introduced, they formed a human chain from second
base to center field and a flag with the County Stadium logo was
passed down from Bernie Brewer's chalet, through the stands and all
the way to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Yount handed the flag to Brewers shortstop Mark Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of us has touched this flag, symbolic of how County
Stadium has touched us,'' Yount said. ''Don't ever forget where it
all started.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta said nobody would.
</P>
<P>
   ''County Stadium has served us well and we will never forget
her,'' he said. ''But, oh, will it be sweet across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   After the great ballplayers of past and present threw
autographed baseballs into the crowd, Uecker gave a moving speech
as the lights went out one standard at a time, leaving him alone in
the dark near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long, old friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The record regular-season crowd of 56,354 toted cameras and
camcorders, shared memories, shed tears and downed bratwursts and
brews on a cloudless day that only grew cold in the ninth, when
they stood and shouted and snapped photos as if it were Game 7 of
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   They had little to cheer about before that, save for Olympic
hero Ben Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, the Brewers' top minor league pitching prospect, shut
out Cuba in the gold medal game at Sydney, Australia. He emerged
from the dugout with his medal dangling from his neck and waved to
the crowd as it chanted, ''U-S-A! U-S-A!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also went crazy over the final sausage race, which the
bratwurst won, incidentally, by a casing over the Italian sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Some came to say good-bye to the old place; others to say good
riddance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I speak for all the guys who played here in the last
five years when I say I'm glad to see it go,'' outfielder Jeromy
Burnitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, the nation's first publicly financed ballpark, was
built in the early 1950s for $4.8 million -- about what Burnitz made
this season alone. And it was constructed at a time when no major
league team had moved since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the place lured the Braves from Boston and sparked
pro sports' great westward migration.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who won the '57 World Series, were the first NL team
to draw 2 million fans and never had a losing season in Milwaukee.
But they bolted for the Deep South after the 1965 season.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bud Selig led a group that bought the Seattle
Pilots out of bankruptcy court and returned America's pastime to
Brew City.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers won the '82 AL pennant but lost the World Series to
the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3. In 1998, they became the first team to
switch leagues since 1892, returning Milwaukee to its NL roots.
</P>
<P>
   But hard times befell them. Eight straight losing seasons and
the 1994 players' strike thinned the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers pulled up stakes in 1994 after playing a portion of
their home schedule at County Stadium for 41 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition begins next week at the old ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The new $394 million stadium, with its retractable roof, was to
open this year, but the project was delayed after a crane collapse
killed three ironworkers on July 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Along a chain link fence between the old ballpark and the new
one, somebody placed three bouquets of flowers Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Women Hoops: Aussies 64, Brazil 52  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia's first chance at a gold
medal in women's Olympic basketball came from the old guard and the
new center.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the home-continent advantage beat Brazil 64-52
Friday to advance to the gold medal game for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The best Australia had ever managed before was a bronze in 1996.
Now, the worst it can get is a silver when it plays the winner of
the United States-South Korea semifinal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that could beat this is to go that one step
further,'' four-time Olympian Michelle Timms said. ''I'm very proud
to be the captain of this Australian basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The game with Brazil couldn't have gotten off to a better start
as Australia (7-0) hit its first four shots and went on to an 11-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 14,698 at the SuperDome was ready for an
afternoon blowout, only Brazil hung around and hung around and was
within 44-40 with 10:02 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then a jumper by Trish Fallon started an 8-0 run that finished
with 3-pointers by Timms, the 35-year-old veteran, and Lauren
Jackson, the 19-year-old considered the future of Australian
women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Timms always receives the loudest ovation when the team is
introduced, with Jackson not far behind. They were right together
when Australia needed it and Jackson's 3 made it 52-40 with 7:53
left.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 was the only basket for Timms, who has been limited to
about six minutes a game as she recovers from arthroscopic knee
surgery after playing for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice to be in the mix this time,'' Timms said. ''I told
myself before the game to be ready to give what a veteran can give.
I had only one 3-pointer and one from 2-range the entire
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel a thing,'' she said about her knee. ''I know it's
got one more game in it. I wanted a chance and I'm really
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia's biggest lead was 56-42 with 6:15 to play on a layup
by Michelle Griffiths. Brazil (3-4) never got closer than eight
points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Sandy Brondello each had 16 points for Australia.
Brondello scored the first six points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sandy set the tone for us and got us off to a great start,''
Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the only Australian player who wouldn't hedge on a
gold medal opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is obviously a great team but we're playing
outstanding and have improved 100 percent since we lost to them,''
Jackson said, referring to an 83-62 exhibition loss on Sept. 9.
''We know we can beat the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Janeth Arcain, who plays for the WNBA's Houston Comets, had 21
points for Brazil, two points above her average for the tournament.
Alessandra Oliveira had 16 points and 14 rebounds in playing the
entire 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Australia beat Brazil in the tournament.
It won 81-70 in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Australian team is an excellent team and is on the path to
a gold medal,'' Brazil coach Antonio Carlos Barbosa said. ''They
are also a team that has the full support of the audience and that
is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia advanced to the semifinals with a 76-48 victory over
Poland, while Brazil got there with a 68-67 victory over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was trying to get to the gold medal game for the second
straight Olympics. It lost to the United States in the 1996 final.

<HEADLINE> Hammer Thrower's Appeal Rejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mihaela Melinte, the women's hammer
throw world champion and world record-holder, lost a last-ditch
appeal Friday to be reinstated for the Olympic final after being
removed for a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Melinte, the gold medal favorite, was escorted off the field
Wednesday before the start of qualifying. The move was ordered by
the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which said Melinte
tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in Milan,
Italy, on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian national Olympic committee filed an appeal with the
Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeking a chance for Melinte to
qualify for Friday night's final or to have her directly inserted
into the final.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could any court interfere with the decision of the IAAF in
doping matters?'' IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai said. ''The
Olympic Charter says eligibility is up to the international sports
federations. It would have been an unbelievable precedent if the
ruling had been overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gyulai said the Mexican Olympic Committee has filed
an appeal with CAS on behalf of Bernardo Segura, who was
disqualified moments after crossing the finish line first in the
20-kilometer walk on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Segura was accused of improperly breaking contact with the
ground three times during the race, all in the final 20 minutes.
His disqualification sent the gold medal to Robert Korzeniowski of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain when the CAS would issue its verdict.

<HEADLINE> Men Reconsider Marathon Prospects  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Runners in the men's marathon examined
the ups and downs of the Olympic course and decided there was no
way that the times would be all that great.
</P>
<P>
   Then the women shattered the Olympic record last week. That gave
the men a tough act to follow on Sunday, when the 26.2-mile race is
run from North Sydney to Olympic Stadium. It ends just before the
start of the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we saw the greatest female marathon, not just in the
Olympics, but ever,'' Australian Steve Monghetti said. ''I think
the men's race has the potential to be that good, but we'll wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Monghetti, who turned 38 on Tuesday, will be running his 22nd
and final marathon, but his first in his native Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to be an also-ran against an all-star field that
includes world leader Antonio Pinto of Portugal, defending gold
medalist Josia Thugwane of South Africa, two-time defending world
champion Abel Anton of Spain, 1996 silver medalist Lee Bong-ju of
South Korea and 1995 world champion Martin Fiz of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could come from a group of lesser-known runners who
are better in the hilly terrain that the runners will cross on
their way from Sydney's central city to Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty unusual for a marathon course,'' said Jon Brown of
Britain, who has a strong background in cross-country races. ''It's
very unlike the city races, which are all about times and running
against the clock. Even though the women's race was surprisingly
fast, I think all the guys here would say as a marathon course,
it's not what we usually come across.''
</P>
<P>
   The race will provide some of the most beautiful backdrops of
any marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The runners cross Sydney Harbor Bridge, then run past the Sydney
Opera House and into the central city. From there, it's out to the
suburbs, where the course gets increasingly tough, with the
downhill portions even harder than the uphill parts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Troop of Australia ran the course in a test marathon earlier
this year, but was not in top shape and can hardly remember running
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I passed out and had to go to the medical tent,'' he said. ''I
didn't even know I'd finished the race until somebody told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Naoko Takahashi of Japan won the women's marathon last Sunday in
an Olympic best 2 hours, 23 minutes and 14 seconds. She did it by
starting faster than expected, then keeping up the pace when the
terrain got difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance caused many of the men to alter the predicted
winning time for their race from 2 hours, 12 minutes to about 2
hours, 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others who could contend are Stafano Baldini of Italy,
Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco and Kenneth Cheruiyot and Japhet
Kosgei, both of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, 34, was fifth in last year's world championships and won
the London Marathon on April 16 in 2:06.36, the fastest time this
year. But it came on a flat course far different than the one he
will face on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Anton, 38, won the 1997 and 1999 world championships in hot
weather. He is only the third runner to win two world titles in the
marathon, and he is a latecomer to the event. He switched from the
5,000 and 10,000 meters in the mid 1990s and won four of the first
five marathons he entered.
</P>
<P>
   Kosgei and Lee ran the second- and third-fastest marathons this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was second to Thugwane in 1996 in the closest men's marathon
in Olympic history. It was the most dramatic in other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane, who was ranked 41st in the marathon going into the
Atlanta Games, became the first black South African to win an
Olympic gold medal. Five months before his Olympic run, he was shot
in the chin during a carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet, 2 inches and 99 pounds, he was the smallest man ever
to win an Olympic marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Since Atlanta, Thugwane has from a kitchen worker for a coal
mine to a national celebrity. But he has not completed any
international marathons lately. He won the Fukuoka marathon and was
eighth in London in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Walker Clinches Olympic Double  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- If he needed any inspiration over 50
grueling kilometers of Olympic race walking, Robert Korzeniowski
needed only nod his head and look at his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Competition number 2711 proved a lucky omen for the Pole, the
first person to win the Olympic race-walking double. Friday's
victory in the 50K walk followed his gold medal in the 20K last
week; he won the longer race in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''My number was very special to me because it was the 27th
Olympiad'' and the one-one represents two gold medals, Korzeniowski
said after winning the 50K in 3 hours, 42 minutes, 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Aigars Fadejevs of Latvia took the silver medal and Joel Sanchez
of Mexico got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski overcame 90 percent humidity to break away from the
field about 8 kilometers from the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very hot, but all my 50-kilometer races have been warm
-- so only the best can win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 50K walk has been contested at the Olympics since 1932. The
20K race was added to the Olympic program at Melbourne in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski said his focus going into the games was the longer
race, but he decided to add the 20K after improving his speed
consistently throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I beat my 10K best four or five times, so I decided to go 100
percent for both races,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski's gold in the 20K came when Mexican Bernardo Segura
was disqualified after crossing the finish line first. Segura,
world record holder in the event, was caught losing contact with
the ground three times in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski said the only disappointment surrounding his double
gold was not crossing the finish line first in the 20K. He kissed
the track in the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium after taking line
honors in the 50K.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the only regret is that they didn't take away Segura
before he crossed the finish line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski flirted with disqualification himself, earning a
white card for a caution in the early stages of the race. He said
the Bulgarian judge who showed him the card had consistently
targeted him in previous championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''After my card, I was very, very angry to go faster and
faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction of winning outweighed any judge's decision, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm at the top of my career,'' he said. ''I was very confident
after winning the 20K. I have trained well and I was very believing
in my preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges disqualified eight of the 56 starters for failing to keep
contact between the shoe and ground or illegally bending the knees
in the highly technical discipline.

<HEADLINE> China Dominant Again at Diving Pool  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Ho hum, another dominating day at the
Olympic diving pool for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Tian Liang and Hu Jia ranked 1-2 after the preliminaries of
men's 10-meter platform Friday (Thursday night EDT), setting up
China to capture its record fifth diving gold medal of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Americans David Pichler and Mark Ruiz also qualified for the
18-man evening semifinal. The last diving medals of this Olympics
will be determined in the finals on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're good prelim divers. Their mistakes are small,''
Pichler said of the Chinese. ''We'll see what happens. They're not
unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again. The Chinese have won four straight diving golds in
Sydney, taking advantage of an expansion in the program.
</P>
<P>
   From 1928-96, there were four diving events at the Olympics. The
lineup was doubled to eight this year with the addition of
synchronized diving.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only nation to win four diving golds at
a single games, doing it six times -- most recently at Helsinki in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese won three of four events at both Barcelona in 1992
and Atlanta four years ago. In Sydney, they have two individual and
two synchronized golds, taking silver in the other three events.
</P>
<P>
   Tian, fourth on the platform at Atlanta four years ago,
performed a list of dives that was equaled by only one other
competitor in degree of difficulty. He earned perfects 10s on three
of his six attempts to finish with 503.16 points.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate was next at 485.43. Little is known about the
17-year-old Hu, whose official Olympic biography provides only his
age, height and weight.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic and world champion Dmitry Sautin of Russia was
closest to the Chinese with 471.27.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, of Butler, Pa., had a strong first dive and overcame a
poor showing in round four to compile 440.91, good enough for
seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to hit all my dives,'' he said. ''I know I have to do
that to be in the top three. If I do that, I'll end up on the medal
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, of Orlando, Fla., failed to put together a huge-scoring
dive but was consistent enough to get to the semis in 10th with a
total of 432.36.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really tired,'' Ruiz said. ''I slept too much last
night. I like to get myself nervous, and I overslept.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, considered America's most promising diver at age 21, is
trying to bounce back from seventh-place finishes in 3-meter
springboard and synchronized platform, where he teamed with
Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get a medal real bad,'' Ruiz said. ''The pressure is
all on me. All I want is to have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One consolation for the Americans: scores from the prelims don't
carry over to the finals -- if they make it that far.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese can hit all the dives they want right now,'' Ruiz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only diving medal for the Americans at the Sydney
International Aquatic Center was Laura Wilkinson's surprising gold
in the women's platform.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men haven't won an individual platform title since Greg
Louganis in 1988. The last medal was a silver by Scott Donie at
Barcelona eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-man preliminaries lasted nearly four hours, making it
hard for the divers to stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six dives is mentally grueling,'' Pichler said. ''By the time
you're done, you're exhausted.''

<HEADLINE> Fu Mingxia Accomplished a Miracle  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When Fu Mingxia -- rusty and a little
chubby -- slipped back into her diving suit for the first time in
two years, the Olympics and making history were far from her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Friends had piqued her curiosity: Could the great Fu, the waif
who won three Olympic golds, still dive?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as she proved Thursday in winning a historic fifth
Olympic medal, was yes. That she climbed back to the top after two
years without a single dive only added to the magic of her feat.
</P>
<P>
   Burned out after the rigors of training for the Atlanta Olympics
four years ago, where she swept the platform and springboard
titles, Fu said goodbye to diving. She took up economics management
at college, made new friends and put on pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But time refreshed her and brought a change of mind. Her college
set up a diving club and ''friends asked me: ''Do you think you can
still dive?'' she said. Fu decided to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Although she says her first platform dive was scary, the rust
came off quicker than expected. Within months, she was
somersaulting and twisting once again. She likened it to learning
how to bicycle: ''The more you ride, the smoother you become.
That's the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, I still really liked diving, I fought for about half
a year and then decided to come back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fu who won the springboard gold Thursday, adding to her
silver a few days ago in syncronized diving, is not the same Fu who
first wowed the world at age 13 in winning her first Olympic gold
at Barcelona in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eight years is a long time. I was a child back then,'' Fu
said. ''I feel I've grown up. I've attended two more Olympics. But
in diving, your competitive streak never changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 22, she's got a boyfriend -- a soccer player for a Beijing
club. She's developed a taste for Starbucks' iced coffee, grown her
hair and appears to be enjoying diving more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Before Atlanta, the rigors of training for the national team
sometimes reduced Fu to tears.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere of her college club is far more relaxed. Many
of those she dives with are children -- as Fu was when she was
spotted by a diving coach at age 10 and brought to Beijing for
training from her home in central China.
</P>
<P>
   The kids treat Fu as a big sister -- admiration that helped build
her confidence as she fought to recapture her form, a friend of
Fu's said. The friend recalled seeing Fu line her young teammates
up once after practice and clean their ears with cotton buds to
prevent infections.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the eight or more hours of daily training Fu endured in
the past, she cut back practice to four or five hours in the
afternoon -- sometimes to the beat of techno music pumping from a
boom box by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her fame, Fu had to make her way through qualifying
contests, national championships and pre-Olympic trials to overtake
the army of other high-caliber divers in China and win a place on
the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But far from describing this low-road back as demeaning for a
star like herself, she said it ''allowed me to shed the mantle of
champion and be a normal diver.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, ''standing on the medal podium, I felt that all the
roads I've walked since I returned to diving until now were just a
small part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fu joined two Americans, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick, as the
only divers to win four gold medals. With her silver, she's also
the first woman to win five diving medals. Louganis, Italy's Klaus
Dibiasi and China's Xiong Ni are the only men to accomplish that
feat.
</P>
<P>
   But for Fu, joining that pantheon was not the goal. After
Sydney, she said she's back off to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never thought of comparing myself to any of those
athletes because it wouldn't be too meaningful to me,'' Fu said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just an ordinary person who accomplished a miracle.''

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: US Women Go for Bronze  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Perhaps no other Americans are so
thrilled about the prospect of a bronze medal as the U.S. women's
volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the look on Maurice Greene's or Michael
Johnson's faces if they won the bronze in their relays?
</P>
<P>
   Then think about how happy the volleyball players will be if
they won it. Imagine Tara Cross-Battle admiring it with her
husband, and Logan Tom showing it off to her friends at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though nobody else thought we could get this far and we
were ranked only 10th, we thought we could win a medal,''
Cross-Battle said. ''That's what we came here for, and that's what
we'll try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest consolation prize at the Olympics won't be easy to
win, however. The United States will play Brazil on Saturday
(Friday night EDT) knowing that it has only beaten the South
Americans once in six matches this year. Brazil won in four games
when the teams met in group play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, Brazil is a top team,'' U.S. coach Mick Haley said.
''We know it is a going to be a tough match, and we are going to
have to play without a lot of heart. I think we have to play at a
consistently high level to beat the Brazilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart and pride are something Brazil has in abundance. Leila
Barros almost willed her team to a comeback victory over bitter
rival Cuba in the semifinals Thursday, but the Cubans were too
strong and won in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also will have trouble with Barros' style of play.
At 5-foot-10, she doesn't get that high, but her speed and ferocity
at the net make her left-handed shots very difficult to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Erika Coimbra is even more talented. The 20-year-old is
the youngest player on her team, just as the 19-year-old Tom is on
hers. Coimbra was the top scorer at the 1999 Junior World
Championships, while Tom was second. They could be the stars on
their teams in the next two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and former Stanford teammate Kerri Walsh played well for the
second straight match against Russia, but the Americans couldn't
come back to win the semifinal after forcing the taller Russians to
a fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought like dogs,'' Tom said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has beaten the Brazilians only once,
in an exhibition in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in June, it can compete with
them if it cuts down on unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the things that's so good about these kids. As
long as this group is together, they'll fight,'' Haley said.
''Personally, I feel there's a big difference between a bronze
medal and fourth place. I really think they'll do well in this next
match, and then they can look back and say, 'Wow, this was really
special.'''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Village Runs Smoothly  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Bulgarians have to make their own
beds. A few athletes have been sent home for stealing.
</P>
<P>
   But other than that, the man in charge of the Olympic athletes
village is happy with the way his temporary town of nearly 17,000
is running.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no scandals,'' village mayor Graham Richardson said
Friday (Thursday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Housekeepers have not serviced the Bulgarian team's living
quarters since finding an abundance of loose needles littered
around the rooms. About 20 other nations also were negligent in
safely disposing of the needles, ''but have not been up in the
Bulgarian class,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Towels and sheets are still available, but the Bulgarians are
responsible for their own housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it appeared most needles had been used for
vitamin injections, and there was no evidence of prohibited
substances. Village personnel is not charged with looking for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern solely has been for the health of the staff,''
Richardson said, noting that a few workers had been accidentally
poked with used needles.
</P>
<P>
   In other quarters, five burglaries have been reported. One man
was caught in the act, trying to burglarize his own delegation. He
was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the richer countries don't lock their doors that
often,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The village is housing about 1,000 people more than it
originally expected. Transportation problems existed early on, but
the International Olympic Committee seems to have ironed them out,
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because of the extra people, organizers have shipped an
extra 20,000 condoms into the village, although Richardson said
athletes are probably hoarding them, rather than using them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a lot of evidence'' of condom use, he said. ''I
suspect there has been some stockpiling rather than abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Mississippi St. Look To Beat Gators  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH D. RUSSO
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Fred Smoot wants to take the gag off the
Florida Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State's trash-talking cornerback watched with envy
as Florida and Tennessee waged a war of words two weeks ago before
meeting on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved it,'' Smoot said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier didn't and slapped a gag order on
some of the Gators, not allowing certain players to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   That's just no fun for Smoot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to start it. I'll get the coach so mad he'll tell
them to talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot and the Bulldogs (2-1) get their shot at No. 3 Florida on
Saturday when the Gators (4-0) make their first trip to Starkville,
Miss., in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot is the Bulldogs' answer to Deion Sanders. He is one of the
top corners in the Southeastern Conference and not shy about saying
so.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can't nobody outtalk me in pregame,'' he said. ''They don't
want to let me in their head because you let me in, I will keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoot's rants even inspired one Mississippi State fan to set up
a Web site featuring some his greatest hits -- Smootsmack.com.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot said he has been looking forward to playing Florida since
1997. That's when he watched on television as his cousin, former
LSU cornerback Cedric Donaldson, return two interceptions for
touchdowns in the Tigers' upset of the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   And if his cousin had two TDs, ''I got to come back for at least
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some suggest the current Florida offense isn't the same
scoring machine it was in the mid 1990s, Smoot thinks the Gators
haven't lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got the same coaches and the same offense,'' he said.
''They're still putting up 500 yards and 60 points. Ain't nothing
changed but the names.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case last week as the Gators found their offensive
stride in a 59-31 victory over Kentucky. Florida had 452 yards
against the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   The new pass catchers that have caught Smoot's attention are
wide receivers Jabar Gaffney and Reche Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the best talent,'' Smoot said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, for one, does not want to get into a war of words with
Smoot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's an All-American, but I don't look at him like
that. I look at him just like any other cornerback,'' Caldwell
said. ''I'm just going to go out there and do my job. If they throw
me the ball, try to make the play ... not get caught up in all of
the hype and what he says and how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoot and the Bulldogs' defense, one that ranked No. 1 in the
country last season, was humbled last week by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks threw for 330 yards -- burning Smoot a few times --
and scored 13 fourth-quarter points in a 23-19 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The game did nothing to take the swagger out of Smoot's step,
something that his coach won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had one like Fred,'' Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill
said. ''He is very funny. He's very witty. He can come back and say
things that other people, it would take them hours to come up with
that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs and Gators have not played since 1993 -- a 38-24
Florida victory on Gainesville. The year before that, though,
Mississippi State routed the Gators 30-6 in Starkville.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of line will Smoot use to greet the first Florida
receiver to line up against him Saturday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only 2:30, but it's going to be a long day. A long day,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Davison Ready for Missouri  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Missouri coach Larry Smith doesn't worry
about Matt Davison quite as much as he does the guy who throws the
ball to the Nebraska receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's miracle end zone catch three years ago kept Missouri
from upsetting the No. 1 team in the country. Smith, however, has
been spending the last two weeks studying Eric Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will get to see Nebraska's junior quarterback up close
Saturday when the Tigers visit the No. 1 Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in their Big 12 game, Crouch rushed for 92 yards and a
score and was 10-of-17 for a then-career high 143 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch already has scored six rushing touchdowns and thrown for
six more this season. His five passing touchdowns last week against
Iowa was not what Smith wanted to see, even with an extra week to
prepare for the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a guy throws five touchdown passes, you can't look away
from that,'' Smith said. ''Still, first I think you've got to stop
him from running the football.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not the big power guy, but Crouch has great speed. He
gets the corner on the options, they use him on quarterback draws,
they use him on counters. They've got about every play in the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has lost 21 straight to Nebraska, but none was more
painful than 1997. The Tigers led 38-31 with seven seconds left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play of regulation, Davison made a diving grab of a
ball kicked by teammate Shevin Wiggins that forced overtime.
Nebraska won it in the OT, stayed undefeated and took a share of
the national title.
</P>
<P>
   All because Wiggins got his foot on a low pass and Davison was
in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to have to make a play like that again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now a senior, Davison will get his final shot against the Tigers
(1-2) on Saturday. And while Davison will miss Missouri (1-2) when
he leaves Nebraska, the feeling is hardly mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Davison's five career touchdowns have come against the
Tigers. Last year during Nebraska's 40-10 win at Missouri,
Nebraska's 21st straight in the series, Davison caught five passes
for 59 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it has a lot to do with the play that happened
in '97 or if it's just some mental thing going on there,'' Davison
said. ''I always seem to get ready to play them and I always feel
like I'm going to have a good game against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has led the Huskers in receiving the last two
seasons, Davison will forever be known for the catch that saved
Nebraska's last national championship season.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska's last game is an accurate forecast, Davison
shouldn't have to make a game-saving catch. Nebraska rushed for 331
yards last week, about 40 yards below average, and the Huskers'
passing attack came to life. Two of Crouch's touchdown passes were
to Davison, who is third among Nebraska all-time receivers with 77
catches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not too concerned about it. Now I have five touchdowns,''
Davison said. ''It was nice to have a game like that just because
playing at a school like this your opportunities are limited.''

<HEADLINE> Redman Leads New Albany Classic  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ALBANY, Ohio (AP) -- Even if Susie Redman never wins an LPGA
tournament -- and she hasn't in her 15 years as a pro -- she won't
ever reconsider or regret the life she chose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always think that I'm winning already,'' Redman said after
her 5-under-par 67 gave her the first-round lead Thursday at the
New Albany Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   A pessimist would consider her winless in 367 career starts.
Redman doesn't look at it that way. She gained her perspective in
1995 when -- in the midst of her best year ever -- she quit to take
care of her 4-month-old son, Bo, who was diagnosed with a form of
childhood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of have this renewed sense of happiness in terms of
being very fortunate and very lucky to be competing and playing,''
said Redman, who also has two other sons. ''He's doing great. He's
going to be 6. He's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   She came closest to winning at the 1995 Nabisco Dinah Shore,
finishing second, had made 10 of 13 cuts that year and earned more
than $130,000. It was only a few days later that the cancer was
discovered. Her best finish since his illness was a tie for third
in the 1997 Oldsmobile Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like that year I was just on the brink of being ready.
By far that's the best start I had ever had in my career,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she never felt cheated. Not then, not now.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you ask me that question -- do I think I'd have won -- I
think that having my children and sharing my testimony with a lot
of families or people I don't know, that seems more important to
me,'' she said. ''I mean, winning would be like icing on the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman jump-started her round with an eagle on the par-5 sixth
hole, reaching the green in two shots and then rolling in a 21-foot
uphill, right-to-left putt.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old player's only misstep was a three-putt bogey on
17. She also had four birdies, including three on putts of 15 feet
or longer with a new putter she pulled out of her collection
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Hyun Kim, Wendy Ward, Mardi Lunn and Dina Ammacapane opened
with 68s, and defending champion Annika Sorenstam three-putted for
bogey on the 16th hole and finished with a 69. Karrie Webb, seeking
her seventh win of the year, struggled to a 76.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who won the Safeway last week, was tied for the lead until
bogeying the closing hole, barely sliding a 6-foot par putt past
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was disappointing,'' the Korean said through an
interpreter. ''But I still have three days left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward pieced together a four-birdie, no-bogey round, while Lunn's
68 featured a 90-foot eagle putt at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lunn shot three rounds in the 60s in finishing second to
Sorenstam a year ago, but had only three more in the year leading
up to this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Ammacapane had the most excitement. As if it weren't enough to
post nine birdies and two bogeys, she also was rattled by a
volunteer's comment that led to a triple-bogey at the par-3 14th.
</P>
<P>
   As she was waiting to tee off, a volunteer asked if pro Danielle
Ammacapane was her sister. When she said yes, the volunteer added,
''She hit it in the water here.''
</P>
<P>
   With that swing thought, Dina then proceeded to hit her 9 iron
into the water off the tee. Still rattled, she three-putted the
next hole for a bogey, but then rebounded to birdie eight of her
final 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''On 16, I almost holed out for a 3 and I tapped in for a
birdie,'' Ammacapane said. ''When we got to the next tee, I looked
at my group and said, 'Do you think Danielle hit it that close?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam was tracking down Redman and was just a shot off the
lead as she came to the par-5 16th hole. She missed a 28-foot
birdie putt that would have given her a share of the lead -- and
then missed the 4-footer coming back for par.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam was joined by Karen Pearce, Heather Bowie, Kelli
Kuehne and Carin Koch at 69.

<HEADLINE> MLB Greats Help Close County Stadium  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The greatest collection of talent ever to play
in Milwaukee took the field one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Forty former Brewers, Braves and Green Bay Packers gathered in a
100-minute ceremony after the final game at Milwaukee County
Stadium on Thursday and listened to Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker
deliver a moving eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was here that boys became men,'' Uecker said. ''And men
became champions, and champions became legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Spahn and Del Crandall helped the Brewers close down the
ballpark they helped open in 1953. Spahn, the winningest
left-hander in baseball history with 363 victories, threw the
ceremonial first pitch to Crandall, his batterymate on opening day
with the Milwaukee Braves 48 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers move next year to Miller Park, under construction
beyond County Stadium's outfield fence.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron was the first one introduced in a postgame
celebration following Cincinnati's 8-1 victory. He was decked out
in his old Milwaukee Braves uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davis, a defensive end with the great Green Bay teams of
the 1960s, was next and rumbled around with a football tucked under
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Robin Yount rode in on his Harley-Davidson
motorcycle and circled the field just like he did after the 1982
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When all were introduced, they formed a human chain from second
base to center field and a flag with the County Stadium logo was
passed down from Bernie Brewer's chalet, through the stands and all
the way to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Yount handed the flag to Brewers shortstop Mark Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of us has touched this flag, symbolic of how County
Stadium has touched us,'' Yount said. ''Don't ever forget where it
all started.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta gave him his word.
</P>
<P>
   ''County Stadium has served us well and we will never forget
her,'' he said. ''But, oh, will it be sweet across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   After the great ballplayers of past and present threw
autographed baseballs into the crowd, Uecker gave a moving speech
as the lights went out one standard at a time, leaving him alone in
the dark near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long, old friend,'' he said before fireworks and flashbulbs
illuminated the packed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The record regular-season crowd of 57,354 toted cameras and
camcorders, shared memories, shed tears and downed bratwursts and
brews on a cloudless day that only grew cold in the ninth, when
they stood and shouted and snapped photos as if it were Game 7 of
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the weirdest at-bat,'' said Loretta, who grounded out
to short for the final out. ''They were cheering for a hit, but
they wanted the ceremony to start. I could do no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans had little to cheer about before that, save for Olympic
hero Ben Sheets, the Brewers' top minor league pitching prospect
who shut out Cuba in the gold medal game at Sydney, Australia. He
emerged from the dugout with his medal dangling from his neck and
waved to the crowd as it chanted, ''U-S-A! U-S-A!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also went crazy over the final sausage race, which the
bratwurst won, incidentally, by a casing over the Italian sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Some came to say good-bye; others to say good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I speak for all the guys who played here in the last
five years when I say I'm glad to see it go,'' outfielder Jeromy
Burnitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, the nation's first publicly financed ballpark, was
built in the early 1950s for $4.8 million -- about what Burnitz made
this season alone. And it was constructed at a time when no major
league team had moved since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the place lured the Braves from Boston and sparked
pro sports' great westward migration.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who won the '57 World Series, were the first NL team
to draw 2 million fans and never had a losing season in Milwaukee.
But they bolted for the Deep South after the 1965 season.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bud Selig led a group that bought the Seattle
Pilots out of bankruptcy court and returned America's pastime to
Brew City.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers won the '82 AL pennant but lost the World Series to
the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3. In 1998, they became the first team to
switch leagues since 1892, returning Milwaukee to its NL roots.
</P>
<P>
   But hard times began to thin the crowds, and with only one
luxury box -- a model to lure investment in a new ballpark -- the
Brewers could no longer compete.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers pulled up stakes in 1994 after playing a portion of
their home schedule at County Stadium for 41 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The new $394 million stadium, with its retractable roof, was to
open this year, but the project was delayed after a crane collapse
killed three ironworkers on July 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Along a chain link fence between the old ballpark and the new
one, somebody placed three bouquets of flowers Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Maggert Leads Buick Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- Jeff Maggert is good enough to have
played on the last three Ryder Cup teams, qualify for seven of the
last eight Tour Championships and even beat Tiger Woods in match
play.
</P>
<P>
   Getting motivated is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert has never seriously contended on the PGA Tour this year,
and it's not hard to find the reason -- a new wife, three kids,
Little League games, dance recitals and some R&AMP;R in front of the
television.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the peaceful setting at Callaway Gardens inspired him.
He posted his lowest score of the year on Thursday, a 9-under 63,
that gave him a three-stroke lead after the first round of the
Buick Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''My ambition is to sit at home and watch TV and watch the kids
play,'' Maggert said. ''I'm more like Fred Couples than Tiger
Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will change as the week goes on, especially if the
36-year-old from Houston gets closer to his third career victory,
and his first since beating Woods in the quarterfinals and going on
to win the inaugural Match Play Championship last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert hit the pin with his second shot on the par-5 second
hole, a 3-iron from 212 yards that stopped 2 feet away for a tap-in
eagle. He hit a couple of others close on his way to a bogey-free
63, which matches the lowest first-round score on tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   His three-stroke lead also matched the largest 18-hole lead this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger birdied three of the last four holes for a 66,
while Joey Sindelar and Charles Raulerson -- both in need of a good
week to help secure their exempt status for next year -- also were
at 66.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at 68 was someone who is motivated to get back --
David Duval, playing for the first time in two months because of a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bogey on the first hole, Duval made five par-saving
putts from 4 to 10 feet and wasted little time getting into the
thick of things. He was just as impressed with his health as his
score.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt great all day,'' Duval said. ''It was kind of
surprising that my short game actually saved me a few shots,
especially when you haven't been able to do much of it -- or any of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink and Scott Hoch were among those at 67. Davis Love
III, who has not won in 2&AMP;frac12; years, bogeyed the last hole for a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Maggert's lowest round of the year was a 5-under
67 at the Buick Open last month. Not that he has cared.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been real focused on golf,'' he said. ''There's a
lot more things that are enjoyable than chasing a ball around 30
weeks of the year and living in a hotel room. It's an easy choice.
I'm motivated at certain times of the year. For four or five weeks,
I can play at a level of Tiger Woods and be that motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He missed only two fairways, twice saved par from bunkers and
cruised around the Mountain View course with seven birdies and his
eagle. None of his birdie putts was longer than 15 feet, and
Maggert played the par 5s in 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are Tiger Woods-like numbers,'' said Maggert, who is
138th on tour in driving distance.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar did all his damage on the par 5s and par 3s, birdies on
three of each for a bogey-free 66, a good start for a man who is
130th on the money list and has finished outside the top 125 only
once in his 17 years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Raulerson is 159th on the money list, and needs about $230,000
to keep his card.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good, stress-free day,'' Sindelar said.
</P>
<P>
   The best news for Duval was that it was a pain-free day. The 68
wasn't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the No. 1 player in the world until Woods blew by the
world of golf in the last 13 months, first experienced pain in his
back after the U.S. Open and made a brief run at Woods in the final
round of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   He had not played a full round since, spending about six weeks
lying on his back.
</P>
<P>
   And at times it showed.
</P>
<P>
   On nearly a dozen occasions, Duval backed off his shot as he
tried to get comfortable with finding the line and pulling off the
shot. He went after only two flags, preferring to aim for the
middle of the green.
</P>
<P>
   He caught the lip of a fairway bunker on the first hole, the
ball barely getting out and leading to an opening bogey. But he got
up-and-down from the bunker three times -- twice for birdie on par
5s -- and made several big putts to keep his round alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't in a hurry today,'' Duval said. ''I was trying to
really play smart.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Horse Leads Equestrian Event  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET FREEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The six-year battle between the two
brightest stars in individual equestrian dressage took a dramatic
turn, with the Netherlands rider overtaking a German rider to top
the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Anky van Grunsven and Bonfire of the Netherlands overtook
Isabell Werth and Gigolo of Germany Friday (Thursday night EDT) in
the Grand Prix Special test, when Gigolo did not perform as well as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Traurig, of Carlsbad, Calif., riding Etienne, and
Susan Blinks, of Wellington, Fla., on Flim Flam improved on their
team scores from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traurig earned a 70.93 percent Friday for a combined score of
140.77. Blinks earned 71.2 percent, for 140.2 combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Etienne felt a little more tired today,'' said Traurig. ''He
did exactly what I asked him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Traurig finished the day in 10th place and Blinks in 11th. They
both qualified for the Grand Prix Freestyle ride Saturday, the
final phase of the individual competition, but are out of medal
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really psyched,'' Blinks said of Flim Flam. ''He's
really on. He's definitely getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Werth had been leading after the team Grand Prix test on
Wednesday, but scored 75.67 percent Friday to 78.13 percent by Van
Grunsven. The combined percent scores from the two tests put Van
Grunsven comfortably ahead of Werth, 153.13 to 151.99, for the
individual medals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dover, of Flemington, N.J., rode off course briefly on
Ranier, and then the horse lost his concentration and kicked out
several times. They finished with 63.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foltaire, the other U.S. horse, was withdrawn due to a possible
hoof abcess, according to team coach Jessica Ransehousen. Foltaire
was the mount of Guenter Seidel, of Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Gigolo had some stiff steps at the beginning of his test that
cost him dearly. His competition here is now not only Bonfire but
his three German teammates who are in third and tied for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Werth and Gigolo won the gold in Atlanta in 1996, with Van
Grunsven and Bonfire taking the silver. They both have announced
that their longtime partners, each 17, will retire after the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so pleased with Bonfire,'' said Van Grunsven. ''He's the
best horse in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Cycling: Last Chance for Americans  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Lance Armstrong and three other
American time trial specialists have one day, and one ride each, to
salvage U.S. Cycling's projected medal haul from the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States has one cycling medal. At least it's a
gold, coming in the match sprint by track rider Marty Nothstein.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team leaders had hoped to land three and, with some luck,
perhaps four medals. Although some results have been disappointing,
the goal remains within reach because of Saturday's time trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think three was an aggressive projection,'' team director
Sean Petty said Friday. ''Some people might not have agreed with
it, that it was realistic ... but if Lance can win one and maybe
one of the women, we would be ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the two-time Tour de France champion from Austin,
Texas, is a favorite in the 33-mile men's trial. It's his last
shot, but also his best shot, at the gold he came to claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the gold medal is a big objective,'' said Armstrong,
who placed 13th in Wednesday's road race. ''If it wasn't, why
bother coming? If I didn't think I could win gold, I wouldn't have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Marblehead, Mass., also could contend. As a
member of the U.S. Postal Service trade team, he played an
important role in Armstrong's two Tour victories, and he's being
asked to help again.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a minimum, Tyler will set a very high standard for Lance to
follow a few minutes later,'' Petty said. ''Tyler is a strong guy.
If you can go on his times, you know you're doing a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time trial, riders leave individually and race against
the clock for the fastest times.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are crossing their fingers for a women's medal.
Five-time national champion Mari Holden of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
and 1994 world champion Karen Kurreck of Los Altos Hills, Calif.,
will ride in the 18-mile trial.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong didn't need to compete in Sydney to make a name for
himself. He came back from cancer to win the Tour de France in
1999, his autobiography is a best-seller and he repeated as Tour
champion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been easy to take a pass, call it a great year
and do some vacation time,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   But an Olympic medal was missing from his brilliant career, and
it nagged his competitive soul. As a kid growing up in Texas,
Armstrong dabbled in swimming and fantasized about Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always looked at Olympic swimmers and thought how cool that
would be, to grow up and be an Olympic swimmer,'' Armstrong said.
''I don't think I had the talent to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but his interest in swimming spawned his participation in
triathlons, which developed into his cycling career. Now, he's one
of the world's best riders, a former world champion and two-time
Tour champion.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could reach the podium at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always dreamed of winning an Olympic medal,'' Armstrong
said. ''For me to make the Olympic team in '92 was a career high at
the time. As a kid, my sport was swimming. Fortunately, I found my
real sport and now I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's road race was disappointing, his fourth Olympic
event going back to Atlanta and Barcelona without a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the road race wasn't his priority for Sydney. He
targeted his training toward the time trial, especially after
breaking a neck vertebra when he crashed into a car during a
training ride last month.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong wasn't able to endure the seven- to eight-hour
training rides needed to prepare for the road race. Instead, he did
shorter training rides aimed at the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would categorize it as less training with more intensity,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the road race, Armstrong began thinking of the time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''My legs felt good today, better than I expected,'' he said.
''I didn't really train for this race. I'm very optimistic about
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurreck and Holden withdrew from the women's road race Tuesday
after crashes and mechanical problems dropped them from contention
by the midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I had a better chance in the time trial,'' Holden said.
''Anything can happen in a road race. In the time trial, it's a
race for anybody who can go well against the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty predicted both women will be eager to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a little fresher and not lacking motivation,'' he
said. ''That was the only consolation for Karen and Mari. You live
to fight again. They're both healthy and back on form. The
accidents didn't take a lot out of them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- After lurking in the middle of the Star
fleet much of the week, four-time Olympian Mark Reynolds of San
Diego sailed into position to win a medal on the regatta's final
day.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who already owns gold and silver medals, had finishes
of first, second and fourth in three fleet races on the Pacific
Ocean on Friday (Thursday night EDT). He's now won fleet races on
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, 44, was tied for second with Ian Walker of Great
Britain with 32 points, but Walker held the tiebreaking advantage,
should it come to it. The 11th and final fleet race will be sailed
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defending gold medalist Torben Grael of Brazil was first with 27
points.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds won the gold medal in 1992 and the silver in 1988, both
with Hal Haenel, now the U.S. team leader. Reynolds' new crewman is
Magnus Liljedahl of Miami, who's in his first Olympics. Together,
they won the Star world championship earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Finn skipper Russ Silvestri of Tiburon, Calif., was 10 points
out of bronze medal position with two races to sail. He had
finishes of third and fourth Friday, with a third race abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of crazily shifting winds on Sydney Harbor and the
ocean, Great Britain won one gold medal and appeared to have won
another, pending a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Robertson won the Europe class gold medal, while
Margriet Matthysse of the Netherlands took the silver and Serena
Amato of Argentina the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Courtenay Becker Dey of The Dalles, Ore., the 1996 bronze
medalist, finished 16th.
</P>
<P>
   In the Laser class, Britain's Ben Ainslie was the provisional
gold medalist, followed by Robert Scheidt of Brazil and Michael
Blackburn of Australia. However, Ainslie and Scheidt were
protesting each other over a collision in the final race. The
protest was to be heard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Myrdal of Kailua, Hawaii, finished 13th in the Lasers.

<HEADLINE> Cells Transplanted to Man's Heart  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For the first time, doctors have
transplanted a patient's own skeletal muscle onto his heart to see
if similar tissue could one day be used to treat heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedure, a small amount of muscle from a patient's
arm was removed, grown in a lab for two weeks and then grafted to
his heart. The 48-year-old patient is awaiting a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being conducted by Temple University and Diacrin
Inc., is ''primarily a safety study to see if the graft takes,''
said E. Michael Egan, vice president for corporate development at
Boston-based Diacrin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patient becomes almost like a petri dish of his own,''
said Dr. Satoshi Furukawa, surgical director of the heart and lung
transplant program at Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will monitor six patients in the study to better
understand the safety of transplanting the cells and the potential
benefits. They plan to analyze patients' hearts after transplant to
examine the cells more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary studies on animals suggest that the transplanted
muscle tissue may repair damaged heart muscle and strengthen heart
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are far more people who need heart transplants than
there are donors,'' said Dr. Howard Eisen, the medical director of
Temple's heart transplant program. ''It's a patient's own cells, so
there's no fear of rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease -- the nation's leading killer -- affects an
estimated 12 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution, which would be years away, is that a patient
who has a heart attack would have muscle cells grafted to the heart
to prevent further damage and even avert the need for a transplant,
Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   One expert said the research holds promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's safe and feasible, then the next question will be how
much impact it has and whether you can graft enough cells to
substantially benefit patients,'' said Dr. Sidney C. Smith, a past
president of the American Heart Association and a professor of
medicine at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Using transplanted cells in lieu of a heart transplant is likely
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will it happen in my lifetime? I'm not so sure. But there's
potential,'' Furukawa said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Asks for 'Fistful of Dollars'  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A federal jury was poring over the good,
the bad and the ugly evidence against Clint Eastwood in a lawsuit
brought by a disabled woman because his historic hotel was not
fully accessible to her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations began Thursday afternoon after the lawyer for
plaintiff Diane zum Brunnen told the eight jurors they should not
excuse Eastwood from requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act and a similar California law because he is a
''very special man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he thinks as a matter of principle he is entitled to
special consideration from you,'' John Burris said in his closing
arguments, gesturing across the courtroom toward the
actor-director, who has been in court every day since the trial
began Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Burris did not ask for a specific amount of damages from the
jury, which was scheduled to resume deliberations Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said Eastwood spent millions renovating his Mission Ranch
near Carmel but neglected to spend a ''fistful of dollars'' -- a
reference to the first of Eastwood's ''spaghetti Westerns'' -- on
improving disabled access.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood attorney Chuck Keller also used the reference in his
closing argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no bones about it,'' Keller said. ''That's why the
plaintiff is here ... because she, and those who represent her,
want a fistful of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen, 51, who has muscular dystrophy, sued Eastwood in
1997, a year after she and her husband say they had dinner at
Mission Ranch. The Alameda couple complained that the
wheelchair-accessible bathroom was in another building, more than
200 feet away, across a driveway; the only accessible guest room
cost $225 a night, when other rooms were as little as $85; and
there was no ramp to the main office.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, 70, said he should have been told about the problems
so he could fix them instead of being sued. The zum Brunnens
testified that they sent Eastwood two letters in 1995 to complain
about the disparity in room rates but got no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood bought Mission Ranch, a former dairy farm dating to the
1850s, in 1987 for more than $4 million. He testified that his
renovations have tried to ensure disabled access while preserving
the ranch's historic character.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know this is about -- cash,'' he said outside court
Thursday, theatrically whispering and elongating the final word.

<HEADLINE> Sailor Found Dead in Elevator Shaft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- A sailor who had been missing at least two
and a half days has been found dead in an elevator shaft on the USS
Camden off Singapore, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The death of William C. Parkhill, 19, of Bremerton, was the
second serious fall involving sailors in the USS Abraham Lincoln
battle group since the ships left for the Persian Gulf last month.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhill was reported missing Sept. 16 after the ship left
Singapore, and his body was found Sept. 18, Navy officials said
Thursday. He died of massive head trauma, said Jon Yoshishige, a
spokesman for the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator shaft covers five to six floors, but officials
aren't sure from what height Parkhill fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still under investigation, but it looks like the sailor's
death was likely an accident,'' Yoshishige said. ''The head trauma
was consistent with a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkhill, a firefighter apprentice studying to become a
machinist's mate, had been in the Navy a little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Camden is among seven ships accompanying the Lincoln, a
nuclear aircraft carrier based in Everett, on a six-month
deployment to enforce sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, Christopher Michaelson, 21, of Everett, fell 65 feet
from the Lincoln's flight deck while the carrier was south of the
Philippines. He is recovering from severe internal injuries in a
Singapore hospital.

<HEADLINE> Foes Swear To Battle Abortion Pill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion foes bitterly denounced government
approval of the abortion pill RU-486 and vowed to continue to fight
a drug they called ''baby poison'' and a threat to women's health.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug
Administration, ending a battle that has involved two presidents,
several countries and heated debate for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the drug gives American women a pharmaceutical
abortion method already in wide use in France, Britain, China and
10 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But since the FDA action took place in the closing weeks of a
national political campaign, it drew quick and heated comments from
both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
called the FDA decision ''wrong'' and said he feared that the
availability of RU-486 ''will make abortions more and more
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts, however, said abortions did not increase after
the drug was introduced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman said a president cannot order drugs
off the market, but, if elected, Bush would appoint an FDA
commissioner ''to make sure the FDA considered the risk and did not
take this action as a result of political pressure from the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, supported
approval of the abortion pill, saying the decision was ''not about
politics, but the health and safety of American women and a woman's
fundamental right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was developed in France and became available there in
1988. In 1989, Bush's father, President George Bush, ordered the
FDA to ban importation of the drug for personal use. In 1993,
President Clinton ordered a re-evaluation of the ban and sought
ways to provide RU-486 for U.S. researchers after its French
manufacturer refused to supply it.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponent Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., called the abortion
pill ''baby poison,'' adding that ''RU-486 is not just poison for
babies, it is potential poison for the mothers who take it.'' He
said it can cause prolonged bleeding and severe cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., promised legislation calling for
severe limits on which doctors could administer the abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the drug
provides an abortion method ''that avoids invasive surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a day that women should remember because their health
and their choices are finally being respected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, known chemically as mifepristone and by the brand name
Mifeprex, will be available to doctors within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone blocks a hormone vital to sustaining pregnancy and
works only during the first seven weeks of pregnancy, when an
embryo is about one-fifth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after taking mifepristone, women take a second drug
that causes cramping and bleeding as the embryo is expelled, much
like a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who choose to have an early termination of their
pregnancy, this is a reasonable medical alternative,'' said FDA
Commissioner Jane Henney. She approved mifepristone based on
studies that found it 92 percent to 95 percent effective in causing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say complications are rare, with serious bleeding in
1 percent of women. The pharmaceutical abortion does require three
doctor visits and the FDA restricted prescribing RU-486 to doctors
with certain training. The agency required that detailed
patient-information brochures be given to every woman.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith claimed in a statement that a French study showed that
out of 950 women who used the drug, 270 required narcotics to
control intense pain and seven required blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hausknecht, medical director of Danco Laboratories,
marketer of mifepristone, called it ''a very, very safe drug.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At long last, science trumps anti-abortion politics and
medical McCarthyism,'' said Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist Majority
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mifepristone may ''turn the tide against anti-choice
intimidation,'' because doctors not offering surgical abortion can
use the pill in private offices instead of protester-targeted
clinics, added Planned Parenthood president Gloria Feldt.
</P>
<P>
   A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 767 physicians found that a
third of doctors who don't now provide surgical abortions would
consider prescribing RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-abortion groups pledged to continue their opposition,
with Judie Brown of the American Life League saying: ''We will not
tolerate the FDA's decision to approve the destruction of innocent
human persons through chemical abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill's journey to the United States began in 1995, when
French manufacturer Roussel-Uclaf turned over U.S. rights to the
drug to the nonprofit Population Council of New York. The council
began clinical trials needed for FDA approval and created Danco
Laboratories to market mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in 1996 declared mifepristone a safe and effective early
abortion method, but delayed full approval because Danco had
problems satisfying manufacturing and other final requirements.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the FDA's four-year investigation shows
the decision was ''purely one of science and medicine.'' He said
the FDA ''bent over backward to do a lot of serious inquiries.''

the opening bell on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down ten points in Friday's

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Friday after Apple Computer
warned that its profits would be below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The news came on the heels of one of Wall Street's best sessions
since early summer. Analysts feared the high-profile computer
maker's announcement would further drive down a market that has
struggled to stay in positive territory this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 57.71 at 10,766.35, erasing some of its 196-point gain in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower after rising Thursday. The
Nadaq composite index fell 46.83 to 3,731.49, and the Standard and
Poor's 500 index dropped 8.82 to 1,449.47.
</P>
<P>
   The market has been down for most of September on anxiety
third-quarter profits, higher energy prices and the weak European
currency. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that
warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout
the markets, but especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning
upward on investory and blue chips issues. But Apple's warning,
which was issued after the markets closed, threatened to undo those
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker was down $25.75 to $27.75, a 48 percent loss,
in early trading, a day after investors pushed the stock up 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks were lower as well. Gateway fell $8.38
to $47.66. And chipmaker Intel fell $1.19 to $43.25, after edging
up slightly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A negative earnings warning also sent United Airlines down $3.38
to $40.63.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.77 to 521.04.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.77 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.44 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.13 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped
0.45 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congressman's Suit Result of Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rep. Bruce Vento, who has a type of lung
cancer closely linked to asbestos, is suing 11 companies for
allegedly ''negligently and recklessly'' exposing him to the fibers
more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants allegedly supplied or installed asbestos products
at four plants where the 59-year-old Minnesota congressman worked
from 1958 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Sieben said he filed the product liability
complaint by mail on Thursday with Ramsey County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Vento has mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that is
almost always associated with the inhalation of microscopic
asbestos fibers.
</P>
<P>
   After he was diagnosed earlier this year, Vento announced that
he would not seek a 13th term in Congress. In February, his left
lung and diaphragm were removed, followed by months of chemotherapy
and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Vento's spokesman said tests after the treatment had
found no lingering cancer cells, but his office said last week that
a ''recent routine medical procedure'' had found more cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sieben said he also plans to file workers compensation claims
against Vento's four former employers.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Reserve Plan Stripped  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan to create a permanent emergency home
heating oil reserve for Northeast states suffered a blow Thursday
when it was stripped from a funding bill.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that was removed from the energy and water
projects bill also would have reauthorized the president's power to
withdraw oil from the 600-million-barrel national Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last week he would tap the reserve to
drive down oil prices. Many Republicans, including presidential
candidate George W. Bush, opposed the move, saying the reserve only
should be tapped in a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said House Republicans were retaliating against
Clinton by stripping the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans in Congress are fiddling around while people
are about to freeze,'' said Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass. ''This
underscores the problem in the GOP leadership that they don't
understand the heating oil crisis. To throw this provision out is a
slap in the face to everyone from a state that relies on heating
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
energy and water subcommittee, said the reserve provision was
removed because matters dealing with fossil fuels were the
jurisdiction of a different panel handling Interior Department
spending.
</P>
<P>
   And because Clinton has said he plans to establish a Northeast
reserve on his own, Republicans said it's unnecessary for Congress
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't prevent anything from happening,'' said Melissa
Carlson, a Packard spokeswoman. ''There will still be a reserve in
the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   New England has 5 million barrels of oil available, a 60 percent
drop from last year's inventory. The provision called for
establishing a permanent reserve of 2 million gallons for New
England, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, which opposes a reserve, says
creating a Northeast reserve will further reduce supplies
elsewhere, driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will use his authority set up a temporary
reserve. But supporters of the permanent reserve say that won't
ensure heating oil is quickly made available to the Northeast
because it would require a national emergency to be tapped.

   ''Current law says you can release reserve oil when you have an
energy supply disruption,'' White House spokesman Elliot Diringer
said. ''What we would like is a trigger that's better suited to a
regional supply shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the permanent reserve say they will continue
pressing the issue in Congress. Another bill now in the Senate has
a Northeast reserve provision.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say they want assurances a heating
reserve will be in place this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a reserve, and we need to know that people will have
oil to heat their homes,'' said Marcial Cuevas, executive director
of the Community Action Agency of New Haven, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM Guilty of Bribery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
was convicted Friday by a special court on charges of bribing
lawmakers to support his government in a confidence vote in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Buta Singh, Rao's home minister, was also convicted, the United
News of India reported. Nine others were acquitted for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was set for Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Rao, the first Indian prime minister to be convicted in a
criminal case, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy and bribery
under India's anti-corruption laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bureau of Investigation had charged Rao, Singh and
several politicians and businessmen of bribing four lawmakers to
vote in favor of the ruling Congress party during a crucial
confidence vote on July 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Rao's Congress party won the confidence vote by 14 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rao, who was in the court when the judgment was pronounced,
refused to comment and left immediately, the Press Trust of India
reported. The private STAR TV news channel reported that Rao would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution relied on the testimony of Shailendra Mahto, one
of the lawmakers who was bribed and later helped the prosecution
build their case, the Press Trust said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahto testified that each of the four parliamentarians were paid
$178,000 in return for their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rao, prime minister from 1991-96, was credited with opening
India's highly regulated economy to global trade, but his years in
office were also disrupted by scandals in high office.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 79; Nasdaq Drops 60  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell back into a slump Friday after Apple
Computer's warning that its profits would be below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's bad news came on the heels of one of Wall Street's best
sessions since early summer. It drove down a market that has
struggled to stay in positive territory this month.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 79.47 at 10,744.59, erasing some of its nearly 196-point gain
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower after rising Thursday. The
Nadaq composite index fell 60.25 to 3,718.07, and the Standard and
Poor's 500 index dropped 9.48 to 1,448.81.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a free-falling, down bear market because the
fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
''But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple
warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has been down for most of September on anxiety
third-quarter profits, higher energy prices and the weak European
currency. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that
warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout
the markets, but especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning
upward on technology and blue chips issues. But Apple's warning,
which was issued after the markets closed, threatened to undo those
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker was down $27.06 to $26.44, a 50 percent loss,
in early trading, a day after investors pushed the stock up 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks were lower as well. Gateway fell $10.03
to $46.01. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.06 to $42.38, after edging
up slightly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A negative earnings warning also sent United Airlines down $3.06
to $40.94.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 308.6 million shares,
compared with 340.6 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 3.27 to 520.54.

<HEADLINE> Congress Struggling With Budget  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has agreed on a major conservation
bill that could double federal land acquisition and preservation
spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, while significant, still left Congress entering
the new fiscal year with 11 of 13 spending bills unfinished,
disputes with the White House on issues ranging from Cuba sanctions
to Missouri River water levels and increasing pressure to end the
session as the election nears.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations interior panel, said the land deal he helped
engineer is ''the greatest increase in resources for conservation
in the history of the country.'' While less costly than a
$3-billion-a-year plan championed by President Clinton, it would
budget $1.6 billion next year for land acquisition and
conservation, with that figure rising to $2.4 billion a year by
2006.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on the land issue opened the way for passage next week
of a $19 billion bill to fund the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some progress was also made Thursday when the House, by 301-118,
approved a $23.6 billion measure for water and energy programs. But
that vote was clouded by a threat from Clinton to veto the bill
because it would block administration plans to allow a springtime
rise in the Missouri River to protect endangered fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is only a small part of a bill that allots $13.5
billion to atomic energy defense activities and $3.2 billion to
Energy Department science programs. But a veto could have
election-year repercussions in the swing state of Missouri, where
farmers and the barge industry worry about floods and other
problems if the river ebbs and flows more naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make our day,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said
when asked about Clinton's veto threat. ''He loses Missouri to
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   With no votes scheduled for Friday, the start of the Jewish New
Year, Congress will enter the new fiscal year on Sunday with only
two spending bills, both defense-related, signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of the government shutdown of 1995, the Senate
on Thursday, following House action, voted 96-0 to keep government
programs running through Friday, Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the temporary extension Friday, and prodded
Republicans to pass the remaining appropriations bills quickly.
''September has come and gone, and Congress still has obligations
to fulfill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With House Republicans in danger of losing the majority they won
six years ago, the GOP leadership was eager to wrap up for the year
so lawmakers could hit the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that good will in the Senate now is needed to finish
our job. The American people want us to do our job,'' said Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, Senate Appropriations Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, ranking Democrat on the
committee, took his colleagues to task for the recent trend of
leaving spending bills for end-of-the-year, marathon bargaining
sessions that exclude most members. ''We are not performing that
watchdog function when we invite the White House behind closed
doors and play five-card draw with the people's tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Interior Department bill, negotiators were
close on two other major spending bills to fund transportation and
agriculture programs.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up the agriculture bill were final negotiations on two
big issues -- easing sanctions on sales of food and medicine to Cuba
and allowing pharmacists and drug wholesalers to reimport U.S.-made
prescription drugs that are sold cheaper in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation bill is to include a provision setting a
national standard of 0.08 percent blood alcohol content for drunken
driving. It would withhold some federal highway money from states
that don't impose the tougher standard. The bill would also
postpone, for at least a year, new federal rules on trucker
operating hours aimed at reducing accident-causing trucker fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The energy-water measure was just one example of how the
late-session rush to complete budget bills was resulting in a
bipartisan spending bazaar. The measure was $2.4 billion higher
than last year's bill and $890 million larger than Clinton had
requested.
</P>
<P>
   It included dozens of projects that were neither requested by
Clinton nor approved by the House and Senate in earlier versions of
the bill. These included $25 million to clean groundwater in the
San Gabriel basin near Los Angeles, inserted by Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif.; $4.5 million to deepen the Columbia River channel between
Oregon and Washington state; and nearly $2 million for the Fox
Point hurricane barrier in Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> Former Canadian PM Trudeau Dies  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- With the death of former Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, Canadians lost their own version of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, 80, died of prostate cancer at his Montreal home
Thursday. The news triggered a stream of Kennedy-esque reminiscing
and photos rolling across Canadian television screens: the prime
minister frolicking with his three young sons, with a beautiful
wife on his arm, or in the heat of a passionate speech laced with
liberal idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau -- who like John Kennedy embraced progressive ideals in
the revolutionary 1960s -- was suffering from Parkinson's disease
and still recovering from 10 days of pneumonia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral will be Tuesday in Montreal. Trudeau's body will lie
in state until Monday in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   A French Canadian who fought for national unity and even sent
troops into Quebec to quell separatism, his charisma and
irreverence helped define an era.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau once danced pirouettes behind the back of Queen
Elizabeth. He wore sandals in Parliament, and called journalists
''trained seals.'' He dated singers and actresses like Barbra
Streisand and Margot Kidder before marrying Margaret Sinclair in
1971, a woman then half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Though named Canada's newsmaker of the millennium by
journalists, Trudeau was increasingly private since retiring from
public life in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien canceled a Caribbean summit in
Jamaica to fly home. Chretien built his political life in the
centrist Liberal Party as a minister in Trudeau's cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pierre Trudeau, the embodiment of the dream of a just society,
has left us,'' Chretien said. ''He is gone but his unfinished work
remains -- our country, Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's powerful influence on Canada was apparent far beyond
the crowds gathered outside his home on a Montreal hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   Airline flight attendants at the Toronto airport sobbed watching
the coverage on terminal televisions. In Ottawa, a young man in
tears laid a single, long-stemmed red rose at the Centennial Flame.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a very passionate guy who enjoyed life,'' said Chris
Tian, 26, of Vancouver. ''I'm devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He made Canada cool, he really did,'' said Reed Haley of St.
Stephen, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was too big for any stereotype: he was a skilled
debater, and an outdoorsman with a love for canoeing.
</P>
<P>
   He was a policy expert and a political visionary -- his vision
birthed Canada's constitution in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pierre Trudeau opened a dynamic new era in Canadian politics
and helped establish Canada's unique imprint on the global stage,''
President Clinton said Thursday from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the chummy relationship Canada now enjoys with the United
States wasn't always so cozy during the Cold War and Trudeau's
reign. President Nixon insulted him on the now famous private
tape-recorded meetings. During a summit, President Reagan blew up
at Trudeau over his Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1969 speech at the National Press Club in Washington,
Trudeau offered this take on sharing a continent with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an
elephant,'' he told America. ''No matter how friendly and
even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and
grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister from 1968 to 1984, with a brief break
in 1979. Pundits dubbed his early years ''Trudeaumania.''
</P>
<P>
   He ushered in the metric system, made French an official
language, and enshrined a Canadian bill of rights in the 1982
constitution. He also had a keen interest in foreign affairs, where
he promoted peacekeeping forces, then still a fairly new concept.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau and his wife had three sons: Justin, Sacha, and Michel.
Trudeau kept custody after the couple separated in 1977. In a
Kennedy-like twist, Michel tumbled to death in a skiing accident in
British Columbia in 1998. Close friends and family say Trudeau
never recovered from the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was born Oct. 19, 1919, to a wealthy family in Montreal.
He graduated with a law degree from the University of Montreal and
a master's degree in political economy from Harvard University in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   He drew strong opposition from fellow French-Canadians in the
separatist movement. Trudeau frowned upon Quebec's desire to split
from Canada's confederation, refusing to take cover when
separatists hurled bottles at him during campaign rallies. He
became the only prime minister to invoke the War Measures Act at
home, sending troops into Montreal and Ottawa in 1970, after
separatist terrorists kidnapped British trade commissioner James
Cross and Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pierre Trudeau was the most distinguished Canadian of our
times,'' said Ujjal Dosanjh, premier of British Columbia. ''I
believe that in the last 40 to 50 years, no one put Canada on the
world map of international affairs as well as he did in a
constructive and assertive fashion.''

<HEADLINE> School Protests Pressure Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of high school students
shunned classes, opposition supporters rallied in the capital and
shopkeepers walked off the job Friday in the first wave of a
nationwide blitz aimed at forcing President Slobodan Milosevic to
accept election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 people gathered at Belgrade's main square as part
of protests opposition leaders hope to use to pressure the Yugoslav
president to admit that challenger Vojislav Kostunica won Sunday's
election by a wide margin. Milosevic admits he finished second, but
his government says the vote was so close a runoff is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cease your work, come out and stay on the streets, so that
this country will find its path to future,'' opposition leader
Zoran Djindjic told the crowd. ''Serbia must stop for us to unload
Milosevic out of a seat he no longer has a right to.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 students waved anti-Milosevic banners and
paralyzed the center of Nis, Serbia's third largest city. In one
Nis high school only the principal was left inside as pupils poured
onto the streets chanting: ''Save Serbia and kill yourself,
Slobodan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know why you are not in school today. You refuse to accept
injustice,'' Nis Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told the students at a rally.
He urged parents to join their youngsters on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Similar walkouts -- joined by shopkeepers and others -- were
staged in several other cities, including the opposition
strongholds of Cacak and Kragujevac. Both places were heavily
targeted during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition lodged an official complaint with the Federal
Election Commission on Friday, providing their own tally that
showed Kostunica beat Milosevic 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission fails to respond, the opposition will press
the case to the country's constitutional court. Charges could also
be raised against individuals implicated in vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has shown no sign of retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled Federal Electoral Commission admitted
Kostunica soundly beat Milosevic, but said he failed to get an
outright majority to avoid a runoff election Oct. 8. Milosevic
plans to run in the second round despite a certain boycott by
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate worries were whether Milosevic would unleash
the military and other security forces against his opponents -- a
move that could force the West into making hard decisions on
whether to offer more than just words of support.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Belgrade's Roman Catholic Archbishop France Perko
urged a ''just solution'' to resolve the discrepancies between the
opposition's election tally and the regime's count but expressed
little faith in advantages of a general strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment, there is great danger of violence, widespread
unrest, even civil war,'' the Archbishop said in an interview with
the Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has praised the growing
anti-Milosevic momentum, but noted, without giving specifics, that
American forces were ''prepared for contingencies.'' The U.S.
contingent is the largest in the NATO-led coalition controlling the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign leaders have promised a Kostunica-led government
the lifting of economic sanctions and the restoration of
Yugoslavia's full U.N.-member rights.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, a NATO member with close cultural and religious ties to
Serbia, has suggested the opposition consider the possibility of
taking part in the runoff if international election observers are
allowed. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou also suggested a
foreign-supervised recount as another avenue for possible
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliamentary results from Sunday's vote, the electoral
commission said pro-Milosevic parties won 74 of the lower house's
138 seats, while the opposition bloc received 55 seats. The other
seats went to independent parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper house -- where 40 seats are divided equally between
the two Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro -- the
pro-Milosevic parties had 27 seats, and the opposition 10, with the
other seats going to independent parties.
</P>
<P>
   The win by pro-Milosevic parties, particularly in the upper
house, was partially due to the fact that many people in
pro-Western Montenegro boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic backers conceded defeat earlier in the week in the
third race -- elections for municipal governments in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Thousands in South Asia Await Relief  </HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Villagers fleeing raging waters took
refuge in trees and on rooftops, witnesses said, as rescue workers
tried Friday to save tens of thousands stranded for more than week
by floods in India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities put the death toll in the two countries at 981 --
from drowning, snake bites and murder by pirates looting abandoned
villages -- and said cholera, diarrhea and typhoid had broken out in
crowded relief camps in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, authorities using speed boats have stepped up
evacuation of flood victims in the Mekong Delta as the death toll
rose to 187, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an official of the International Federation of the
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimated that up to 20
children a day are drowning in Vietnam -- falling off dikes where
tens of thousands of families have taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Late monsoon rains caused major rivers in eastern India to
overflow since Sept. 18, flooding villages throughout West Bengal
state, inundating parts of Calcutta, submerging hundreds of farming
villages, towns, roads and railway lines in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are thousands of people stranded in remote villages and
we have not been able to help them,'' Mohammad Shahjahan, a
Bangladesh government relief worker, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates by relief workers, government officials
and news reporters, about 17 million people are believed marooned
or living in muddy relief camps in India and another 1.5 million
are affected in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless have taken shelter on roads, mud embankments, and
schools or abandoned factories.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen many people perched on trees or vulnerable roofs of
their houses,'' Farazi Ajmal Hossain, a reporter of Dhaka's Ittefaq
newspaper said after touring some flooded villages in Jessore
district, 85 miles west of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bengal state government in India put the casualty toll
Thursday at 651 dead and 231 missing and presumed dead. Another 39
died in Bihar state and more than 60 have died in Bangladesh,
according to unofficial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Atish Chandra Sinha, of the opposition Congress party in
West Bengal accused police and state officials of underreporting
deaths and said the toll is probably in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the worst-hit areas, Murshidabad, Sinha said rotten
carcasses of cows, goats and other animals could be seen floating,
and there is an acute shortage of clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   He said reports of people suffering from stomach ailments ''are
pouring in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Though people in those areas somehow managed to survive the
first onslaught of the flood, they will perish of hunger unless
they are provided with food and relief materials immediately,''
Sinha said.
</P>
<P>
   Some supplies are being dropped by air, and the army said
Thursday it is trying to get more boats to the area.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and
typhoid have broken out in the overcrowded relief camps, according
to the Bangladesh Observer newspaper. Relief agencies also say they
have been unable to get enough food and water to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger bus service from Calcutta to Dhaka, the Bangladesh
capital, has been suspended. Knee-deep water fills the border post
offices and warehouses packed with imported Indian goods.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 125 million people, is
buffeted by floods and cyclones every year. But this is the first
time since 1935 that the western region has suffered such deadly
floods.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Aircraft Arrives in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A Yemeni aircraft carrying the nation's
deputy prime minister and other officials arrived in Iraq on Friday
after Saudi Arabia reversed its refusal to let it fly over the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed flight had been approved by the United Nations, but
comes days after French and Russian flights challenged the U.N.
embargo on Iraq by failing to wait for authorization from the U.N.
sanctions committee. Jordan is the only other Arab country to send
a flight to Baghdad recently; it also had secured U.N. clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz welcomed the Yemeni
Airlines Boeing 727 at Saddam International Airport and praised the
Yemeni leadership, noting it has been a staunch supporter of
lifting the sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he expects more Arab flights, Aziz said: ''It
is up to the Arab governments' leaders. If they decide to do the
same ... we would welcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Abdul-Kader Bajammal and
Information Minister Abdel Rehman al-Akwaa were among the plane's
approximately 50 passengers. The aircraft carried medicine and
other humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a humanitarian step taken to show solidarity with the
Iraqi people and we hope that the sanctions are lifted soon,''
Bajammal had said in San'a, the Yemeni capital, before boarding the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. sanctions committee said the flight
received authorization Thursday after answering questions about its
purpose from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis granted permission for the flight after Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh called Saudi Defense Minister Prince
Sultan, a Yemeni government official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Prince Sultan said the plane could cross Saudi territory
on condition that it fly to Amman, Jordan, and not directly to
Iraq, the Yemeni official said in San'a.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan allowed the plane to fly over its territory and on to
Iraq because it had U.N. clearance, said Jihad Irsheid, the
Jordanian director of civil aviation. Jordan flew a humanitarian
flight to Baghdad on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment, but
the nation routinely has supported Arab League resolutions calling
for the sanctions to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, which have caused severe shortages and
malnutrition, are widely resented in the Arab world. But the Saudis
regularly vote for international resolutions that call on Iraq to
abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions that require it to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and pay reparations for
its seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the organizers of another anti-sanctions flight to
Iraq said Friday they had been forced to cancel their trip because
of opposition from the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22-23, France and Russia flew planes carrying
humanitarian aid, officials, business executives and artists to
Iraq, having informed the U.N. sanctions committee but refusing to
wait for its authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The United States criticized the flights as a violation of
sanctions, while Russia and France contend that humanitarian
flights do not require clearance from the U.N. Iraq hailed the
flights as evidence that the sanctions regime was collapsing.

<HEADLINE> Stability A Priority for Peru  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, facing
rumors of a military coup and demands for his resignation, said
Friday that ''stability and democracy in Peru will be guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori spoke briefly to reporters outside the State Department
following a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. His
hastily arranged visit to Washington was prompted by a series of
setbacks that have weakened his position considerably and raised
questions about whether Peruvian democracy can survive.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Albright, Fujimori met with National Security
adviser Sandy Berger. He met Thursday evening with Organization of
American States Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria, who has assumed a
key role in the effort to restore democratic stability to Peru by
organizing a dialogue among the country's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, Fujimori announced plans to convene presidential
elections in 2001, four years ahead of schedule. He said he will
not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time powerful ally, Vladimiro Montesinos, was forced into
exile in Panama last week after his attempt to bribe an opposition
legislator was captured on videotape and shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos had been Peru's intelligence chief and was able to
stock the military high command with supporters. He also has been
linked to secret arms shipments to Colombian guerrillas via Jordan
but U.S. officials admit they do not know the full story.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, without going into detail, said the National
Intelligence Service that Montesinos headed has been deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   He offered no details about his meetings with Gaviria and
Albright and has not explained his reasons for visiting Washington.
The State Department learned of the trip only hours before Fujimori
left Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing Fujimori's meeting with Albright, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said Thursday that she planned to tell the
Peruvian leader of ''our support for a peaceful, democratic and
constitutional transition of power, and for the continuation of OAS
dialogue that has been going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori left the State Department, he waved to reporters and
said he he was not prepared to comment. But several reporters
approached him as he got into his car, and he agreed to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The priority is the Peruvian electoral process,'' he said,
declining to go beyond generalities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer at this time that you excuse me for not commenting on
these subjects but what I do want to say is that stability and
democracy in Peru will be guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Fujimori's 2 a.m. departure Thursday from Lima, an
opposition congressman who had defected to Fujimori's ranks charged
that the army high command was pressuring lawmakers to provoke a
coup within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, Miguel Mendoza, said the army was plotting to
restore Montesinos to power. The army command has denied the
allegation.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Generals Forced To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croatia's president forced seven generals
to retire Friday after they criticized a government crackdown on
war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The generals signed an open letter accusing President Stipe
Mesic and his government of ''waging a campaign to smear the
independence struggle through recent spectacular arrests'' of
former soldiers suspected of committing atrocities against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The generals were supporters of the nationalist government of
the late president, Franjo Tudjman, which was defeated by a
pro-Western opposition coalition earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic cited a constitutional ban against senior military
officials publicly airing political views, and told the officers
that if they thought they could bring down the government with
pamphlets ''they are playing the wrong hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever wants to be involved in politics has the right to do
so,'' Mesic told the state-run HINA news agency. ''But while they
are in the army, they will not be publishing pamphlets.''
</P>
<P>
   The move infuriated war veterans, whose association asked Mesic
to reconsider the decision. The veterans said they were ''deeply
concerned for the political stability'' of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   And Ivo Sanader, the leader of the Tudjman's party -- the former
nationalist government -- said the decision is ''extremely
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The military had always been the power base of Tudjman's party,
and many of its supporters remained in government posts after the
new administration took power in January. Many believe Tudjman's
party is behind the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The new government has been trying to carry out democratic
reforms and work for Croatia's admission to the European Union,
NATO and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Croats made up the majority of victims in the war that erupted
when ethnic Serbs took up arms to fight Croatia's secession from
former Yugoslavia, but independent reports showed Serb civilians
were also the victims of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry was also critical. It said Mesic's move was
''drastic ... and taken without consultations'' with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The seven generals who were forced to retire joined five retired
generals in signing a critical letter published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter noted ''with bitterness'' that the 1991 war against
Yugoslavia has been presented ''as a crime and something filthy,
while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom,
independence and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The generals were alluding to the new government's commitment to
cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal and prosecute alleged
war criminals -- even if the perpetrators were Croats.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 129; Nasdaq Falls 76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell back into a slump Friday after Apple
Computer's warning that its profits would be below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's bad news came on the heels of one of Wall Street's best
sessions since early summer. It drove down a market that has
struggled to stay in positive territory this month.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
128.68 at 10,695.38, erasing some of its nearly 196-point gain in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower after rebounding Thursday.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 75.91 to 3,702.41, and the Standard
and Poor's 500 index dropped 14.87 to 1,443.42.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a free-falling, down bear market because the
fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
''But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple
warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has been down for most of September on anxiety over
third-quarter profits, higher energy prices and the weak European
currency. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that
warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout
the markets, but especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning
upward on technology and blue chips issues. But Apple's warning,
which was issued after the markets closed, threatened to undo those
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker was down $27.06 to $26.44, a 50 percent loss,
in early trading, a day after investors pushed the stock up 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks were lower as well. Gateway fell $10.03
to $46.01. Hewlett Packard was off $7.94 and $98.19. Lucent slipped
$1.38 to $30.38. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.44 to $42, after
edging up slightly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A negative earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down
$2.63 to $41.38. But old-economy companies, for the most part,
appeared less affected.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble remained unchanged at $67, retaining gains made
Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart
moved up 19 cents to $6.06.
</P>
<P>
   Many energy issues also stayed in positive territory.
Halliburton advanced $1.29 to $49.94. Schlumberger was up 88 cents
to $53.06.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues and advancers traded at a nearly even margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 440.43 million
shares, compared with 514.64 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 2.92 at 520.89.

<HEADLINE> Houston Charged With Pot Possession  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Pop singer Whitney Houston could face
30 days in a Hawaiian jail and a $1,000 fine for allegedly
possessing half an ounce of marijuana, discovered by security staff
at the Keahole-Kona International Airport, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was found Jan. 11 in Houston's bag during a routine
search as the recording star prepared to board a plane for San
Francisco, First Deputy Prosecutor Charlene Iboshi said. The petty
misdemeanor charge was filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff kept the bag, but Houston departed before officers had
arrived, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's husband Bobby Brown was arrested earlier this year at
the airport in Newark, N.J., after testing positive for cocaine
while on probation for a 1996 drunk driving conviction. Houston
picked Brown up from a Florida jail July 7, when he was released 10
days early for good behavior.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Attack Grounded Jets  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters attacked Russian positions
in the Chechen capital and elsewhere in the province while Russian
jets and helicopters were grounded because of bad weather,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery kept up shelling in the south, but the
visibility was so poor that no combat missions could be flown, said
an official with the pro-Russian government in the northern Chechen
town of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's interior minister reportedly said police
have identified 20 people involved in a series of apartment
bombings last year that were cited as one reason the Russian
military launched its incursion to retake the breakaway region of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rushailo told the Izvestiya newspaper that nine of the
suspects had been arrested, while the 11 others have been put on an
international wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in September 1999 devastated two apartment
buildings in Moscow, one in the southern city of Volgodonsk, and
another in the southern city of Buinaksk. Some 300 people were
killed in all.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately blamed the bombings on Chechen rebels, and
Russian troops were sent soon afterward back into the region, from
which they had withdrawn in defeat at the end of a 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo did not identify any of the suspects. Police say two
top rebel commanders in Chechnya masterminded the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces have since taken about two-thirds of Chechnya,
but haven't been able to push rebels from the southern mountains
and are subjected to nightly guerrilla attacks even in regions they
occupy.
</P>
<P>
   The official from Chechnya's pro-Russian government said Friday
that Russian checkpoints were attacked 17 times in the past 24
hours, including six times Grozny, the Chechen capital. There were
reports of wounded in Grozny, but no concrete figures on casualties
for either side.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian
troops had been deployed in the southern Vedeno Gorge, which has
been shelled by Russian artillery and aircraft for months, to root
out small groups of rebels. The gorge is a key rebel channel for
moving men, arms and other supplies.

<HEADLINE> 3 Palestinians Dead Following Clash  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM HAZBOUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli riot police fired rubber bullets and
live rounds at hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians on Friday,
killing three protesters in the bloodiest clashes in four years at
a Jerusalem holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Palestinian protesters were injured. Dozens of police,
including the Jerusalem police chief, were hurt by rocks during the
violence in the compound.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute over who will control the area has blocked progress in
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been running high since Thursday when the hawkish
Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, visited the compound to
demonstrate that Israel was in control. A senior Palestinian
official on Friday accused Sharon of igniting a ''religious war.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, a Palestinian policeman opened fire on
Israeli colleagues with whom he was patrolling the West Bank town
of Qalqiliya. One Israeli officer was killed and a second wounded,
officials said. The gunman was arrested by Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, clashes spread to areas of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem as well as parts of the West Bank. In one Jerusalem
neighborhood, a tourist bus was pelted with stones, and five
passengers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the biblical town of Bethlehem, rocks littered the main road
and thick clouds of black smoke from burning tires rose into the
skies. One stone-thrower, his face covered by a black hood, was
taken into a chokehold by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The violence at the Jerusalem shrine, known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary,
began after Muslim noon prayers. As thousands of worshippers
emerged from the two mosques in the walled compound, some began
throwing stones at Israeli troops posted deployed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At first, police stayed back, huddling behind tall plastic
shields and firing rounds of rubber-coated bullets from the
compound's Moghrabi Gate as a barrage of stones descended upon
them. At one point, they charged forward, some wielding clubs, to
push back the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In the mayhem, Palestinian protesters hit by rubber bullets fell
to the ground and were carried away by their friends. One young man
was unconscious, his forehead bloodied. Others held their stomachs
and heads in pain. Shouts of ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great,
rose from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Three Palestinians were killed, according to Khaled Qureia, the
director of Mukassed Hospital in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Qureia initially put the death toll at four, saying a comatose
patient hooked up to a respirator was among the dead. However, he
later corrected himself, saying the patient was alive.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 175 Palestinians were treated for rubber bullet
injuries at Mukassed and nearby Augusta Victoria hospital, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Israeli police ringed the hospital, triggering a
barrage of stones by Palestinians who feared the troops had come to
arrest some of the injured. Scores were hurt in renewed clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli's police chief, Yehuda Wilk, said police largely fired
rubber-coated steel pellets, but that snipers also fired some live
rounds at the Temple Mount, targeting protesters they felt
endangered the lives of officers. It was not clear if those killed
were hit by live fire. Rubber bullets can also be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians blamed Sharon for the violence. ''The clashes
are a continuation of the fire of the religious war which was
ignited by Sharon's visit yesterday,'' said Nabil Aburdeneh, an
adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli government officials were not immediately available for
comment because of the Jewish New Year, which began at sundown
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the clashes raged, Sharon defended his visit to the holy
shrine. ''The state of Israel cannot afford that an Israeli citizen
will not be able to visit part of his country, not to speak about
the holiest place for the Jewish people all around the world,''
Sharon told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is site of the former biblical Temple, Judaism's
holiest shrine. It is revered by Muslims as the home of two major
mosques that mark the spot where tradition says Prophet Muhammad
ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came at a time of deadlock in peace talks.
Negotiations are hung up because of rival claims to sovereignty
over the walled compound. Both sides have said they would not grant
the other sole control. U.S. mediators have floated compromise
ideas, but none has been accepted by both Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Americans Recount Ferry Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- The sunset on the Aegean Sea had been
spectacular and now the two friends awaited their night docking in
Paros harbor.
</P>
<P>
   A gale wind kicked spray off the sea and howled through the
ferry's metal rails. But Heidi Hart and Christine Shannon -- on a
hastily prepared vacation from Seattle -- didn't want to go below.
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of the darkness, rocks appeared. They struck at 18
knots -- near full speed for the Express Samina. ''(It) was maybe 20
feet wide and it dragged across the side of the boat for a few
seconds,'' Hart, 26, said of the rocky islet. ''I looked at
Christine ... First I laughed in disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Lights went out. The ship began listing and panicked passengers
poured onto the deck. The two American tourists -- afraid and
confused -- wondered if this was the end.
</P>
<P>
   It was for at least 72 people aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, a combination of sheer luck and raw survival
instincts allowed them to somehow negotiate the two-mile tempest
separating the sinking 345-foot ferry from shore late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rocks -- marked with a large beacon -- had torn a gash nearly
300 feet long in the side of the 34-year-old ship.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from other survivors suggest valuable time was lost
while crew members tried to calm passengers instead of preparing
them to abandon ship. Hart and Shannon, 30, could not understand
Greek. And from where they were standing could not see any crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   When the ship slammed into the rocks, the captain was allegedly
sleeping in his cabin and his first officer was reportedly flirting
with a passenger. Survivors say other officers and crew were
watching a soccer game in the main lounge. The captain, first
officer and two crew members have been charged with murder, neglect
of duty and violation of maritime procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized we were going down and had to get off the ship,''
said Hart. ''We couldn't understand the language so we made smarter
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   People were sliding across the deck and clutching the rails.
Life boats were being lowered into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   A group of people shouted to the two Americans to get on one of
the boats. But as the they were being lowered to the sea, the
wooden vessel swung and hit the side of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were soaked as soon as we hit the water,'' said Hart, an
accountant. ''My foot went through the hole in the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paros shoreline was visible. But large waves and strong
winds pushed survivors out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The waves were really big and it was totally dark. People were
crying. People were throwing up over the side,'' said Hart. ''I
kept chanting to myself, 'Please let everyone be OK.' I said it
1,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   The two friends had originally planned to go to Mexico, but a
hurricane was approaching. So they got on a plane to Israel. They
toured the Holy Land and Egypt before deciding to hop across the
Mediterranean to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just wanted to get to a beach and stay there,'' said Hart.
''And have some good food.''
</P>
<P>
   They were packed into a life boat packed with soaked and
shivering passengers: Greeks, Germans, Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The waves were huge. That's what scared us,'' said Shannon, an
artist and teacher. After repeated efforts someone managed to get
the outboard motor got started.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of salvation came when the blue dome of a church
came into view.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just said, 'Thank you, thank you,' all the time ... we made
it. It was very scary and we made it,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors were met by residents carrying clothes and blankets.
Their feet were wrapped in gauze to get them warm.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave us pajamas,'' Hart said. ''Women came up to us and
kissed us.''

<HEADLINE> Buffalo union official sentenced to jail over teachers' illegal strike </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The president of the Buffalo teachers union
was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined $1,000 Friday for
calling an illegal strike that canceled classes for 47,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Rumore surrendered Friday afternoon to begin serving his
sentence at the Erie County Correctional Facility in Alden.
</P>
<P>
   Two other union officers, Edith Le Win and Barbara Bielecki,
were fined $1,000 but spared jail.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore said his sentence was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had anticipated there would be jail time. These are the
consequences of our actions,'' he said upon leaving state Supreme
Court Justice Kevin Dillon's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be easier than what I went through last week,'' he
added while heading home to pack.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore, Le Win and Bielecki pleaded guilty last Friday to
contempt of court for calling the Sept. 14 walkout in violation of
a no-strike order signed by Dillon two days earlier. The strike
also violated the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits public
employees from striking.
</P>
<P>
   In sparing the two women jail, Dillon said he could not hold
them any more responsible for the strike than the nearly 4,000
other members of the Buffalo Teachers Federation, who at Labor Day
rally authorized union leaders to take any necessary action to
settle a contract dispute that had stewed since June 1999. Le Win
and Bielecki are the union's vice president and secretary,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The union and Board of Education agreed to a five-year contract
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The judge harshly criticized the union for calling the strike at
7:05 a.m. while students were at bus stops and on schoolbuses
headed for class. Surprised parents, who in many cases had already
left for jobs, were forced to arrange last-minute day care.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore said the union never intended to jeopardize the
children's well-being and assumed schools would remain open without
the teachers. Instead, Superintendent Marion Canedo canceled school
but said the district would care for students who did not get the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never any intent by the teachers ... to endanger any
of our students,'' Rumore said. ''A job action was to withhold our
labor, not to inflict any damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Dillon could have sentenced the union officers
to up to 30 days in jail, fined them $1,000 or both. Saying he had
''struggled mightily'' to weigh the case's complexities, Dillon
said he could not allow a willful violation of his court order to
go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This court issues hundreds of orders each year. If all
dissatisfied recipients ignored them and did what they think is
best, there would be chaos,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could impose community service I would,'' he told
Bielecki before sentencing her, indicating he had been inundated
with such requests.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore called for a change in the bargaining process to avoid
such disputes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way that we've done this has to end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The school district's attorney, Michael Risman, made no specific
sentencing recommendations, saying the Board of Education was
divided on what would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the judge to consider the timing of the strike, its
impact on students and their families, and to send a message to
students that ''there must be respect for the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants fully understood there were other lawful
options that could have been pursued,'' Risman said.
</P>
<P>
   Union attorney Michael Sawicki said his clients would accept the
sentence ''without bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's time to go forward from here,'' he told the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 14 walkout was the second in a week after contract
negotiations broke down. Teachers also walked out Sept. 7, the day
after school opened for the year. Amid uncertainty, Canedo also
closed schools Sept. 8, though the teachers reported for work.
Contempt charges related to the Sept. 7 walkout were dismissed on a
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   The union, as a corporation, also has pleaded guilty in the
Sept. 14 strike and will be sentenced in November. Risman said the
law includes no limits on potential fines.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress on Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Noting that more than 2 million previously
uninsured children now have health coverage, President Clinton
appealed for Congress to expand that coverage to their parents.
''We can afford this now,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded in the White House Rose Garden by dozens of
youngsters in colorful T-shirts, Clinton said 2.5 million children
have been enrolled in the state-based Children's Health Insurance
Program. He announced $700,000 in grants to help states locate and
enroll more eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every child in this country ... who is eligible for CHIP ought
to be in it. The parents who need it ought to be able to buy into
the program,'' Clinton said. ''We have the money to keep America's
economy going, to get the country out of debt, and to provide more
health insurance to families. We ought to do it, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited new census data released Thursday that showed a
decline in the number of uninsured Americans for the first time
since 1987, when the Census Bureau began compiling the data. The
number of uninsured children fell by 1.5 percentage points, a drop
attributed in part to CHIP, created by Congress three years ago to
help poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that the parents of children covered under CHIP
also should be able to purchase coverage at a reduced price,
because many of them cannot afford to pay for health insurance
through their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do this, we could cover a quarter of all the uninsured
children and families in America -- and, I might add, those that are
most at risk and need the health insurance most,'' Clinton said.
''There are only two ways that you can provide health insurance for
working people on modest incomes. There either has to be some sort
of subsidy from the government, or the employers have to provide
it, or you have to have a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also appealed for states to bolster their efforts to
recruit children for the CHIP program. He said certain states, such
as Indiana, Ohio and Maine, have done an admirable job of locating
eligible families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope others will look to them for leadership,'' Clinton
said. ''This is a simple matter of systematic effort and real
dedication.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 47; Nasdaq Sheds 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues again pulled the market lower
Friday after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety
about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's bad news, released late Thursday, came on the heels of
one of Wall Street's best sessions since early summer. It drove
down a market that has struggled to stay in positive territory this
month, as many investors took profits on technology stocks and
moved their money into blue chips or out of the market
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
47.29 at 10,776.77, after dipping nearly 130 points earlier in the
day. On Thursday, the average gained nearly 196 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower after rebounding Thursday.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 64.88 to 3,713.44, and the Standard
and Poor's 500 index dropped 7.69 to 1,450.60.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a free-falling, down bear market because the
fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
''But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple
warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has been down for most of September on anxiety over
third-quarter profits, higher energy prices and the weak European
currency. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that
warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout
the markets, but especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning
upward on technology and blue chips issues. But Apple's warning,
which was issued after the markets closed, threatened to undo those
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker was down $26.06 at $27.44, a 51 percent loss,
in early trading, a day after investors had bid the stock up 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks were lower as well. Gateway fell $9.29
to $46.75. Hewlett Packard was off $9.19 and $96.94. Lucent slipped
$1.06 to $30.69. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.44 to $42, after
edging up slightly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A negative earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down
$2.38 to $41.63. But many old-economy companies appeared less
affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble was up 38 cents at $67.38, retaining gains made
Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart
moved up 19 cents to $6.06.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical company DuPont, which got dumped by many investors
earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, was
higher, trading up $2 at $41.75.
</P>
<P>
   Many energy issues were also in positive territory. Halliburton
advanced $1.29 to $49.94. Schlumberger was up $1.54 at $82.94.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 659.22 million shares, well behind
the 787.38 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 1.51 at 522.30.

<HEADLINE> Writer Morrison: No Magic Involved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Toni Morrison says she doesn't
believe in a magic formula for successful writing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is (none), or we would have bottled it and every book
would be a bestseller or very, very good,'' she told a crowd at
Purdue University on Thursday. ''Creative people know instantly, or
at least very quickly, what is best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for ''Beloved,'' the
story of an escaped slave who tries to kill her children rather
than have them returned to bondage. She also won the Nobel Prize
for literature in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said she often begins a book not knowing what the
beginning will be, but she always has an end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writers seem to like chaos in their lives,'' she said. ''They
were created to have this place in the center that is peaceful,
though they create chaos in their writing.''

<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jerry Springer still has a hankering for
politics, but acknowledges that his fight-filled television talk
show might cost him votes if he runs for office again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jerry Springer Show'' may have permanently tainted him in
the eyes of some voters, Springer said after a speech Thursday at
the Ohio AFL-CIO's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people focus on the show, the answer is no. If they focused
on issues, then maybe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cincinnati mayor and 1982 candidate for the governor
has said he might give politics another try. He said he'll consider
running for public office in 2002 -- if the timing seems right.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say what office he might seek but said it probably
would be a federal post because he's interested in national issues.
</P>
<P>
   Springer has often been criticized for the violent content of
his TV show, including fistfights and chair throwing.

<HEADLINE> Work Stoppage Protests Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Darkening movie houses and blocking
roads, tens of thousands of Yugoslavs from cinema owners to cabbies
heeded opposition calls Friday for nationwide strikes aimed at
forcing President Slobodan Milosevic to accept election defeat and
step down.
</P>
<P>
   Even as opposition leaders explained the campaign to about
25,000 supporters in Belgrade's main square, students rallied in
the country's south, shopkeepers shuttered their doors in the east
and television workers cut off transmissions in the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cease your work, come out and stay on the streets, so that
this country will find its path to future,'' opposition leader
Zoran Djindjic told the Belgrade crowd. ''Serbia must stop for us
to unload Milosevic out of a seat he no longer has a right to.''
Serbia and the smaller Montenegro make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition called the protests to pressure Milosevic to
admit that challenger Vojislav Kostunica won Sunday's election.
Milosevic admits he finished second, but his government says no
candidate won a majority so an Oct. 8 runoff is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The actors guild declared a strike, and most theater and cinema
owners said they would shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Belgrade, thousands of high school students shunned
classes in Nis, Serbia's third largest city, and spilled into the
streets -- some jumping out of first floor classroom windows in
their haste to attend the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Waving anti-Milosevic banners, they chanted: ''Save Serbia and
kill yourself, Slobodan,'' while taxi drivers blockaded adjoining
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know why you are not in school today,'' Mayor Zoran Zivkovic
told the students in Nis. ''You refuse to accept injustice!''
</P>
<P>
   Walkouts -- joined by shopkeepers and company employees -- were
staged in a dozen other cities and towns, including the opposition
strongholds of Cacak and Kragujevac.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Valjevo was completely blocked and thousands protested
in Kraljevo. In Novi Sad, state television employees stopped work.
</P>
<P>
   A main highway in western Serbia was blocked for one hour by
some 60 cabbies as a ''warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Serbia's opposition lodged an official complaint
with the Federal Election Commission, providing their own tally
that showed Kostunica beat Milosevic 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent
in Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission fails to respond to their complaint, the
opposition plans to press the case in the country's constitutional
court.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition said it would dispatch delegations to army
headquarters, the Interior Ministry and Serbian state television
with documents proving their election victory.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of the commission, Nebojsa Bakarac, told
reporters that Milosevic had falsified more than a hundred thousand
votes from polling places that never opened in Albanian-populated
towns in Kosovo and that there was proof of ballots ''cast'' by
dead voters.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica urged an independent recount of the ballots, appealing
''especially to neighboring Greece'' to help ease tensions caused
by the differing election figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is more than necessary to count the votes again and examine
the entire balloting material,'' Kostunica said in a letter made
available to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, a NATO member with close cultural and religious ties to
Serbia, has suggested the opposition consider the possibility of
taking part in the runoff if international election observers are
allowed. Bakarac -- the commission's opposition member -- rejected
Greece's initiative, saying the opposition would not bargain with
Milosevic on a runoff: ''The truth is the truth and it's not
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has praised the growing
anti-Milosevic movement, and noted, without giving specifics, that
American forces were ''prepared for contingencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign leaders, including President Clinton, have promised
to lift sanctions if Kostunica's victory is respected.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia on Friday added its voice to nations recognizing
Kostunica's victory, calling it a ''vote for democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Longtime agency boss denies federal charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Mattie L. Brown says she has put her heart
and soul into building the Utica Head Start program into something
special.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never taken anything from Head Start,'' said Brown, the
agency's executive director and a longtime community leader.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal grand jury accused the 58-year-old Brown
and her daughter, Deborah A. Brown, Utica Head Start's former
fiscal director, of defrauding the government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim Deborah Brown received $151,940 in
unauthorized severance payments and Mattie Brown helped conceal the
illegal transaction from local board members and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation has been proceeding for a year and we have
finally assembled a case we can be comfortable with,'' said
prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew T. Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Brown told The Utica Observer-Dispatch that the charges
stem from a personal vendetta by a health and human services
department employee and by former board members of Utica Head
Start.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Mattie Brown said she helped build
Utica Head Start from a tiny agency into a $2.5 million enterprise
that operates 12 centers and serves 390 preschoolers throughout the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, she even put some of her personal money into the
effort, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of folks have been hurt by this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, after an investigation began into the
severance payments, Brown and Utica Head Start were stripped of
control and funding of the early childhood education programs.
</P>
<P>
   A Troy-based group has operated the program since that time
while Brown and a skeleton staff have been awaiting a Health and
Human Services appeals board decision on whether to restore
funding. A negative response probably would spell the end of the
nonprofit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Health and Human Services officials first clashed in
April 1999 when the department notified the Browns that the family
relationship between the executive director and the chief financial
officer was a conflict of interest that violated the rules and
regulations of the federally funded program.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Brown said the government was aware of the fact her
daughter worked at Utica Head Start for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was no secret,'' said Deborah Brown's attorney, Frank
Policelli. ''Everybody knew that Deborah was her daughter. They
allege the facts that are convenient for them and they omit facts
that put it in a completely different light. The Browns didn't do
anything wrong at all.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the Browns conspired to defraud
Health and Human Services by ''trickery, deceit, concealment,
misrepresentation and fraud.'' Investigators also said that after
the board found out and voided the separation agreement, Deborah
Brown was reactivated on the Head Start payroll and fraudulently
received a salary for six more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Brown, 43, of Liverpool, also was indicted on a charge
that she fraudulently obtained a mortgage by claiming she was
employed by Utica Head Start even though her employment had ended.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mattie Brown faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
and fines up to $500,000. A possible 20-year sentence and fines up
to $750,000 await the younger Brown if she's convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the charges, the Browns have their supporters, including
David Mathis, a former president of the Utica Head Start board of
directors whose six-year term ended in June 1999, and longtime and
current board member Carol Crooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always found her to be one of the best people I knew,''
Crooms said. ''I still do. I still have a lot of respect for her
and what she has done with the program.''

<HEADLINE> First hard frost diminishes risk for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The first frost in Connecticut means more
than just the return of windshield scrapers. State officials say
the coming of the cool weather equals reduced activity among
mosquitoes that may be carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good, hard frost will kill off many mosquitoes and greatly
diminish the risk of mosquito bites,'' said state Entomologist
Louis Magnarelli, who's based at the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures dipped into the high 20s and low 30s early Friday
and isolated frost appeared around the state, said Tom Fair, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass.
The low of 30 degrees at Bradley International Airport tied the
record set in 1957, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a frost, Magnarelli said, the risk is diminished
this time of year because mosquitoes usually don't fly and feed at
night when it's below 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler weather also forces some mosquitoes into hibernation,
during which they don't feed on blood - reducing the risk for virus
transmission, said Chief Medical Entomologist Theodore Andreadis,
head of the state agricultural station's mosquito testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend temperatures are expected to be in the 60s and 70s,
Magnarelli said, and mosquitoes in areas with less severe frost can
survive then re-emerge when the thermometer rises.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to late August and early September, he said, the
risk is ''a lot lower now.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 129,877 mosquitoes and 413 birds in Connecticut
have tested positive for West Nile virus, said Department of
Environmental Protection officials.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes, which
acquire it by feeding on infected birds. Generally the virus causes
flulike symptoms or no problems at all, but it can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and anyone with a weakened immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been reported in Connecticut this year.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials said Wednesday a resident infected with the
West Nile virus had died. Seven people in New York died of the
virus last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk is getting so low, it doesn't require spraying,''
said DEP spokeswoman Michele Sullivan. ''We are certainly past any
point of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in Stamford and Greenwich plan to go
door-to-door next month, asking residents for blood samples to test
for the West Nile virus. The voluntary testing, which is scheduled
to start Oct. 10, will determine how many area residents have been
infected.
</P>
<P>
   A pool of human-biting mosquitoes and one pool of bird-biting
mosquitoes were collected from Stamford on Sept. 20. Both pools
recently tested positive for the potentially fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
   The blood tests can help predict the risk of infections in
future years, said Anthony Iton, Stamford's director of health and
social services.
</P>
<P>
   Iton also urged area residents to take part in the risk
assessment study that will be conducted next month by the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with assistance from the
state Department of Health and local health departments.

<HEADLINE> Pataki signs bill creating barn preservation program  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Old barns, though no longer practical for
modern farming purposes, should be preserved as monuments to the
state's agricultural heritage, Gov. George Pataki said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor signed a bill into law creating the New York State
Barns Restoration and Preservation Program to help pay for the
renovations of barns and other aging farm buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million program will help pay for 80 percent of the cost
of repairs, up to $25,000 per project, to the roofs, foundations,
walls and sills of farm structures. Owners must pay the other 20
percent in cash or labor.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings must be at least 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the best scenery in New York state features historic
farm buildings that remind us of our heritage,'' Pataki, who grew
up on a farm in Peekskill, said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, R-Onondaga, sponsored the
legislation in her chamber. She said old farm buildings are
''symbols of cultural lifestyles of earlier generations'' in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the structures are like ''cathedrals,'' Hoffmann said,
built meticulously by craftsmen in eras before power tools.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced his signing of the measure during an appearance
Friday at the Aken family farm in Rome, about 60 miles west of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
will administer the program. Pataki's office said priority will be
given to certain projects when making grants - that structures are
being improved for active agricultural use; are visible from scenic
highways or are fixtures in rural landscapes; or are on or eligible
for state and national registers of historic places.
</P>
<P>
   The older the buildings are, the better their chances at
qualifying for the program, Pataki's office said.
</P>
<P>
   One-time farm buildings being converted for non-agricultural
purposes will not be eligible under the Barns Restoration and
Preservation Program.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed projects will also be reviewed by the state
Department of Agriculture and Markets before being approved.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for the program will be available starting Oct. 15
at regional state parks offices around the state. More information
is available at Albany headquarters of the parks office
518-486-1868 or at the agency's website at www.nyparks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Applications must be received by the state by Dec. 15, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Statesman Chats Online  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's outspoken elder
statesman, gave his first online chat Friday, musing over the
Internet on everything from God to bigamy to whether the government
has the people's well-being at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest question came from an online chatter who referred
to an opposition-controlled district with aging buildings and asked
Lee if the government works for supporters of the ruling People's
Action Party or ''Singaporeans as a whole?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the 77-year-old former prime minister who still wields
great power in the Southeast Asian city state, responded: ''The
government works for the people of Singapore. But any government
has to ensure that its support is firm or it will cease to be the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee has ruled Singapore with a tight grip since the 1960s,
winning praise for turning an impoverished, malaria-ridden tropical
island into one of the world's most prosperous countries.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little room for dissent in Lee's Singapore.
The country has some of the world's strictest laws, including a ban
on the sale of chewing gum and tough fines for spitting on the
sidewalk or tossing a cigarette butt. There's a long list of
outlawed books, magazines and popular songs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Singapore has recently begun taking small steps toward
freer speech -- including Friday's Internet chat and the recent
opening of a ''Speakers' Corner'' in a public park.
</P>
<P>
   During the one-hour chat, Lee stressed the need for Singapore to
remain competitive in the global marketplace, and said his party
''has been successful because we have never allowed ourselves to
rest on our laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is constantly changing. What succeeded last year may
not next year,'' he said, adding that current high oil prices might
hurt Singapore's exports by stunting growth in the United States,
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who retains the title of senior minister, offered a rare
glimpse into his views on religion -- a sensitive topic in
religiously and racially diverse Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The makeup of the human mind requires a belief in some
powerful and unexplained superior force,'' he said. ''Those who
have faith in their religion can face adversity and death with
greater equanimity.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an Internet user asked Lee if he thought bigamy
could solve the problem of Singapore's low population of fewer than
4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' said Lee, a Cambridge-educated lawyer. ''It will help
solve the problem but it will cause a tremendous row with women's
lib. It is not on. Nobody wants to be a secondary wife.''
</P>
<P>
   During a lull between questions, a chatter complained that
''these are questions that have only one answer ... the politically
correct one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, politically correct means toeing the official
line, but many of Lee's remarks would have been considered anything
but politically correct elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about adoption, he said: ''I would not
adopt a baby unless I know who his parents are. Otherwise it is
more risky than buying a lottery ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the most important thing in his life right now is
''keeping healthy and vigorous so that my experience accumulated
over 77 years can still be of use.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am doing better than most people of my age,'' he added. ''I
count my blessings.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Funding Yugoslavian Reformers  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The United States funneled $35 million
to opponents of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in little
more than a year as part of efforts to weaken him that culminated
in his apparent electoral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The money was part of a long-term Western effort to strengthen
anti-Milosevic forces over the past decade. The European Union has
spent close to $140 million since 1991 on projects as diverse as
providing energy last winter to opposition-run cities in the main
Yugoslav republic Serbia, to paying for benches and other equipment
for schools there.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats in the region say much of the American money was
spent on computers for human rights groups, transmitters for
independent B2-92 radio and other non-governmental radio stations
and other basics for student organizations and labor unions, such
as fax machines and telephones. The funds even paid for a rock band
that played at events to mobilize voters ahead of the Sept. 24
elections.
</P>
<P>
   None of several senior U.S. diplomats interviewed was willing to
be named, citing orders from Washington not to be quoted on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the low profile, the office set up by the State
Department to coordinate U.S. aid to pro-democracy groups in Serbia
is housed in a nondescript building in downtown Budapest, with no
sign to indicate its presence.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats declined to identify particular recipients or
projects, suggesting specifics would only help Milosevic's attempt
to label the opposition as pro-Western lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   But they did say that Vojislav Kostunica, the apparent winner of
the presidential election, never received any American money.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had no desire to have contact with us, and we respected
that,'' said a State Department official in Washington, also
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has played up his lack of dependency on the West,
important in a country where ill-feeling toward NATO and the United
States remains high after last year's NATO bombing forced a Kosovo
settlement unfavorable to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some of the U.S. money paid for voter surveys
conducted by the same American company that runs polls for
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Americans not welcome in Serbia, some money went to
pro-democracy groups in other countries which in turn trained
organizations in Serbia in election monitoring and promoting
awareness of voters' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Slovak groups which helped defeat Slovakia's
authoritarian prime minister, Vladimir Meciar, in 1998. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with them in March and
urged them to use their experience to help kindred movements
elsewhere in former communist eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   European Union aid over the past two years has included about $6
million to support independent media, nearly $4 million to help
schools in cities run by the democratic opposition and $36 million
for last winter's deliveries of fuel to 12 opposition-run cities.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the European Union last summer drew up a list of
Serbian companies exempted from EU sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the diplomats described the American contribution as a
fairly modest sum, comparing it to the $40 million the Americans
earmarked for democracy-building in much smaller Albania over a
12-month period in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   More money appears to be on the way. The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a bill Monday authorizing $60 million for
further pro-democracy activities in Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic and Milosevic's power base.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government has accused the West of covert
interference in the electoral process, a charge the Americans deny.
They say there is no secrecy about the kind of aid that has flowed
since the end of NATO bombing to groups promoting democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And while U.S. officials acknowledge that Hungary and other
countries close to Serbia have been used as meeting points between
U.S. officials and aid recipients, the diplomats scoff at
suggestions of wads of cash surreptitiously trading hands.
</P>
<P>
   They insist the money goes into foreign bank accounts set up by
Serbian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The amount and kind of help being given to human rights and
opposition groups is not much different from what went to Serbia's
neighbor, Croatia, under Franjo Tudjman, the authoritarian
president who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Croatia, with about 4.6 million people compared to
Serbia's more than 10 million, is receiving approximately $30
million in U.S. aid to help bolster democratization, diplomats
said.

<HEADLINE> Prince William Slams Diana Expose  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince William shed his schoolboy shyness and
faced the press as an adult on Friday, revealing his plans and
making clear his disapproval of a new book about Princess Diana by
her most senior aide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, Harry and I are both quite upset about it -- that
our mother's trust has been betrayed and even now she is still
being exploited,'' the 18-year-old William said at his first
substantial question-and-answer session with the press.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters he didn't want to say any more about the book
by Patrick Jephson, Diana's former private secretary, which depicts
the late princess as manipulative, emotionally disturbed and
occasionally cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II have deplored the book's
violation of confidentiality, warning that it would upset William
and his 16-year-old brother Prince Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Jephson told Press Association, the national news agency, on
Friday that he respected Prince William's comments and understood
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure that when the whole book is read it will eventually
be seen to be truthful and sympathetic to the memory of the late
princess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that William disapproves of the book, but the
fact that he would answer the question at all is a significant
step.
</P>
<P>
   He has never concealed his dislike of the press, and after his
mother died in a 1997 car crash, pursued by photographers, he
sometimes seemed almost to recoil in their presence.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, with his father Prince Charles nearby cracking an
occasional joke in the familiar gardens of their Highgrove country
estate, William seemed confident and forthright.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked reporters for leaving him alone while he was at Eton,
the private school his brother still attends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a bit anxious about how it was going to turn out,'' he
said. ''But, thanks to everyone, it really has been brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole of Eton made a big difference, with everyone not
trying to snap a picture every time I was walking down the
street,'' he said. ''And I hope this continues for Harry as well
while he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   William, who is taking a year off to work and travel before
starting his studies at St. Andrew's University in Scotland, has
already been on a survival course in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   He was on exercises with a British army regiment, ''in the
jungle, training with them and seeing what they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From Belize he went to the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues,
part of Mauritius, with the Royal Geographical Society for an
environmental research project.
</P>
<P>
   He studied marine conservation, ''learning how to sustain the
reefs and the whole management of the sea around the fishing
industry,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He next goes to Chile with an international expedition in remote
parts of Patagonia where he will work with 110 other young
volunteers on environmental and community projects.
</P>
<P>
   William said he had raised $8,000 for the trip himself and has
also raised money to finance a boy from a less-privileged
background.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know him yet but I'll get to meet him while I'm out
there,'' he said. ''I organized a water polo match and got sponors
-- basically did it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted ''to do something constructive'' with his year
off after school. ''I thought this was a way of trying to help
people out and meeting a whole range of people from other
countries, and at the same time helping people in remote areas of
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session, the two princes turned and walked
away from the cameras -- one tall, blond and denim-clad now towering
over his neatly suited, slightly balding father.

<HEADLINE> Five months later, stranded barge is dislodged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Mother Nature and a high-powered tugboat
helped save a star-crossed house mover from jail Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than five months after it was pushed up onto a sod bank
during a storm, a barge carrying a house was dislodged about 11
a.m. by a 100-foot tugboat powered by three diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the house, Bryan Gallagher, 38, of Little Egg
Harbor Township, then anchored the barge in a nearby channel to
make preparations for the vessel's 40-mile trip north to Barnegat
Township.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, a professional house mover, bought the five-bedroom,
three-bathroom contemporary from its Longport owner for $1 last
year. Then he loaded it onto a barge, intending to move it to a
vacant bayfront parcel he owns in Barnegat Township.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 125-ton barge broke loose from its moorings during
a storm and ended up marooned on the grassy island in Great Egg
Harbor Bay, where it sat all summer.
</P>
<P>
   State police cited Gallagher for the abandoned vessel, and he
was fined $4,620 by a judge who ordered him to move it by Oct. 14
or face jail.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the barge Friday didn't solve all of his
problems, though. He still needs zoning permits from Barnegat
Township officials to put the house down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm relieved, but that's only part of the whole situation,''
Gallagher said Friday. ''We still have to get it up to Barnegat and
set it up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said high water in the bay caused by a new moon had helped
free the barge.
</P>
<P>
   The barge will remain anchored in a channel while Gallagher
waits for calmer weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a day with no wind,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cold snap sets records across state  </HEADLINE>
With AP Photo NYSCH-101
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Homeowners draped tarps and sheets over
plants and fruit and vegetable growers hauled in as much crop as
they could as record cold swept the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across the state, record low temperatures fell as much
of New York shivered through the coldest Sept. 29 ever.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, the low - just before 6 a.m. - reached 33 degrees,
breaking the mark of 36 degrees most recently hit in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse, the low temperature of 30 - at 7:15 a.m. - exceeded
the previous mark of 33 set in 1941. It was also the fifth coldest
day ever in September. Syracuse hit 25 degrees on Sept. 28, 1947,
the coldest day in September ever there.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Massena, a low of 27 degrees flirted with the
old record of 26 set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And in Albany, 1978's record low of 30 fell by one degree Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large area of high pressure in Canada settled over the
region with clear skies and calm winds, all the ingredients which
allowed the heat to radiate into space,'' said Carl Cerniglia of
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   At Devoe's Rainbow Orchards in Clifton Park, just north of
Albany, Vaughn DeVoe spent Thursday picking fruit, looking to clear
the fields of vegetables before the hard frost.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're bringing in everything we can,'' he said. ''Everything
is running late this year. If it freezes hard, it's done. This will
be a killer frost, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerniglia said the weather will atone for the big chill by
warming up nicely over the next four days with clear skies and high
temperatures getting near 70 through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be a shot of Indian summer,'' he said. ''It will be a
good leaf-peeping weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   For October through December, Cerniglia said predictions are for
near-normal temperatures and precipitation.

<HEADLINE> Webber's New Musical A Mixed Bag  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- There's no denying that Andrew Lloyd Webber's new
musical, ''The Beautiful Game,'' has an abundance of heart. But the
bravery of its ambitions would be greatly improved if the Northern
Ireland-based show also had a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Those may sound like harsh words for a venture so self-evidently
on the side of the angels. After all, this is a musical that
advocates peace and love and finding a way out of the long-standing
Catholic-Protestant antipathies in the region. What audience member
wouldn't agree to that?
</P>
<P>
   How pleasing, too, to find a composer whose career has embraced
cats (in ''Cats''), trains (in ''Starlight Express'') and
monstrous, dethroned divas (in ''Sunset Boulevard'') writing, at
last, about people -- and soccer, which is blended throughout this
tale of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the emotional directness and vigor of director
Robert Carsen's extremely accomplished production, you can't help
feeling that its subject matter deserves far less simplistic a
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, few knew what to anticipate before the $4.3 million
show's Sept. 26 opening at the Cambridge Theater. After all, Lloyd
Webber's track record has been spotty lately -- his prior West End
entry, the 1998 ''Whistle Down the Wind,'' remains his most feeble
venture. And his book writer and lyricist on ''The Beautiful
Game,'' Ben Elton, was a newcomer to musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber has indeed expanded his collaborative base. The
musical's choreographer, Meryl Tankard, is an Australian darling of
the avant-garde. Both Carsen and his excellent designer, Michael
Levine, are Canadians drawn from the world of opera. And the show's
look has the minimal austerity that many contemporary opera
productions tend toward these days.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ''The Beautiful Game'' lies largely with Elton,
an English comic, novelist and playwright writing about an
Anglo-Irish problem that demands real subtlety, not merely a
sermon. It's as if he awoke one day and discovered that -- gee! --
violence and hatred are bad. As protest musicals go, ''The
Beautiful Game'' is naive and sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   The opening number makes for a promising start, the title song
displaying Lloyd Webber at his most convincingly anthemic. The
appealingly fresh-faced cast leap about the stage, their
physicality a mixture of a soccer player's moves and the
exhilarating abstraction of contemporary dance.
</P>
<P>
   But once the script kicks in, the promise fades.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more important things in life than football,''
remarks the socially aware Catholic Mary (Josie Walker) to John
(David Shannon), the gifted amateur player with whom she falls in
love and, in Act 2, weds.
</P>
<P>
   The writing rarely rises above such cliches -- except when
stooping to innuendo, much of it expressed through the imagery of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative is potentially gripping: The would-be innocent,
John, is corrupted by a struggle that sours him on life and love.
By the end, he's been sucked into the very violence he tried to
avoid -- the athleticism of soccer replaced by the man-to-man combat
of bigotry and hate.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that Northern Ireland's political situation
can't support Elton's rent-a-rhyme approach. A glance at some of
the song titles in the program (''I'd Rather Die on My Feet Than
Live on My Knees,'' ''If This Is What We're Fighting For'') tips
you off at the baldly presentational level of what is to follow.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, since much of the score finds its composer in a
pleasingly wistful and plaintive mode. His critics, however, will
resent the customary Lloyd Webber repetition, much in evidence
here.
</P>
<P>
   The cast -- most of them unknown (Frank Grimes playing the
inevitable role of Father O'Donnell, the local priest, is the
quasi-exception) -- are not just bright-eyed but talented, too.
</P>
<P>
   The two leads rescue the show from merely seeming to be a ''West
Side Story'' rewrite, with John's slide from star player to 1970s
internment camp inmate particularly well charted.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shaeffer has a scary intensity as Thomas, the show's
incipient revolutionary -- a Belfast boy addicted to the very
conflict that ''The Beautiful Game'' wants to see ended.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, even if you doubt a stage show's ability to
accomplish in 2&AMP;frac12; hours what more than three decades of political
negotiation have yet to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ''The Beautiful Game'' isn't really a show;
it's a thinly disguised homily.

<HEADLINE> Incorrect Cancer Treatments Rising  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The proportion of women with early-stage breast
cancer receiving incorrect treatment in the United States has
nearly doubled in the 1990s, increasing from 12 percent in 1989 to
22 percent by 1995, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is the growing popularity of lumpectomy, where
doctors cut out only the cancerous part of the breast instead of
removing the whole breast, and the failure of some doctors to carry
out important follow-up treatments, said the study, published this
week in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   It estimated that about 22,000 American women each year may be
receiving substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   Two treatment options are considered appropriate when breast
cancer has not spread to other areas. The first is a mastectomy --
the removal of the breast -- together with a dissection of the lymph
nodes in the armpit to ensure they are cancer free.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a lumpectomy, along with the lymph node check and
radiation treatment of the area. Although it allows women to keep
their breasts and can be as effective at eliminating cancer if done
right, lumpectomy is a more complicated treatment than mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem noted by researchers from the Medical College of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee was that some doctors skipped the radiation
or lymph node inspection, or both, when they performed
lumpectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ian Fentiman, a professor of oncology at Guy's Hospital in
London, said a similar trend of substandard lumpectomies was seen
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mortality rate from breast cancer is falling as a result
of earlier diagnosis and better treatment and it is very important
that this success is now not compromised by inadequate treatment,''
said Fentiman, who was not connected with the research.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the scientists examined the medical records of
144,759 women aged 30 and older who had surgery in the United
States for early-stage breast cancer between 1983 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, experts agreed at a National Institutes of Health
consensus conference that lumpectomy is the preferable approach and
set out the recommended procedures for both options. Since then,
lumpectomy has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the proportion of women getting
substandard lumpectomy treatment increased from 10 percent in 1989
to 19 percent at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proportion of women whose mastectomy treatment
was performed incorrectly remained steady at 2.7 percent during the
time of the study, which means the decline was connected to
lumpectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion of women getting the correct treatment
declined from 88 percent in 1989 to 78 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that the problem is not that doctors are
getting more lax when performing lumpectomies, but that more women
overall were getting lumpectomies instead of mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   While about 15 percent of women got lumpectomies in 1983, about
half were getting that treatment by 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors or patients might disagree with the recommended
methods, so it is not surprising that some women are not getting
the standard treatment, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is surprising, however, is that the proportion of the
population meeting the standard declined in the years immediately
after'' the 1990 NIH recommendations on standards for treatment,
the study said.

<HEADLINE> Legal expert questions credibility of survey by rabbi's lawyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A survey of Camden County residents by
lawyers for a Cherry Hill rabbi accused of having his wife killed
lacks credibility, a legal expert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zucker and Dennis Wixted, lawyers for Rabbi Fred J.
Neulander, want the rabbi's murder trial moved out of Camden
County. They maintain the rabbi cannot get a fair trial in the
county because of widespread publicity. They also say many
residents believe Neulander is guilty of arranging to have his
wife, Carol, killed on Nov. 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed Thursday supporting their request to have the
trial moved or heard by jurors from outside Camden County, they
cited an informal telephone survey conducted by Zucker.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he made random telephone calls over three weekends
in July and found that 88 percent of 163 respondents had heard of
the case; 85 percent believed Neulander is guilty. Eighty percent
of those surveyed said they would not be able to disregard what
they had heard or read about the case and base a verdict on
evidence at a trial, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Askin, a professor at Rutgers Law School in Newark, where
he founded the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Center, said the
survey lacks credibility because the lawyer made the calls himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had an independent polling outfit do it, I think that
would carry weight,'' Askin said. ''A self-fulfilling survey by the
defense team is much less likely to be accorded much weight by the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Askin said it would have been very expensive to hire a polling
firm but it would have been more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''The credibility would be multiplied so many times it's not
even comparable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he thinks the results would have been the same if
the poll were conducted by an independent party. He also defended
the poll's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that one of the attorneys for the defendant does the
poll should have no effect on the weight the judge gives, in terms
of whether or not she believes the results of the poll are valid or
not,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said they didn't hire a polling firm because, as Askin said,
it would have been expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess in a perfect world it would be great if money were no
question to hire the best person in the world to do it,'' he said,
adding that Neulander doesn't have ''an unlimited sources of
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander could face the death penalty if convicted. No date has
been set for his trial.
</P>
<P>
   State Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig is scheduled to
hear arguments Nov. 9 on the request to move the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two men have pleaded guilty to carrying out the killing and have
agreed to testify against the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Leonard Jenoff, has said Neulander agreed to pay
him $30,000 to kill his wife. But he told a different story to
fellow inmates at the Salem County Jail, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   Two inmates said Jenoff told them he killed Carol Neulander to
get back at the rabbi for not being friendlier to him, the
Courier-Post of Cherry Hill reported. The prisoners said Jenoff
later pinned the crime on the rabbi, acting again out of anger that
the rabbi was not a better friend.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers said they might use the inmates' statements
in an effort to win bail for the rabbi, who is being held in Camden
County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the state's star witness now saying the defendant had
nothing to do with it and he framed him,'' said Zucker.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenoff's attorney, Francis J. Hartman, dismissed the inmates
as ''jailhouse snitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Uniformly defined, their testimony is motivated by some base
purpose,'' Hartman said. ''The story should always be taken with a
grain of salt.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 106; Nasdaq Falls 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues again pulled the market lower
Friday after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety
about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's bad news, released late Thursday, came on the heels of
one of Wall Street's best sessions since early summer, and drove
down a market that has struggled to stay in positive territory this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
105.74 at 10,718.32, cutting significantly into its nearly 196
point gain the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower after rebounding Thursday.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 89.19 to 3,689.13, and the Standard
and Poor's 500 index dropped 11.72 to 1,446.57.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the
fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
''But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple
warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has been down for most of September on anxiety over
third-quarter profits, higher energy prices and the weak European
currency. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that
warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout
the markets, but especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning
upward on technology and blue chips issues. But Apple's warning,
which was issued after the markets closed, undid those gains.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker was down $27.88 at $25.63, a 52 percent loss,
a day after investors bid the stock up 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.46 to $46.58.
Hewlett Packard was off $9.88 at $96.25. Lucent slipped $1.31 to
$30.44. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.63 to $41.81.
</P>
<P>
   A negative earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down
$2.69 to $41.31. But many old-economy companies appeared less
affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble was up 6 cents at $67.06, retaining gains made
Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart
moved up 19 cents to $6.06.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $7.67 to $64.38 on rumors it
might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The
company declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this
month after issuing its own profit warning, was higher, trading up
$1.88 at $41.63.
</P>
<P>
   Many energy issues were also in positive territory. Halliburton
advanced $1.04 to $49.69. Schlumberger was up $1.42 at $82.81.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing
Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 percent last month in addition to a
0.3 percent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6
percent in both July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 786.10 million shares, well behind
the 932.46 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 2.10 at 521.71.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Turkish Book May Be Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A court on Friday acquitted a Turkish
journalist charged with insulting the military in her banned book
on the Kurdish rebel war.
</P>
<P>
   The case was seen as a test of Turkey's intentions to improve
its poor human rights record. Representatives of international
human rights organizations hailed the verdict as a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good day for Turkey's journalists, a good day for
Turkey,'' said Kati Marton of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists, who attended the court session Friday. ''It is
a step toward Turkey's democratization that is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadire Mater faced up to 12 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the prosecutor appeals the verdict, the ban on ''Mehmet's
Book,'' which recounts the horrors and frustrations of recruits
fighting Kurdish rebels, will be lifted in seven days.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Mater urged Turkish authorities to repeal
laws curbing the freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not solve Turkey's problem regarding freedom of
expression because the laws still exist,'' Mater said of her
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Her publisher was also acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is trying to join the European Union and it has pledged
to abolish numerous laws used to jail journalists and activists.
James Ron of Human Rights Watch said the judge had chosen to
''uphold Turkey's international commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mehmet's Book'' hit a raw nerve because it was a rare case of
soldiers publicly criticizing the war. Mehmet is a nickname for
Turkish recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Mater called the charges an attempt to silence the truth about
Turkey's 16-year war against the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK,
which is fighting for autonomy in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I demand my acquittal for the right of people to be informed
and for the freedom of expression,'' she had told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities restrict coverage of the war, which has killed
37,000 people. Dozens of journalists and intellectuals have been
jailed for crimes such as calling for a peaceful solution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Mater's case attracted many of Turkey's leading human rights and
press freedom activists, including Akin Birdal, who was jailed for
10 months after giving a speech calling for an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mater's case ''put freedom of thought and press on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said in a statement that the verdict was
''a step forward for freedom of expression,'' but that Mater
shouldn't have been tried in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also said it would continue to urge Turkey to
lift restrictions on freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mehmet's War'' was published in April 1999 and more than
14,000 copies were sold before it was banned and confiscated two
months later. The publisher, Semih Sokmen, said he will issue a new
edition if the ban is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Mater is the correspondent of the Inter Press Service and works
with the Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders.

<HEADLINE> Senate Struggles With Trade Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a World Trade Organization deadline
looming Sunday, Congress is still struggling to pass legislation to
replace an export tax break for U.S. companies that was
successfully challenged by the European Union as an illegal trade
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO set the deadline to give the United States time to
replace its Foreign Sales Corporation program before the 13-nation
EU could impose retaliatory tariffs or sanctions. U.S. officials
say the Europeans are preparing a list of sanctions that could cost
$4 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials expect the Europeans to delay any immediate
retaliation despite the expiration of Sunday's deadline, since the
United States is working toward a solution. But a trade war is
possible if Congress fails to act before adjourning for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passage of this legislation is the only way to meet our
obligations in the WTO and avoid an unprecedented confrontation
with the European Union,'' said Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart
Eizenstat this week. ''We are very hopeful that it will be passed
and signed into law very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite White House pressure -- and an overwhelming favorable
vote in the House-- Senate Democrats blocked attempts this week by
Republican leaders to bring the bill up for debate. The dispute
centers on Republican efforts to limit amendments and Democratic
insistence on their rights to offer them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, senators want to change the legislation, which
would set up a replacement system of trade tax breaks on foreign
sales for about 6,000 U.S. corporations at a cost to taxpayers of
$4.5 billion over 10 years. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., is pushing
an amendment that would deny the tax benefit to pharmaceutical
companies that sell drugs in the United States at vastly higher
costs than overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we want to provide a tax subsidy to an industry which is
gouging the American public?'' Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators want to deny tobacco companies the benefits,
arguing that the government should not provide tax perks while
waging a war against smoking. A similar effort failed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Still others want to attach completely unrelated measures,
mainly because there have been few chances in the Senate to do so.
For example, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., wants a vote on a
campaign finance reform amendment on the trade tax bill, while Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has threatened try to attach language
raising the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage on several pieces of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., expressed
frustration at the blocking tactics after he tried to bring the tax
measure to the floor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the amendments on the list I saw were the usual
suspects that have now been offered that do not relate to the
bill,'' Lott said. ''This is something we need to do, and I hope we
can get it cleared up in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4986.

<HEADLINE> Camden officials want judge to determine how much power state has over city </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Camden officials want a state appeals judge
to determine how much power the state has over the city in its
supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
   The city administration and City Council also have filed for an
injunction against the state Local Finance Board's appointment of a
new business administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the state, under the state supervision act, has
been controlling the finances in the state's poorest city. The
Local Finance Board, saying its role includes hiring and firing,
named Norton N. Bonaparte Jr. as the city's business administrator.
Bonaparte, replacing the retiring business administrator, is to
begin his job Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many city officials say the state has overstepped its authority.
Last week, the City Council voted against supporting Bonaparte for
the job, instead backing Mayor Milton Milan's choice. They filed
for an injunction against the appointment in the Appellate Division
of state Superior Court in Trenton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Gilbert Wilson said the action is ''about the power
of the city and the sovereignty of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Miranda, spokesman for the state Department of Community
Affairs, said, by their actions, city officials aren't serving the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does nothing to take positive steps forward to do what we
all agree needs to be done in Camden. It simply blocks progress,''
Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan released a statement saying he wants to help
municipalities throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''My strong stance is intended to preserve the power of future
mayors and mayors across the state of New Jersey in any evil
attempt from the state to strip away the power of the people and
the legitimacy of the local officials and the residents of Camden
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a Superior Court judge can take up the matter, Camden
officials were required to appeal the appointment to the Local
Finance Board. They did so Friday, and the board voted to reaffirm
Bonaparte's appointment, Miranda said. Five members voted to
support the appointment, and two abstained.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Will Get Missiles If Attacked  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. missile sale to Taiwan includes a
highly unusual condition: that they will not be turned over to the
island democracy unless China threatens an attack, a senior U.S.
defense official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is designed to meet a U.S. arms export pledge
not to introduce new offensive military capabilities into Asia,
where tensions between Taiwan and China are a source of growing
U.S. concern.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese pilots will train with the missiles, designated the
AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, at
Air Force training ranges in the United States, the defense
official said, speaking on condition he not be identified. Their
F-16s will be updated with the weapon control software.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way for them to train up and be ready should the threat
occur,'' without provoking China into accelerating its pursuit of a
similar capability, the official said. China's air-to-air missiles
are far less advanced, although a Pentagon report to Congress this
summer said that later this decade China is likely to field a new
missile that would give its growing fleet of new-generation
fighters an AMRAAM-like capability.
</P>
<P>
   The AMRAAM, in use by U.S. aircraft since 1991 and built by
Raytheon Co., allows a fighter pilot to launch the weapon from
beyond visual range of his target. It also provides a greater
capability to attack low-altitude targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan arms deal comes at a particularly delicate moment in
U.S.-China relations, which were set back last year when the U.S.
Air Force bombed China's embassy in Yugoslavia. Just last week,
relations took an important step forward when the Senate approved
legislation to normalize trade relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China on Friday condemned the Taiwan deal and warned that
Washington would bear unspecified consequences for defying Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China, which regards Taiwan as part of the motherland, strongly
opposes U.S. arms sales to the island. Under the Taiwan Relations
Act, the United States is committed to providing Taiwan with
defensive arms.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 million deal for advanced air-to-air missiles seems
likely to complicate U.S.-China talks on missile proliferation
which resumed this summer after China broke all military contacts
with Washington following the embassy bombing. The United States
wants to constrain China's exports of missile-related technologies,
while Beijing insists that U.S. missile sales to Taiwan show
Washington uses a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert at the private
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Friday the
AMRAAM arrangement with Taiwan strikes a sensible balance between
Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Holding AMRAAM in reserve says that with little or no warning
the United States can give Taiwan air supremacy over the Taiwan
Straits,'' Cordesman said. Taiwan is barely 100 miles from the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual arrangement was not mentioned in a Pentagon
announcement late Thursday saying it planned to sell 200 AMRAAM
missiles to Taiwan as part of a $1.3 billion arms package. The
Pentagon said the sale would augment and improve Taiwan's air
defense capabilities without upsetting the regional military
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official who discussed the AMRAAM sale said it was
approved in response to China's efforts to improve its offensive
military capability aimed at Taiwan. He said U.S. officials believe
China is pursuing the purchase or development of its own air-to-air
missile with a beyond-visual-range capability, but the United
States insisted that Taiwan not take direct possession of AIM-120C
missiles for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to spur an arms race in the area,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the Pentagon announced that it was selling 100
AMRAAM missiles to Singapore. Those, too, will stay in the United
States and delivered to Singapore only in the event of a military
threat against it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AIM-120C air-to-air missiles, the Pentagon
also agreed to sell Taiwan 71 Harpoon anti-ship missiles for $240
million, a package of 155mm howitzers and other munitions for $405
million, and an advanced communications system for Taiwan's field
military forces for $513 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress can reject any Pentagon arms sale but it rarely
does so.

<HEADLINE> Rowland decries 'politics' in ouster of lottery chief  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The ousted chief of the state lottery was
the victim of political enemies in Kansas who did not want to see
him get the top job in Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Ziemak, the former head of the Kansas Lottery, withdrew
this week as the new president and chief executive of the
Connecticut Lottery Corp. following news reports about problems in
the Kansas agency.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems include a lottery employee accused of theft and
the release of a photograph that showed Ziemak standing with female
lottery workers wearing bras on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   After Ziemak withdrew, the chairman of Connecticut's
quasi-public lottery board vowed to do a better job investigating
the backgrounds of new candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland, who was not involved in Ziemak's selection, said
Friday that lottery officials did all they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''They called the (Kansas) governor's office. They checked all
the references,'' Rowland told reporters. ''In a background check
none of this would have come up. That's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that newspapers in Kansas were reporting on problems there
even as Ziemak was applying for the Connecticut job, Rowland said
there was ''a lot of politics'' in Ziemak's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happened, obviously, is that he has some enemies in
Kansas that have filtered information to'' the media, Rowland said.
''It's not the first time I've seen this happen. So it becomes more
of a perception problem than a real problem. I'm not sure what else
the (lottery) board could have done to further check out this
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Corey, chairman of the Connecticut lottery's board of
directors, traveled to Dallas this week to speak personally with
Ziemak about the allegations. He said he did not ask Ziemak to
withdraw, but supported the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery board's members are appointed by Rowland and other
state leaders, but it operates as an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, in the future we will attempt to do a more thorough
background check prior to voting'' to hire a candidate, Corey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak, a Manchester, Conn., native, spent 18 years in the
lottery unit of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue before
being replaced as unit chief by then-Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr. in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the head of the Kansas lottery in 1993 by then-Gov.
Joan Finney, a Democrat. Ziemak, 52, stayed when Republican Gov.
Bill Graves took office in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak was to replace George Wandrak, who resigned in April as
the Connecticut lottery's president and CEO. James Vance, who has
served as acting president since April, will continue in that role
until a new president is hired, Corey said.

<HEADLINE> France Cheers U.S. RU-486 Approval  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) --The French developers of the abortion pill RU-486
expressed satisfaction today over the U.S. decision to approve the
early-abortion method, saying it would help the pill gain
acceptance in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, American women can benefit from this product,'' said
Eduoard Sakiz, former head of the French drug company Roussel that
put the pill on the market in France, the first country to use it
in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 is now widely available in western Europe, but 12 years
after it appeared, it is far from the method of choice in the
countries where it is authorized, and it remains controversial in
many others.
</P>
<P>
   The pill blocks a hormone, progesterone, that is essential to
sustaining pregnancy. It can only be used early in pregnancy and if
the pill fails, surgical intervention is required.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the pill's inventor, said that after
more than a decade of use in France, the method was ''satisfying --
and insufficient'' and that he wanted to see the pill's application
extended.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French Movement for Family Planning, the number
of abortions performed in France using RU-486 has increased from 14
percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1998. An abortion using RU-486
costs about $200, most of which is reimbursed by the French social
security system.
</P>
<P>
   Baulieu said he wanted a reduction in the eight-day waiting
period before the pill can be administered, better training for
French doctors in the pill's use and an extension beyond the
seventh week of pregnancy, the limit for legal use of RU-486 in
France.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 is authorized in 12 of the 15 European Union countries,
with the exception of Ireland, Portugal and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fiercest opponents is the Vatican, which has battled
to halt international acceptance of the abortion pill since it was
first marketed in France. Lobbying by Catholics has held up
approval in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is that RU-486 is unacceptable, as in all
abortion cases,'' said Maria Louisa Di Pietro, a researcher and
spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Institute of Rome's Catholic
University, a key advisory body for Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Besides France, RU-486 has met its greatest success in Sweden,
where it was introduced in 1992. In 1999, 33.6 percent of all
abortions in Sweden were performed with RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   But in some European countries where RU-486 is available, it
hasn't caught on. France Tranza of the Marie Stopes International
clinic in London, said fewer than 2 percent of the 40,000 abortions
it does annually use RU-486. She said people believed ''it is a
much easier process than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   She said women wanting RU-486 have to make three visits to the
clinic, at least two of which last two hours or more. In the early
stages of pregnancy, women are more likely to prefer a procedure
that can be done in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, RU-486 was introduced in January, but most people
aren't yet aware of it and the government has no figures on how
many times it has been used. About 15 hospitals are using the pill
in Norway, where conservatives unsuccessfully tried to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the Femagen pharmaceutical company is considering
dropping RU-486 because of disappointing sales since it went on the
market nearly a year ago. The pill's poor showing is mainly because
German doctors receive a smaller government reimbursement for
administering it than for surgical abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, which has the world's highest abortion rate, the pill
was approved last year with little opposition. But most Russian
women are unaware of it and many provincial clinics can't afford to
buy the pills.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is high for Russians, at upwards of $180, compared to
standard abortions that can be obtained for about $36.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Petrosian, an obstetrician at the Women's Medical Center in
Moscow, said 300 patients at her clinic have used the pill and they
had suffered fewer complications than woman who had standard
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good method, and we are actively working hard so
that people learn about it,'' Petrosian said.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 has yet to win acceptance in Africa, where the need to
visit the doctor several times has hindered its widespread use, but
Sarkiz said efforts were being made to gain approval in South
Africa. He also hopes Canada will now authorize the pill.

<HEADLINE> New Iceberg Breaks Off in Antarctic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An iceberg has broken free from the Ross Ice
Shelf in the Antarctic, the National Ice Center reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The 345 square mile iceberg, named B-20, was found by satellites
operated by the Defense Meteorological Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The exact date the berg broke free could not be determined
because of cloudiness in the area, but it is thought to have been
between Sept. 20 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-by-11.5 mile iceberg is located near latitude 77 degrees,
00 minutes south; longitude 170 degrees, 42 minutes east, in the
Ross Sea, south of the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> New York's fall hunting seasons load up  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gary Schultheis loves not hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Although he enjoys tracking game on a crisp fall day, his
business, Schultheis Sporting Goods in Arkport, gets busier this
time of year, leaving him less time to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, these stores see anything from a slight, but bankable
rise in sales like at Schultheis' to the more than doubling of
business that Dick's Gun Shop enjoys 25 miles away in the Allegany
County town of Scio. But what's unique about Schultheis' slice of
New York state's $6 billion hunting and fishing economy is that
it's a mile and a field of muck from where New York's biggest
trophy deer were bagged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Allegany County hamlet of Burns, Homer Boylan shot a
244-pound buck carrying a 26-point rack of antlers. A few miles
away, during the same 1939 hunting season, Luckey Roosevelt bagged
a 198 pounder with 14 points. The deer are the state's records for
the two categories of guns, both shot in the county of 50,000
people, more than 7,000 of whom are licensed to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Schultheis could tell you more about that record deer, and
exactly where it was shot. But he's getting a bit busier these days
leading to Sunday's opening of one of several hunting seasons in
New York that are staggered throughout the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cottontail rabbit season begins Sunday in upstate counties along
with, in some areas, hunting for hare, ruffed grouse, pheasants and
woodcock. Squirrels have been fair game for a month. Big game
seasons for deer and bear open at staggered times later in the fall
in different zones of the state and attract the most hunters.
</P>
<P>
   A national researcher estimates hunting and fishing in New York
draws $3.5 billion in retail sales and $1.6 billion in wages, said
Dan Farrell, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   And state wildlife biologists said the conditions appear better
than average this fall for the state's 550,000 licensed hunters:
the foliage is on schedule to reduce obstructions and enhance the
outdoor experience, and the state's more-than-1-million deer
provide plentiful game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Year after year, the Empire State's outstanding hunting
opportunities attract millions of sportsmen and women to the
outdoors,'' said DEC Commissioner John Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters killed 256,000 deer during the record-setting 1999
season. The kill was 10 percent more than the year before and the
deer population keeps growing, becoming a problem for farmers and
motorists, state officials said. There were 70,000 car-deer crashes
in New York in 1998 that left nine people dead. That's almost
10,000 more crashes than a decade before.

<HEADLINE> Paper plant cited for 31 safety violations   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal workplace safety agency has
found numerous safety violations at a paper plant owned by the same
company that operates a mill where a worker died Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed
penalties of $93,000 be levied against the American Tissue Mills of
New York Inc. plant in Mechanicville.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA said the mill had a ''lost workday injury and illness''
rate of 13.6 for 1998, almost three times higher than the national
average of 4.6 for paper mills.
</P>
<P>
   During an inspection in July and August, OSHA found serious
violations including failure to:
</P>
<P>
   -properly identify confined spaces with danger signs and develop
and implement programs for employees who work in confined spaces.
</P>
<P>
   -verify that confined spaces were safe before entry.
</P>
<P>
   -ensure retrieval systems were in place for confined spaces.
</P>
<P>
   -ensure emergency first aid services were available.
</P>
<P>
   -adequately cover open floor pits and provide adequate guardrail
protection.
</P>
<P>
   -provide adequate guards on a paper machine.
</P>
<P>
   There were a total of 19 serious violations for which OSHA
recommended a total of $78,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA also found 10 ''other-than-serious'' violations and two
repeat violations - failure to conduct hazard communication
training and failure to secure a propane cylinder on a fork lift.
</P>
<P>
   It was at an American Tissue plant in Greenwich on Monday where
a 51-year-old worker died when he fell headfirst into a machine.
Timothy J. Finn was killed in the accident at the plant 33 miles
north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Finn slipped or tripped and fell into the mill's
paper machine, which pulled him in and caused extensive head
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That fatality came four months after OSHA announced it had found
22 labor violations at the mill after a series of inspections in
January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its New York plants, American Tissue has facilities in
St. Helens, Ore.; Winchester, N.H.; Neenah, Wisc.; Harriman, Tenn.;
Berlin-Gorham, N.H.; Gilman, Vt.; and Augusta, Maine.

<HEADLINE> Siewert: Shy Guy, A Very Public Job  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was out with the Joe, in with the new at
the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's combative spokesman, left the job
officially today and -- after having his last daily briefing
interrupted by his boss -- turned over the duties to his deputy,
Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people think Joe's leaving for purely selfish, monetary
reasons,'' President Clinton said. ''But the truth is, he told me
that I was no longer in enough trouble to make it interesting for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled appointing Lockhart as his press secretary in
October 1998, amid questions of whether the stocky, wide-eyed
Lockhart was ''heavy enough to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He leaves with gravitas and gravy-tas, and a lot of
gratitude,'' Clinton said -- prompting reporters to titter and
Lockhart to blush.
</P>
<P>
   The president handed Lockhart a photograph, taken earlier this
month during their only golf outing together, that shows a hapless
Lockhart trying to putt. ''What a moment,'' Lockhart said as
Clinton read the caption: ''Joe, a typical day as presidential
press secretary. Lost in the weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the wings was Siewert, Lockhart's deputy for the past
year and now, spokesman for the most powerful leader in the world --
albeit for only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was so busy sending Clinton away from the White House
briefing room -- ''I'm still on the clock,'' he said -- that the
president almost missed the chance to appoint Lockhart's successor.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton named his fourth press secretary with these words:
''I have a gift for your successor, Jake.'' The gift was a green
combat helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you'll wear it to your first briefing,'' Clinton told
Siewert, who declined to don it immediately. ''I worked enough on
the Dukakis campaign not to put this on,'' Siewert deadpanned as
Clinton draped his arms chummily around both his spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, in the privacy of his office, after a phone
interview with a Chicago radio station, Siewert did try on a
full-sized black riot helmet and matching bulletproof vest, both
emblazoned with ''JAKE'' in white capital letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his experience over the last few years here more than
qualifies him to take over and do the job without the vest,''
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert kept on the vest and helmet long enough to pose for
photographs with press office aides. Then he sat down at his
computer to hastily punch out his biography for a reporter; the
White House had not written one for him yet.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hastily arranged ascension for the 36-year-old Siewert,
a native New Yorker, Yale graduate and son of schoolteacher
parents. He keeps a low profile at the White House and guards his
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, telling virtually no one, Siewert stole away from
the White House entourage while Clinton was in New York City. He
journeyed into Harlem, attended a memorial service for his college
roommate Joe Wood Jr., and -- after much explaining, wrangling and a
sprint of a few blocks -- barely caught up with Clinton as he headed
to the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert's White House profile also is as casual as it is low.
Friday, his colleagues teased him about the fact that he wore a
business suit to work, rather than his usual combination of a
blazer, khakis, shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   While boxes of memorabilia and plastic packing foam stacked up
in Lockhart's office Friday, Siewert's small West Wing office was a
study in neatness, with the few books and photos there still
unpacked.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's announcement, Lockhart shared a press office

<HEADLINE> Mourners gather to bid farewell to ''four wonderful nurses, four wonderful women'' </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ZACHARIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They were remembered as heroes, praised for
their dedication and for the lives they saved.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners filled the pews at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday to
bid farewell to a group of nurses who were killed earlier this week
in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   The women, good friends who all worked at St. Vincent's Hospital
in Manhattan, plunged five stories to their death when their car
drove through a parking garage wall in Virginia Beach on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 1600 family members, friends, and co-workers filled the
pews for the funeral Mass of Joan Ellen Walsh, 56, case manager for
the hospital's pediatrics and neonatal intensive care unit; Mary
Ann Going, 60, the unit's nursing care coordinator; and Kathleen M.
Mollick-Kelly, 63, the head nurse of the pediatrics and obstetrics
outpatient clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth woman, Mary Ann Dono, will have a separate service to
accommodate her elderly mother who is unable to travel outside of
Brooklyn, where she lives, said Bill McCann, a spokesman for St.
Vincent's. Dono, 60, was the nurse manager for the pediatrics and
neonatal intensive care unit. She was spoken of extensively
throughout the service on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four of these women were heroes,'' said Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the first speaker at the service. ''They saved lives and
they helped people.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani expressed a ''tremendous amount of gratitude'' to the
nurses, as well as St. Vincent's, for their treatment of the people
of New York. The four friends had all been on the staff of St.
Vincent's for at least 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Edward Egan delivered the homily for the service. He
described the women as gifted and ''great professionals'' and
praised them for their ''selfless dedication'' and their ''humble
service.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They cured, and when they couldn't cure, they soothed,'' Egan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were finding it hard to imagine St. Vincent's without them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Hopkins, who worked with them as a pediatric resident
from 1981 to 1984, said she couldn't believe that they would no
longer be at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were the heart and soul of the whole department,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going's brother, James P. Going, praised his sister and her
friends for their deeds at work and in their personal life. Amid
continuous sobs, there were laughs as he talked about the women's
personalities, and as he sent his wishes to them.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''We know you're in heaven looking down and we hope
you're enjoying your send-off.''

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Israel Trip Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid rising tensions, the State Department
criticized Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon on Friday for
visiting a holy site in Jerusalem. It also urged Israelis and
Palestinians to avoid actions that create tension.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department advised American citizens ''to
exercise caution'' while avoiding the vicinity of the site and
large crowds and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The violence could spread through East Jerusalem and the West
Bank, the statement said. American diplomats in were told to avoid
the areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-throwing Palestinians rioted Thursday after Sharon, who
heads the Likud bloc and vehemently opposed to yielding control of
areas of Jerusalem. went to the Temple Mount and declared it
''inconceivable'' that the site could be off-limits to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine is sacred to Jews as the site of the first and second
temples. It also is the third holiest shrine in Islam, containing
the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques. It is known to Muslims as
Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization urged a show of resistance, and leading Palestinian
officials joined hundreds of teen-agers in demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, tensions intensified. Israeli riot police fired at
stone-throwing protesters, and four people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which on Thursday appealed in general
terms for lowered tensions, got specific Friday and pointed an
accusing finger at Sharon, a former general and Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were quite concerned that the visit by Sharon to this site
risked creating tensions,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said. ''And,
in fact, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's incumbent upon people on both sides to avoid
actions that inflame the situation and create tension,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Palestinian demonstrations, Boucher said, ''Certainly we
don't approve of any violence. We don't condone it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ''The two sides should be actively working to
stop the violence. But also, in the meantime, we need to remember
how important it is to actively work to reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, ''We
are always concerned and condemn violence of any kind. The recent
violence underscores the sensitivity of the issue of Jerusalem and
provides even further illustration of how difficult this issue
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations ended Thursday
with no signs of progress on the future of Jerusalem, the eastern
part of which Arafat is demanding as capital of a projected
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has proposed Palestinian
control over some areas of East Jerusalem. Martin Indyk, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel, said in a recent speech the Holy City should
be shared.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated development, Indyk's security clearance was
suspended amid an investigation into allegations of possible
violations. Boucher again declined Friday to say what prompted the
inquiry by the FBI and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The situation makes Indyk unable to play a role in U.S.
mediation between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to promote a settlement, Albright telephoned
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, the senior Israeli
negotiator, on Friday and planned to talk to Arafat as well,
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence there is a reminder that the only solution is
peace, and the only way to resolve these situations is to intensify
efforts to reach an agreement,'' Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney convicted of conspiring to sell rare edition of Dickens novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBION, N.Y.(AP) - An attorney was convicted Friday of
conspiring to sell a rare edition of Charles Dickens' novel ''The
Pickwick Papers'' that police seized as part of a large-scale drug
investigation three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An Orleans County jury found Paul Heiligenthaler guilty of one
count each of conspiracy and criminal possession of stolen
property.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 indictment accused the North Carolina resident, formerly
of Medina, of having control over the more than 150-year-old book,
which was stolen in a burglary in Medina and recovered in a series
of drug and weapons raids.
</P>
<P>
   Police said one of the men arrested during the drug raids had
been in possession of the book and that Heiligenthaler had been
actively looking for buyers for it, believing it to be worth tens
of thousands of dollars. It was later appraised at between $1,500
and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Heiligenthaler, representing himself at trial, accused
prosecutors of setting him up as revenge for Heiligenthaler's
criticism of law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware of the book but did not know it was
stolen.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to divest its Clairol
beauty care business and Zimmer medical products unit to focus more
on its drug business.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company with research laboratories in
Princeton and Hopewell said it wants to increase profit growth from
the current 11 percent level to the high teens by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Heimbold Jr., chairman and chief executive, said Clairol
and Zimmer could be sold, spun off to stockholders or swapped with
other companies in exchange for other drug assets.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers said it also will pursue alliances and expand more
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The moves comes as investors pushed the company to boost
profitability. The company's stock had declined 12 percent before

   UNDATED (AP) - Grand Union Inc., which is trying to find a
buyer, has replaced one of its financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Freimark, chief financial officer, told The Star-Ledger
of Newark that New Jersey's sixth-largest grocer replaced Alvarez &AMP;
Marsal Inc. with a new consultant, Nightingale &AMP; Associates of
Stamford, Conn., after Alvarez turned in the first phase of the
company's business plans Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It hired Alvarez to write its plans, and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to
find a possible buyer for the chain, under an agreement with its
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Union's management and board decided to replace Alvarez,
Freimark said.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of Grand Union's plans is due Oct. 1 and will
cover the possible closure and sale of stores, and changes to its
capital structure.
</P>
<P>
   It has been under bankruptcy protection twice in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said potential buyers include distributors Di Giorgio
Corp. in Carteret and C&AMP;S Wholesale Grocers or a real estate group.

   CARTERET, N.J. (AP) - Pathmark Stores Inc.'s stocks lost almost
15 percent of their value on their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Its bondholders sold the shares they received when the company
emerged from bankruptcy protection. Many bondholders were forced to
sell their shares because they are prohibited in their charters
from holding equity.
</P>
<P>
   The Carteret subsidiary of Supermarkets General Holding Corp.
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection July 12 and emerged
Sept. 7.
</P>

   The stock opened at $14 a share on the NASDAQ market, closing
down $2.06 at $11.93.
</P>

   Pathmark dropped $1.1 billion in bonds and canceled leases under
the reorganization. It now has about $383 million in debt, part of

Penn State holds rally for Taliaferro
AP Photos
</P>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) - Hundreds of Penn State faculty,
students, staff and fans attended a rally Friday for partially
paralyzed football player Adam Taliaferro.
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro, a freshman defensive back, has been unable to move
his fingers or his legs since he injured his spine making a tackle
last week at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   He had spinal fusion surgery Monday and was transferred from
Ohio to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Sebastianelli, Penn State's director of athletic
medicine, said metal support and bone grafts had been inserted to
stabilize the spine in Taliaferro's mid-lower neck area.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to Adam is out of our hands,'' Penn State coach
Joe Paterno said. ''It's in the hands of a God who is still
creating miracles, a God we still believe in and a God we pray
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Jackson, the coach who recruited Taliaferro, visited
Taliaferro on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He laid in his bed and he talked and he showed me that he can
move his arms a little bit just like this,'' Jackson said, pumping
his arms in a running motion. ''So don't worry, Adam will be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State plans to create a fund for anyone wishing to make a
contribution to support Taliaferro's long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Tim Curley said the fund was established to
support the Taliaferro family and assist with expenses that the
university and NCAA catastrophic injury insurance don't cover.
</P>
<P>
   A Thomas Jefferson Hospital spokesman said Taliaferro is in the
intensive neurological care unit. He is expected to be transferred
to the Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Lazio: Race vs. Clinton may determine America's 'moral compass'  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, N,Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio on Friday said his Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton ''may determine the moral
compass of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island congressman, who has frequently raised the issue
of character, told about 150 supporters that people across the
country are following the campaign and think it is more important
that those in their own states.
</P>
<P>
   ''They look at this race and they say, 'This is a race that may
determine the direction America goes, that may determine the moral
compass of our country,''' the Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I think this is the most important race of my
generation. ... This is a race that will determine whether or not
character still counts in public service; whether or not integrity
matters; whether the rule of law applies to all or just to some
privileged people.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks underscored a main theme of the Lazio campaign -
that the first lady cannot be trusted and that she and her husband
have ''embarrassed the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said later, ''Rick
Lazio traveled upstate today, not to offer a specific plan to help
boost the economy but instead to hurl more personal insults against
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sought to take the offensive, Lazio found himself facing
questions about his participation in a major state GOP event aimed
at raising soft money. Admission prices for the event run up to
$100,000, which gets donors 17, $1,000-a-person tickets and photos
with Lazio and other big-name New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been making much of an agreement brokered with Clinton
that bans soft-money advertising, which is paid for by political
parties and outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson called Lazio a hypocrite. ''He repeatedly told New
Yorkers that he wasn't raising or spending soft money. Now New
Yorkers know that was a lie,'' Wolfson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said money raised at the event will be used only for
get-out-the-vote activities and similar purposes.

<HEADLINE> Eastwood Cleared in Disabled Case  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A federal jury ruled Friday that Clint
Eastwood owes nothing to a disabled woman who sued because his
historic inn was not more accessible to her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for less than five hours before determining
that while Eastwood's Mission Ranch near Carmel lacked some
wheelchair accommodations, the actor-director should not have to
pay Diane zum Brunnen, 51, any damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there were too many lies told in court and I think the
jury could see through that,'' said Eastwood, who thanked the
jurors, signed autographs for them and posed for pictures after the
verdict. ''Once you tell a lie and it gets out of control, it's
like a runaway train.''
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen, who has muscular dystrophy, was not in court when
the verdict was read. Her attorneys said they were considering an
appeal; one said he thought Eastwood's celebrity status influenced
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen sued Eastwood under the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act in 1997, a year after she and her husband,
Michael, say they had dinner at Mission Ranch. The couple
complained the wheelchair-accessible bathroom was in another
building, more than 200 feet away, across a driveway; the only
accessible guest room was $225 a night, when other rooms were as
low as $85; and there was no ramp to the main office.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Eastwood liable for two minor violations: not
enough signs to the restroom and no ramp access to the hotel
office.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood said he should have had a chance to address the
couple's complaints before he was sued. He said he has tried to
allow disabled access in his renovations to the 150-year-old ranch,
which he bought in 1987, while preserving the buildings' historic
feel. He pointed out that Monterey County building officials
approved all of his renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not against the ADA; I want to make that clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of evidence was a photo of the ranch registration
office that the zum Brunnens said they took to show there was no
wheelchair ramp. The picture was taken from some distance away on a
sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   The zum Brunnens said in depositions they took the picture after
their dinner on Jan. 21, 1996 -- when it would have been dark -- and
later said at trial it was taken right before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A surveyor testified that the picture was taken at 12:05 p.m.,
which Eastwood attorney Chuck Keller said proved the zum Brunnens
merely drove by and snapped a quick picture for use in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of didn't think she was really there for dinner,''
said juror Lorenzo Gutierrez, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen's attorneys blamed the inconsistent testimony on the
passage of time, rather than a conspiracy to nail Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   Though zum Brunnen's side portrayed the case as a simple fight
for a disabled woman's civil rights, it was impossible to ignore
the celebrity status of the 70-year-old Eastwood, who was mayor of
Carmel from 1986 to 1988. And both sides accused the other of
seeking a ''fistful of dollars'' -- a reference to his 1964 Western.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood was asked that if the case had been in a movie, whether
this would have been the verdict he would have directed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of fact,'' he said, smiling as he began to walk
away, ''it's not a bad ending, is it?''

<HEADLINE> White House Says Milosevic Must Go  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration insisted again
Friday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic clearly lost his
re-election contest and should leave office without delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made very clear that we believe the Serbian opposition
has won this election, that Milosevic should go,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   He said all observers not ''under the thumb of the government''
agree that ''the opposition has won this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has refused to recognize challenger Vojislav
Kostunica's apparent victory in Sunday's elections, saying he would
move ahead with plans for an Oct. 8 runoff. The State Election
Commission controlled by Milosevic's government said Kostunica
earned 48 percent of the vote to 38 percent for Milosevic, less
than a majority. But opposition poll watchers said Kostunica won 52
percent of the vote, compared with 32 percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has sought Milosevic's ouster since it led
NATO air strikes on Belgrade last year in response to attacks on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called any conclusions reached by the election
commission ''inherently suspect.'' He said the opposition's
position, shared by most countries which have expressed an opinion,
''is that the first-round results were clear and that Milosevic
should go and respect the will of the people of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Street demonstrations aimed at Milosevic's ouster have broken
out in Serbia. ''How the opposition presses its case is up to
them,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, adding
that since the media is largely controlled by the government
''people are going to want to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said, however, that while ''we can understand the
outrage'' in Serbia that the government may be trying to steal the
election, ''nobody is encouraging violence; not we, nor the
opposition''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that he believes international
sanctions should be removed as soon as a democratically elected
government is installed in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Franks, Corzine differ on federal government's role in public education </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In some ways, U.S. Senate candidates Jon
Corzine and Bob Franks agree on what and how children should be
taught.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Corzine and Republican Franks part company, however,
over the federal government's role in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Both Corzine, the millionaire Wall Street retiree, and Franks,
the Union County congressman, support ''character'' education to
promote values in children and after-school programs to provide
them with a safe haven, for example.
</P>
<P>
   After that, differences emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has also made college scholarships a key feature of a
campaign platform driven by television advertising, although he
recently tempered his promises somewhat with caveats to control
runaway costs. Some took it as a signal he may shift away from the
universal promises offered during the primary to a more measured
set of proposals for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public schools, both candidates have laid out a
variety of proposals on what polls suggests is a hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
   Franks believes the federal government ought to hand over more
control to local school districts and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Corzine proposes that the federal government
increase its involvement by targeting increased funding to solve
specific flaws in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine ''is not only committed to ensuring that the federal
government plays a bigger role, but will target the funds to the
public education system's biggest needs,'' said campaign
spokeswoman Ivette Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the federal government contributed 3.7 percent of
education costs in the 1998-99 school year, the last year for which
statistics are available, according to the New Jersey School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among Corzine's various calls for more federal investment is a
$50 billion program over 10 years to ensure that preschool programs
are accredited, meet health and safety standards, and supply
well-trained and compensated staff.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Corzine wants to see federal education aid increase to
enable local districts to hire and train more certified teachers,
reduce class sizes, enhance school safety and stem substance abuse,
Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat supports interest-free school construction bonds
with tax credits to help state and local governments modernize,
repair and build public schools, Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Corzine, Franks wants to decentralize the federal
government's hold on public education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Franks believes parents, teachers and administrators know
what's best for our children. They should be the ones empowered to
make decisions regarding our children's education, not a Washington
bureaucracy,'' said campaign spokesman Peter DeMarco.
</P>
<P>
   Franks supports federal block grants to give local officials the
flexibility to meet local needs. In return, the districts would
have to meet higher education accountability standards, DeMarco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' decentralized approach irks the Corzine campaign, which
says there aren't enough accountability strings attached to Franks'
favored form of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also takes Franks to task for voting in 1995 to
dismantle the federal Department of Education, but Franks' campaign
said the resolution was merely advisory and never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they cited was not binding language,'' said DeMarco. ''It
only called on appropriators to consider eliminating the Department
of Education.'' DeMarco noted the provision was a small part of a
300-page report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the report was not to reduce the financial
commitment to education, but to have more federal money find its
way to classrooms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he will press to triple federal funding for
educating the disabled and handicapped, and he has proposed a $1
billion loan program to help charter schools pay for new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Franks also voted for a bill that would allow states to
distribute federal funds to parents who need help paying private
school tuition. Corzine opposes vouchers for private school costs.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Adopts Anti-Smoking Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa adopted strict new
regulations Friday that ban tobacco advertising, limit smoking in
the workplace and force bars and restaurants to build walled-off
smoking sections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the regulations, which were published by the government
Friday, will take effect Sunday, but will not be enforced for three
months as South Africans and businesses adjust to them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the regulations, employers must protect their workers from
workplace exposure to tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Bars, restaurants and hotels must forbid smoking except in
designated, walled-off areas, where a health warning must be
posted. Retailers who sell tobacco also must post a health warning.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations banning tobacco advertising will take effect April
23.

<HEADLINE> Hudson County challenges Whitman order keeping sex offenders in Kearny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Hudson County is challenging an
executive order issued last week by Gov. Whitman that could keep
some civilly committed sex offenders in temporary detention space
in Kearny for as long as two years.
</P>
<P>
   The governor issued the order requiring about 115 inmates to
remain in rented jail space in Kearny until a new detention
facility is completed in Woodbridge in about two years. The new
facility will be built on the grounds of East Jersey State Prison,
next to the state's only existing prison for sex offenders, the
Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center.
</P>
<P>
   The county asked Superior Court Judge Maurice Gallipoli to
overturn Whitman's order Friday, but the judge said the state's
appellate courts are the proper place for such a challenge to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had previously ruled that the state violated its lease
with Hudson County when it moved the sex offenders into the
Northern State Annex, a facility the state rents next to the Hudson
County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fought against this move since day one, and don't plan
to stop now,'' said Hudson County Executive Robert Janiszewski.
''What Governor Whitman did is just wrong, and the people of Kearny
deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she acted under emergency powers due to a crisis
caused by insufficient space for the prisoners, who have served
their criminal sentences but are still deemed a threat to society.

<HEADLINE> Oktoberfest's Elitism Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Bouncers wielding walkie-talkies with
lists of VIPs, deciding who's in and who's out, certainly aren't
unusual at hip venues.
</P>
<P>
   Only these bouncers aren't guarding the velvet-rope frontier of
a New York nightclub. They're wearing Lederhosen and patrolling the
festive tents of Oktoberfest, where the right to drink beer, dance
on the table and roar out an ode to the frothy stuff has been a
sacred rite for nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, it's become invitation-only -- to the chagrin
of Munich city leaders and Oktoberfest organizers who are vowing
steps to prevent the world-famous Volksfest from turning into a
VIPfest.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that events staged by record companies to promote
musicians, or shows featuring ladies doffing their Dirndl dresses,
are threatening the core of a tradition dating to 1810.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to have the Oktoberfest become a show-biz event.
We are not Las Vegas, we are not Woodstock, we are not a
mega-disco,'' says Gabriele Weishaeupl, Oktoberfest's general
manager, herself the picture of tradition in a smocked green
Dirndl. ''We want a traditional Bavarian Volksfest.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Oktoberfest has become a victim of its own popularity.
By the time the 167th Oktoberfest ends on Tuesday, more than 6.5
million people will have passed through the blue-and-white gates
marking the entrance to ''Wiesn,'' the Bavarian word for field. And
they'll have chugged down 5 million of the massive liter-sized beer
mugs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to just walk into the popular Hippodrom or
Kaefer tents. Tables are booked months in advance, many by
companies in large blocks. And the non-reserved sections in the
middle of the tents are already filled by afternoon. Beer hall
owners then simply shut the doors to new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   While only a handful of the Wiesn's 14 tents are violating the
Oktoberfest spirit, Weishaeupl says she will sit down with all the
tent owners after the 18-day festival ends for a serious talk. City
lawmakers have already called for the tents to set aside more
unreserved tables.
</P>
<P>
   The clash with tradition reached a head last year after a
performer at the Hippodrom dropped her Dirndl, flashing her breasts
for the crowd. Mayor Christian Ude derided the spectacle as a
striptease -- and took issue when the Hippodrom started issuing VIP
bracelets to allow unlimited access for a select few, a sort of
season's pass.
</P>
<P>
   Hippodrom owner Sepp Kratz abandoned the bracelets under
pressure and says he regrets the flashing incident last year. But
he and other owners defend their attempts to regulate admission as
a step against overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sorry that it happened -- such things don't belong to
Wiesn,'' Kratz said. Still, he insisted, ''we are caring for
Bavarian tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the Hippodrom tent, Johann Niedermeyer of Munich
can't remember ever missing an Oktoberfest in all his 63 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be cozier, not such a huge event,'' Niedermeyer
says, wearing a well-worn pair of Lederhosen.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, a performer with the stage name Antonia from Tirolia
performs a song in a short-short dress, then jumps up and down,
threatening to free her bosom from its fabric confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There weren't such things in the past,'' Niedermeyer says as
he claps along. ''But I like these things too.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Susanne Tusche from the nearby town of
Memmingen stood outside the Hippodrom tent, already off-limits to
non-ticket holders, viewing the revelers swaying merrily to the
music through a window.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has no Volksfest atmosphere when you stand here before
closed doors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her mood changed when a friend came out carrying the
all-important reservation bracelets, and suddenly she was on her
way to grasp yet another beer mug between her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''See, it's all who you know,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Kids caught in scheduling stalemate over game set for Rosh Hashanah </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVON, Conn. (AP) - What would Sandy Koufax do?
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Dodger ace refused to pitch the first game of the
1965 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement. A group of 10- and 11-year-old boys in Avon can
definitely relate.
</P>
<P>
   Their soccer team was on the verge of forfeiting a game against
Fairfield at the Connecticut State Cup tournament because it seemed
no agreement could be reached to reschedule it to accommodate Rosh
Hashanah.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed a few hours before sundown Friday, just in time
for the Jewish New Year. The Fairfield first selectman said late
Friday that the coach of the Fairfield boys' team agreed to play
the game anytime to accommodate Avon.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a hitch, though.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were playing in the Connecticut Cup tournament and
rules, handed down by the Connecticut Junior Soccer Association,
forbid any State Cup makeup games after Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield First Selectman John Metsopoulos said if the state
association doesn't sanction the makeup game, then Fairfield coach
Don Houston has agreed that his team will forfeit and the two would
play ''a friendly game.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 16 players on the Avon team are Jewish and cannot
play this weekend because of the holiday. Fairfield coach Don
Houston refused to play the game earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Metsopoulos and the Anti-Defamation League were drawn into the
scheduling stalemate and both had harsh words for the state
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rosh Hashanah has been a major holiday in the Jewish faith for
5,761 years,'' said Metsopoulos. ''I don't think it was too much to
ask the state organization to check the calendar before they
schedule these games.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's saddening. In this day and age we're all trying to
respect each others' practices where kids can get along and on the
eve of Rosh Hashanah, this is where we're standing,'' said Steven
Sheinberg, associate director the Anti-Defamation League's
Connecticut branch.
</P>
<P>
   Avon coach Len Goldberg met with his players' parents Thursday
and explained the choices: field a team with just 10 players or
forfeit. The parents - Jewish and non-Jewish alike - didn't
hesitate: They'd rather forfeit. They wanted to stick together.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Goldberg had to break the news to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple kids were crying. They didn't understand,'' he said.
''They wanted to know why I couldn't work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them what most adults have to tell a kid sometime in
their lives: ''Sometimes life isn't fair and you have to work with
people who may not do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Tyler Donahue, 10, agreed with the all-for-one
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some of us can't play, I don't think we should,'' said
Tyler. ''How would Fairfield feel if we scheduled games on
Christmas and Easter?''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Zolad, the league administrator, refused to comment.
Houston, an attorney for the Fairfield school board, could not be
reached. Messages were left on his home phone and at his law
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinberg said the league appeared unwilling to bend the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this age of instant (telecommunications) and conference
calls, they can't pull their board of directors together?'' he
said. ''It's in the CJSA's hands and I hope they do the right
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect pleads guilty in vandalism of church statues in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man pleaded guilty Friday to charges involving
the desecration of religious statues at Catholic churches across
Brooklyn, and was sentenced to five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   Primus St. Croix, 33, an illegal immigrant from St. Lucia,
pleaded in Brooklyn Supreme Court to charges of criminal mischief,
aggravated harassment, tampering with physical evidence,
trespassing and criminal interference with health care services or
religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix admitted in court that he entered at least five
Catholic churches with the intention of ''smashing and
vandalizing'' statues in those churches, as well as a statue of
Pope Pius at a Knights of Columbus Hall and an exterior statue at
St. Francis of Assisi Church, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J.
Hynes said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The official sentencing date was set for Oct. 11, and St. Croix
will remain in jail until that date, Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are awaiting a decision by the U.S. Department of
Immigration and Naturalization as to his resident status and
whether he will be deported.

<HEADLINE> USDA Faulted on Commodity Procedure  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department needs to improve
its procedures for validating petitions for referenda on commodity
promotion programs, a congressional study says.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called a referendum on the
pork promotion program on his own after his department was unable
to validate sufficient signatures on petitions asking for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the General Accounting Office said the department
didn't know for sure how many pork producers there are and also
used flawed survey methodology in trying to verify the eligibility
of the 19,000 people who signed petitions asking for the pork
referendum. Under government rules, the USDA was required to hold a
referendum if 15 percent of eligible producers asked for one.
</P>
<P>
   Promotion programs are funded through mandatory assessments on
producers and importers.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO agreed that Glickman had the authority to call the
referendum on his own. It also said that the pork promotion program
should pay for the cost of running the referendum, not taxpayers.
The referendum is expected to cost $529,000.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman agreed with the GAO's findings, spokesman Andy Solomon
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Increasingly, we find ourselves in the business of running
elections, which is not something we have historic expertise at
dealing with,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also has been petitioned to have a vote on the beef
promotion program. The department is hiring an accounting firm to
validate those petitions. The department expects to know by the end
of the year whether there are sufficient signatures to have a
referendum, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   The pork voting was held Sept. 19-21. Counting and verifying the
ballots is expected to take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The pork program is best known for the advertising slogan, ''The
Other White Meat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because checkoff assessments are mandatory it is essential
that there be a fair and orderly process in place to ensure
producers have a say in whether the checkoff program is benefitting
them,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Violence Overshadows Jewish New Year  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israelis marked the Jewish new year at sundown
Friday with festive family meals, dipping apples in honey to usher
in a sweet year, but the celebrations were marred by deadly
Israeli-Palestinian clashes.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine,
normally packed with worshippers during high holidays, stood
deserted Friday after confrontations erupted between Palestinian
stone throwers and Israeli riot police at the adjacent mosque
compound. The rioting left four Palestinians dead, 175 injured, and
44 Israeli policemen hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Israel faces a year of uncertainty, with a peace treaty
appearing increasingly elusive and Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
government teetering.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish new year, called Rosh Hashanah in Hebrew, begins a
10-day period of solemn introspection, soul-searching and asking
for forgiveness for sins. At sundown Friday, Israelis gathered for
elaborate meals marking the start of the year 5761.
</P>
<P>
   Children performed holiday songs they had learned in school.
Diners dipped apples in honey and ate pomegranates to reaffirm the
commandment that Jews do as many good deeds as the fruit as seeds.
Hotels and guest houses in Israel's resort areas, including the
Galilee in northern Israel, were filled with holiday makers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the first day of the two-day holiday fell on the
Jewish Sabbath. The sounding of the shofar, a trumpet made from a
ram's horn that traditionally heralds the holiday's start, was
absent, since the shofar is not used on the Sabbath, according to
Jewish law. It will sound on Sunday, the second day of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   While many Israelis attend special religious services on both
days, others take advantage of the long weekend to travel to
vacation spots in Israel and abroad. Beaches and resorts are
expected to be crowded throughout the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The solemn period ends with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement,
the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, starting at sundown Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis' feelings about the future were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll in the Yediot daily, 60 percent said the state of the
nation is good, 83 percent said their personal situation is good
and 46 percent expected a change for the better in the coming year.
Still, more than half the people, 55 percent, said their personal
mood is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 percent thought the peace process with the Arabs was
going well, while 70 percent said it was not. The poll, by the
Dahaf agency, questioned 501 Israeli adults and quoted a 4.5
percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis crowded shopping centers and open-air marketplaces,
stocking up for the holiday. At Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda
market, extra police patrolled. Markets have been targets for bomb
attacks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this is the last New Year without peace,'' said
student Shira Kohn, 19, as she shopped.

<HEADLINE> Ex-kennel owner agrees to pay fines for alleged violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The owner of the now closed Garden State
Kennels in Long Hill has agreed to pay $5,000 to the state and
$1,000 to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to
settle charges that he used the wrong drug to euthanize hundreds of
animals at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pelissier is also banned from operating a kennel, shelter,
pet store or any other animal-related business in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Pelissier and the kennel do not have to make any admission of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our No. 1 objective was to get this guy out of business, and
that's what we did,'' SPCA attorney Frank Pisano told The
Star-Ledger of Newark in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The kennel, which provided animal services to communities in
Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union counties, closed March 31.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the SPCA filed 272 animal cruelty complaints
against the kennel and Pelissier, alleging he used a neuromuscular
blocking agent to kill dogs and cats. It is not legal to use
succinylcholin chloride, which causes death by paralysis, on
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jeffrey Bronster said Pelissier never used the
neuromuscular blocking agent to euthanize an animal, but has used
it to sedate animals that were difficult to control for his and the
animals' safety.
</P>
<P>
   He said the sedating procedure in such situations is an approved
method cited in the state's training manual for animal control
officers. Pelissier then used approved drugs to euthanize the
animals, Bronster said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is it doesn't matter,'' Pisano said. ''The
statute says you're not supposed to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Health and Senior Services in January
fined Pelissier and the kennel $18,715 for allegedly using the drug
to kill 600 animals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bronster said the fine was illegal because the state acted
without holding a hearing.

<HEADLINE> Asbestos cleanup begins in Atlantic City, a day after evacuation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Work crews on Friday began removing
asbestos ceiling tiles from the lobby of City Hall, a day after
their discovery prompted the building's evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people were ordered out of the building Thursday
after a contractor installing a fire-suppression sprinkler system
discovered the tiles in the first-floor lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The tiles apparently went unnoticed during a four-year, $4
million asbestos removal project in the late 1980s, city Business
Administrator Andrew Mair said.
</P>
<P>
   The building reopened Friday, but the lobby entrance was blocked
off.
</P>
<P>
   Employees and visitors who used other entrances found themselves
rerouted through labyrinthine stairways and passageways to the
second floor, where the building's receptionist set up shop in
front of the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby will remain closed while the cleanup work is
completed, according to Mair. He did not know how long that would
take.
</P>
<P>
   Mair said an environmental engineer took air samples Thursday
night that indicated levels of airborne asbestos that were within
safety standards in the other areas of the building.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state Public Employees Occupational Safety
and Health Program said Friday the state was satisfied with the
city's response.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the levels in the air you need to worry about,'' said
Chris Gage. ''If they're within the appropriate levels, we're in
good shape. We'll continue to look into this. We'll make sure
everything's going all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Several employees interviewed Friday said they weren't worried
about the asbestos, even though the substance has been linked with
lung diseases and cancer. But a union president was.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unsafe. The whole building should be closed,'' said
Michael Bell, president of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, which represents some City Hall workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mair said the city was trying to locate the company that was
supposed to have removed the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were four different contractors on the project. We have
already attempted to contact the firm that did the design
specifications, and they're no longer in business. We are reviewing
our documents to see what recourse we have,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New program gives inmates job interview practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) - There were no jobs, just chances for
North Country prison inmates to tell real employers why they were
worth hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen businesses participated in Thursday's inaugural
Job Fair 2000 at the Federal Correction Institution at Ray Brook.
Prison officials hope the mock interviews will help inmates land
employment once they are released.
</P>
<P>
   Warden John Nash told employers: ''What we ask you to do today
is ask those very hard questions: Why were you in prison? What did
you do? How are you different? Why should I hire you?''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Fitzgerald, human resources manager for O.W.D. Inc. in
Tupper Lake, said chances are better for former convicts because
the job market is tight. O.W.D. employs about 200 workers at its
plastics plant. ''To work in a factory, there is really no entry
level,'' said Fitzgerald. ''These guys are not that much
different.'' O.W.D., he said, hired three or four ex-convicts in
the past and all ''turned out to be good employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is somewhat self-serving to look for potential applicants
down the line,'' said Susan Manning, the Plattsburgh-based
human-resources manager for Gregory Supply Co. ''I like the
excitement of kind of auditioning (them) for a job.''

<HEADLINE> Police officer arrested, charged with misconduct and sexual abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Queens transit police officer was arrested
Friday and charged with multiple counts of coercion, misconduct and
sexual abuse in connection to two incidents involving female
passengers last month, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Pirrello, 39, a 14-year veteran of the force, was
accused of taking women aside as they were coming through the
turnstile and threatening to give them summonses unless they
complied with his demands.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the first incident occurred on Aug. 22 at the 179th
Street station in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Pirrello allegedly approached a woman as she was trying to get a
stroller and four children through the turnstile, and threatened to
issue a summons. He then directed her to leave her children and
accompany him to a remote area of the station, where he told her he
would not issue a summons if she would agree to meet him later,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, which allegedly occurred Aug. 31 at the
52nd Street station, authorities accuse Pirrello of approaching a
woman who had attempted to enter a turnstile with another person
when her metrocard failed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Pirrello asked for her name and address and threatened to issue
a summons, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He then allegedly took her to an isolated area of the station
and touched her breasts with a pen, afterward releasing her without
issuing a summons.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the police department said Pirrello had been
suspended pending the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces two years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 173; Nasdaq Off 106  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by a slumping
technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer
revived anxiety about corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but
failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies,
including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would
fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at
10,650.92, down 196.45 compared to a week ago. Friday's drop nearly
wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators also fell after rebounding Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, off 130.94
for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to
1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day,''
said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest.
''This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter
earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the
economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak
euro.''
</P>
<P>
   Those issues have kept the market down for most of September.
Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of
disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The market got a brief respite from the anxiety Thursday, but
Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid some of
those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75, a nearly 52
percent loss.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.29 to $46.75.
Hewlett Packard was off $9.25 at $96.88. Lucent slipped $1.25 to
$30.50. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56, furthering a
decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the
fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
''But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple
warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42.
But many other old-economy companies appeared less affected by the
turbulence created by the Apple announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble was unchanged at $67, retaining gains made
Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart
was unchanged at $5.88.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumors it might
the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this
month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at
$41.44.
</P>
<P>
   Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to
$48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing
Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 percent last month in addition to a
0.3 percent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6
percent in both July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.41 billion shares,
compared with the 1.39 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 2.44 at 521.37, up 2.55 from a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.77 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.51 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Three alleged mob associates arrested in art fraud scam  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Three mob associates were arrested Friday on
charges of trying to peddle ''cheesy'' fake artworks that they
claimed were created by Picasso, Chagall, Botero and Rubens,
federal prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants planned to sell the fakes
through an upscale Manhattan gallery for $32 million. Federal
agents, using wiretaps and an informant, killed the alleged scheme
and no paintings were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants are Dominick ''Little Dom''
Curra, 56, of Lawrence, N.Y.; Kevin McMahon, 35, of Howard Beach,
Queens; and Robert Walsh, 35, of Fort Lee, N.J. The defendants are
associates of reputed Gambino organized crime soldier Charles
Carneglia, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Curra and Walsh were arrested at their homes Friday morning.
McMahon was arrested in jail where he is already being held on
federal extortion charges, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Weissmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants were charged with wire fraud, which is
punishable by up to five years in prison. Curra and Walsh pleaded
not guilty when they were arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Cheryl Pollack released Curra in $750,000 bond. She
remanded Walsh and scheduled his bail hearing, and McMahon's
arraignment, for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said the phony art package included two pieces
purportedly by Picasso, one by Marc Chagall, one by Fernando
Botero, and one by Peter Paul Rubens. He said the fakes ''looked
really cheesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said the fake Rubens is in fact an authentic
12-inch-by-12-inch canvas from ''the school of Rubens,'' meaning it
was painted by a Rubens-era (1577-1640) artist in Rubens' style.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubens-style canvas, worth about $2,000, was stolen from a
private residence in Maryland about 30 years ago, the federal
complaint against the three men said.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants and the informant, who has pleaded guilty
in another case and is cooperating with prosecutors, planned to ask
$30 million for the ''Rubens'' and $500,000 for each of the other
four fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Weissmann said he did not know where the defendants got the
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said Walsh told the informant in a March 31
telephone conversation that the Rubens was real, had been insured
by Lloyd's of London, and had been owned by a ''real gangster.''

<HEADLINE> Million Family March Heads to D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of religious leaders rode into
downtown Washington Friday in the first wave of buses headed to the
nation's capital for the Million Family March, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to serve notice that the masses are on the way,''
proclaimed Benjamin Muhammad, the march's national director.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Family March will be on Oct. 16, the fifth
anniversary of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's Million Man
March.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has called for people of all races and religions to
''rise above their symbols'' and gather at the Washington Mall in
support of the American family. Muhammad, formerly known as Ben
Chavis and a former NAACP director, helped organize the original
march.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 pastors, imams and clerics from Washington met in
Arlington, Va., for a prayer breakfast sponsored by the American
Clergy Leadership Conference Friday morning. Then they rode a bus
together into Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While Muhammad said the march would be nonpolitical and
nonpartisan, he called it ''the largest gathering just before the
national elections, so it will impact the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has asked marchers to withhold their choice for
president until the march, when he hinted that he may endorse a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers would be willing to meet with any national
candidate about making an appearance, Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent these candidates now focus on families is the
extent they may get the attention of the millions of families who
are participating in the Million Family March,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe
Lieberman, the first Jewish politician to run on a major U.S.
political ticket, told American Urban Radio Networks he was open to
meeting Farrakhan to promote reconciliation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim leader campaigns for black empowerment, but has drawn
criticism for statements against whites and Jews. He once called
Judaism a ''gutter religion.''

<HEADLINE> Army Denies Claim of Soldier's Mom  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has denied a $1.8 million wrongful
death claim filed against it by the mother of a soldier murdered in
his barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no legal basis to support payment of the claim,''
Col. John H. Belser, chief of the Army's Tort Claims Division,
wrote in a letter to Patricia Kutteles' attorney and given to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Adam Pachter said he received the letter Friday, and he
vowed to appeal to Army Secretary Louis Caldera within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Kutteles believes an anti-gay atmosphere in the Army led to the
killing of her son, Pfc. Barry Winchell, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Kutteles said fellow soldiers believed Winchell was gay and
harassed him for months before he was beaten to death while
sleeping in his cot July 5, 1999 at Fort Campbell, Ky. The Army
knew about the harassment but did nothing to stop it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very upset and very disappointed and also angry that they
don't care enough about his death to even consider the merits of
the claim,'' Kutteles said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She filed her claim under the Military Claims Act, which is an
administrative procedure that allows people to seek reimbursement
from the military for injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   But the Army letter stated that the Federal Tort Claims Act,
which is a procedure for seeking redress in civilian courts, is the
only way that Kutteles can file her claim.
</P>
<P>
   The letter then stated that Kutteles would not be successful
under the civilian procedure, because of a Supreme Court ruling
that limits the kinds of claims that can be brought against the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider it to be a procedural dodge to avoid the real
issues in this case,'' Pachter said.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Calvin Glover of Sulphur, Okla., was sentenced to life in
prison for murdering Winchell. Another soldier was given a 12&AMP;frac12;-year
sentence for lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The killing prompted criticism of the Pentagon's policy on
homosexuals in the military. Under the policy known as ''don't ask,
don't tell,'' gay members of the military can continue to serve as
long as they keep their sexual orientation a secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general issued a report in July on the
circumstances surrounding Winchell's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The report found evidence of low morale and anti-gay behavior
among members of Winchell's unit, D Company, 2nd Battalion of the
502nd Infantry Regiment. It concluded, however, that the chain of
command at Fort Campbell responded appropriately in enforcing the
''don't ask, don't tell'' policy.

<HEADLINE> Federal health officials expect West Nile to spread outside region  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An increase in the number of migratory bird
species found infected with the West Nile virus has federal health
and wildlife officials concerned about the disease's imminent
spread to regions outside the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not if the virus will move farther south, it's when,''
said Dr. Robert McLean, director of the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. ''This year
already, there's been a tremendous expansion of virus activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said Friday they have tracked the disease from
last summer, when it could be found only in crows in the New York
metropolitan area, until now, when it has spread into Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Guptill, a research scientist for the Geological Survey,
said West Nile virus has also been found in more than 60 bird
species and several species of mammals, including horses, bats and
raccoons
</P>
<P>
   He said officials are now focusing on tracking geographic
information about the disease in an attempt to predict where it
might occur next.
</P>
<P>
   An 82-year-old man from Little Falls in Passaic County was the
first person in the nation to die from the mosquito-borne disease
this year. State officials announced his death Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three other people in New Jersey and 14 in New York have also
tested positive for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   All those tested in New Jersey had symptoms of the disease and
are from areas in the state where the virus has been found in
animals or mosquito pools.
</P>
<P>
   Infected crows have been found in 16 of the state's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Six horses have also tested positive, two each in Atlantic and
Sussex counties and one each in Cape May and Ocean counties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite careful mosquito control efforts and monitoring
throughout New Jersey, at least one state legislator thinks more
must be done.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Norman R. Robertson said he would introduce a bill
Monday calling for $10 million in additional spending for mosquito
control programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator found that throughout each county, the plans and
methodology for fighting and controlling mosquitos varied widely,''
said Joseph Scaperrotta, Robertson's aide.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson wasn't saying ''this person would still be alive in
Little Falls if the county had had a better plan,'' Scaperrotta
said, but rather ''that there at least needs to be some sort of
coordination between the state and the counties.''
</P>
<P>
   The first frosts of the season will likely put a halt to
mosquito breeding, but stepped-up control efforts will continue
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, Essex County scaled back its mosquito
control efforts from a commission with nearly 60 employees to a
small sector of the public works department with only six
employees, according to Larry Furchak, senior mosquito control
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   But West Nile may change such staffing, as it already has
changed budget allocations.
</P>
<P>
   ''While you hate to say it takes a disease to bring people
around, I think a lot of them are afraid to say no to anything we
ask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mosquito control budget in Hudson County doubled
- largely as a result of West Nile - from $200,000 last year to
$400,000 this year, according to county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Vallone, superintendent of the county's mosquito control
program, said he tries to calm residents worried about the disease
even as the four-person staff increases its efforts to combat the
pests and spread information about West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are panicking, asking what does a West Nile mosquito
look like and things like that,'' he said. ''Mosquitoes are not
born with West Nile, they're not born with encephalitis. If a
person contracts the encephalitis, it's a dead end. I tell them to
be concerned, but not alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems.
</P>
<P>
   McClean said while there's so far little cause for panic among
humans, the disease has proven deadly for wildlife populations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Geological Survey and the Center for Disease
Control will return to New Jersey next week to capture birds in
Bergen, Passaic and Sussex counties to get a better sense of the
spread of West Nile through different species.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's increasingly coming up bigger on our radar screen as
we've seen how many species have been involved,'' he said. ''It's
probably one of the most virulent viruses for our native species
that we've seen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet in Washington next
month with a top North Korean official as the United States
accelerates its contacts with the communist government in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 9-12 visit of Cho Myong Nok, the first vice chairman of
North Korea's National Defense Commission, was announced Friday by
the State Department. The statement characterized the visit as ''an
important step forward in promoting bilateral relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho is the highest-ranked North Korea official to come to
Washington. He is considered second in command to the country's
leader, Kim Jong Il, and will be accompanied by Kang Sok Ju, vice
minister of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   American and North Korean negotiators have been meeting since
Wednesday in New York in an effort by the United States to end
North Korea's development and export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks also have been centered on terms of an accord that
froze North Korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for energy
supplies and two civilian reactors, State Department officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's past involvement in terrorism also is on the
agenda, but State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
issue will be dealt with next week.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the talks after three days ''remains positive,''
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be the official host
of Cho's Washington visit, which gives it high status. The
announcement said both sides believe the visit ''will contribute to
the goal of ending the long-standing state of hostility on the
Korean peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit has been under discussion for months. Last January,
North Korea accepted an American invitation to send a senior
official. The visit is reciprocal for the trip former U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry made to Pyongyang in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is believed capable of targeting virtually all of
Japan as well as other Asian countries with its missiles. A
potential long-range missile threat has been cited by the Clinton
administration as one reason for considering a U.S. missile defense
program, but President Clinton has deferred a deployment decision
to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations follows attempts
at reconciliation between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the North's reclusive
leader held a summit meeting in June. Another summit meeting is in
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of missile talks ended in July with North Korea
insisting its program was a sovereign exercise in self-defense, but
also with indications from cash-strapped Pyongyang that it might
curb the program in exchange for payments of about $1 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains that North Korea should not be
compensated for stopping a program it shouldn't be developing in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   High-level negotiators from South and North Korea met Friday in
South Korea to discuss ways to accelerate the shift toward
reconciliation on their divided peninsula and pave the way for a
visit south by Kim Jong Il.

<HEADLINE> White House Embraces Land Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The White House on Friday embraced a
congressional compromise to pump at least $1.6 billion a year into
a new land conservation program over the next six years, although
it's less ambitious than one that gained widespread support
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted with the result,'' said George Frampton,
chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
Barring any ''unanticipated surprises,'' President Clinton will
sign the legislation, which assures a steady funding stream for new
land purchases and other conservation measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is part of a $18.8 billion Interior Department
spending bill that has been the focus of intense negotiations all
week. House and Senate conferees agreed on the conservation package
late Thursday and continued to work on details on Friday with
expected final approved by Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year program calls for spending $1.6 billion this fiscal
year with the amount to grow by $200 million each year for the
following five years. The dedicated funds would have to be approved
by Congress annually but lawmakers could not spend it on any other
program.
</P>
<P>
   While some details remained to be worked out, it includes $450
million for federal land purchases and $150 million additional for
maintenance at parks and other federal lands, Frampton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least $400 million a year -- increasing later to
$600 million -- would be allocated to coastal areas for such
purposes as beach erosion repair and wetlands protection, $160
million for urban parks and historic preservation and $300 million
for wildlife and habitat protection.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the funds represent a roughly doubling of money devoted
to new land purchases and conservation measures, said Rodger
Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife, who called it a
''historic funding initiative for conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   A much more ambitious land conservation program, making
available $3 billion a year for 15 years without annual
congressional approval, had passed the House by a 3-1 margin last
May and gained the support of at least 63 senators.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers involved in deciding spending programs had
objected to that package, known as CARA, because they would have no
say in how the money is spent. A handful of western lawmakers had
opposed that measure because they said the additional spending for
land threatened property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said the compromise falls short of
what he had sought in the CARA legislation, but represents ''a
significant, multiyear dedication of revenues for land, recreation,
wildlife and coastal programs'' that had ''for years been severely
underfunded.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, another co-sponsor, of CARA,
called the compromise a ''smoke and mirrors substitute'' because
there is no assurance Congress annually would appropriate the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton had no such concerns. ''We felt this was the best way
to assure permanent funding,'' he said, adding that there would be
incentive to spend the money each year for the conservation
programs because it could not be spent for anything else.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Bolivia in Coca Battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department expressed strong support
Friday for the Bolivian government's plan to rid the country of
illegal coca.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by spokesman Richard Boucher came amid violent
demonstrations sponsored by coca growers protesting the government
effort. In the past week, 10 people have died and more than 100
have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that apart from eliminating illegal coca, the
Bolivian government also is attempting to attract foreign
investment to generate jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For these reasons, we believe both the demands and the violent
tactics of the coca growers are destructive to Bolivia's national
interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   'We share and fully support President Hugo Banzer's call for
communication and reconciliation and urge all Bolivians to take
heed of the plea by 10,000 women in Cochabamba for peace, dialogue
and cooperation in achieving a brighter future for all Bolivians.''

<HEADLINE> Connecticut attorney general investigates Priceline.com  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state attorney general is
investigating Priceline.com, the Internet name-your-own-price
company, after receiving more than 100 complaints from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Friday that most of the
complaints are from people who bought gasoline and airline tickets
from the Norwalk-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers bought gas at a certain price from Priceline,
only to find out later that it wasn't available at that price at
participating gas stations, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said many consumers bought airline tickets for trips on
certain days, but discovered afterward that Priceline had
restrictions on what days people could fly.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the investigation began about three weeks ago,
and he expects a preliminary finding within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There's no indication so far that the company violated the law,
Blumenthal said. The probe focuses on civil complaints, not
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an ongoing investigation ... concerning claims of
incomplete and inaccurate disclosure about the terms and conditions
of sales, particularly of airline tickets and gasoline,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   If the attorney general finds wrongdoing, he could impose fines
and penalties or obtain court orders against the company,
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline has been cooperating with the investigation, he said.
Priceline spokesman Brian Ek said the company has addressed prior
complaints from the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com warned Wednesday that its third-quarter revenues
are likely to be lower than analyst expectations. The company said
sales for the quarter will range from $340 million to $345 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gasoline and airline tickets, Priceline also
allows customers to purchase groceries, rental cars, hotel rooms
and home mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Japan Officer Charged As Russia Spy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prosecutors on Friday filed charges against a
Japanese naval officer accused of selling defense secrets --
including information about U.S. naval units in Japan -- to a
Russian military attache.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Shigehiro Hagisaki, 38, was arrested earlier this
month as he met in a restaurant with Capt. Victor Bogatenkov, an
official at Tokyo's Russian embassy. Hagisaki later confessed to
selling secrets, news reports say.
</P>
<P>
   Hagisaki was charged with violating the Self-Defense Forces Law,
a statement from the prosecutor's office said. The law prohibits
members of Japan's military from divulging classified security
information. If convicted, he could face up to one year in prison,
or a small fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatenkov, 44, has refused to talk to prosecutors, citing his
diplomatic immunity. He left Japan after Hagisaki's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Foreign Ministry expressed its disappointment Friday to
the Russian embassy and urged Moscow to prevent similar incidents
in the future, a ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador to Japan Alexander Panov responded that he
would not accept the assertion that Bogatenkov had acted
inappropriately, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer advocates object to DPUC approval of NU-ConEd merger  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Consumer advocates on Friday recommended
rejection of the multibillion merger of Northeast Utilities and
Consolidated Edison Inc., saying regulators aren't demanding enough
savings for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Utility Control last week issued a draft
decision to approve the $7.5 billion merger, but required the
companies to offer a variety savings for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the deal offers no real savings and
doesn't benefit the state, while the companies say the draft deal
benefits only consumers and not shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary approval of the merger ordered NU subsidiaries
to cut rates and share high profits with consumers. Friday was the
deadline for all parties to submit written comments.
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-page filing, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said
that by imposing 50 conditions on the deal, the DPUC draft itself
''makes a strong case for rejecting the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the proposed merger presents this number of problems
concerning issues as serious as emergency preparedness and
response, the impact on Connecticut's economy, rates, reliability,
customer service, open space, and market power, then this merger
should not be approved,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A balanced evaluation of the evidence presented in this
proceeding leads inexorably to the conclusion that this merger
should not be allowed to proceed,'' Consumer Counsel Guy Mazza said
in a 26-page filing.
</P>
<P>
   NU's Connecticut Light &AMP; Power division must reduce distribution
rates by 3 percent until the end of 2003, the DPUC said. The
company's rates for electricity, which are subject to competition,
already are frozen until that time.
</P>
<P>
   NU's Yankee Gas division must reduce costs for average customers
by more than 5 percent for a year, the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DPUC's draft decision imposes conditions that depart from
its own precedents and goes far beyond its previous decisions in
other mergers,'' NU said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ''The draft lost sight of the fundamental tenet underlying this
and all mergers - that mergers benefit customers in the long run
and that there needs to be financial incentives for all parties,''
NU said.
</P>
<P>
   Since savings may be even greater from the merger, regulators
said they would review both utilities' rates before the mandated
cuts expire.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed said the rate cuts might mean short-term benefits for
consumers, but added: ''Unfortunately, the proscriptive nature of
much of the draft brings into question the ability of the
applicants to realize many of the potential synergies envisioned by
the merger and reduces their incentive to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Fund for the Environment objected to the DPUC's
failure to include a provision that would protect open space by
giving municipalities the first chance to buy property should the
company decide to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department has failed to incorporate a core condition
necessary to protect the uncertain future of the applicant's
treasure trove of open space holdings,'' CFE staff attorney Curt
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Unions representing workers from the two companies were divided
in opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy it was approved,'' said Stephen Jackson, director
of legislative affairs for Local 420 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 800, or
half, of NU's unionized workers. ''We're pleased with Con Ed
because they're a union company.''
</P>
<P>
   But a union representing some 8,600 Con Ed workers fears that
New York jobs lost through attrition would not be kept in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to do what we can to see that those jobs stay in
New York,'' said Manny Hellen, president of Local 1-2 of the
Utility Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC will hold more hearings before issuing a final decision
Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create the country's largest electricity and
gas utility, with more than 6.5 million customers in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still needs approval from regulators in New Hampshire
and New York, and from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders from both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission have approved
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Vermont either approved the merger or said they would not act on
the plan.

<HEADLINE> Toni Morrison: No Magic Formula  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Toni Morrison says she doesn't
believe in a magic formula for successful writing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is (none), or we would have bottled it and every book
would be a bestseller or very, very good,'' she told a crowd at
Purdue University on Thursday. ''Creative people know instantly, or
at least very quickly, what is best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for ''Beloved,'' the
story of an escaped slave who tries to kill her children rather
than have them returned to bondage. She also won the Nobel Prize
for literature in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said she often begins a book not knowing what the
beginning will be, but she always has an end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writers seem to like chaos in their lives,'' she said. ''They
were created to have this place in the center that is peaceful,
though they create chaos in their writing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A diverse group of actors and directors,
including Jimmy Smits, Billy Dee Williams and James Coburn, are
being honored for their efforts to bring diversity to film and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people will be honored at the eighth annual Multicultural
Motion Picture Awards ceremony on Oct. 23 in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The others are actors Halle Berry, Omar Epps, Diane Ladd and
Greg Kinnear and directors Todd Solondz and Miguel Arteta.
Williams, the gallant star from the ''Star Wars'' series, is being
given the organization's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ''These honorees bring with them a vast array of talent, diverse

<HEADLINE> Four Americans indicted on murder charges British Virgin Islands slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) - The British Virgin
Islands' attorney general on Friday indicted four Americans on
murder charges in the slaying of a Connecticut artist.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Cherno Jallow indicted the four men for the
January murder of Lois Livingston McMillen, 34, of Middlebury,
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Investment broker William Labrador, 36, of Southampton, N.Y.;
law student Michael Spicer, 36, of Albemarle County, Virginia; Evan
George, 23, a construction worker from Washington D.C. and book
publisher Alexander Benedetto, 35, of New York City, were indicted
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the case's preliminary inquiry in August,
Magistrate Gail Charles ruled that Labrador should be charged with
McMillen's murder, and the three others arrested would be charged
as accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The British Caribbean territory's law allows prosecutors to
pursue any charges they perceive from the documents presented from
the preliminary inquiry. It was not clear if Jallow received new
evidence that led to all four being indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, who have maintained innocence, will be arraigned
on Tuesday. They have been denied bail since their arrests Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' ruling followed a preliminary inquiry in which 15
witnesses including police officers and a pathologist testified
from June to August. The inquiry was closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not present DNA evidence then because test
results from Britain had not arrived in time, said government
spokeswoman Sandra Ward. Police seized a bloodstained shirt worn by
Spicer, clothing worn by the other men on the night of McMillen's
killing and three pairs of wet, sandy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen's body was found Jan. 15 along a shore on the island of
Tortola, with her rental car nearby. She had drowned but appeared
to have had a struggle, police said at the time. The men, who said
they had socialized with McMillen days before, denied seeing her on
the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   The artist had been staying in a villa owned by her family on
Tortola and had long known Spicer, who had a house nearby. George,
Labrador and Benedetto were Spicer's house guests.
</P>
<P>
   A murder conviction in the British Virgin Islands carries a
sentence of life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Springer Still Eying Politics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jerry Springer still has a hankering for
politics, but acknowledges that his fight-filled television talk
show might cost him votes if he runs for office again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jerry Springer Show'' may have permanently tainted him in
the eyes of some voters, Springer said after a speech Thursday at
the Ohio AFL-CIO's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people focus on the show, the answer is no. If they focused
on issues, then maybe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cincinnati mayor and 1982 candidate for the governor
has said he might give politics another try. He said he'll consider
running for public office in 2002 -- if the timing seems right.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say what office he might seek but said it probably
would be a federal post because he's interested in national issues.
</P>
<P>
   Springer has often been criticized for the violent content of
his TV show, including fistfights and chair throwing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Sling Blade'' Oscar-winner Billy Bob
Thornton is recuperating at home after being treated at a hospital
for a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, 45, left a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, according
to publicist Michelle Bega, who denied reports that Thornton's ill
health was due to an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-writer-director said several years ago that he once
suffered from anorexia nervosa.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was hospitalized last weekend and his wife, ''Girl,
Interrupted'' Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie, rushed from shooting a
movie in England to be at his side, Bega said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing wonderfully,'' Bega said, adding that Thornton
intends to join Bruce Willis in a couple of weeks to work on the
film ''Bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of
''Sling Blade,'' directed ''Pretty Horses,'' starring Matt Damon
and due for release Christmas Day.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Taliban Discuss Terrorist  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials and representatives of the
Taliban, the religious militia that controls 90 percent of
Afghanistan, held ''frank and straightforward'' discussions about a
fugitive terrorist accused in U.S. embassy bombings, a State
Department spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which also dealt with a possible peace settlement and
human rights, followed discussions the previous day between the
same U.S. officials and Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah, a
representative of the ousted government that controls 10 percent of
the country. Abdullah uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban did not raise the issue of recognition by the United
States, said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and Assistant Secretary
of State Karl Rick Inderfurth held talks with the Taliban
delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abdur Rahman Zahid.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides discussed Osama bin Laden, believed to have found
sanctuary in Afghanistan and accused by the United States of
masterminding the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Boucher declined to say if the United States raised the possibility
of having the Taliban expel bin Laden to a third country for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
recognize the Taliban government, which has imposed a rigid form of
Islamic law. The United States, Russia and other U.N. members
states have opposed Taliban representation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sanctions were imposed on Afghanistan in November 1999
barring flights to or from the areas the Taliban controls. Boucher
said the United States and Russia were discussing adding more
measures.

<P>
   Bars, restaurants and hotels will be required to restrict
smoking to designated, walled-off areas, where a health warning
must be posted. Retailers who sell tobacco also must post warnings.

<HEADLINE> EPA delivers report following House Republican's subpoena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - One day after being subpoenaed by a leading
House Republican, the Environmental Protection Agency delivered a
draft analysis of acid rain legislation, a report long been sought
by officials in heavily affected New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Perciasepe, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office
of Air and Radiation told the Associated Press late Friday that the
report had been delivered to Rep. Dan Burton's office, in
compliance with the Indiana congressman's formal request.
</P>
<P>
   Perciasepe added that there was ''nothing particularly
remarkable'' about the report and said the subpoena was an unusual
way of making such a request.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first time they asked for it and of course we
handed it over to them,'' Parciasepe said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's office could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   New York state lawmakers have reportedly been seeking the report
- a cost benefit analysis of proposed acid rain and ozone control
legislation - for six months, with Sen. Daniel Moynihan first
requesting a cost review in 1998. EPA officials on Friday said the
requests had not been directed directly to them until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report has been sitting in the Office of Management and
Budget since being completed in March.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA's summary of the report, the ''Acid
Deposition and Ozone Control Act'' would have cost benefits of $60
billion thanks to reduced incidences of cardiovascular and
respiratory ailments, less damage to buildings and an estimated
$1.2 billion per year in visibility improvements to national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan along with Republican Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and John
Sweeney are the main sponsors of legislation to reduce emissions of
the acid rain-causing pollutants nitrogen and sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   The New York lawmakers are hopeful the report will provide them
with ammunition to push legislation unpopular with Midwestern
lawmakers through Congress. Much of the nitrogen and sulfur
pollution originates at Midwestern coal burning plants and is then
carried east on prevailing winds.

<HEADLINE> Jury acquits 18-year-old of setting fire that killed 12 horses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A jury cleared an 18-year-old man of
charges he deliberately set a barnyard blaze that killed a dozen
horses, accepting the defense's contention the man's confession may
have been forced.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Furgal's acquittal came after 10&AMP;frac12; hours of deliberation
over two days, deliberations that were broken by requests to hear
portions of various witnesses' testimony read back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what caused the jury to reject the confession was the
fact that there was no evidence linking him to the crime,'' Defense
Attorney Dennis Claus said. ''The jury believed the confession to
be involuntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Furgal, of Nedrow 5 miles south of Syracuse, was charged with
third- and fourth-degree arson and unjustifiably killing an animal
in the Dec. 6 fire at the Quarry Ridge Stables.
</P>
<P>
   Furgal worked as a laborer at the stables and was allegedly
angry at Lori Lorini, a woman who owned the horses and leased the
barn.
</P>
<P>
   Furgal initially told detectives the fire started accidentally
when he spilled some gasoline on an incinerator near the barn. He
later admitted intentionally setting the fire by pouring a trail of
gasoline from the incinerator to the barn.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, defense attorney Dennis Claus tried to cast
Lorini as a suspect. The stable's owner, Philip Bowen told the jury
that he first suspected Lorini had started the fire because of
prior arson threats she had made to him. Bowen testified that
Lorini also later threatened to burn his farmhouse because he was
pursuing an investigation into the barn fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Bowen testified that Lorini was upset with her father after
learning that he was competing with her to buy and sell horses for
a profit.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia, Coca Growers Begin Talks  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Coca-leaf producers and government
officials began negotiations late Friday after days of violent
protests and roadblocks that have choked Bolivia and left 10 dead
and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   The protests are the worst since Bolivia returned to democracy
in 1982, causing more than $100 million in losses to South
America's poorest economy, disrupting commerce, and leaving
hundreds of trucks and buses stranded on country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations in the city of Santa Cruz involved Evo Morales, the
head of the leading coca-leaf producing organization, three Cabinet
ministers and members of the country's Roman Catholic clergy, who
acted as mediators. Striking teachers have not agreed to a dialogue
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The two main protests have been by teachers demanding a
50-percent wage hike and by farmers of coca-leaf, the basis for
cocaine. The farmers object to the government's plan to eradicate
their crops by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers and police continued Friday to confront
farmers to end the roadblocks but to no avail. There were no
reports of violence Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks began two weeks ago in the Chapare, a lush
tropical region 380 miles east of La Paz, after coca farmers led by
Morales demanded that the government end the eradication of coca
plants and plans to build three military barracks in the region.
The roadblocks then spread to the Bolivian Andean highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables and fruits have nearly disappeared from city markets
while meat, dairy and some food products are being flown in from
producing areas.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Offers Rebels Amnesty  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The president of the Philippines
offered amnesty Friday to Muslim guerrillas in an effort to curtail
a decades-old secessionist rebellion that has killed more than
120,000 people in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel spokesman rejected the offer from President Joseph
Estrada, calling it propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada offered the amnesty to members and supporters of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger of two rebel groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller but more radical Abu Sayyaf group, which is holding
17 hostages on southern Jolo island, was not offered amnesty. The
government considers the Abu Sayyaf to be a group of bandits. A
massive military effort was launched two weeks ago to rescue the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty offer will be open for six months after it is
approved by Congress, which is controlled by the Estrada
administration, presidential spokesman Ricardo Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu dismissed the offer and promised the
rebels would remain ''steadfast'' in their bid for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic rebels regard the southern Mindanao region as a
homeland for Muslims in the Philippines. It is rich in natural
resources, but wracked by poverty and violence, which the military
blames on the MILF.
</P>
<P>
   The government recently renewed efforts to resume peace talks
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's national security adviser Alexander Aguirre estimated
there are 14,000 to 15,000 MILF rebels.

<HEADLINE> Pataki announces program to preserve barns  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Old barns, though no longer practical for
modern farming purposes, should be preserved as monuments to the
state's agricultural heritage, Gov. George Pataki said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor launched the New York State Barns Restoration and
Preservation Program to help pay for the renovations of barns and
other aging farm buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million program will help pay for as much as 80 percent
of the cost of repairs, up to $25,000 per project, to the roofs,
foundations, walls and sills of farm structures. Owners must pay
the other 20 percent in cash or labor.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings must be at least 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the best scenery in New York state features historic
farm buildings that remind us of our heritage,'' Pataki, who grew
up on a farm in Peekskill, said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, R-Onondaga, sponsored the
legislation in her chamber. She said old farm buildings are
''symbols of cultural lifestyles of earlier generations'' in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the structures are like ''cathedrals,'' Hoffmann said,
built meticulously by craftsmen in eras before power tools.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced the parameters of the program during an
appearance Friday at the Anken family farm in Rome, about 35 miles
east of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
will administer the program. Pataki's office said priority will be
given to certain projects when making grants - that structures are
being improved for active agricultural use; are visible from scenic
highways or are fixtures in rural landscapes; or are on or eligible
for state and national registers of historic places.
</P>
<P>
   The older the buildings are, the better their chances at
qualifying for the program, Pataki's office said.
</P>
<P>
   One-time farm buildings being converted for non-agricultural
purposes will not be eligible under the Barns Restoration and
Preservation Program.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed projects will also be reviewed by the state
Department of Agriculture and Markets before being approved.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for the program will be available starting Oct. 15
at regional state parks offices around the state. More information
is available at Albany headquarters of the parks office
518-486-1868 or at the agency's website at www.nyparks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Applications must be received by the state by Dec. 15, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Joyce, Isaac weaken; Keith forms out of depression off Yucatan  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK REYNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - Tropical Storm Keith swirled to life Friday in the
northwest Caribbean from a depression that has been soaking much of
Central America. It was drifting northward and was expected to be a
hurricane by Sunday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The torrential rains were expected to continue well into the
weekend as the storm intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest threat is for northeastern Mexico,'' said Eric
Blake, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''Right now, there's a hurricane watch along the east of Yucatan
from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Keith would move into the Yucatan Channel between Cuba
and the Yucatan Peninsula ''over the next two to three days.'' The
channel leads to the southern Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. EDT, Keith was centered near 17.7 north latitude, 85.3
west longitude. That's about 290 miles south of the western tip of
Cuba, or 225 miles south-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Its top winds, just 35 mph earlier Friday, were up to 50 mph,
well over the threshold of 39 mph at which it became a tropical
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect intensification,'' Blake said. ''It could become a
hurricane over the next couple of days, but it's too early to tell
whether it'll be a threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith has been drifting toward the northwest, but was expected
to move slowly toward the north-northwest near 3 mph later Friday
night and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous emergency managers in southwest Florida were already
eyeing the developing storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only about 600 miles away ... and poses a definite
threat to southwest Florida over the next week,'' said a statement
issued by Collier County officials in Naples. ''Any acceleration
would obviously reduce our response time, and intensification
increases the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joyce, which became a hurricane Wednesday, weakened
into a tropical storm Friday and kept losing steam, with top
sustained winds of 60 mph - well below the 74 mph threshold needed
to remain a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce continued a steady march westward across the Atlantic
and residents in the Lesser Antilles were reminded to watch its
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could very well become a hurricane again,'' said Robert
Molleda, a meteorologist at the center. ''It's right at that
threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Joyce was centered near 10.5 north latitude, 51.0
west longitude or about 605 miles east-southeast of Barbados in the
Windward Islands. It was moving west at near 16 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hurricane Isaac's top sustained winds dropped back to
105 mph as it continued moving across an open sea, a threat only to
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Isaac was near 33.7 north latitude, 55.8 west
longitude, or about 525 miles east-northeast of Bermuda. It was
moving north at about 17 mph, with a turn north-northeastward
forecast during the coming 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said it should pass well east of Bermuda.

<HEADLINE> Foresters: Spend to Prevent Fires  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- State foresters say it makes a lot more sense
to spend millions a year to prevent fires than a billion plus to
put them out as happened in the fire season just past, which saw
nearly 7 million acres burn.
</P>
<P>
   Forest dwellers won't like the conclusions reached in a draft
report by the National Association of State Foresters, which says
people who build houses in forests should be ready to lose them to
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make sense to spend millions to save property worth
thousands, says the report which was prompted by the 1994 fire
season which was the most expense in history to that time at $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the 2000 fires will cost $1.6
billion for fire fighting and forest repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''An immediate influx of money at the time of the crisis isn't
going to resolve the crisis,'' said Donald Smith, Connecticut's
state forester. ''The real need is for careful planning and funding
of rebuilding of the nation's fire suppression structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith heads a subcommittee of the foresters group. At its
national meeting Monday, the group will urge cutting the cost of
fighting fires as a priority second only to keeping firefighters
safe.
</P>
<P>
   But there are big conflicts between the fire preventers and the
land owners who don't want the government clearing underbrush in
their forests. Even more controversial is deciding what buildings
and land to save from fire and what to let burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these issues that we raise in the report are real
sensitive,'' said Montana State Forester Donald Artley, who saw
945,519 acres of his state burn this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The politically expedient, but more expensive, approach has been
to try to stop the fire's advance. But it might not be the safest
one, Artley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe you give up some ground to give yourself a better chance
of success from a more defensible position,'' he said. ''And, of
course, you take the criticism, because somebody owns those
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally difficult is the decision whether to save homes when it
endangers firefighters and takes equipment from the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will the lasting impression (from this fire season) be one of,
'Fire departments are going to come in and park a fire engine in my
front yard so we don't really need to worry?'
</P>
<P>
   If so, Artley said, ''We've just shot ourselves in the foot
because we have spent millions of dollars protecting thousands of
dollars of value.'' The foresters report says the vast majority of
Americans have never experienced the fury of an uncontrolled fire
and think, incorrectly, that fire fighters will be able to protect
them and their property.
</P>
<P>
   Removing years of accumulated brush, dead or dying trees and
stunted saplings is critical both to forest health and to wildfire
prevention. But, the group says, that kind of spending is not
popular with either politicians or taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 report by the General Accounting Office identified 39
million acres that need thinning at an estimated cost of $725
million.
</P>
<P>
   Artley calls it a ''tragedy waiting for a match.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from the government, the company that makes

all of this year's crop of the grain to keep it from getting into the food
supply. Federal officials say there is no known health risk from the corn
produced by Aventis CropScience, but it has not been approved for human

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government opened an investigation today into another

accidents in which two people died and 12 were injured. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said it has received 167 complaints about the
Steeltex R4S and A/T light truck tires since Aug. 1. The tires are original
equipment on Ford F250 and F350 pickups, the Ford Excursion, General Motors'
Suburban and G Van, a commercial vehicle. ''The majority of the complaints
occurred at highway speeds and allege a blowout, tread separation or other major
failure,'' NHTSA said.

Federal Gov't Won't Appeal Marijuana Ruling
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government will not appeal an Ontario
court ruling that struck down marijuana laws because they don't
allow for medicinal use, a Justice spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government made the decision Thursday, a week after Health
Minister Allan Rock announced he would make changes to regulations
that would allow Canadians access to marijuana for medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in July that Canadian laws
prohibiting possession of marijuana failed to recognize that pot
can be used for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The court gave Ottawa a year to change the law, after which
there would be no law prohibiting possession in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Rock said last week the new approach, once in place, would
define the circumstances and the manner in which use of marijuana
will be allowed for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Canadians can apply to the government for exemption
from the law for medical purposes with the supervision of a doctor.
Supreme Court: Mimimum Sentence in Shotgun Killing Constitutional
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A mandatory minimum jail sentence of four years
for a deadly shotgun mishap is constitutional, the Supreme Court of
Canada ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Lorraine Morrisey of Belmont, Nova Scotia, admitted he
accidentally shot his friend, Adrian Teed, in the head with a
sawed-off shotgun on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Criminal Code says anyone found guilty of criminal
negligence causing death using a firearm must be sentenced to a
minimum of four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances, Morrisey argued that amounted to cruel
and unusual punishment, a violation of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court judge Charles Gonthier disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The offense of criminal negligence causing death requires
proof of wanton and reckless disregard for the lives and safety of
other people -- a high threshold to pass,'' he wrote in a 7-0
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This offense does not punish accidents. Nor does it punish the
merely unfortunate. It punishes those who use firearms in a manner
that represents a marked departure from the standard of care
employed by a reasonable person, resulting in death. It is no
trivial matter, and Parliament has treated it accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrisey pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death and
unlawfully pointing a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to two years in jail, but Crown lawyers weren't
satisfied, and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal imposed the
four-year minimum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling upholds that decision, but says one year should
be knocked off for time served in pre-trial custody.
Final Arguments in Murder Trial To Begin
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Final arguments in the first-degree
murder trial of Dr. Abraham Cooper will begin Monday after more
than three weeks of witnesses and exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 61, is charged with the first-degree murder of fellow
physician Dr. Doug Snider in Fairview, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Snider was reported missing by his wife on May 5, 1999, the day
before his 60th birthday, after he failed to return from what she
said was a meeting with Cooper. Snider's body has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Court has heard several witnesses testify about bad blood among
the doctors practicing in Fairview, a small town in northwestern
Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   There was aggressive competition for patients, professional
disagreements about treatment, and drug and alcohol problems on
Snider's part, jurors have heard.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA expert has testified a mixture of Snider's and Cooper's
blood was found on a shirt seized from Cooper and that DNA matching
Snider's was found on one of Cooper's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Other testimony revealed blood was found on the walls and carpet
of Cooper's clinic in Fairview as well as in his car, in a sink and
on paper towels found in the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown alleges Cooper murdered Snider in his office after
violently forcing Snider to write a confession on the evening of
May 5, 1999, admitting to a conspiracy to ruin Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Queen's Bench jury has been told Cooper's goal was
to use the confession as evidence to advance his legal action
against Snider and two other Fairview doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's lawyer has suggested Snider faked his own death to set
up Cooper as the fall guy for his murder. He called two witnesses
who said they met Snider at a coffee shop in Golden, British
Columbia, a few days after he went missing.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's lawyer says Snider is still alive and fled Fairview to
escape the $3.2 million lawsuit Cooper filed against his
colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Leaders Praise Bush Oil Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan to open up
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain to oil drilling
drew praise from state politicians and oil companies Friday, while
opponents warned it would harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush understands energy policy and what is needed to
make this country less dependent on foreign oil,'' Republican Sen.
Frank Murkowski said in a press release. ''Oil development on a
tiny sliver of Alaska's coastal plain will have no negative effect
on Alaska's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate, speaking at a factory in
Saginaw, Mich., said Friday he supports opening 1.5 million acres
of the refuge to drilling to decrease the United States' dependence
on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the oil reserves there range as high as 10 billion
barrels, but only one well has been drilled there, and results of
that well have been kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances ''have dramatically decreased the
environmental impact of oil and gas exploration,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   BP oil company spokesman Ronnie Chappell said the new technology
makes it possible to explore for oil without harming the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will certainly have a physical presence on the land, but
that presence can be managed in a way that the wildlife population
that use those areas can continue to use those areas,'' he said.
''We can explore for oil without leaving a footprint on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, speaking from the Audubon Society's
preserve just outside Washington, said Bush wanted to let oil
companies ''invade precious natural treasures'' in Alaska and
elsewhere. He said, if elected, he would ''not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to degrade our environment in order to secure
our energy future,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Callaghanchapell, the Sierra Club's spokeswoman in Alaska,
said it would be shortsighted and wrong to drill in the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't drill our way to energy independence,'' she said.
''The Arctic refuge is an Alaska treasure that should not be
sacrificed for a short term supply of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Alaska politicians, including Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles,
have strongly supported the idea of drilling in the refuge.

<HEADLINE> Bungling Colombia Smugglers Captured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Trying to elude a pursuing U.S. Navy
frigate, a bungling speedboat crew allegedly smuggling cocaine went
a bit overboard.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre incident reported by Colombia's navy on Friday and
confirmed by the U.S. Coast Guard, the five-man crew began hurling
dozens of boxes of pure cocaine into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Then their strategy took an oddball turn.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to wash away any traces of the white powder,
the men stripped and doused themselves with gasoline, the navy
reported.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason then, the crew turned their 36-foot boat toward
the USS De Wert, a 453-foot guided missile frigate. The speedboat
crashed into the ship, caught fire and sank, leaving one of the
crew members with burns and broken bones, Colombian navy spokesman
Juan Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. seaman plucked the five suspects out of the ocean and
handed them over to Colombian authorities along with about a ton of
cocaine, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
   The San-Diego based USS De Wert, which had a Coast Guard crew
aboard, suffered no damage, Coast Guard spokesman Paul Rhynard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-seas capture took place Wednesday near the Colombian
Island of Malpelo, some 450 miles northwest of the Pacific port of
Buenaventura.

<HEADLINE> Eddie Wins on CBS' 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 88-day endurance test is over. Eddie
McGee, the blunt New Yorker who lost his left leg to cancer, won a
half million dollars as the survivor on the CBS reality show, ''Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show overwhelmingly chose the University of Texas
student over the other two remaining contestants, New York lawyer
Curtis Kin and Californian Josh Souza, in a live telecast on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wild,'' he said after learning he won. ''My heart is
pumping so hard. I have to remind myself to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlasted nine other contestants who entered the specially
built house July 5 on a California soundstage. Their every move was
followed by cameras and microphones, with the frequently dull
results airing as much as six nights a week on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Souza, who gave McGee a warm hug, won $100,000 as the
second-place finisher. Kin won $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The brash McGee, a wheelchair basketball star, alienated some of
his fellow contestants with his blunt talk and determination. He
said Friday, though, that he never expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   McGee said he hoped to pay off some debts and help his brother
with his college education.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to look forward to having a real great holiday
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to an end a series that never proved as successful in
the United States as it did in other countries, largely because
American viewers never warmed to the cast members and were bored
with their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   While a critical bust, ''Big Brother'' was a modest financial
success for CBS. Over its run, the show's average of 9.1 million
viewers was 9 percent higher than summer reruns fared in the same
time slots a year ago. But it did much better among young viewers
that advertisers love and CBS often can't attract.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting contestants were voted out quickly. First
to go was William Collins, who engaged the gang in provocative
racial discussions and was later found to be a member of the New
Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for romance and conflict, producers found little of
either. The only kiss shared by McGee in a highlight reel shown
Friday was with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, producers tried to entice someone to leave
the house with an offer of $50,000. They hoped to replace a less
exciting contestant with an attractive and combative young blonde
woman, but none of the occupants took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, six remaining houseguests talked about walking out
en masse. That idea fizzled, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the final female contestant, former Seattle beauty contest
winner Jamie, was voted out on Wednesday, viewers were left to
choose by telephone vote among the three men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS and the show's producers were reportedly discussing a
second ''Big Brother'' run for sometime next year. Networks are
trying to stockpile reality shows in anticipation of a potential
actors strike next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased with the ratings the show has delivered and we
do see tremendous potential in the concept,'' CBS spokesman Chris
Ender said. ''But there's no official word regarding another
edition.''

<HEADLINE> Wolcott forfeits game in wake of hazing incident. Moving on both news and sports lines </HEADLINE>
prhofons
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOLCOTT, Conn. (AP) - Wolcott High School forfeited its football
game Friday against Watertown in the wake of a hazing scandal that
resulted in the arrest of eight team members.
</P>
<P>
   The players were arrested earlier this week on charges they beat
three freshmen players with a plastic baseball bat during a hazing
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty additional team members were suspended Thursday after
participating in a protest before school to show support for their
teammates, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions issued Thursday left the team with just 14
players, only two or three of whom have varsity experience, said
Joe Monroe, Wolcott's athletic director and head football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight players facing criminal charges, including
three team captains, were arraigned in Waterbury Superior Court on
Friday. The eighth player, 15 when the alleged hazing occurred, was
to appear in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the players have been removed from the football team,
Superintendent Thomas Smyth announced. One has already served a
10-day school suspension; the rest were suspended for 10 days each,
effective Thursday. Two other players face lesser charges in the
incidents and will sit out the next four games. They were each
suspended for five days and ordered to perform 10 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Tom Decelles, Jason Lush, Brett Morrone, Lamont Ward and
Mark Dorais were charged with one count each of second-degree
unlawful restraint, third-degree assault, conspiracy to commit
second-degree unlawful restraint and conspiracy to commit
third-degree assault. Christopher Pace and Douglas Ashe of Wolcott
were charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit
second-degree unlawful restraint and conspiracy to commit
third-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, a team captain, was the starting quarterback. Morrone
started as tailback and Ashe, the third captain, was a wide
receiver and defensive back. Dorais was a tight end and linebacker,
Ward a wide receiver and Lush was a nose tackle.

President Al Gore shot back that former oilman Bush just wanted to let oil
companies ''invade precious natural treasures like the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.''

Maryland Adopts Bullet ID System
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Beginning on Sunday, with every new handgun sold in
Maryland, the manufacturer will have to give state police a spent shell casing
carrying the weapon's ballistic fingerprint. Under the law -- the first of its
kind in the nation -- the unique markings on the casing will then be entered
into a database. When detectives find a bullet casing at a crime scene, they can
go to the computer and instantly identify the gun it came from. ''Countless
hours of investigative work can now be eliminated from the process of
identifying the crime gun and who may have been in possession of it,'' State
Police Superintendent David Mitchell said. A similar New York state law takes
effect March 1.

Feds Probe Another Firestone Tire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government opened an investigation today into another
brand of Firestone tires after receiving reports that they were involved in
accidents in which two people died and 12 were injured. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said it has received 167 complaints about the
Steeltex R4S and A/T light truck tires since Aug. 1. The tires are original
equipment on Ford F250 and F350 pickups, the Ford Excursion, General Motors'
Suburban and G Van, a commercial vehicle. ''The majority of the complaints
occurred at highway speeds and allege a blowout, tread separation or other major
failure,'' NHTSA said.

''The type of severity or magnitude (of the punishment) has not been determined

Euro Trouble May Split Europe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Denmark's rejection of the single European currency
is more than a desire to hang on to the 125-year old krone, it's the gut fear of
being swallowed up by the continent's powerhouses. More significantly, it could
be the beginning of what some call a ''two-speed Europe.'' European Union
officials insisted the 53 percent to 47 percent vote in Thursday's referendum
against joining the European Monetary Union wouldn't hurt the euro on foreign
exchange markets -- and it didn't in Friday's trading. But the real question
wasn't money, it was the entire direction and speed of European integration.

<HEADLINE> Bush Prepares for Debate at Ranch  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush is hunkering down at his
ranch for a weekend of debate preparation, but it won't exactly be
a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he'll be standing behind a lectern during at least one
90-minute practice session against ''Al Gore,'' played by Sen. Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire. But he'll be doing it in his own laid-back
style -- in a T-shirt and jeans -- at the ranch near Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides, including communications director Karen Hughes and
media adviser Stuart Stevens, will observe and offer tips during
the sessions, to be held in what they call ''the bunker'' -- a
building that's usually used as an exercise room. A stationary bike
and bunk beds will be shoved off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   ''There aren't very many frills except coffee,'' Hughes said
Friday. ''We usually sit on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The informality contrasts with the real thing: the candidates'
first debate Tuesday night in Boston. The candidates will appear
behind lecterns of prescribed 48-inch height, responding to
questions from moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS and abiding by strict
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been trying hard to lower expectations for
the Texas governor's performance so he will be more likely to look
good by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know that the vice president is a world-class
debater,'' Hughes said. ''He is acknowledged to be the most
experienced debater in American politics today and we expect that
he'll have some of the best lines that Hollywood can write at his
disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also tried to plant an expectation that Gore wouldn't debate
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that one of the problems of debating a lot is that
people catch on to your tricks,'' she said. ''Governor Bush is
prepared for the vice president to misrepresent his record.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hughes said, Bush will go into the debate
''speaking from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Each man debated his primary election rivals 10 times. Bush also
debated opponents in campaigning for the Texas governorship,
including incumbent Ann Richards, who Gore has repeatedly said is a
much better debater than he.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush practiced in Texas and Gore prepared in Florida this
weekend, a controversy over the governor's previous practice
sessions shadowed both campaigns. The FBI is investigating how a
copy of a videotape of Bush's other practice sessions, along with
some debate strategy documents, was sent to Gore headquarters in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, a federal law enforcement official requesting
anonymity said the FBI is still investigating the possibility that
an employee of Bush's media consultant had sent the package of
debate materials despite her denials.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Yvette Lozano, told the FBI that the package she
mailed on Sept. 11 contained Gap pants that she was returning for
her boss. On Thursday, she told ABC News that FBI agents earlier
that day had taken a second set of fingerprints from her and had
seized her computer.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Tom Downey received the material and said he
immediately turned it over to the FBI. Hughes said Friday, ''We
hope that others in the Gore campaign did not see the materials.''

<HEADLINE> US, Britain: Indonesia Can Lose Aid  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain joined the United States in
warning Indonesia on Friday that it risked losing foreign aid if it
doesn't disarm militias in West Timor and arrest those responsible
for slaying three U.N. aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock told the U.N. Security
Council that Britain would find it difficult to continue extending
support to Indonesia at an upcoming donor meeting in Tokyo, unless
action was taken against the militias.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen warned during a Sept. 18
visit to Jakarta that Indonesia risked losing financial assistance
if it didn't move to break up the militias.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was laid waste by anti-independence milita groups
after its people overwhelmingly voted to break from Indonesia in a
U.N.-sponsored ballot last year.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries are now intent on destabilizing
U.N.-administered East Timor's transition to self-rule and
preventing 120,000 East Timorese refugees who sought safety in
Indonesian-held West Timor from returning home. Three U.N. aid
workers in the West Timor border town of Atambua were slain by a
milita mob on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. administrator for East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello,
told ambassadors that the militias must be disarmed, disbanded and
their leaders must be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regrettably, I remain skeptical that current activities will
achieve this goal,'' de Mello said. ''Where resolution and a
certain degree of ruthlessness would seem to be required, we are
witnessing hesitation and prevarication.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian Ambassador Marakim Wibisono bristled at the
criticism. He said the slain workers had ignored Indonesian warning
to leave Atambua ''and hence could not be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's statement came after a two-day security crackdown
against militias in West Timor netted only 21 weapons. Peter
Kessler, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
East Timor, dismissed the effort as ''a real disappointment.''
Wibisono defended the operation, saying a greater number of weapons
had been collected prior to the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Many militiamen have fled the region's towns for militia
strongholds, vowing to defy the government's order for them to give
up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian police said about 1,000 armed officers and soldiers
were deployed to nine militia strongholds on Thursday across West
Timor to clamp down on the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Militiamen in the regional capital of Kupang voluntarily handed
over an array of arms that included grenades, automatic rifles and
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   The militias also surrendered some weapons last week the
handover came to a halt after a clash on Sunday between security
forces and the militias.

   WESTWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Nat Fein, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his
poignant shot of a dying Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium, died Tuesday.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for The New York Herald for about 30 years, starting
out as a copy boy before becoming a staff photographer in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Fein won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for a photo that was taken June
13, 1948, two months before Ruth died of cancer. The rearview
picture shows Ruth in his old uniform, leaning on a bat, and other
players lined up in the background with their hats off.
</P>
<P>
   Fein recalled that he had gone behind Ruth because he wanted to
show the number on his uniform -- No. 3 -- that was being retired.
</P>
<P>
   He remained at the Herald until it went out of business in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Fein is survived by a son.

<P>
   LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Kent Foster, who worked his way from
reporter to editor during a 40-year career at the Lewiston Daily
Sun and Sun Journal after it combined with the city's other daily
newspaper, died Thursday of a heart attack. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He started his journalism career writing for the United Press
International's Boston office before joining the Army as a member
of the Army Corps of Engineers in Europe. Foster moved back to
Maine after he left the Army in 1945 to work as a reporter for the
Lewiston Daily Sun.
</P>
<P>
   He was serving as city editor of the Sun before it combined with
the Evening Journal in the '80s to create the Sun Journal. The Sun
was the larger of the two papers, and Foster oversaw both papers
when he was hired as editor in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Foster retired from his post as editor in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children and
two grandchildren.
James D. ''Mike'' McKevitt:
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Former Congressman James D. ''Mike'' McKevitt, a
Republican who represented Denver for two years, died Thursday
after suffering a heart attack. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt, who also served as Denver's district attorney, was
defeated in 1972 by former Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Democrat who went
on to represent Denver for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   He attended law school at the University of Denver. When the
Denver district attorney died in 1967, Gov. John Love appointed
McKevitt to the post. He kept the office in the 1968 election.
</P>
<P>
   As district attorney, he made headlines for closing a movie
theater playing the controversial movie ''I Am Curious (Yellow)''
and for threatening to close restaurants that served hippies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he took advantage of a split among Democrats to win the
Denver-based 1st Congressional District. But he proved too
conservative for his district.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office in 1973, he joined President Nixon's
Justice Department as assistant attorney general for legislative
affairs. He was also counsel to the energy policy office in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt returned to private practice, eventually serving as
head of the Washington office of the National Federation of
Independent Business for 10 years.
Pete Schmidt:
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Pete Schmidt, Indiana's offensive
coordinator and quarterbacks coach, died Friday after a yearlong
battle with cancer. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt previously was head coach at Albion (Mich.) College from
1983-96. His teams compiled a 106-26-5 record, earned five
conference championships and won the 1994 Division III national
championship. He won the division's national coach of the year
award.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Pledges Military Support  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Wy. (AP) -- Dick Cheney flew to his home in Wyoming with
key advisers Friday for a weekend of intensive preparations for
next week's vice presidential debate with Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's running mate got right to work as he ended a
week of campaigning in battleground states, huddling with three
counselors -- tapped to coach, advise and critique Cheney -- during a
3&AMP;frac12;-hour flight from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Cheney on his plane was Dave Gribben, a longtime
friend who worked for Cheney when he was secretary of defense and
is currently head of government relations at Halliburton, the
Dallas-based oil services company that Cheney ran from 1995 until
retiring in August.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Jim Steen, Cheney's former legislative director
when he was a House member during the 1980s and 1990s, and Gus
Puryear, an attorney and former GOP Hill staffer.
</P>
<P>
   To assist Cheney in preparing for the debate, the advisers have
been studying videotapes of Lieberman, Democrat Al Gore's running
mate, on talk shows and giving speeches on the Senate floor.
They've also immersed themselves in Lieberman's legislative record
and his position on the issues to prepare a debate strategy, which
aides declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is playing Lieberman in practice
sessions, will join Cheney Saturday morning, said Juleanna Glover
Weiss, Cheney's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's staff has already made one videotape of a practice
session and plan to make others this weekend to help fine-tune
Cheney's performance. The tapes are recorded by staffers, said
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   A tape of Bush practicing for his debate made by a media company
hired by the campaign was sent to the Gore campaign, sparking an
FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Florida earlier Friday, Cheney said a Republican
administration would give America's armed forces the equipment and
spirit it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   On a second day of touring Florida cities with Navy bases,
Cheney pledged higher military morale under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will make sure that the military has everything it needs to
return to its former glory and has a commander in chief it can be
proud of,'' said Cheney, defense secretary under Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Morale will improve when you get a new commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of about 1,500 military
veterans and supporters at the Jacksonville fairgrounds. The city
is home to the Jacksonville Naval Air Station and Mayport Naval
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the military better than it was eight years ago?'' Cheney
asked. The crowd shouted, ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only 60 percent of the Army's combat helicopters are
ready for action, and the Air Force's combat readiness has sunk to
65 percent from 85 percent 10 years ago. The military often can't
get spare parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't been able to take advantage of the revolution in
technology because we are working with old equipment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in an online interview with ABC News and The New York
Times, said voters are likely to place great importance on the
coming campaign debates --three between the presidential candidates
and one Thursday between Democrat Joseph Lieberman and him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the advice I get is, be yourself,'' he said. ''You've
got to come across as straight.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Americans have not known him that well since the Persian
Gulf War and the debate will be a reintroduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will make their own judgments and I am very comfortable
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also spoke in the interview of his past opposition to
many of the U.S. sanctions placed on other countries, especially
economic sanctions that the United States exercises unilaterally.
He said sanctions against Iraq have been relatively effective
because many countries are behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But usually, he said, ''it's driven by domestic political
considerations at home.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Sets Sights on New Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Political tensions eased Friday as fears of a
military coup subsided and government officials and opposition
leaders set their sights on special elections to end President
Alberto Fujimori's 10-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Federico Salas told reporters Friday that the new
elections probably will occur between March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we're looking ahead,'' Salas told a gathering
of foreign correspondents. ''I don't want to believe the
possibility of a coup exists in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders and the government announced an agreement
late Thursday to establish a definite date for new elections by
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, hammered out in talks mediated by the Organization of
American States, followed Congress' vote approving the quick
dismantling of the National Intelligence Service, run by exiled spy
chief Vladimiro Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a military revolt intensified this week after an
opposition lawmaker who had defected to Fujimori's ranks alleged
that top army commanders were plotting a coup to allow Montesinos'
return from Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The army high command called the allegations ''completely
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to lessen tensions was the end Friday of a 10-day
truckers strike that had led to violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced Sept. 16 that he was ending his 10-year
presidency with new elections and was deactivating his spy chief's
espionage agency after a videotape aired apparently showing the
intelligence adviser bribing an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The decision caused an apparent power struggle between Fujimori
and his once-trusted aide, who fled Peru to seek political asylum
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori says he plans to stay in office until July, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama Friday, President Mireya Moscoso said she will decide
within the next 12 days whether to grant asylum to Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from the Organization of American States to
accept Montesinos and thereby defuse a potential crisis in Peru,
Moscoso said she was still weighing the pros and cons of the asylum
request.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Police Arrest Gang Members  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL EASTERBROOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police said they arrested 22 members of
a Medellin-based group Friday suspected of carrying out
assassinations and kidnappings for rightist paramilitary militias.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests, which capped a yearlong investigation, dealt a
severe blow to the criminal group, Medellin police chief Gen. Luis
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police took part in raids in dozens of neighborhood
in Colombia's second-largest city against the notorious gang, known
as La Terraza.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested was the purported leader of the
organization, Carlos Osorio. Police said they also seized guns,
ammunition, ski masks, camouflage and military clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors suspect La Terraza in a series of assassinations and
abductions believed to have been paid for by Carlos Castano, the
chief of the nation's paramilitary umbrella organization, the
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is waging a brutal campaign against leftist
insurgents, often targeting civilians believed by the rightists to
sympathize with them.
</P>
<P>
   La Terraza gunmen, most of them young toughs drawn from poor
Medellin neighborhoods, are suspected in high-profile cases,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --The June 23 kidnapping in Medellin of Guillermo Valencia, a
state lawmaker and brother of government peace negotiator Fabio
Valencia. Valencia was released several days later along with a
message from Castano.
</P>
<P>
   --The August 1999 assassination of Jaime Garzon, a beloved
television satirist gunned down in Bogota in a crime that saddened
the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   --The May 1999 kidnapping of Sen. Piedad Cordoba, a left-leaning
peace advocate who was subsequently freed by Castano and went into
exile.
</P>
<P>
   --The February 1999 kidnappings on Castano's orders of four
Medellin-based human rights workers who were later freed unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Big Decline in Uninsured Americans  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people without health insurance
decreased last year for the first time since the Census Bureau
began compiling the data in 1987, a new trend that health care
advocates said was due in large part to America's robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   About 42.5 million people, or 15.5 percent of the population,
lacked insurance for all of 1999, compared with 44.2 million, or
16.3 percent, in 1998, according to data released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by 1.5 percentage points
to 10 million or 13.9 percent, according to the Census Bureau's
annual report on health insurance coverage in America.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts highlighted two factors most responsible for the drop:
more employers offering health coverage as a way to lure or keep
workers in a tight labor market and healthy economy, and the Child
Health Insurance Program, enacted by Congress in 1997 to assist
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that 62.8 percent of Americans had coverage
through an employment-related health insurance plan, compared with
62 percent in 1998. The percentage of those covered under Medicare
remained constant at 13.2. There was a 0.1 percentage point decline
in Medicaid coverage, to 10.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I am pleased with today's development, there is much
work to be done,'' President Clinton said. ''We need to encourage
states that are not doing as well to accelerate their activities in
reaching out to uninsured children. And we need to provide targeted
programs to build on their success.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
has proposed a number of health insurance initiatives, including a
tax credit of up to $2,000 per family to help low-income working
Americans buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Al Gore has proposed expanding the
federal-state health plan for children to enroll more children and
allow parents to join.
</P>
<P>
   With the good economy, ''employers are competing with each
other, health benefits are of the attractions that are offered,''
said Diane Rowland, executive director for the Kaiser Commission on
Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''we're still not able to make a dent in the overall
number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both health care reform advocates and industry supporters used
the report to promote their positions on an issue that has drawn
attention on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America said the data proved that ''a private, employer-based
system works.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited figures showing that since 1993, the number of people
covered under employment-based policies increased from 148 million
to 172 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a function of more jobs being created and a tight labor
market which is encouraging more employers to offer more
coverage,'' said Kahn, placing the imperative on Congress ''to
reduce that number by tens of millions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer group
Families USA, noted that the report also showed that 32.4 percent
of people living below the poverty line remained uninsured, along
with 47.5 percent of low-income, full-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people lost health coverage when they moved from welfare
into entry-level jobs that have no health benefits,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the states, 25.6 percent of residents in New Mexico were
uninsured in 1999, the highest in the country. Texas ranked
next-to-last, with 23.3 percent; in 1998, it was 50th at 24.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island had the smallest percentage of uninsured in 1999,
6.9 percent, followed by Minnesota at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --More Hispanics (33.4 percent) were likely to be uninsured than
any other of the major racial or ethnic group. Still, the
percentage fell from 35.3 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Adults age 18 to 24 remained the most likely to be uninsured
(29 percent), but the figure was 30 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of uninsured foreign-born residents declined
from 34.1 percent to 33.4 percent. The percentage for U.S.-born
residents fell nine-tenths of a percentage point, to 13.5 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press reported erroneously on

was 13.9 million. The correct number is 10 million, representing
13.9 percent of all children.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Royals 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez hit a tiebreaking two-run home
run that lifted the Chicago White Sox to a 6-4 victory Friday night
over the Kansas City Royals, snapping a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox won for the first time since clinching the AL
Central division on Sept. 24, ending their longest losing skid of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's 32nd homer came with two outs and the game tied at 4
in the seventh, after Frank Thomas walked on four pitches. Ordonez
hit the first pitch off Dan Reichert (8-10) to give Chicago a 6-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton had tied the game at 3 in the second inning with
a three-run inside the park homer. It was the second inside the
park home run this season by the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Bradford (1-0) picked up the win in 1 2-3 innings of
one-hit relief. Keith Foulke pitched the ninth for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque, who may start Game 1 of the AL Division Series,
tuned up by throwing 54 pitches over three innings. He gave up
three runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Parque may be moved up in the playoff rotation if Mike Sirotka
does not recover from a hyperextended left elbow suffered Thursday.
The White Sox will know more about Sirotka's availability after he
throws on the side either Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert lost his fourth straight start, giving up six runs on
nine hits and three walks over 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Febles, Johnny Damon and Rey Sanchez each hit RBI singles
off Parque in the Royals' second to go ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox answered in their half when, with runners at first
and second and none out, Singleton hit a 3-2 pitch from Reichert
that dropped in front of a sliding Damon in center. The ball rolled
all the way to the wall and Singleton raced home for the first
inside the park homer by a White Sox at new Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Joe Crede gave Chicago a 4-3 lead in the sixth inning
with a sacrifice fly, his first career RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals tied the game at 4 on Sanchez's RBI single in the
seventh off Lowe.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Damon scored in the second, it was his 134th run,
setting a single-season club record. The old mark was 133 set by
Willie Wilson in 1980. ... Parque finished the regular season at
13-6 with a 4.28 ERA, setting career highs in wins and innings
pitched (187). ... Paul Konerko hit the White Sox's other inside
the park homer this year on April 11 at Tampa Bay. ... 2B Ray
Durham played for the first time in a week after suffering bruised
ribs in a collision at home plate Sept. 22 in Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Britain Takes Steps Agreed in Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Northern Ireland peace
accord's most divisive element -- the early release of terrorist
prisoners -- will be extended to apply to some fugitives who escaped
from prison, Britain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The British government also announced that six military
checkpoints on the Irish border will be demolished as part of new
measures to scale down the security presence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace accord, the British army plans to cut troops
from 13,500 to 8,000 and to eliminate another 44 of 105 military
bases, the Ministry of Defense said.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the violence in Northern Ireland, there were an
estimated 30,000 troops on duty. In the past few years, 41 bases
have been demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, the most senior
British official in the province, announced that Britain will drop
extradition requests for those fugitive terrorists affiliated with
paramilitary groups observing cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitives will be free to return to Northern Ireland and
apply for immediate parole under the 1998 peace agreement's early
release program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not underestimate the hurt this decision may cause the
victims of those whose extradition will no longer be pursued,''
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was Britain's latest step toward fulfilling its
commitments under the peace accord, of which the central plank was
the formation of a four-party coalition government that includes
the Irish Republican Army's political allies, Sinn Fein, and the
eventual disarmament of the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   About 430 prisoners in Northern Ireland, a third of them serving
life sentences for murder, have been freed under the early release
program. The latest decision applies to 21 escaped convicts.

<HEADLINE> First Two Cuban Boxers Win Gold  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Guillermo Rigondeaux, a fresh face on a
team loaded with veterans, gave Cuba it's first boxing gold medal
at the Sydney Olympics by outpointing a Russian bronze medalist
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Rigondeux scored an 18-12 decision over Raimkoul
Malakhbekov at 119 pounds Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy to have won,'' Rigondeaux said. ''I thank my
coach for teaching me how to do it. ... The other guy was very
technical, but I beat him. I hope to fight again in the next
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigondeaux was just too quick for the Russian and took charge in
the final two rounds after trailing 7-6 after the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Kindelan, a 29-year-old world champion, gave Cuba it's
second gold by outboxing Andriy Kotelnyk of Ukraine 14-4 at 132
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kotelnyk couldn't solve the left-handed Kindelan's defense. The
Cuban also opened up in the final two rounds after leading only 3-2
after the second.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Cuban finalists boxed later on the card.
</P>
<P>
   The two American finalists will fight Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   World 125-pound champion Rocky Juarez of Houston, will box
Bekzat Sattarkhanov of Kazakstan, and Ricardo Williams Jr., of
Cincinnati will box Mahamadkadyz Abdullaev, the 139-pound world
champion from Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   The first gold medal of the games was won by Brahim Asloum of
France, who won the 106-pound title on a 23-10 decision over
30-year-old Rafael Lozano, of Spain, a bronze medalist in 1996
appearing in his third Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano had outpointed Asloum in a previous meeting, and when he
learned he would be fighting the Spaniard for the gold medal,
Asloum had said, ''I have improved a lot and I am out to take
revenge, and I always win my grudge match.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my third time,'' said the 4-foot-11 Lozano, who could not
get inside against the 5-5 Asloum and fell behind 17-7 after three
rounds. ''I tried. I will enjoy the silver medal.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 8, Cardinals 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ron Villone struck out a career-high 16 while
Garrett Stephenson's postseason rotation prospects took a hit as
the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Villone tied a Reds franchise record for strikeouts by a
left-hander, matching the mark set by Noodles Hahn in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Villone (10-10) pitched a two-hitter. He topped that himself,
getting three singles.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central champion Cardinals are tied with the Atlanta
Braves, who lost 4-2 to Colorado, for the second-best record in the
NL. San Francisco began the night with a one-game lead over both
teams in the race for home-field advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start since Sept. 14, Villone allowed one hit
the first seven innings before Fernando Vina tripled to start the
eighth. He struck out the side in the first and fanned Fernando
Tatis four times to top his previous career victory high of nine
last year and previous strikeout best of nine on Sept. 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire also struck out as a pinch-hitter for the last out
in the fifth with a runner on second. He's 4-for-13 since returning
from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (16-9) missed his last start due to arm fatigue and a
12-day break didn't help. He gave up five runs, all on home runs,
on nine hits in five innings and has a 6.60 ERA in five September
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker opened the game with his second straight leadoff
homer, his 15th overall, and Sean Casey added a two-run shot in the
first for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Casey doubled with two outs in the third ahead of Alex Ochoa's
13th homer for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' only hit the first seven innings was a leadoff
single in the second by Eric Davis. They scored in the fifth when
Edgar Renteria walked with two outs and scored when Eli Marrero's
line drive to center sailed under Tucker's glove and rolled to the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 46,152 was the Cardinals' 35th of the season
and gave them a season attendance record of 3,241,861. The previous
record was 3,225,334 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added three runs in the ninth on a bases-loaded walk by
Chris Sexton, a sacrifice fly by Brian Hunter and an RBI single by
Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Villone threw 148 pitches. ... Villone was moved to the
bullpen after allowing 15 earned runs in 15 1-3 innings his
previous three starts, all losses. His last outing was in relief.
He allowed two runs, one earned, on Tuesday at Milwaukee. ... The
Cardinals played their first game without catcher Mike Matheny, who
tore two tendons in his right ring finger with a hunting knife
earlier in the day. The knife was a birthday present Matheny had
just opened. ... The Cardinals have struck out a league-leading
1,241 times, breaking last year's team record of 1,202. Jim Edmonds
struck out both of his at-bats, raising his team-record total to
166. ... The Cardinals swung at strike three of all 13 strikeouts.

environment. The Republican presidential candidate, speaking at a factory in
Saginaw, Mich., said today he supports opening 1.5 million acres of the refuge
to drilling to decrease the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Vice
President Al Gore shot back that former oilman Bush just wanted to let oil
companies ''invade precious natural treasures like the Arctic National Wildlife

Maryland Adopts Bullet ID System
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Beginning on Sunday, with every new handgun sold in
Maryland, the manufacturer will have to give state police a spent shell casing
carrying the weapon's ballistic fingerprint. Under the law -- the first of its
kind in the nation -- the unique markings on the casing will then be entered
into a database. When detectives find a bullet casing at a crime scene, they can
go to the computer and instantly identify the gun it came from. ''Countless
hours of investigative work can now be eliminated from the process of
identifying the crime gun and who may have been in possession of it,'' State
Police Superintendent David Mitchell said. A similar New York state law takes

<HEADLINE> Eddie Wins CBS' 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 88-day endurance test is over. Eddie
McGee, the blunt New Yorker who lost his left leg to cancer, won a
half million dollars as the survivor on the CBS reality show, ''Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show overwhelmingly chose the University of
Texas-Arlington student over the other two remaining contestants,
New York lawyer Curtis Kin and Californian Josh Souza, in a live
telecast on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wild,'' he said after learning he won. ''My heart is
pumping so hard. I have to remind myself to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlasted nine other contestants who entered the specially
built house July 5 on a California soundstage. Their every move was
followed by cameras and microphones, with the frequently dull
results airing as much as six nights a week on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Souza, who gave McGee a warm hug, won $100,000 as the
second-place finisher. Kin won $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The brash McGee, a wheelchair basketball star, alienated some of
his fellow contestants with his blunt talk and determination. He
said Friday, though, that he never expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   McGee said he hoped to pay off some debts and help his brother
with his college education.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to look forward to having a real great holiday
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 contestants attended a raucous post-show celebration.
Some of the housemates said they were happy Eddie won -- even if
they weren't pulling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't have asked for anything better for anyone else. He
has a disability but he doesn't look at it that way. I admire that.
He doesn't let anyone get him down,'' said George, the show's
''Chicken Man.''
</P>
<P>
   George, who like the other also-rans, would not give out his
last name Friday, came to the post-show party dressed as a chicken,
his hair dyed orange. He said he's looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   As the contestants shed tears and shared hugs, the first person
voted out said he, too, was glad to be back.
</P>
<P>
   The argumentative William Collins, 28, had set the tone early as
the house's angry young man before he was bounced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last hurrah and for everyone to say goodbye to
each other,'' he said. ''This is my chance to show that I wasn't
the mad, angry, bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It brings to an end a series that never proved as successful in
the United States as it did in other countries, largely because
American viewers never warmed to the cast members and were bored
with their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   While a critical bust, ''Big Brother'' was a modest financial
success for CBS. Over its run, the show's average of 9.1 million
viewers was 9 percent higher than summer reruns fared in the same
time slots a year ago. But it did much better among young viewers
that advertisers love and CBS often can't attract.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting contestants were voted out quickly. First
to go was Collins, who engaged the gang in provocative racial
discussions and was later found to be a member of the New Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for romance and conflict, producers found little of
either. The only kiss shared by McGee in a highlight reel shown
Friday was with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, producers tried to entice someone to leave
the house with an offer of $50,000. They hoped to replace a less
exciting contestant with an attractive and combative young blonde
woman, but none of the occupants took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, six remaining houseguests talked about walking out
en masse. That idea fizzled, too.

   Still, CBS and the show's producers were reportedly discussing a
second ''Big Brother'' run for sometime next year. Networks are
trying to stockpile reality shows in anticipation of a potential
actors strike next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased with the ratings the show has delivered and we
do see tremendous potential in the concept,'' CBS spokesman Chris
Ender said. ''But there's no official word regarding another
edition.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Racewalker Appeal Denied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mexican racewalker Bernardo Segura,
disqualified after he crossed the finish line first, lost his
appeal Saturday (Friday night EDT) to get his gold medal back.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Segura's
disqualification was valid even though he wasn't notified until
about 15 minutes after he crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Segura, the world record holder in the 20-kilometer walk, was
already celebrating his victory when officials disqualified him.
They ruled he broke contact with the ground three times, all in the
final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Segura insisted he did nothing wrong and filed an appeal with
CAS on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't disqualify me,'' Segura said. ''It would be unfair
because I ran a clean race.''
</P>
<P>
   Segura's disqualification gave the gold medal to Robert
Korzeniowski of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, the CAS slammed the International Amateur
Athletic Federation for pulling Romanian hammer thrower Mihaela
Melinte off the field minutes before she was to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Melinte, the world record holder, had just walked on the infield
when officials approached her and told her she would not be allowed
to compete. The IAAF said Melinte tested positive for the steroid
nandrolone at a meet in Milan, Italy, on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arbitrators found the manner in which the athlete was
advised of her suspension just moments before competing and removed
from the athletic field was embarrassing and disrespectful,'' the
CAS wrote Friday in rejecting Melinte's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, the IAAF, which apologized at the hearing, had not
breached any of its rules. There was thus no reason to allow the
athlete to compete in spite of a positive doping test.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Geoff Jenkins homered twice and Jeromy Burnitz
homered and scored four runs, leading the Milwaukee Brewers over
the Houston Astros 13-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers wrapped up third place in the NL Central. Houston
hit the 90-loss mark for the first time since dropping 97 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Horacio Estrada (3-0) made his first appearance in the majors
since May 21. Before being sent down to Triple-A Indianapolis for
three months, he picked up a victory in two innings of relief
against the Astros on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada went 5 1-3 innings and allowed three runs on five hits
and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (17-7) lost for the third time in his last five
decisions. He went 4 2-3 innings and allowed five runs, four of
them earned, on six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz scored in the second inning when Raul Casanova was hit
by a pitch with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz led off the fourth with his 31st home run. One out
later, Ron Belliard hit his eighth home run.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard's RBI single scored Richie Sexson in the fifth and
finished Elarton. Reliever Jose Cabrera gave up Casanova's RBI
single, making it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Jenkins hit his 33rd home run. Jenkins added a
three-run shot in the ninth for his second multihomer game of the
season and third of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo tripled to lead off the Astros sixth and scored
on Lance Berkman's sacrifice fly. Chris Truby hit an RBI double and
scored on Tim Bogar's single to make it 6-3 and chase Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz walked with the bases loaded in the eighth. Tyler
Houston followed with a two-run double and Belliard had an RBI
groundout.
Notes: Houston OF Moises Alou's MRI revealed irritation and
inflammation in his right shoulder. He received a cortisone
injection and is listed day-to-day ... The Brewers signed their
eighth-round draft pick, outfielder Billy Scott from UCLA.
Milwaukee has signed all 15 selections from the 2000 June draft.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. women's volleyball team missed
out on a medal, but they can take pride in being the biggest
overachievers at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had too much quickness and strength, winning the bronze
medal by defeating the worn-out Americans 25-18, 25-22, 25-21
Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Taking fourth still is a remarkable achievement for the United
States, which finished seventh in Atlanta and entered this
tournament ranked 10th in the world. It wasn't expected to
challenge for a medal until 2004 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   With only two players who had Olympic experience, the Americans
were just hoping to make the quarterfinals. They did that, and beat
a tenacious South Korean team to get within a victory of the
gold-medal match before losing in five sets in the semifinals to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That loss took a lot out of the U.S. team, which appeared
drained early on against Brazil, without much spring in their legs.
Hitters Leila Barros, Virna Dias and Erika Coimbra helped Brazil
jump to an 18-9 lead and an easy opening-game win.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team's best chance for a comeback came in the second
game, when Danielle Scott and Sarah Noriega teamed up to stuff Dias
on two straight points to finish a 5-0 run and give the Americans a
13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil answered with a 4-1 run of its own, and Dias, in her
comfort zone on the left side of the net, broke a 21-all tie with
three impressive kills in four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans rallied in the third game, getting within 24-21,
but Dias crushed a ball off the block to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil won bronze for the second straight Olympics, having lost
to Cuba in the semifinals both times.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Mourn Trudeau  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadians marked Pierre Trudeau's passing by
placing flowers outside the former prime minister's home Friday.
Politicians of all stripes turned respectful and newspapers printed
giant photos and tender columns.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old former prime minister, who died of prostate
cancer at his Montreal home Thursday, had been suffering from
Parkinson's disease and was weakened by a 10-day spell of pneumonia
in January. His sons had issued a statement Sept. 8 saying he was
not well.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's state funeral will be Tuesday in Montreal. His body
will lie in state in Ottawa until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who rose to political prominence
in Trudeau's government, paid tribute to his mentor in a speech
before Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pierre Trudeau was a man like no other, he was a man of
brilliance and learning ... A man of grace and style,'' Chretien
told a hushed House of Commons. ''A man of extraordinary courage. A
complex man whose love of Canada was pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke members of Parliament looked on soberly, some wiping
their eyes. Unlike most days, there was no heckling, no snide
remarks, no rhetorical questions. All applauded Chretien's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was prime minister from 1968 to 1984, with a brief break
in 1979. Pundits dubbed his early years ''Trudeaumania.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons, Conservative Leader Joe Clark, who
defeated Trudeau to become prime minister in 1979, paid a moving
tribute to his old adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He represents an audacious page in the history of our nation
and that page has just been turned,'' Clark said. ''His intellect
guided him more than his intuition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London carried a front page report from Ottawa,
saying ''Pierre Trudeau will go down as the greatest Canadian
politician of the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also remembered him respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pierre Trudeau opened a dynamic new era in Canadian politics
and helped establish Canada's unique imprint on the global stage,''
Clinton said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His charisma and irreverence helped define his era. He once
danced pirouettes behind the back of Queen Elizabeth, wore sandals
in Parliament and called journalists ''trained seals.'' Before his
brief marriage to Margaret Sinclair in the 1970s, he dated
actresses and singers, including Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very unusual -- an athlete with a poetic soul,'' said
Streisand, who learned of Trudeau's death after her final concert
in New York City on Thursday night. ''His love and dedication to
his country were inspiring. He had extraordinary charm and grace
and style. He will be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   After splitting from Sinclair, Trudeau kept custody of their
three sons. The youngest, Michel, was killed in an avalanche in the
Rocky Mountains of British Columbia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by sons Justin, 29, a school teacher, and Sacha,
27, a documentary film maker.
</P>
<P>
   Well-wishers gathered outside Trudeau's home, but his family
remained silent after releasing a brief statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau ushered in the metric system in Canada, made French an
official language along with English, and enshrined a Canadian bill
of rights in the 1982 constitution. He frowned upon Quebec's desire
to split from Canada's confederation.
</P>
<P>
   A French Canadian who fought for national unity and even sent
troops into Quebec to quell separatism, his charisma and
irreverence helped define an era.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1969 speech at the National Press Club in Washington,
Trudeau offered this take on sharing a continent with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an
elephant,'' he told America. ''No matter how friendly and
even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and
grunt.''

<HEADLINE> Univ. of Idaho Pulls Altered Photo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) -- The University of Idaho has removed a
picture of nine students from the top of its Internet site after
discovering that it had been altered to replace the heads of two
white students with those of two minority students.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Hoover said the picture was removed Thursday
after the student newspaper made inquiries about its authenticity.
It was replaced with a picture of the school's domed sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said on Friday that a graphic artist at the school who
recently graduated altered the 1997 photo by inserting the heads of
a black male student and an Asian male student and then posted it
on the Web site three to four weeks ago. The artist, David
Embleton, did not inform any of his supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were putting the pictures up, we encouraged them to
find diversity,'' Hoover said on Friday. ''He didn't find it, and
he chose to superimpose those pictures, and that is not acceptable
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   About 8 percent of the school's 10,500 students are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Embleton will be disciplined, Hoover said, but will not lose his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Embleton declined comment Friday. He told the student newspaper,
the Argonaut, that he altered the picture because ''it is important
that we show the diversity of the University of Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, officials at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison acknowleged that a brochure cover photo was doctored by
inserting a black student into a crowd of white football fans to
show the school had a diverse enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure was reprinted and being sent with a letter of
explanation to the all those who received the original who can be
found. Staffers there won't be disciplined because they admitted
their mistake and apologized to the student whose photo was used,
officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms in Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK REYNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Keith swirled to life Friday in the
Caribbean and drifted slowly to the northwest, with forecasters
saying it could soon become a hurricane that will threaten parts of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains were expected through the weekend as the storm
grows stronger and moves toward the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane
watches were issued for parts of the Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest threat is for northeastern Mexico,'' said Eric
Blake, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
He said there was a hurricane watch along the east of Yucatan, and
Keith would move into the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and the
peninsula over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Keith was centered about 210 miles
south-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico with top sustained winds of 50
mph, heading northwest at 5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hurricane Joyce weakened into a tropical storm Friday
and kept losing steam, with top sustained winds dropping to 50 mph
as it churned westward across the Atlantic. Residents in the Lesser
Antilles were told to track the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could very well become a hurricane again,'' said Robert
Molleda, a meteorologist at the hurricane center. ''It's right at
that threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Joyce was about 480 miles east-southeast of
Barbados in the Windward Islands. It was moving west at near 15
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hurricane Isaac's top sustained winds dropped back to
100 mph as it continued moving across an open sea, a threat only to
shipping. It was expected to get weaker Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., Isaac was about 1,410 miles west-southwest of the
westernmost Azores Islands in the mid-Atlantic. It was moving to
the northeast at about 24 mph.

<HEADLINE> Vegas Defendants Take Plea Bargains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Three men linked to the death of gambling
figure Ted Binion and the theft of his silver fortune have accepted
plea bargains that will allow them to avoid prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   David Mattsen, Michael Milot and Steven Wadkins have accepted
deals, prosecutor David Roger said Friday. He said the case against
the only remaining defendant, John B. Joseph, also could resolved
without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mattsen, 64, Binion's former ranch manager, is accused of
helping Rick Tabish dig up an underground vault filled with $6
million of silver two days after Binion's Sept. 17, 1998, death.
</P>
<P>
   Tabish, 35, and 28-year-old Sandy Murphy were convicted in May
of killing Binion, a Las Vegas gambling heir, and plotting to steal
his fortune. Both are serving life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Wadkins and Joseph are charged with concocting with Tabish a
torture-extortion plot against a sand pit owner two months before
Binion was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Wadkins has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit
extortion, a gross misdemeanor, at a hearing next week, Roger said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattsen and Milot will enter no-contest pleas to a gross
misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to commit grand larceny or
burglary, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The no-contest pleas do not require the defendants to admit
guilt, but they acknowledge prosecutors have enough evidence that a
jury could find them guilty at trial.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued in '92 Model Slaying  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities issued an arrest warrant
Friday for an illegal immigrant wanted for the 1992 slaying of an
aspiring model after a DNA sample was compared to a statewide
database of convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Pimentel Sanchez, 43, has been charged with the murder
of 18-year-old Cari Ann Parnes, who disappeared March 7, 1992. Her
beaten body was found in an orange grove near Irvine later that
week and was identified a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The murder investigation went nowhere until last February when
investigators submitted a DNA sample to compare with those in a
statewide database of convicted felons, said Orange County
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA matched Sanchez, whose DNA was obtained after he was
convicted of rape in 1989, Amormino said. Sanchez was on parole
when Parnes was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Sanchez, who has been deported from the
United States eight times, is living somewhere in Mexico but will
return again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pattern. He'll come back and we'll get him,'' Amormino
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parnes' body remained unidentified at the county morgue for more
than a year as her mother, Rosemarie Fekete, sought information
from drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a chronic drug abuser who wanted help but just
couldn't seem to hold on,'' Fekete told The Orange County Register
in 1993. ''I felt in my heart something terrible happened. ''

Wildlife Refuge.'' With winter approaching and fuel prices high, energy politics

Maryland Adopts Bullet ID System

   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Beginning on Sunday, with every new handgun sold in
Maryland, the manufacturer will have to give state police a spent shell casing
carrying the weapon's ballistic fingerprint. Under the law -- the first of its
kind in the nation -- the unique markings on the casing will then be entered
into a database. When detectives find a bullet casing at a crime scene, they can
go to the computer and instantly identify the gun it came from. ''Countless
hours of investigative work can now be eliminated from the process of
identifying the crime gun and who may have been in possession of it,'' State
Police Superintendent David Mitchell said. A similar New York state law takes
effect March 1.

Traffic Safety Administration said it has received 167 complaints about the
Steeltex R4S and A/T light truck tires since Aug. 1. The tires are original
equipment on Ford F250 and F350 pickups, the Ford Excursion, General Motors'
Suburban and G Van, a commercial vehicle. ''The majority of the complaints
occurred at highway speeds and allege a blowout, tread separation or other major
failure,'' NHTSA said.

   CHEJU, South Korea (AP) -- High-level negotiators from South and
North Korea ended four days of talks Saturday, reaffirming their
earlier commitment to improving ties on the divided Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint statement contained few new details, except for an
agreement to form a working-level committee to implement agreements
to boost economic exchanges between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the joint statement was delayed for hours for
differences South Korean officials refused to explain. But local
news reports said South Korea wanted North Korea to promise in the
statement that Southern food aid will be distributed to those in
need, not to its military.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea considers such a demand a slight to its pride.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea also wanted to set down a date for the visit to
Seoul by Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's ceremonial head of state.
Kim's trip would lay the groundwork for the planned first-ever trip
to Seoul by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, South Korea said it would give 600,000 tons of
grain to North Korea to help the communist state overcome food
shortages this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The government is under fire from opposition legislators
accusing North Korea of diverting outside food aid to its hard-line
military.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in this South Korea resort island were the third round
of minister-level meetings aimed at following up on agreements
reached at a historic inter-Korean summit in June. At the first
summit, which was held in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, the
leaders of the two Koreas pledged to pursue peace and
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, Kim Jong Il had also promised to visit Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's joint statement said the two Koreas will hold their
fourth round of minister-level talks in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit, North and South Korea have agreed to allow
more reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War and
reconnect a cross-border railroad line.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean peninsula partitioned into the North and pro-Western
South in 1945 at the end of World War II. The Korean War ended
without a peace treaty. There is no regular means of cross-border
travel for Korean citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation, led by senior Cabinet councilor Jon
Kum Jin, was to fly home later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington announced Friday that Cho Myong Nok, the first vice
chairman of the North's powerful National Defense Commission, will
visit the United States on Oct. 9-12 to discuss improving ties with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is the highest-ranked North Korea official to come to
Washington as it accelerates contacts with the isolated communist
state.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- One if by land. And one if by sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans took a pair of medals Saturday (Friday night EDT)
with skipper Mark Reynolds riding a shifting wind to a sailing gold
medal and cyclist Mari Holden pedaling into a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, a San Diego sailmaker, won the first U.S. sailing gold
medal since he won the Star gold at Barcelona in 1992. Holden won
the second U.S. cycling medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Holden opened the penultimate day of Olympic competition with
her second-place finish Saturday (Friday night EDT) in the women's
time trial. She covered the 18-mile course in 42 minutes flat.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time national champion from Colorado Springs, Colo.,
bounced back after a rough trip in the Olympic road race earlier in
the week. Mechanical problems and a crash knocked her out of the
medal chase there.
</P>
<P>
   Holden finished second to Leontien Zijlaard of the Netherlands,
who won her third gold medal of the Sydney Games. Jeannie
Longo-Ciprelli of France, soon to turn 42, won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second cycling medal for the United States, coming
after Marty Nothstein's gold in match sprint.
</P>
<P>
   After the first events Saturday, the Americans remained atop the
medal table with 80 (33 gold, 20 silver, 27 bronze). Russia was
next with 61 (20-19-22), followed by China's 56 (26-15-15).
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SAILING: Reynolds, and crewman Magnus Liljedahl were assured
of at least a bronze medal at the start Saturday (Friday night
EDT), but they refused to settle. Reynolds, a four-time Olympian,
emerged from the 16-boat fleet and took advantage of a wind shift
on the course -- one that his competitors had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Gold medalist Reynolds then held off Britain skipper Ian Walker,
who wound up with silver.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOCCER: Cameroon's Indomitable Lions lived up to the name,
taking the Olympic gold with a shootout victory over Spain. After
tying 2-2 through regulation and overtime, Cameroon's 5-3 edge in
penalty shots gave them the Sydney title.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Ivan Amaya, who scored an own goal, was also the only
player to miss in the shootout. As a result, Africa keeps the
Olympic title after Nigeria's historic victory at Atlanta '96.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- CANOE-KAYAK: After reaching the finals for the first time, the
United States team finished sixth in the 1,000-meter four-man kayak
Saturday (Friday night EDT). With one race to go for the Americans,
they finished out of the medals in each attempt Down Under -- the
second straight Olympics where they have failed to win anything.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: Playing for the bronze medal, the
Americans were overmatched against Brazil in a straight-set loss,
25-18, 25-22, 25-21 on Saturday (Friday night EDT). The U.S.
fourth-place finish was still cause for some celebration, since the
team -- which had only two players with Olympic experience -- was
ranked 10th in the world and not expected to challenge for a medal
until Athens in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TRACK: Marion Jones sailed across the Sydney sky, hoping to
land with her third gold medal. Before she ever touched down, it
had turned to bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Olympic alchemy, the kind that happens when great
athletes stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, already the winner of two Sydney golds, had her drive for
an unprecedented five golds in a single Summer Games ended by her
own foot in the long jump, her weakest event. In a half-dozen jumps
Friday, her track shoe inched over the foul line four times.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dream for five is not alive any more,'' Jones said. ''I
don't regret at all saying I was going to go for five. I had a
shot, and it just didn't pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones finished third, behind 1992 Olympic champion Heike
Drechsler of Germany and 1996 silver medalist Fiona May of Italy.
Drechsler, 35, is more than a decade older than Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her bronze, Jones still has the 400-meter and
1,600-meter relays to run. Her chances for victory there were
hamstrung by injuries that sidelined relay teammates Gail Devers
and Inge Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans prevailed in the Olympic pole vault for the first
time since 1968, with Nick Hysong taking the gold and Lawrence
Johnson winning the silver.
</P>
<P>
   In track's other story, Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj's three-year
winning streak in the men's 1,500 meters ended when he finished
second to Noah Ngeny of Kenya. Ngeny set an Olympic record to snap
El Guerrouj's reign.
</P>

   -- MEN'S BASKETBALL: The shot by Sarunas Jasikevicius hung up in
the air, headed toward the Lithuania hoop. If it fell, so would the
gold-medal hopes of the 12 NBA stars playing for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. And the U.S. ''Dream Team,'' headed into the
gold-medal game for the third straight Olympics, narrowly avoided a
defeat that would have made ''Hoosiers'' look hokey.
</P>
<P>
   The final was the United States 85, Lithuania 83 -- and it was
closer than that. It was the closest Olympic game ever involving
the U.S. professionals, and would have been the first U.S. Olympic
basketball loss since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Americans -- led by Vince Carter with 18 points and
Alonzo Mourning with 16 -- advance to the championship game Sunday
(Saturday night EDT) against France.
</P>
<P>
   Before missing the last shot, Jasikevicius had drilled 5-of-10
3-pointers on his way to a team-high 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: The Americans came to Sydney intent on winning more
than just a single gold medal -- their ''haul'' in each of the past
two Olympics. With the finals this weekend, they still have a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild, high-scoring punchfest, U.S. 139-pounder Ricardo
Williams defeated Cuban Diogenes Luna 42-41 to make the gold medal
fight. And 125-pounder Rocky Juarez outpointed Kamil Dzamalutdinov
of Russia for his own shot at Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a U.S. sweep of their three fights was 156-pounder
Jermain Taylor, who was outclassed by Yermakhan Ibraimov of
Kazakstan. The fight was stopped early in the fourth round on the
15-point rule, with Ibraimov leading 29-14.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, like teammate Clarence Vinson at 119 pounds, winds up
with a bronze. The four medals are two fewer than American boxers
got in 1996, but one more than they earned in 1992.
