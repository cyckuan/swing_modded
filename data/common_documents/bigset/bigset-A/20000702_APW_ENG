<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Royals 7  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rob Fick's RBI single tied it in the
ninth, then Ricky Bottalico walked Brad Ausmus with the bases
loaded to force in the winning run as the Detroit Tigers outlasted
the Kansas City Royals 8-7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bottalico (7-2) gave up singles to Tony Clark and Dean Palmer
starting the ninth as he blew his sixth save in 11 opportunities
despite the Tigers' stranding 16 runners.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his league-leading 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Fabregas hit a two-out solo homer in the eighth off Doug
Brocail (4-3) to cap Kansas City's comeback and give the Royals a
7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, 3-for-4 with three RBIs, and Bobby Higginson each hit
their 16th home runs as the Tigers mounted a six-run lead in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a former Kansas City third baseman, hit a 416-foot solo
homer off Jeff Suppan in the second and added a two-run single in
the four-run third, then Higginson's two-out shot put the Tigers on
top 6-0 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler took a shutout into the sixth but left with one
out after up giving up RBI singles to Mike Sweeney, Jermaine Dye
and Joe Randa. Danny Patterson came in and got Carlos Beltran to
ground into a 6-4-3 inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Dave McCarty's pinch RBI single made it 6-4,
then Brocail was called for a balk, sending Johnny Damon trotting
home from third. Dye then tied it with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney had four hits, a night after getting three, and raised
his RBI total to 75.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan, who gave up only one hit in nine innings in the Royals'
4-1, 11-inning victory over the Tigers on May 8, pitched 3 2-3
innings. He allowed up five runs on eight hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus had a sacrifice fly in the third for Detroit and Juan
Gonzalez drove in a run with the second of his three singles.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals 3B Randa made one of the best defensive plays in
Kauffman Stadium this year, running in to scoop up Juan
Encarnacion's bunt and making a powerful, accurate, off-balance
throw to nip him by a step. ... Before the game, former manager
Whitey Herzog and former outfielder Willie Wilson were inducted
into the Royals' hall of fame. .. The Tigers have hit 36 home runs
in their last 17 games. ... A boy about 12 years old was struck on
the arm or leg when Tony Clark's bat went flying into the fourth
row behind first base. The child was crying but did not appear
seriously hurt as he walked to the first aid station. ... Detroit
loaded the bases with one out in the fifth but reliever Jeff
D'Amico got Encarnacion to fly out to shallow center and retired
Deivi Cruz on a pop foul behind first.

<HEADLINE> Texarkana Editor Mahaffey Dies, 92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) -- J.Q. Mahaffey, a retired executive
editor of the Texarkana Gazette who was a conscientious community
editor and mentor to young journalists, has died. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey, who died Thursday, was editor of the Gazette for three
decades. He also served on the national boards of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, the Associated Press Managing
Editors, and as a Pulitzer Prize juror.
</P>
<P>
   But he was best remembered for his personal influence on his
community and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''J.Q. Mahaffey was a great editor and a wonderful person. His
relationship with our family goes back three generations,'' said
Walter E. Hussman Jr., publisher of the Texarkana Gazette and
president and chief executive officer of WEHCO Media.
</P>
<P>
   Wick Temple, vice president and director of membership for The
Associated Press, said, ''J.Q. was one of the last of a breed of
newspaper editors who was the conscience as well as the chronicler
of his community, and whose influence stretched beyond Texarkana to
national journalism circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many of us, he was a mentor who sent us off into the world
with a reminder that it is not only what one accomplishes that
counts, but the kindness and good humor with which it is done,''
said Temple, who began his career as a teen-ager under Mahaffey's
wing after the death of his own father, an AP newsman.
</P>
<P>
   Louis ''Swampy'' Graves, editor emeritus of the Nashville (Ark.)
News, who worked as city editor under Mahaffey, said, ''J.Q. was
everybody's idol. Those who worked under his tutelage remembered
his patience with young reporters -- and his expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Blocker, retired managing editor the Herald Democrat in
Sherman, Texas, said he was ''floating,'' unsure of what he would
make his life's work, when he started to work for Mahaffey in 1938.
''He helped me peg down what I wanted to do,'' Blocker said. ''J.Q.
was the pivotal point in my young life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a tremendous force for the community,'' said State
District Judge Bill Peek, who worked for Mahaffey as a young
journalist, and called him one of the greatest influences in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey, the son of a prominent Texarkana lawyer, began his own
journalism career at the Gazette after graduation from Furman
University in 1929. He struggled with a stammer, and said humorist
Will Rogers gave him advice about it during a news interview that
kept him from giving up reporting. Mahaffey later became a popular
public speaker known for his humor and storytelling ability.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades at the newspaper, he held almost every editorial
position. One of his proudest accomplishments was bringing women
into the newsroom to cover more than society news. After his
retirement in 1968, he returned to write a popular weekly column
for the newspaper from the early 1980s to the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the honors of his long career was being named editor of
the year in Texas by Sigma Delta Chi, the national journalistic
fraternity now known as the Society of Professional Journalists.
The Baptist General Convention of Texas recognized him for
Christian service in the field of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey was born on Oct. 12, 1907. He married Ruth Burgadine in
1935. She died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include a son, John Mahaffey, a retired broadcast news
anchor in Baton Rouge, La., and a daughter, Prudence Mahaffey
Mackintosh, a writer, who lives in Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Firework Production Halted in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A southern Chinese province has ordered factories
that make fireworks and cigarette lighters to suspend operations
and some to close permanently after an explosion that killed 36
people, a municipal official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Another 160 people were injured in the blast Friday at a
fireworks factory in Jiangmen, in Guangdong province. More than 30
people remained missing after the explosion, which leveled the
31,000-square-foot factory.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, has numerous factories and
small workshops making fireworks and disposable lighters. They have
suffered a string of deadly fires blamed on inadequate equipment
and safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   According to China's official Xinhua News Agency, managers of
the Jiangmen factory ignored an April 4 order from fire officials
to improve their alarm and firefighting systems.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency order issued Saturday by Guangdong province allows
factories that pass a safety inspection to reopen, said an official
of the Jiangmen city propaganda office who gave her name only as
Huang. But those in densely populated areas will be closed
permanently, Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Paul Abbott pitched seven strong innings
and Mike Cameron hit a two-run homer as the Seattle Mariners beat
the Texas Rangers 6-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott (5-2) allowed one run and seven hits to win his fourth
consecutive decision and improve to 3-0 career against Texas. He
struck out six and walked two in stopping the Rangers' three-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa walked the first two batters in the ninth, and
Kazuhiro Sasaki got two outs before walking Rafael Palmeiro and
Ivan Rodriguez to force in a run to make it 6-3. Sasaki then got
David Segui to hit a foul pop to third for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 1-1, Rangers rookie Ryan Glynn had two outs
and a runner on first in the fourth when he was forced to leave due
to a blister on his right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark (3-5) came on in relief and got out of the fourth,
but the Mariners took a 3-1 lead in the fifth on Stan Javier's
sacrifice fly and Cameron's run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron completed his three-RBI night in the seventh with his
11th homer, a two-run shot off Francisco Cordero. Alex Rodriguez
followed with a single and scored on Edgar Martinez's double to
make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's solo homer off Arthur Rhodes in the eighth reduced
Seattle's lead to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle got a run in the first on Martinez's groundout. Texas
tied it at 1 in the third on Rusty Greer's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes:@Glynn left his previous start on June 24 against Tampa Bay
in the sixth inning with a blister on the same finger. ... The
Rangers' three-game winning streak ended. ... Clark was making his
first appearance since June 16. ... Rhodes had a 13-inning
scoreless streak halted by Rodriguez's homer.

<HEADLINE> Terrace Collapse Kills 1 in Ohio  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- A concrete terrace loaded with
tourists collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie on Saturday,
killing one person and injuring 75, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a crack and I just dropped. It was like sliding down a
hill,'' said Wade Weaver, 23, of Gibsonburg. ''I kept thinking it
was like an earthquake hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse left a hole in the floor of the lakefront terrace
at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a fortresslike mansion
on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just came loose and gave way,'' said Steve Ernst, 31, who
watched the floor crumble and drop. ''People pulled doors off
hinges to create backboards'' to carry the injured out the door of
a wine cellar where the victims and rubble fell. The cellar was
unoccupied but contained casks.
</P>
<P>
   The floor apparently collapsed under the weight of the people,
said John Blatt, mayor of the nearby island resort village of
Put-In-Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old Columbus man died at the scene, Put-In-Bay Police
Chief Jim Lang said. Earlier, police and U.S. Coast Guard officials
had said that two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Greer, director of the Ottawa County Emergency Management
Agency, put the number of injured at 75. They were taken to
hospitals in Port Clinton, Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics estimated 30 people were critical but the rest were
in stable condition by evening, said Pat McCloskey, spokesman for
the emergency management agency.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said about 100 people were on the 25-by-20-foot terrace
where the 4-inch-thick floor collapsed. He said it fell 16 to 18
feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel were called in from as far away as
Cleveland, 60 miles away, and closer cities such as Toledo and
Bowling Green. The Coast Guard said a 47-foot motor lifeboat was at
the scene. Lang said more than 40 people were flown off the island
and the rest left by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The winery was closed after a dog searched the rubble and found
no additional victims, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lonz Winery sits on about 120 acres of a Lake Erie island
about 6 miles from the mainland. Only about 40 people live on
Middle Bass Island but as many as 1,500 visitors stay during busy
summer weekends.
</P>
<P>
   George Prusock, 25, of Mayfield Heights was transported to
Magruder Memorial Hospital in Port Clinton. He said he was
attending a bachelor party at the winery when the terrace
collapsed, injuring both his legs and trapping a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our buddy's last hurrah before he got married,''
Prusock said. ''The next thing you know, the floor collapsed and
he's under the pop machine. The floor just dropped. Nobody had any
time to react.''
</P>
<P>
   The young adults who party at the winery buy bottles of wine
there and carry them to picnic tables, where they socialize as a
band plays '80s and '90s hits.
</P>
<P>
   Famous as a winery in the 19th century, the site hasn't been
used for growing grapes for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Its owners, Paramount Distilleries Inc., decided to sell it last
year but are keeping the winery open while negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   The state is buying the site for $6.75 million for a park that
will feature nature trails and eventually could have a campground,
swimming beach and resort lodge.

Ohio Terrace Collapse Leaves One Dead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- One person died and dozens injured after a
cement terrace loaded with tourists collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie
Saturday, authorities said. The collapse left a gaping hole in the floor of the
lakefront terrace at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a fortresslike
mansion on the National Register of Historic Places. ''The whole deck just
disappeared, it just fell,'' Barbara Kraft, visiting the island from Rochester
Hills, Mich., told WBNS-TV in Columbus. Paramedics estimated 30 people were
critically injured.

Fiji Army To Appoint New Government

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying rebels who took over Fiji's parliament and
demanded that ethnic Indians be stripped of political power, the army said
Sunday it would appoint a temporary government next week that would include
Indians. The announcement appeared to raise the stakes in a political standoff
that began May 19, when the rebels stormed the Indian-led parliament of this
South Pacific island nation in what they called a battle for the trampled rights
of indigenous Fijians. They continue to hold 27 members of parliament hostage.

Midwesterners Unfazed by Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. Illinois legislators voted overwhelmingly last week to
suspend the sales tax for six months to appease voters angry over the rapid rise
in pump prices. Gov. George Ryan admonished station owners to pass the savings
on to customers. Indiana's governor also suspended his state's gas tax for 60
days. Prices in one north-side Chicago neighborhood fell to $1.99 per gallon
Saturday, down 10 cents to 16 cents per gallon since Thursday.

$100M in Cocaine Seized in Caribbean
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. and Dutch authorities seized 3,080 pounds
of cocaine on a Panamanian freighter bound for Spain, the U.S. Coast Guard said
Saturday. The cocaine -- with a U.S. street value of more than $100 million --
was the third major shipment bound for Spain seized in the last two weeks. The
cocaine was found on the MV Tiger, a 318-foot freighter stopped Thursday by a
Dutch Navy vessel 200 miles north of Venezuela, the Coast Guard said in a
written statement. The Dutch vessel was on a routine patrol near Dutch Caribbean
territories.

Gore Leads Bush Among Hispanics

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has a double-digit lead over George W. Bush among
Hispanics, but for the second time this week a poll of Hispanic voters showed
the Republican getting more support than GOP candidates usually do. Hispanics,
the nation's fastest-growing minority, are being heavily courted by both parties
in the presidential race. Democrat Gore led the Republican by 16 points in
Knight Ridder's national poll of Hispanics, 50 percent to 34 percent. But Gore
was getting less support than President Clinton had in either one of his two
presidential races. Clinton won the 1996 election among Hispanic voters by 51
points.

the attack, which was similar to ones previously carried out by the country's
main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Four
explosive devices were launched from the back of a pickup truck parked next to
the police headquarters in downtown Cali. One landed on a car passing by on the

<HEADLINE> Angels 7, Athletics 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim's Jarrod Washburn held Oakland
hitless through six innings before giving up homers to Olmedo Saenz
and Matt Stairs in the Angels' 7-2 victory over the Athletics on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's (4-2) no-hit bid ended when Saenz led off the seventh
with a homer over the left-center field fence. Two outs later,
Stairs chased Washburn with a 406-foot homer to dead center.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn allowed two runs and two hits, struck out two and
walked five in 6 2-3 innings in handing Oakland its fourth
consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine allowed just a double to Ben Grieve in 2 1-3 innings
to complete the three-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the first when Tim Salmon hit an
RBI single and Mo Vaughn scored on an errant pickoff throw by Ariel
Prieto (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina's two-run homer in the third, his eighth, made it
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim added an unearned run in the fifth, on second baseman
Randy Velarde's wild relay on a potential inning-ending double
play. Vaughn's RBI single in the sixth made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn added another RBI single in the eighth to make it 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn flirted with a no-hitter for the second time this
season, but this was the first time he was actually on the mound to
see it end.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, the left-hander held the Indians hitless for five
innings in Cleveland, then was removed as a precaution because of a
strained oblique muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, slowly making his way back from 1998 reconstructive
elbow surgery, went four-plus innings in his third start of the
year. He allowed five runs -- three earned -- on four hits, with five
walks and two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Angels have spent the entire season between two games
under and four games over .500. ... Garret Anderson's walk against
Scott Service in the fifth was his first unintentional walk since
June 2, a span of 102 at-bats. ... Since missing a couple of games
a week ago with back spasms, Troy Glaus has gone 1-for-18, with 12
strikeouts. Glaus even grounded into a double play in the seventh
after doing so only once in his first 272 at-bats. ... The A's have
scored six runs during their slump. ... Angels SS Benji Gil
prolonged Washburn's no-hitter by going deep into the hole for
Velarde's sixth-inning one-out grounder and throwing him out at
first.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Assured of No Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new president has assuaged the
fears of those in the military that he will declare independence
and bring about war with mainland China, Taiwan's defense chief
said in an interview published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   President Chen Shui-bian has toned down his former
pro-independence leanings, and his conciliatory stance toward China
''has brought peace to the hearts'' of those in the military, Wu
Shih-wen told the China Times, a respected daily.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has said he will abide by Taiwan's constitution -- which
does not support a formal break from China.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan have been governed separately since splitting
amid civil war in 1949, and China has grown increasingly impatient
about reunification with the island. China has threatened war if
Taiwan ever sought to declare independence. Beijing deeply
distrusts Chen because of his former pro-independence tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan's recently-purchased Patriot missiles and early
warning systems were ''an important deterrent,'' to war, Wu said,
the weapons have their own limitations and there is still a need to
increase defense spending and bolster military training.
</P>
<P>
   China's growing arsenal of Russian-made planes and advanced
missiles are ''a great threat'' to national security, Wu added.

<HEADLINE> No Early Election in Australia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia Prime Minister John Howard
said Sunday he would not try to capitalize on Olympics euphoria by
calling a general election shortly after the Sydney games this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always thought it a huge political error to believe
that great public festivals like that have any political impact at
all,'' Howard told Australian television's Ten Network. ''I don't
get fooled by that. I won't be doing that, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister does not have to call an election until early
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Howard also said he had no plans to announce his retirement from
politics. Some political observers have speculated that no
political challenge is left for Howard following Saturday's
introduction of a huge overhaul of Australia's taxation system. But
he denied that he was ready to leave his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody should think that I'm not enjoying it and that I don't
look forward to doing quite a number of other things before I
depart the political scene.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the first day of Australia's fiscal year, wholesale
taxes were scrapped and replaced by a 10 percent goods and services
levy, while the government also cut income tax by $7.2 billion and
raised child care benefits and pensions for the elderly.

One Dead After Ohio Terrace Collapses
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Two people are dead and dozens injured after
a cement terrace loaded with tourists collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie
Saturday, authorities said. The collapse left a gaping hole in the floor of the
lakefront terrace at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a fortresslike
mansion on the National Register of Historic Places. ''The whole deck just
disappeared, it just fell,'' Barbara Kraft, visiting the island from Rochester
Hills, Mich., told WBNS-TV in Columbus. Paramedics estimated 30 people were
critically injured.

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying rebels who took over Fiji's parliament and
demanded that ethnic Indians be stripped of political power, the army said
Sunday it would appoint a temporary government next week that would include
Indians. The announcement appeared to raise the stakes in a political standoff
that began May 19, when the rebels stormed the Indian-led parliament of this
South Pacific island nation in what they called a battle for the trampled rights
of indigenous Fijians. They continue to hold 27 members of parliament hostage.

Israel Complains to UN Over Lebanon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has complained to United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that Lebanon has not fulfilled its part of a U.N. resolution
outlining an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, a spokesman said Saturday.
The Israeli delegation to the United Nations sent a letter to Annan complaining
that the Lebanese army had not deployed in south Lebanon since Israel's May 24
withdrawal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said. In addition, Lebanese
authorities are located on Israel's side of the border in some places, Shiron
added. The United Nations approval of the withdrawal on June 16 was held up over
Lebanese complaints that Israeli troops were still located in Lebanese
territory.

Castro Warns Next U.S. President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANZANILLO, Cuba (AP) -- Fidel Castro defiantly warned the next U.S.
president Saturday not to try to defeat his socialist revolution, as the Cuban
government launched a new series of mass demonstrations after Elian Gonzalez's
return. Led by Gen. Raul Castro, head of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and
Fidel Castro's younger brother, a sea of people vigorously waved small red,
white and blue Cuban flags. In rare comments to reporters afterward, Raul Castro
said that media coverage of the battle over Elian had helped Americans better
understand Cuba and its people. Because of that increased understanding, ''the
second chapter will also be a triumph,'' he said.

Midwesterners Deal With Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. Illinois legislators voted overwhelmingly last week to
suspend the sales tax for six months to appease voters angry over the rapid rise
in pump prices. Gov. George Ryan admonished station owners to pass the savings
on to customers.

Gore Leads Bush Among Hispanics
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has a double-digit lead over George W. Bush among
Hispanics, but for the second time this week a poll of Hispanic voters showed
the Republican getting more support than GOP candidates usually do. Hispanics,
the nation's fastest-growing minority, are being heavily courted by both parties
in the presidential race. Democrat Gore led the Republican by 16 points in
Knight Ridder's national poll of Hispanics, 50 percent to 34 percent. But Gore
was getting less support than President Clinton had in either one of his two
presidential races. Clinton won the 1996 election among Hispanic voters by 51
points.

   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Assailants launched crude missiles outside police
headquarters in Colombia's third-largest city Saturday, killing one passer-by
and wounding at least 11 others. No one immediately claimed responsibility for
the attack, which was similar to ones previously carried out by the country's
main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Four
explosive devices were launched from the back of a pickup truck parked next to

Saturday night. Abbott (5-2) allowed one run and seven hits to win his fourth
consecutive decision and improve to 3-0 career against Texas. He struck out six
and walked two in stopping the Rangers' three-game winning streak. Jose Mesa
walked the first two batters in the ninth, and Kazuhiro Sasaki got two outs
before walking Rafael Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez to force in a run to make it
6-3.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Take Aim at Lung Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When doctors diagnosed Billy Stamm with lung
cancer, there was more bad news to come. Not only was surgery out
of the question, the odds weren't good that he would respond to
conventional radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm's frail lungs were so ravaged by years of emphysema,
bronchitis and a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit, that radiation
therapy to kill the tumor also would have injured healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But the Connersville service station worker wasn't without hope.
</P>
<P>
   One of his doctors told him about an experimental therapy being
tested at the Indiana University School of Medicine. It used
precisely aimed high doses of radiation to try to kill tumors while
sparing healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm's doctors said there was a chance the tumor in his right
lung wouldn't spread if he chose no treatment. But the 57-year-old
decided to give the new therapy a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 'I'm game for just about anything right about now,'''
said Stamm, who was diagnosed in November. ''It sounded like
something worth giving a try. I didn't want to wait and do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Stamm became the seventh patient with inoperable lung
cancer to receive the new treatment -- stereotactic body
radiotherapy -- as part of a clinical trial at the Indianapolis
school.
</P>
<P>
   The first tests of the new therapy are aimed only at determining
the highest radiation level that can safely be given to the 35 or
so patients expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But the hope is that it will lead to a second clinical trial
that will reveal it as a potent treatment for inoperable, early
stage lung cancer, according to Dr. Mark Williams, the trial's
principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping this can become another option for a patient
group that has few options,'' said Williams, a clinical assistant
professor at IU.
</P>
<P>
   For lung cancer patients whose disease is in the early stage,
the survival prospects between those who undergo surgery to remove
tumors and those who can't is stark.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who undergo surgery have a cure rate between 50 to 70
percent. But for patients with inoperable tumors who get
conventional radiation instead, the cure rate is only 20 to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Considering those numbers, a more effective radiation therapy
would be an important development, said Dr. Robert D. Timmerman, an
assistant professor of radiation oncology at the medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Since the therapy was first used to treat a patient in the
United States, at IU in 1997, it has extended the predicted
lifespans of liver, colon and breast cancer patients whose cancer
had spread, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Timmerman, the trial's co-principal investigator, anticipates
improved results in the clinical trials because its subjects all
have lung cancer that hasn't spread to other organs.
</P>
<P>
   The new therapy taps into several advanced technologies,
including 3-D imaging, radiation beams that can be tailored to the
shape of the tumor and a new way to hold patients virtually
motionless to target the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach is used to effectively target brain tumors.
But it wasn't easy to transfer that technology beyond the cranium's
fixed tissues because tissue in the body's torso tends to shift,
Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The new therapy solves that problem with a special body frame
designed in Sweden to hold patients extremely still.
</P>
<P>
   The patient lies on a Styrofoam body pillow that, when the air
inside it is vacuumed out, creates a mold of the patient. The
pillow is saved and used in subsequent treatments to place the
patient in the same position.
</P>
<P>
   A device Timmerman likens to an apple press is pressed against
the patient's chest to restrict breathing as minute adjustments are
made to the body frame before photon radiation is fired at the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Because positioning each patient for the treatments can take up
to an hour, some need sedatives to remain still for so long,
Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the long wait is worth it because the cancer can be
precisely targeted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While in conventional radiation therapy, radiation can only be
focused at areas with diameters of 1.2 to 1.5 inches -- threatening
healthy tissue -- the new therapy can hit targets two-tenths of an
inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   That's possible with technology similar to that used to target
missiles. During an MRI or CAT scan, coordinates are assigned
throughout the patient's body to create a grid system that allows
the tumor's location to be known precisely when the patient is in a
specific position.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tumor is in the crosshairs, it is blasted with
radiation from seven directions. Another innovation permits the
radiation beams to be tailored to the tumor's shape.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have a tumor shaped like a banana, we can aim the beams
into the shape of a banana,'' Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology allows the highest radiation levels to be
focused at the tumor's center, with the intensity falling off
rapidly farther out.
</P>
<P>
   The new therapy offers hospital-weary patients another benefit.
</P>
<P>
   While patients in conventional radiation therapy receive about
35 separate treatments over a six-week period, the new treatment
requires just three treatments over about a 10-day period.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge the safety of the therapy's intense radiation, the
researchers are slowly increasing the radiation levels. Patients in
the latest group received in a single treatment about six times the
radiation of a conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If the therapy works, it will give oncologists a valuable new
weapon because early detection of lung cancer is improving, said
Dr. Norman H. Edelman, a scientific consultant for the American
Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept is good and I'll be waiting anxiously to see what
their results are,'' said Edelman, dean of the School of Medicine
at State University of New York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm, his wife, Millie, and son, Gene, 30, also are awaiting
results.
</P>
<P>
   Since his last treatment in late June, Stamm said he is faring
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling good, real good. No sickness or nothing. I think I
even feel a little better, but we'll see,'' he said.

<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Armand Assante's love of beautiful
women has brought him to the Balkans once again.
</P>
<P>
   The actor traveled to Romania to attend a beauty contest. It's
become a hobby of his -- last year, he spent a few days on Croatia's
coastline, also to attend a beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women in Eastern Europe are very sexy,'' Assante told the
Romanian daily National.
</P>
<P>
   Assante also attended the opening of a disco Saturday at the
Black Islands resort of Olimp, close to the summer vacation home of
former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like this part of the world. You have a deep culture,
without the pragmatism in the West which is sometimes too
aggressive,'' Assante said.

<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- If only ''Survivor'' castaway Rudy
Boesch could have reeled in a tuna while he was on the island of
Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   Boesch, 72, competing in a fishing tournament in his hometown of
Virginia Beach, had Saturday's largest catch when he reeled in a
115-pound bluefin tuna after fighting the fish for more than an
hour. The event offered up to $2 million for anyone catching a blue
marlin larger than 1,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Boesch has gained celebrity as one of the 16 people in the CBS
hit left to fend for themselves on the island off the coast of
Borneo to compete for a $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   On the episodes that have been broadcast so far, the castaways
have subsisted mostly on rice because their efforts to catch fish
have been unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Jill Sobule Writes About Environment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- What makes urban-angst folk singer Jill Sobule a
good songwriter?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a voyeur,'' Sobule says in Sunday's Daily News. ''As a
child I was shy and alone. I'd act like 'Harriet the Spy' -- more an
observer than a partaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobule, whose 1995 homoerotic song ''I Kissed a Girl'' was
banned on several Southern radio stations, draws heavily on
real-life characters in her adopted hometown of New York City,
where she has lived for the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You write about your environment. It's no surprise my audience
is East Coast and urban. My records aren't exactly selling in
Bloomington.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up in a Jewish family that was agnostic Jewish. There
was no talk of God,'' she adds. ''In fact, there was disdain for
(religion).''
</P>
<P>
   But she isn't lacking faith, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a running theme of disappointment in my work,''
Sobule says. ''But in the end, I'm like Charlie Brown. I'll go for
that football.''

<HEADLINE> Net2Phone, where NJ politics and high-tech investments meet  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - It's the high-tech choice of high-profile New
Jersey political figures.
</P>
<P>
   A former congressman is president of its parent company. New
Jersey's leading GOP fund-raiser is its chairman. One of New
Jersey's senators participated in an initial public offering of its
stock.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the House made several thousand dollars buying and
selling shares last year. A member of the governor's cabinet went
to work for it after resigning from the administration. The
governor's husband is an investor.
</P>
<P>
   These New Jersey politicians are investing their money, even
their careers, in Hackensack-based Net2Phone Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A majority-owned subsidiary of IDT Corp. of Newark, Net2Phone is
a leading competitor in the cutting-edge field of voice-enhanced
Internet communications. Net2Phone routes telephone calls via the
Internet and says users can save up to 95 percent off international
phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Net2Phone is Clifford Sobel, finance chairman
for the New Jersey Republican Party and head of fund raising in New
Jersey for Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. He is
a top fund-raiser for Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's husband, John, held $5,000 to $25,000 in Net2Phone
shares at the time of the governor's May 2000 financial disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, earned $16,000 to $65,000 last
year selling shares of Net2Phone, according to his recently
released financial disclosure form.
</P>
<P>
   Gualberto ''Gil'' Medina, who served as Whitman's commerce
commissioner, left the administration last month to become a vice
president at Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone is a subsidiary of IDT Corp., a Newark-based
international telecommunications company and Internet service
provider. Former Rep. Jim Courter, who served in the House for 12
years before running unsuccessfully for governor, joined IDT as
president in 1996. He also is vice chairman of IDT's governing
board and a major shareholder in Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   Among those elected this year to IDT's board of directors was
former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. In 1998, IDT named former
Rep. Jack Kemp, the GOP candidate for vice president in 1996, as
senior strategic adviser to its board.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Purpuro, a former top aide to Courter, was director of
international sales for IDT Corp. until last June, when Republican
National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson appointed him deputy
chief of staff of the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Purpuro arrived, the RNC announced it would
begin to accept phone calls to GOP headquarters via the Internet
through a deal with - who else? - Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of New Jersey's most prominent Democrats, Sen. Robert
Torricelli, got it on the act. He took part in an initial public
offering of Net2Phone stock last summer.
</P>
<P>
   According to his financial disclosure forms, Torricelli bought
$15,000 to $50,000 in shares of Net2Phone last July, sold $15,000
to $50,000 in shares two weeks later, and sold another $15,000 to
$50,000 worth three weeks after that. There is no way to tell from
the forms how much money, if any, Torricelli made on the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey politicians are not the only high-power entities
expressing interest in the two companies. Liberty Media, an
investment arm of AT&AMP;T Corp., bought a 10 percent stake this spring
in IDT. World Wide Web pioneer Yahoo! Inc. bought a 5 percent
interest in Net2Phone in March.
</P>
<P>
   If politicians seem particularly taken with Net2Phone, the
feeling is mutual. Net2Phone is involved in a movement lobbying
Congress not to regulate or tax Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   The company was a sponsor of an ''Internet Freedom Rally'' last
month in Washington. The rally protested a bill in Congress that
ensures people will never pay per-minute fees to get online. The
bill does not rule out access fees charged to companies, like
Net2Phone and its peers, that provide Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill in May, acting largely in response
to rumors on the Internet about a nonexistent bill that would
impose a per-minute access charge on Internet service providers,
ultimately to be passed on to consumers.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joely Fisher says her mother, singer-actress
Connie Stevens, knew how to balance her career and personal life.
Her playboy crooner father, Eddie Fisher, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who played the narcissistic Paige on the ABC sitcom
''Ellen,'' said show business and her father, who also was married
to Liz Taylor and Debbie Reynolds, were a toxic mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very destructive relationship. It's the opposite of
how I was brought up, this feeling that the only way you could
receive love was through being popular,'' said Fisher, 32, in
Sunday's Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who is starring in ''Cabaret'' on Broadway, said she
inherited her wit and her warmth from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mom's an amazing human being. I was a road baby. I fell
asleep in the bandstand many times over and watched this magical
performer in her beautiful flame dress, making people laugh and
cry,'' she said. ''But she's also the most rounded human being. She
made us know the balance.''

<P>
	   ISLAND BEACH STATE PARK, N.J. (AP) - A Plainsboro man died after
he tried to help rescue two girls swept off a sandbar by a riptide,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin House, 47, suffered an apparent heart attack Saturday when
he tried to assist another man who had gone after the girls, whose
ages were estimated at 10 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Park Chief Ranger James Hanebury told The Star-Ledger of Newark
the girls were about 100 yards from the beach when a riptide swept
them off the sandbar and into deep water about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' mother, who was on the beach, enlisted the aid of a
park patron, Thomas Wingler of Toms River, who went into the water
to rescue the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Wingler, also in his 40s, was able to reach the girls and help
them keep their heads above water, Hanebury said. However, Wingler
began to tire, and House, who saw the three in the water
struggling, went in the water to help.
</P>
<P>
   House was stricken just as he reached the three. Hanebury said
two other men from the beach were able to pull House, Wingler and
the girls ashore. Efforts on the beach to resuscitate House were
initiated, but he was pronounced dead en route to Community Medical
Center in nearby Toms River.
</P>
<P>
   Hanebury said the state park's eight-mile stretch of beach is
not covered by lifeguards. Beachgoers swim at their own risk.

<HEADLINE> Yale doctors say new heart transplant method will save more lives  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Doctors at Yale-New Haven
Hospital say
they have found a new approach to heart transplants that could save
the lives of critical patients.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of removing a whole diseased heart, the doctors have
developed a method to attach a new heart to the healthy half of the
original organ, leaving the patient with one-and-a-half hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, which works in dogs, could be tried in the first
human within three to six months, said Dr. John Elefteriades, chief
of cardiothoracic surgery at the Yale School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A description of the method was published in the June issue of
the medical journal The Annals of Thoracic Surgery and was met by
heart surgeons with a combination of fascination and caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of a clever idea,'' said Dr. Verdi J. DiSesa,
chairman of the department of cardiovascular-thoracic surgery at
Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they may be proposing an elaborate solution to something
we already have therapies for.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSesa, who wrote a commentary about the approach for the
journal, also echoed the fears of others who said that the Yale
method might make sicker people eligible for heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   With donor hearts already in short supply, that could increase
competition for an already too-small pool of organs. Every year,
there are about 7,500 people in the United States on waiting lists
for new hearts, and only about 2,500 get transplants, largely
because of a donor shortage, said Dr. Jonathan Hammond, a heart
surgeon at Hartford Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But Elefteriades said his method seems to solve one of the most
vexing problems for surgeons and patients - failure of the donor
heart because it is not strong enough to overcome a type of lung
damage common in people who have suffered from chronic heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Elefteriades stressed that most patients do well after a heart
transplant. He came up with the one-and-a-half heart idea out of
frustration after watching his sickest patients die either because
they did not qualify for a heart transplant, or because the donor
heart failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said, 'Let's think of something we haven't thought of.
Let's be creative,''' said the 49-year-old surgeon, who has been
transplanting hearts for 16 years.

<HEADLINE> Two years after 11-year-old girl killed, suspect's trial looms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DANIELSON, Conn. (AP) - Two years after an 11-year-old girl was
murdered while delivering newspapers, the man accused in her
slaying nears trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the wait has been a long one for the mother of Angelica
Padilla, whose body was found Aug. 13, 1998 near the Willimantic
complex where she - and, police say, her attacker - lived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the waiting ... and knowing that I'm going to have to
relive this all over again (during the trial), it's been very
stressful,'' said Mille Mercado, Padilla's mother. ''My life is not
the same and it will never be the same again. My daughter was my
only child, my company, my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime tore through the community. When word spread that
police were closing in on Jose Torres, a crowd about 500 people
strong gathered in front of his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla's murder also touched off debate surrounding Megan's
Law, named for a girl killed by a sex offender who lived in her New
Jersey neighborhood. The law requires convicted sex offenders to
register with police in files that must be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, police temporarily kept the sex
offender list from the public, prompting questions and criticism
from parents.
</P>
<P>
   Torres was convicted of third-degree sexual assault in 1996
regarding an attack on his ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Torres beat Padilla to death with a mechanic's
tool in a laundry room of the apartment complex. The girl's throat
was slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 28, has pleaded innocent to charges of capital felony
and murder. He is due in court Friday for a hearing, but his trial
is not expected to begin until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado said she visits a memorial to Padilla - erected at a
park on Route 195- a few times a week and is buoyed by the
continuing support from the people of Willimantic.
</P>
<P>
   ''People still leave little gifts and prayer cards,'' she said.
''Obviously the community hasn't forgotten and that's helped me so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercado said before going to bed every night, she talks to her
daughter's cremated remains, enclosed in a glass case in her living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst part is at night when Angelica is not here to kiss
me goodnight.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Want Egypt Professor Freed  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Human rights organizations urged Egyptian
authorities Sunday to release a leading liberal sociologist,
calling his arrest ''a kind of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociology professor at the American
University in Cairo and head of an Egyptian think tank, was
detained Friday night with three of his assistants and later
ordered detained for 15 days and transferred Cairo's Liman Tora
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who holds dual U.S.- Egyptian citizenship, said
prosecutors have charged him with preparing a documentary about
elections that harms Egypt's image, receiving foreign funds without
government permission and forging an election ballot. He said the
ballot was a dummy made expressly for the film.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said in a statement
Sunday that the arrests are ''generally connected to the state's
desire to silence all establishments that are trying to participate
in the country's public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group ''has strong suspicions that the state is
practicing a kind of terrorism against civil societies to ... stop
their initiatives in the field of defending human rights or
supporting democracy, or participating in economic, social and
political development.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human Rights called for
Ibrahim's immediate release, saying it fears his imprisonment is
related to his ideas and work.
</P>
<P>
   While Egyptian authorities often detain rights activists, it is
rare that an academic of Ibrahim's standing is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet-spoken champion of human rights, Ibrahim runs the Ibn
Khaldun Center for Development Studies, a Cairo think tank, and is
often interviewed and quoted by foreign journalists. He is also on
the board of directors of the Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, a government-funded think tank.
</P>
<P>
   For years Ibrahim has criticized Arab governments for their lack
of democracy and discrimination against minorities. In Egypt, he
called for greater opportunities for the country's Coptic
Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country's 64
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The EOHR identified two of the assistants arrested with Ibrahim
as Nadia Abdel-Nour, a Sudanese citizen, and Osama Hammad. The
statement said the prosecution has ordered the arrest of three
other employees at the center, identified as Khaled Fayyad, Mamdouh
Mansour and Ayman Gabal.
</P>
<P>
   The EOHR said such arrests will frustrate active forces in the
society and called on ''all democratic forces in Egypt and around
the world to declare their solidarity with the Ibn Khaldun Center
in defense of democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Tear Gas Macau Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU (AP) -- Police hurled tear gas canisters Sunday at about
200 unemployed people protesting the hiring of foreign workers on
the island that was recently reverted to Chinese control.
</P>
<P>
   The violence flared when the protesters tried to break through a
police barrier during a march to a park near government
headquarters. The demonstrators, carrying placards and chanting
slogans, threw bamboo poles and rocks at the baton-brandishing
police.
</P>
<P>
   Police warned the protesters to disperse before resorting to
tear gas. The pandemonium sent people fleeing. Police said there
were no reports of injuries and that they detained 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was organized by the Macau Unemployed Workers
Self-Help Association.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a protester was injured during a similar protest.
</P>
<P>
   Macau, with a population of 450,000, employs about 27,000
foreign workers. Many of them come from the Philippines, Thailand
and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny territory, a popular gambling resort, was hit hard
during the Asian financial crisis and unemployment has shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Macau was returned to Chinese sovereignty last December after
more than four centuries of Portuguese administration. In recent
years, its image has been tarnished by violent gang wars, though
mob killings have tapered off since China resumed control.

<HEADLINE> Newly crowned Miss New York stresses children's health  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Miss New York 2000 is a nursing student
who wants to promote physical fitness, especially among young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Falgiano, 21, of Amherst was crowned Saturday night. She
said her new title requires working with, and improving, the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan to get involved in local schools and work with
government officials,'' Falgiano told a press conference on Sunday.
''We need to invest more time in our children's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Falgiano holds an associate degree from Erie Community College
and is working toward a master's degree in nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the three-day pageant, 28 young women from around the state
vied for the title, competing in talent, swimsuit, evening wear and
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dreamed the dream and poured my heart into this,'' Falgiano,
who was last year's first runner-up, said. ''Competing in the Miss
America program is about taking good care of yourself and keeping
up on current events. It's not just standing up on the stage and
being a beautiful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   She will represent the state at the Miss America pageant in
Atlantic City this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Falgiano takes the crown from last year's winner, Brandi
Burkhardt.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon too crowded? See America's crime scenes instead  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Calling all cars - and RVs and motorcycles -
that are toting tourists tired of well-trod attractions. Just in
time for the summer travel months comes ''Crime Scene USA,'' a
guide to murder and mayhem in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book has its humor (check ''Cowabungled, Dude!'' in
the Hawaii chapter, about a surfer turned not-so-bright murderer)
the more than 150 crime scenes listed are historically accurate and
well researched.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites are well known (the scenes where President Kennedy,
John Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated); some are
recent (the homes of JonBenet Ramsey and Nicole Brown Simpson); and
others are from the era of Jesse James and the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Hyperion, was written by Neal S. Yonover
and edited by members of a loosely organized group called BADGE -
the Bureau of Amateur Detectives and Gatherers of Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   BADGE member David Borgenicht says that because ''the country is
really fascinated by crime,'' the attractions indeed draw visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody's using it as their sole travel book,
but if you happen to be traveling through that town, there's
something different to see,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The book's introduction puts America's fascination with crime
rather succinctly: ''The bottom line, as one true crime fan
described it, is that the place where Lincoln gave the Gettysburg
address is interesting, but not like the place where he was shot.
Because it's history, only better.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Monkkonen, a professor at the University of California at
Los Angeles who studies urban murders, said there are two reasons
people are fascinated by crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''One, because crime is truly damaging to both individuals and
the society, and two, because the crime stories we follow have a
comforting narrative pattern, beginning, middle and end,''
Monkkonen said. ''So, the story of a crime both worries and then
comforts us.''
</P>
<P>
   When researching the book, BADGE members had a lot to choose
from in the big states like California and New York (sites
associated with Son of Sam and Charles Manson, among others). The
smaller states were a challenge but, alas, crime even occurs in the
serenity of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just an amazing mix of stuff that you can see, whether
you're interested in historical outlaws, or sort of contemporary
tabloid celebrities,'' said Borgenicht.
</P>
<P>
   The book lists every state. It includes narratives on unsolved
serial murders and asks the public's help in solving them. It also
alerts travelers to bed and breakfasts, bookstores and museums with
crime themes.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has the most crime scenes listed, and tourists
have already discovered the spot where John Lennon was gunned down
in 1980. Tourists flock on a daily basis to take pictures outside
the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived opposite Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's that famous doorway,'' Sally Johannsen of New Orleans
said as she pointed to the Dakota entrance where Lennon was shot.
''It's in the tour book, so we came to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But tourist buses have yet to run to other crime scenes: the
site where the Son of Sam (David Berkowitz) was arrested after he
spent the summer of 1976 terrorizing the city; the park where
rocker David Lee Roth was busted in a 1993 drug sting; and the
seedy spot that spawned this famous 1983 New York Post headline:
''Headless body in topless bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists in California already visit Alcatraz, but how many
actually trek to the site where the body of a woman later dubbed
''the Black Dahlia'' was found in 1947, or to the house where
gangster Bugsy Siegel was gunned down the same year?
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, tourists are told to head for Chicago, the site of
the St. Valentine's Day massacre as well as to Al Capone's
speakeasy, house and tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild West lives again in Globe, Ariz., where tourists can
see where Pearl Hart, the West's only female stagecoach robber, was
captured in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   ''The robbery was successful, but the escape wasn't,'' the book
reads. ''Hart and her partner promptly got themselves lost
galloping off into the hills.'' They were captured the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Several key moments in the Civil Rights movement are chronicled,
from the Birmingham, Ala., church where four young girls died in a
bombing in 1963, to the site of King's slaying in 1968 at a motel
in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the offbeat entries, such as ''Cowabungled, Dude!''
In 1996, Richard Star went to a Honolulu surf shop and bought a
surfboard bag. To make sure it was the right size, he climbed into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once inside the bag, he told the salesperson, 'Gee, it sure is
spooky in here. I'd hate to have it zipped up,'' the entry reads.
</P>
<P>
   When police found Star's wife in the bag, they didn't look far
for her killer. ''Star is now hanging ten-to-life in a mainland
prison,'' the book adds.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller and more rural states proved to be a challenge, but
the book manages to find crime there as well. The Maine chapter
begins: ''There's so little noteworthy crime here, it's hard to
believe that master horror writer Stephen King makes it his home.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lone entry from Maine is from 1937, when then ''Public
Enemy No. 1,'' Al Brady - who had committed four murders and 150
robberies - was killed in a shootout with FBI agents in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places listed in the book, Borgenicht said to him,
the most famous crime scene in American history is the site
opposite the Texas Book Depository in Dallas where President
Kennedy was killed in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a site that has memorialized the event,'' he said.
''It's part of our national consciousness, you can really visualize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 176-page book, costing $12.95, includes advice on visiting
crime scenes. Respect private property, it says, or you could end
up in jail. Another tidbit - ''With few exceptions, the most
vicious sociopathic killers look just like everyone else'' - seems
to advise visitors to think about who could be standing next to
them at any given crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   And one last tip: Enjoy your trip and don't forget your
fingerprint kit.

<HEADLINE> McCall seeking to cement one key core of supporters  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic state Comptroller H. Carl McCall
may not be the drunk-with-ambition candidate for governor that
those close to the current governor, Republican George Pataki, are
working hard to portray him as.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall is doing many of the things candidates tend to do two
years or so out from a gubernatorial election they look likely to
jump into.
</P>
<P>
   That includes making sure those groups they count on to form
their core support stay healthy, happy and loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came a letter from McCall personally addressed to some
260,000 of New York's local and state government retirees last week
informing them of what most already knew - that the state
Legislature and governor agreed in June to allow the retirees to
share in more of the assets of the public employees' pension funds
in New York. Perhaps just as important to pensioners, the state
will institute a recurring system of annual cost-of-living
increases.
</P>
<P>
   For an 82-year-old school custodian who retired in 1980, for
instance, the benefit increases taking effect on Sept. 30, 2000,
will increase his annual pension from $5,737 to $7,439. A
60-year-old teacher who retired in 1990 will see her benefits
increase from $30,210 a year to $32,196.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fighting for this since I took office seven years
ago, but it's the retirees who deserve all the credit,'' McCall
told beneficiaries under the letterhead of the largest pension fund
he administers as comptroller, the New York State and Local
Retirement Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congratulations on finally winning the good fight,'' the
letter continued. ''I am proud to have been with you during this
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall added that retirees could expect another letter from him
this fall providing specifics of how the changes would affect their
individual pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this campaign material in the guise of an informational
letter to members of pension funds McCall administers?
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's aides insisted it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not a declared candidate for anything, No. 1,'' his
chief spokesman Steven Greenberg said. ''Two, he is in the second
year of a four-year term. Third, and most importantly, this is an
important benefit change affecting 260,000 people and historically
the pension system has always written to retirees to inform them
about changes in their retirement system.''
</P>
<P>
   As sole administrator of the $127 billion pension fund, McCall
would be negligent to his fiduciary responsibilities if he did not
inform retirees about changes in their benefits, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement system paid for the mailing, Greenberg said. He
did not know how much it cost.
</P>
<P>
   Public government retirees are a solid little voting bloc in New
York and of an age - retirement age - where people tend to get to
the ballot box in large numbers on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has proven popular among retirees because he has
advocated for an automatic cost-of-living increase in their
benefits since he became comptroller. Of the 260,000 or so living
retirees from the State and Local Retirement Systems, the vast
majority continue to live in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But their numbers would hardly be enough to swing most
elections, especially considering Pataki outdistanced his closest
challenger by more than 1 million votes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki is sure to counter McCall's influence among the
retirees by pointing out that as governor he also favored the
cost-of-living increase and was the guiding force behind the STAR
property tax-cut program, which was put into effect for senior
citizens before other homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   These are the calculations made when the sparring starts against
a perceived political opponent, even if the election is 28 months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides have already started to give the scripted answer
when McCall criticizes a Pataki administration agency or budget
that it is ''sad'' the Democratic comptroller is putting personal
ambition above those served by whatever program or department he is
authorized by the state constitution to examine. Often, McCall's
auditors find such mundane problems - frequently, bad computer
software or office bookkeeping practices - that it defies
explanation how his office's criticisms amounts to political
opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon declined to comment on McCall's
letter to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at history, one could wonder why Pataki would feel
threatened by a possible challenge from a state comptroller. No
sitting comptroller won election as governor throughout the 20th
century, and polls consistently show average New Yorkers have only
a vague idea of who their comptroller is or what he does.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki and his advisers can count, too. In 1998, McCall got
more than 2.8 million votes as he won re-election - or almost
300,000 more than Pataki received.

<HEADLINE> Retransmitting to fix category code  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Julie, the ex-admissions officer, lives in
Thailand, and Lian, the screenplay-writing housewife, in
California. Monica does medical research in Oregon, Sheila is a New
York school principal and sports marketer Liz goes back and forth
between those two places.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Dolan sisters, five women who grew up in Connecticut
but have since spread far and wide. They have different lives and
careers, but share one thing - they love to talk to each other
about everything and anything, from politics to personal health.
</P>
<P>
   Such chats used to be private. No more. Now, the Dolans have
their own radio show, ''Satellite Sisters,'' that connects them via
satellite from their local stations to do what they call
''conversation radio.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really trying to replicate the kind of phone calls
that we had with each other, the kind of really encouraging
conversation that used to always make me feel better,'' Julie, 44,
said of the first 12 shows the sisters taped.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite Sisters, co-produced by WNYC Radio, debuted on public
radio April 1 and has been airing in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago
and Portland, Ore., and on the Internet. Now the show is being
syndicated nationally by Public Radio International.
</P>
<P>
   It seems an unlikely endeavor for five women with no background
in radio.
</P>
<P>
   The idea surfaced in 1996 when Liz, then vice president of
marketing for Nike, and Julie, an admissions officer with a
California college, were complaining about their jobs. Listening
in, Julie's husband suggested they find a project for all five
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of dawned on us, the only thing we really know how to
do together is talk to each other,'' Liz, 42, said during a recent
trip to New York that brought together all five sisters for the
first time in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   The other sisters agreed to take part, and the five put together
a proposal that Liz described as ''radio that sounded more like
real life and real conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   She took it to WNYC, the nation's largest public radio station,
where she had contacts. It was good timing because the station
wanted to add more women's voices.
</P>
<P>
   WNYC definitely got more voices with the very vocal Dolans. In
an interview, the five sisters were constantly talking, sometimes
one over the other, and often breaking into laughter. They went off
on tangents, from makeup to the impact of parent organizations in
school.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of freewheeling, silly-to-serious-and-back-again
interaction that the sisters try to capture on air. Topics so far
have included Julie's move to Bangkok for her husband's career and
whether she should pack her gravy boat, how to do proper breast
self-exams - after Lian thought she had found a lump - and the
appeal of a nude juice bar, with comments from a male friend of
Lian.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters often bring in friends or colleagues with knowledge
of certain issues; potential topics are discussed in e-mails and
conference calls with the producers. Julie said the show has an
emphasis on health care and finances because ''we don't think
people, women in particular,'' talk about these enough.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Liz and Julie share anchoring duties with 35-year-old
Lian. Sheila, 41, and Monica, 40, usually contribute segments but
aren't on every show. Each show is expected to feature at least
three of sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the family - the Dolans have three brothers - loves
the show. Their parents, now living in Portland, tune in an hour
early to the public radio station to make sure they don't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ''One time, I called and they said, 'We can't talk to you,
you're on the air,''' Julie said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters also hear from listeners who say the conversations
sound like their own chats with sisters or close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people really like the fact that we're
sisters and they kind of latch on to the back-and-forth that we
have,'' Sheila said.
</P>
<P>
   The five sisters say the show has helped them see different
aspects of each other's personalities. ''It's been a very special
family project,'' Lian said.
</P>
<P>
   And has it changed the way they talk to each other?
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's almost worse,'' Julie said with a laugh. ''Now we'll
have a conversation not related to work and Lian will start to say
something and it's 'Oh, oh, don't tell me, save it for the show!'''

<HEADLINE> With perseverance and a little luck, sisters get film to screen  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Five years ago, two sisters set out to write a
screenplay for a feature film based on several short stories by
Joyce Carol Oates. One sister would direct, the other would take a
starring role.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that neither had ever written a screenplay. Or that
Lisanne, the would-be director, had never directed a feature film.
Or that the subject matter of their movie was to cover ground that
was quite dark, including insanity, domestic violence and lives
built around lies.
</P>
<P>
   But, after dozens of script changes, temp jobs, dead ends and
finally, a little luck, ''Getting to Know You'' opened in New York
for a two-week run last week, and will be screened in Los Angeles
and the San Francisco Bay Area in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a very positive review this week, The New York Times film
critic Elvis Mitchell said the movie ''conjures an alluring spell
of mistrust and hope,'' and that the work itself tests the
independent film system ''because it's missing the cramped,
high-concept, low-budget pushiness that makes many small films the
bargain bin equivalent of studio pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how New York natives Lisanne and Tristine Skyler
moved from the kernel of an idea to a critically acclaimed film is
itself the story of independent cinema - from the scramble for cash
and the struggle against compromising ideals, to the necessity of
always keeping an eye on what sells.
</P>
<P>
   And even after the commercial success of independent films in
recent years such as the ''Blair Witch Project,'' the vast majority
of movies made outside the studio system never make it to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for people to take a chance on something that's
different,'' said Tristine, ''and much easier for them to want to
make something derivative, if that's what has a record of doing
well commercially.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Skylers had become enthralled by three stories in a
short story collection by Oates called ''Heat,'' that the sisters
describe as being about ''women at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories would be linked into a coherent film by placing a
16-year-old girl named Judith, played by Heather Matarazzo, at the
center of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Judith is waiting for a bus in an upstate New York
bus station when she meets an older boy who snares her attention by
telling her the intimate details of the lives of some of their
fellow travelers - though it is never made clear whether the tales
are true or if the boy has invented them.
</P>
<P>
   Lisanne, 30, who has made several documentaries, including ''No
Loans Today,'' a well-received look at a pawnshop in South Central
Los Angeles that aired on PBS in 1996, had never directed a feature
before. Neither she nor Tristine had written a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   What they did have was a naive sense of their chance of
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but our passion for the
material really carried us through,'' said Lisanne.
</P>
<P>
   And while they were pushed to do a more mainstream film, the
sisters resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want it to be 'Short Cuts,''' said Tristine,
referring to the film based on several short stories by Raymond
Carver. ''We didn't want it to be conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers were eventually able to get financing for their
nontraditional story in a very traditional way: They lined up stars
- independent stars.
</P>
<P>
   Matarazzo, who set the indie film world on its ear with her
performance in ''Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' had agreed to do the
film contingent on whether it got financing back in 1996 after she
read an early version of the script.
</P>
<P>
   And based on the strength of their script and the help of a pair
of producers they were working with, the filmmakers also got
commitments from Bebe Neuwirth, Mary McCormack and Chris Noth, of
''Law and Order,'' and ''Sex and the City'', simply by mailing
scripts to agents.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters also had a tentative commitment from Casey Affleck,
although he had to drop out to do another film.
</P>
<P>
   After years of dead ends in which it seemed the movie wouldn't
get made, the Skylers eventually got financing through
ShadowCatcher, a Seattle-based production company whose founders
had backed the groundbreaking indie film ''Sex, Lies &AMP; Videotape''
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was contingent, however, on substantial script changes.
As a result, the role of a twentysomething looking for love written
for Tristine was reduced from 30 pages in the script to just 12
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting took place in Asbury Park, N.J., over 22 days on a $1
million budget. An abandoned carpet and tile store was transformed
into the film's bus station. The down-on-its-luck seaside town
stood in for a depressed Rust Belt town.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, things got easier. The film premiered at the 1999
Sundance Film Festival, where it received a positive response. It
also played at the Venice Film Festival, where it was purchased for
the Italian market.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, however, didn't get picked up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Decisions by distributors are based on what's the hook, who's
going to like it, how do we market it,'' said Lisanne. ''People
don't push independent films to promote art, but because they want
to make money.... Distributors couldn't see the angle.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the film fell between recognized genres: woman's film,
mystery movie, art house flick.
</P>
<P>
   So the sisters waited. For two years.
</P>
<P>
   The wait finally ended when New York's Film Forum movie theater
expressed interest this spring - five years after the sisters first
came up with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like adolescence,'' said Tristine, ''If someone had told
you how hard it was going to be and all the things you'd have to go
through, you might not want to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed in Cola Contamination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A man who reportedly tried to extort
$730,000 from Coca-Cola's German headquarters by placing
contaminated bottles on supermarket shelves was arrested when he
tried to collect the money, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old suspect faces at least one year in prison if
convicted on the blackmail charge, said Job Tilmann, a spokesman
for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The substance added to the bottles, which were placed on store
shelves around Frankfurt between January and June, was not
life-threatening, Tilmann said. All of the bottles were eventually
located by police, he said, adding ''it wasn't very many.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilmann declined to release other details, saying he did not
want to aid potential copycats.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman at the offices in Essen declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Munich couple is currently on trial in Frankfurt for allegedly
trying to extort money from Nestle by poisoning that company's
products between October 1998 and last December.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old man was sentenced to 11 years last September on
similar charges, also involving brands belonging to Nestle.

<HEADLINE> Iran Nixes New Ties With Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian-Egyptian communications have
improved considerably, but formal restoration of diplomatic ties is
not imminent, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Relations are very different from what they were in the past.
However, reports appearing in the media that the two countries will
establish diplomatic relations soon are not accurate,'' state-run
Tehran radio quoted Hamid-Reza Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Sadeq Hosseini, an adviser to Iran's minister of
culture, had said Saturday that the restoration of ties with Egypt
was imminent after more than 20 years of estrangement. Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Adeli said last week that
restoration of ties would be announced within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Asefi's comments contradicted those statements. And in
Egypt, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa discounted reports that Iran has
agreed to upgrade diplomatic ties to the ambassador level.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not informed about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his Iranian counterpart,
Mohammad Khatami, spoke by telephone last month -- the first direct
contact between leaders of the two states since Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were severed after Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
Relations deteriorated further when Egypt gave refuge to the ousted
Iranian shah, who was buried in Cairo in 1980. But the mood began
to improve after Khatami, a political moderate, took office in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Several lingering diplomatic disagreements still divide the
sides. Iran has objected to Egypt's dealings with Israel, and Egypt
has urged Iran to rename a street named after Khaled al-Islambouli,
the Muslim militant army officer who assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Conference To Meet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Call it another millennium milestone: Sometime in
the coming year or so, for the first time in human history, most of
the world's population will be living in cities rather than rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   How to cope with the march toward teeming urbanization --
especially in the poorer countries of Asia and Latin America -- is
the focus this week of a global ''conference on the urban future''
organized by Germany as part of its Expo 2000 world's fair.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan joins Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in opening the three-day Urban 21 conference Tuesday in
Berlin. They will welcome thousands of academics, public officials,
activists, architects and urban planners from more than 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future of mankind lies in the cities,'' Schroeder wrote in
his welcome address.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ways must be found to keep the social and
ecological problems associated with uncontrolled growth from
smothering the advantages metropolises offer as hubs of economic
development, technological innovation and cultural dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   The conference follows up on objectives laid out by two
U.N.-sponsored sessions on urban development: a 1992 conference in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the 1996 Habitat II summit in Istanbul,
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the last session, the United Nations acknowledged that
governments can't solve all urban ills -- from homelessness to
pollution to overcrowding -- alone. It invited activists, businesses
and other experts to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Germany, South Africa, Brazil and Singapore have
worked together on organizing regional meetings to share ideas and
promote problem-solving partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Urban 21 is geared toward a ''global specialist public,'' but
delegates also will hear firsthand about the problems of
''mega-cities'' from those who run them. The mayors of two dozen
major cities -- from Beijing and Moscow to Istanbul and Cape Town,
South Africa -- opened their own summit Sunday in Berlin and were to
present their findings to the main conference.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of the report to be adopted at Urban 21,
the number of city dwellers will double over the next quarter
century to 5 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the human race, up
from 47 percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the growth will be in the developing world, especially
Asia. ''It is here, in the exploding cities of some of the poorest
countries of the world, that the central challenge lies,'' the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of Urban 21 is to ''elaborate solutions, visions and
guiding principles'' to meet that challenge in the 21st century,
German Transport, Building and Housing Minister Reinhard Klimmt
wrote in his official invitation.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Reject Multiparty Politics  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandans have overwhelmingly rejected
multiparty politics in favor of continuing with President Yoweri
Museveni's ''no-party'' system, according to final referendum
results Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Nkurukenda, deputy chairwoman of the Electoral
Commission, said 90.7 percent of voters ballots chose the
''non-party'' system and 9.3 percent opposed it in Thursday's vote.
Officials said 51.1 percent of registered voters, or about 4.8
million, cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''People of Uganda fulfilled a constitutional requirement to
choose the political system of their choice,'' said Hope Kivengere,
Museveni's spokeswoman. Kivengere said voting was peaceful and
free.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the referendum could not immediately be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties in Uganda are allowed to exist in name only:
They cannot campaign, raise funds or field candidates on party
colors. Party leaders have argued that basic political rights
should never have been restricted when Museveni came to power in
1986 after a five-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional political parties had called for a boycott of the
vote. But it wasn't clear whether the boycott, rainy weather or
simply a lack of interest was responsible for the low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni blames political parties for creating the religious and
ethnic divisions that plunged Uganda into chaos from the mid-1970s
until he assumed power.
</P>
<P>
   Western donors, who contributed $4.5 million to the cost of
holding the referendum, expressed concern Saturday that the results
could lead to a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of donors emphasizes the importance of insuring that
the movement system does not evolve into a de facto one-party
state. Experience shows that such development would not be in the
interest of transparent and accountable government in Uganda,''
their statement said.

<HEADLINE> Pair suspected in spree of bank holdups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. - A Trenton woman and a New York man under
surveillance in connection with a near-monthlong spree of bank
robberies were arrested Saturday after authorities followed them to
a Hopewell Township bank and apprehended them after it was robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Annie M. Ford, 31, of Trenton and Tim Martin Johnston, 33, of
New York City were arrested Saturday after the 9:30 a.m. robbery at
a First Union bank branch at the Pennington Circle. A third suspect
remains at large, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they believe Johnston is the person caught on
surveillance videotape in the string of robberies that began June
7. Banks in Trenton, Ewing, Lawrence and Burlington City were
robbed in addition to ones in Falls and Middletown townships in
Pennsylvania. Ford is suspected of assisting in many of the
robberies, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   A task force - made up of the FBI and police from the towns in
which the nine banks were robbed - had placed the pair under
surveillance and on Saturday followed them to the First Union bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could have gone to the movies or shopping or to the
shore, but instead they robbed a bank,'' FBI Special Agent Jim
Dougherty told The Times of Trenton for Sunday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Doughtery said authorities were unable to prevent Johnston from
entering the bank but took up positions outside and awaited his
exit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bank was open, and people were trying to go in, and there
we were with our pistols drawn, waving people away,'' Dougherty
told The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bank, Johnston ordered a teller to fill a plastic bag
with money. He exited the bank and tried to flee after he was
approached by police. Johnston threw the bag of money into the air
and began to run, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made the apprehension in the middle of Pennington Circle,''
Dougherty told The Times. ''The money was flying all over. A good
bit of it was on the road. We recovered all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was arrested in the bank parking lot, waiting in a vehicle,
Dougherty said. The third suspect remains to be identified, but
authorities said that person also was caught on surveillance
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities declined to reveal the amount of cash taken Saturday
but said it was more than $3,000.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hurl Stones at Israelis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- About 1,000 Palestinians shouting
anti-Israel slogans hurled stones at Israeli soldiers across the
border Sunday, breaking the window of a military vehicle, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waving Palestinian flags, the demonstrators chanted ''God is
great'' in Arabic as they threw stones at an Israeli military
outpost at the border fence separating Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the window of a passing armored Israeli jeep was
broken, but Israeli soldiers did not respond with gunfire as they
have in the past at the Fatima gate in Kfar Kila village.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, including women and children, also threw
stones at another Israeli jeep and an agricultural tractor, but
missed, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima al-Saedi, a 65-year-old Palestinian woman who has been
living in Lebanon since the founding of Israel in 1948, asserted
her right to return to her home village.
</P>
<P>
   ''God willing, we will return to Palestine and the Jews will be
thrown into the sea,'' she said as she taunted Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowd, Abdullah Kamel, a member of the Central
Committee of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
said, ''There can be no just peace in the region without (ensuring)
the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland and (granting
them) self-determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Palestinian refugees is one of the issues meant to
be resolved by a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty. The two
sides have until Sept. 13 to reach a final accord.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel completed its troop pullout from south Lebanon on
May 24, there have been frequent incidents along the border, with
Lebanese demonstrators taunting Israeli soldiers and pelting them
with stones. Several people have been wounded by Israeli gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has refused to deploy troops to keep the
peace in southern Lebanon until it is satisfied that Israel has
completely withdrawn from the country. Lebanon maintains that
Israel is still occupying tracts of its land along the border.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Spar Over Drug Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Competing Democratic and Republican approaches
to providing prescription drug insurance for older Americans are
full of trade-offs. President Clinton's plan appears more generous,
but the congressional Republicans' proposal might lead to cheaper
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pocketbook questions really do matter to (Medicare)
beneficiaries,'' said Patricia Smith, senior health care lobbyist
for AARP, the nation's largest organization of older people.
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislation passed by the House last week would
extend drug coverage through government-subsidized policies sold by
private insurers. An alternative proposed by President Clinton and
supported by most congressional Democrats would establish a
standard, government-run Medicare benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for compromise this year are uncertain, but polls show
the issue is likely to be a priority for older voters in this
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Each party says its formula would guarantee availability of new
drug coverage nationwide, although insurance companies have
expressed doubts about their ability to offer the private policies
specified by the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming availability, however, whether to purchase the new drug
coverage would be up to retirees under both the Democrat and
Republican approaches. Both parties tout their plans as the better
buy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This provides more political coverage for the Republicans who
voted for it than insurance coverage for the seniors who need to
buy medicine,'' Clinton said last week as he blasted the GOP bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader from Texas, predicted on
''Fox News Sunday'' that Clinton will sign the GOP plan despite
repeated pledges to veto it. ''The fact is, this president will
sign into law a measure ... that so thoroughly well relates to the
needs of our seniors ... and makes him look good as if he's
building a legacy,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   And on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, decried ''the constant Democrat approach,'' which he
said ''is to just throw money at it, make it universal so that the
taxpayers are stuck with it the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan
analysis of legislation, predicts that virtually all Medicare
beneficiaries who lack drug insurance, an estimated 13 million
people, could be expected to buy the policy offered under Clinton's
plan. By comparison, only 46 percent would be likely to buy a
private policy such as those offered under the GOP plan, the CBO
has said in its written reports.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption is based largely on the fact that Clinton's
benefit offers retirees more for the price they would be charged.
In other words, the government is picking up more of the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is estimated to cost the Treasury $253 billion
over 10 years, compared to $159 billion for the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at another factor that would hit senior citizens'
wallets, CBO analysts estimated that under the GOP plan,
competition among insurers would reduce drug costs by up to 25
percent compared to what an uninsured consumer spends. Savings
under Clinton's plan would amount to only around 12.5 percent, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear from the CBO analysis how much of the savings would
reach consumers under either plan, but any discounts could help
older people by lowering the price they pay even when a
prescription is not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? The GOP plan gets bigger savings in part because it
would allow insurers more flexibility not only to negotiate with
drug companies and pharmacies, but also to restrict coverage to
drugs on so-called formulary lists and impose graduated co-payments
-- for example, charging consumers more for brand names.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Clinton's plan would cost retirees about $312 a
year in premiums to get 50 percent off the cost of their
prescriptions covered until they collected a maximum of $1,000 in
basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, typical drug coverage under the GOP plan would cost
beneficiaries around $720 per year in premiums and deductibles to
get 50 percent off their prescriptions paid for until they
collected a maximum of $1,050 in basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic coverage to pay all drug costs would kick in if, in
a single year, a retiree's drug spending topped $4,000 under
Clinton's plan and $6,000 under the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue the CBO's estimate of lower participation in
their plan is based only on a sample policy. In practice, insurance
companies would have freedom to design a variety of policies to
meet different needs. For example, some plans might offer
no-deductible policies with higher co-pays, which could be more
attractive to some retirees.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Breezes to No. 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Clooney's ''The Perfect Storm'' blew
Mel Gibson out of the water at the box office over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on the true story of a fishing crew battling a
behemoth tempest, took in $41.7 million to debut at No. 1 at the
weekend box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's gross almost doubled that of Mel Gibson's
Revolutionary War spectacle ''The Patriot,'' which took in $21.7
million Friday to Sunday to finish at No. 2. The animated adventure
''Chicken Run,'' featuring Gibson's voice, came in at No. 3 with
$12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other big release, ''The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' opened to a disappointing $6.6 million for fifth
place.
</P>
<P>
   The overall box office was good news for Hollywood. After three
slumping weekends that put the industry behind last summer's record
revenues, the top 12 films this weekend grossed $121.8 million, up
5.3 percent over the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a prospect that for the five-day weekend through
Tuesday, the industry could approach the $198.3 million Fourth of
July record set in 1996, when ''Independence Day'' opened.
</P>
<P>
   With three big movies premiering, the Fourth of July had been
viewed as the pivotal weekend for Hollywood's summer season, when
studios rake in about 40 percent of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   As late as last week, industry observers figured the box-office
crown would be a tossup between ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''The
Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised by the disparity between the grosses for
'Perfect Storm' and 'Patriot,''' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie-ticket sales. ''I didn't
think there would be that wide of a gap.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot'' may have been hurt by its R rating and two-hour,
40-minute running time, half an hour longer than ''The Perfect
Storm,'' rated PG-13. As a period piece, ''The Patriot'' also had a
tough battle against the digital wizardry that created the striking
wave action in ''The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a really cutting-edge effort,'' said Dan Fellman, head
of distribution for Warner Bros., which released ''The Perfect
Storm.'' ''It was the first time anyone's been able to generate
those kinds of effects on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane, ''The Perfect Storm''
was the third-highest grossing movie ever to open over Fourth of
July weekend, behind ''Men in Black'' and ''Independence Day,''
which debuted with about $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   '''Perfect Storm' is the more traditional Fourth of July, big
special-effects roller-coaster ride,'' said Dean Devlin, a producer
of ''The Patriot.'' ''I'm just happy we weathered the storm. I was
really worried they would wipe us out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot'' broke a stigma in Hollywood that movie-goers
aren't interested in the American Revolution, Devlin said. The last
such film, Al Pacino's ''Revolution,'' was a flop in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think people are sitting around saying they can't wait
for the next movie about the American Revolution,'' Devlin said.
''But I definitely think we have broken that curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $41.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Patriot,'' $21.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Chicken Run,'' $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Shaft,'' $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Big Momma's House,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Gladiator,'' $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Living in U.S. May Win Seat  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than three decades after leading the
Mexican student movement that fought for democracy and workers'
rights, Jose Jacques Medina hopes to speak for another potentially
powerful group: Mexicans who now live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has put Medina of Los
Angeles and Raul Ross of Chicago on the list of candidates for
Mexico's 200 at-large congressional seats, which are allotted
according to parties' vote percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Medina is so far down the list he has no chance of being
elected. But Ross could be elected if the PRD does well. The party
claims it would be the first time a Mexican national living in the
United States is named to Mexico's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has held
Mexico's presidency since 1929, has made a similar pledge. Eddie
Baron Levy of Los Angeles is on its list Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Just placing U.S. residents on the ballot is a significant
gesture by parties that in the past have often ignored Mexican
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, was in a
neck-and-neck race Sunday against Vicente Fox of the center-right
National Action Party. The PRD's Cuahtemoc Cardenas was in third
place in polls.
</P>
<P>
   The 200 proportional representatives join 300 directly elected
representatives in Mexico's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   About ten percent of Mexican adults -- 7 million to 10 million
people -- live in the United States. PRD leaders say the nationals
don't have a voice in Mexico's Congress partly because the PRI has
refused to back laws that would implement voting beyond Mexico's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups say the PRI fears most Mexicans in the United
States would vote against it. Some Mexican nationals cross the
border to vote, but there are only a limited number of ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, now 55 and a community organizer in Los Angeles, says he
didn't seek the nomination. The PRD came to him.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted, though he doesn't relish the idea of commuting to
Mexico every week for the Tuesday through Thursday congressional
sessions. He long ago established himself in the United States,
where he says he fled to escape persecution -- maybe even death -- at
the hands of corrupt Mexican authorities during a crackdown on
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would lose focus of what I have wanted to do here for the 26
years I've been in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, he said, he hates flying.
</P>
<P>
   Medina gained fame as an activist during the movement that
culminated in a huge protest in Tlatelolco square on Oct. 2, 1968.
Police and soldiers opened fire on the students, killing at least
300 protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexican historians consider the shock of the massacre to be
a turning point in Mexican political life, discrediting the
government while sending a few young Mexicans into guerrilla
rebellion and many more into pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Medina was arrested and accused of attempting
to kidnap the dean of the National Autonomous University in Mexico
City -- a charge he denies.
</P>
<P>
   He was 28 years old and could have been imprisoned or even
killed if he stayed, he said. He fled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980 his relationship with his homeland began to thaw; the
Mexican government granted him an amnesty. He has returned there to
organize conferences on emigrants and to visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he gained the right to become a U.S. citizen, and
plans to file the papers soon.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, who is a lawyer and an international representative for
the AFL-CIO, says he would continue to bring his ideas for social
justice to the Mexican Congress if he wins the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues he said he would champion are fair wages for
Mexican workers and legal status for Mexican immigrants in the
United States -- a goal that has earned him the enmity of

<HEADLINE> NJ hospitals starting to feel pinch of growing nurse shortage  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey hospitals are feeling the pinch
of a growing shortage of nurses, especially in specialties such as
critical care, although a recent survey found most hospitals still
have adequate bedside staffing.
</P>
<P>
   However, to keep units properly staffed, many Garden State
hospitals have been forcing nurses to work mandatory overtime,
angering nurses. That, along with major hospital layoffs in the
late 1990s and practices such as floating nurses to unfamiliar
units, is driving many nurses out of the profession.
</P>
<P>
   But under first-in-the-nation legislation passed Thursday,
forced overtime will be prohibited in New Jersey hospitals and
nursing homes except in emergencies. On top of that, experts warn
an aging nursing work force and a sharp decline in new nursing
students, partly due to increased opportunities for women in
higher-paying, less-demanding fields, will leave about 20 percent
of nursing jobs unfilled in New Jersey by 2006 and across the
nation by 2020 - when most baby boomers will be senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're considering it almost a crisis shortage,'' said Carol
Chernack, spokeswoman for the New Jersey State Nurses Association,
which lobbied for the bill along with nursing unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned about patient care quality,'' she said Friday.
''In certain hospitals, on certain units, on certain shifts, it can
be quite unsafe'' for patients.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Hospital Association survey of members covering the
last half of 1999 found that - in the hospitals responding -
dayshift nurses in the typical medical-surgical unit were caring
for six patients each.
</P>
<P>
   For intensive care units, the ratio was two patients per nurse,
and in step-down units, where patients are still on monitors and
need frequent care, the ratio was four patients per nurse, said
Cathy Cardea, a registered nurse who directs quality initiatives at
the hospital association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cardea said, ''the majority of hospitals are having
trouble with a shortage,'' especially of critical care, emergency
room and operating room nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will get worse,'' she said, adding, ''If one
patient goes bad, then a one-to-six ratio may not be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   With 60 percent of New Jersey's 80 acute-care hospitals losing
money due to severe cuts in government and insurance company
reimbursements, hospitals don't have the money to expand nursing
staffs, Cardea said, although nursing executives at hospitals with
worse ratios are hoping to use the survey results as ammunition to
increase budgets for nursing staff.
</P>
<P>
   So along with filling staffing holes with RNs from nursing
employment agencies, hospitals resort to forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bad idea, Chernack said.
</P>
<P>
   ''An exhausted nurse working the 15th hour of a double shift
involuntarily is not who you want taking care of you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On evening and graveyard shifts, the shortage is generally
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go on the floor, you'll see two nurses assigned to 20
patients,'' said Bernie Gerard, a vice president at the Health
Professionals and Allied Employees union.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hospital association survey shows better staffing
levels than what he sees, and that is compounded by putting very
ill patients, who once would have spent days in intensive care, in
units with less staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard expects Gov. Christie Whitman to sign the bill barring
mandatory overtime, and it would take effect a year later, but a
Whitman spokesman said the governor is still reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hospital and state health department officials have
been meeting with nursing groups to seek solutions to the shortage,
partly under a collaboration funded by the Plainsboro-based Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation called ''Colleagues in Caring.'' Hospitals
are becoming more aggressive and innovative in their recruiting
strategies, offering signing bonuses as high as $3,000 and hiring
nurses overseas, but no clear solution is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''All states are experiencing some shortage, but it's not as
critical'' as in New Jersey, which competes with New York and
Philadelphia hospitals that often pay more, said Geri Dickson,
project director for Colleagues in Caring in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Dickson said, the average age of working RNs - as opposed
to the many RNs out of the 110,000 licensed in New Jersey who work
in other fields - is 43, a year older than the national average.
Worse yet, the average age of new nursing school graduates in New
Jersey is about 32, and the number of graduates has been dropping
about 12 percent per year, falling from a peak of 2,372 in 1994 to
1,899 in 1998. Meanwhile, half the faculty at New Jersey nursing
schools hits retirement age in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   While starting salaries in New Jersey are about $40,000 and the
average wage is $22.65 per hour, salaries don't rise much with
increased experience, further discouraging many nurses.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors threaten the quality of nursing staff in New
Jersey, which has eight of the 18 hospitals nationwide designated
by the American Nurses Association as ''magnet hospitals'' for the
skills and experience of their nursing staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have excellent nurses in New Jersey, and I want to
keep it that way,'' Chernack said.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Truck Bomb Explodes  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A truck bomb exploded Sunday in front of a
Russian military headquarters in the Chechen town of Urus-Martan,
in what Russian officials said was a suicide bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The driver tried to crash the truck into the headquarters, but
was stopped short. There were no Russian casualties, said Lt. Gen.
Ivan Babichev, a Russian military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers then scattered a group of rebels preparing to
continue the attack on the headquarters building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Babichev said the attack was a propaganda attempt by rebels ''to
create the illusion that there is widespread fighting,'' but he
said that the situation in Chechnya was under control.
</P>
<P>
   Ramzan Akhmadov, a Chechen guerrilla commander, said by
telephone that there were Russian dead, but he did not specify a
number.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides exaggerate the other's losses and understate their
own, and there was no way to immediately sort out the conflicting
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they have all but won the war to
re-establish control over the rebellious region, but rebels
continue to inflict casualties with mines and ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, a bomb exploded
Sunday in the attic of a bathhouse where residents and soldiers
were relaxing. Two servicemen and a local woman were wounded, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian policemen were killed late Saturday when their car
drove over a homemade land mine at the entrance to a shooting range
in the town of Shelkovskaya, 30 miles northeast of the capital
Grozny, Interior Ministry officials said. Responding to a report of
an explosion at the shooting range, police found the three officers
dead, apparently killed by shrapnel from a land mine made out of an
artillery shell.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen fired for two and a half hours on a military headquarters
in the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechny region, a lowland
area the Russians captured last year, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from elsewhere in Chechnya are living in a large camp
in the town, and a three-member team of human rights observers from
the Council of Europe is headquartered there.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary police stations in the city of Argun and the village
of Nadterechnaya were also fired on Saturday night, the officials
said. No Russian casualties were reported in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops on Sunday were carrying out what
officials called ''special operations'' in the towns of Valerik and
Urus-Martan, southwest of Grozny, ITAR-Tass reported. It said the
towns were sealed off, and that 15 people were arrested for taking
part in rebel operations.
</P>
<P>
   Troops combed the woods for rebels around Serzhen-Yurt and
Avtury, near the scene of fighting last week that left 13 Russian
soldiers dead, the news agency said. Russian forces also checked
hospitals for wounded rebels, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned after Chechnya-based Islamic militants raided several
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government blames
on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Ex-Communists Seek Gains  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- Election results trickled in Monday
from Mongolia's parliamentary elections the day before, with the
nation's resurgent ex-communists expecting to make strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials had made no announcements by Monday evening.
But the International Republican Institute, a U.S. group observing
the vote, confirmed that at least two candidates of the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party -- the former communists -- had won in
the capital, Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
   The party headquarters in the capital was lively early Monday,
and party officials were optimistic they would gain seats in the
76-member parliament. But they said firm results would not be
available until later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mongolians walked, rode horses and drove jeeps to the
polls to choose between the scandal-plagued reformist government
and the country's former leftist rulers. It was the first
parliamentary race since a democratic coalition won 50 seats in
parliament in 1996. The coalition has since broken up.
</P>
<P>
   The election took place as Mongolia struggles with a rapid
transformation from communism to free-market capitalism. While the
economy is growing strongly, the transition has thrown many into
poverty and unemployment in this central Asian nation wedged
between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was expected to be strong, but some of the voting did
not go smoothly. First-time voters in some districts complained
that confusion over changes in the national identification card
system had left them without proper documents to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people don't have these documents, especially herders,''
said R. Burmaa, a member of the General Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was only the third time Mongolia has gone to the
polls to choose a new parliament. A populist movement overthrew
hard-line communism in 1990. The former communists won the 1992
election before losing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the former communists looked set for another
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Boldbaatar, an unemployed 30-year-old voter in Gachuurt, a rural
town outside Ulan Bator, said the current government has made a lot
of mistakes, so he was throwing his support to the People's
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their platform gives me hope that they won't fail the people
of Mongolia,'' the son of herders said after voting at the village
schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The election comes amid serious political problems in Mongolia.
Over the past four years, three members of parliament have been
jailed in a corruption scandal, a popular Cabinet minister has been
murdered and the country has had four prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers, led by the Mongolian National Democratic Party,
pledge to keep up the pace of change. They have painted the former
communists as a reactionary force intent on turning back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The former communists have declared unequivocal support for both
democracy and free markets, but they say they would take a more
measured approach to privatization. They accuse the present
government of mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from Sunday's voting that Mongolian democracy is
still very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Shagdarsuren, a 90-year-old Buddhist monk dressed in a bright
yellow robe with purple cuffs, showed up to vote at a station in
Ulan Bator but couldn't read the ballot. Instead of asking for
help, he simply marked the third choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who it was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Activists Arrested at Home  </HEADLINE>
By VILMA PEREZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. marshals fanned out across
Puerto Rico on Sunday, arresting dozens of anti-Navy activists at
home for refusing to post bail on federal trespassing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Marshals had arrested more than 50 of 122 activists by Sunday
afternoon, protest organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were among 183 people originally detained last
week as they scrambled under fences or sneaked onto remote beaches
in an attempt to stop military exercises on the outlying Puerto
Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest renewed a 14-month-old dispute on Vieques, a
21-mile-long Puerto Rican island of 9,400 people that is also the
site of the U.S. Navy's prime Atlantic Fleet training ground.
Activists committed to ousting the Navy say bombing at the site
destroys fishing grounds and endangers residents. The Navy
maintains the bombing is safe and provides crucial training for
American sailors and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters arrested last week had been freed temporarily and
given until Friday to post $1,000 bail, but the group of 122
refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not recognize any moral authority nor the legitimacy of
the U.S. court in this matter,'' Sen. Manuel Rodriguez Orellana of
the Puerto Rican Independence Party said Sunday. The arrests
''unmask the repressive and intimidating character of the
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting marshals would not talk to reporters. Herman
Wirshing, chief of the U.S. Marshals Service in Puerto Rico, could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people have been detained since May 4, when marshals
removed protesters who had camped out on the Vieques bombing range
for a year to thwart exercises there.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 183 arrested last week were members of the Puerto
Rican Independence Party. The party planned a rally on Tuesday --
the Fourth of July -- in front of the federal prison in San Juan
where the arrested protesters are being held.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Navy's presence in Vieques boiled over in
April 1999 when a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped a bomb off target,
killing a civilian security guard in the bombing range. The latest
Navy exercises have used non-explosive bombs, but the protests have
continued.

<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Judges of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia will hear oral arguments in Wilmington on
Aug. 1 and 2 during the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was concern that if there are demonstrations, the judges
and attorneys might not be able to get through to the courthouse,''
Judge Jane R. Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The court hears appeals from federal cases in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1 and 2, a three-judge panel will hear oral arguments at
the U.S. District Courthouse in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Even if protests don't cause a problem, the 45,000 people
expected in Philadelphia for the convention mean lawyers who
commute to argue cases may not be able to get a hotel, said Jim
Yacucci, appeals court deputy executive.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens returned from the
disabled list to pitch seven impressive innings and David Justice
drove in two runs for his first RBIs in a New York uniform, giving
the Yankees a 5-2 win Sunday over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (5-6), sidelined nearly three weeks with a strained
right groin, gave up one run and three hits. He struck out five and
walked two.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 252nd of his career, moving Clemens ahead of
Bob Gibson into 38th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Randy Choate allowed an eighth-inning run and Mariano
Rivera got the last four outs for his 18th save. The Devil Rays
finished with four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius hit a two-run homer off Steve Trachsel (6-8).
Trachsel beat the Yankees 1-0 at Yankee Stadium on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, obtained Thursday from the Cleveland Indians for Ricky
Ledee and two players to be named, got his first hit as Yankee -- a
single that gave New York a 1-0 lead in the second. He grounded out
in the third, driving in another run to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the second straight for the two-time defending
World Series champions, who are 2-0 in July after going 15-20 in
June for their losing month since August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory was marred by a fight between catcher Jorge
Posada and Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith, however there was no carryover
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a RBI single off Clemens in the sixth. The Devil Rays
also scored in the eighth when Bubba Trammell tripled and scored on
Choate's error on Fred McGriff's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had not pitched since being removed after one inning of
an outing against the Boston Red Sox on June 13. The Yankees also
welcomed back Orlando Hernandez (sprained right elbow) to the
rotation on Saturday and return home from a season-long, 13-game
road trip with three victories in their last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who was 3-for-4, hit safely and scored at least
one run in every game on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius ended Trachsel's streak of 39 innings without allowing a
homer, and Clemens recorded his 3,400th career strikeout when he
fanned Steve Cox with runners at second and third with two outs in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, who before Sunday had allowed just one run in 22
innings against the Yankees, Blue Jays and Red Sox, yielded nine
hits, walked three and struck out two in five innings. Since
winning consecutive 1-0 decisions over Pedro Martinez at Fenway
Park and Hernandez at Yankee Stadium, the right-hander is 3-6 in 10
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gave up a leadoff single to Randy Winn in the first and
didn't allow another hit until Jose Guillen singled with one out in
the fifth. Neither of the runners the Devil Rays stranded in
scoring position in the third reached on a hit.
Notes: Yankees manager Joe Torre hopes Posada doesn't draw a
suspension for his involvement in Saturday's fight. ''I have a
great deal of respect for (baseball disciplinarian) Frank Robinson,
but I certainly would like to have him remember how many fights he
was in and not be suspended.'' Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild
said he didn't feel either player should be suspended ... Yankees
2B Chuck Knoblauch missed his second straight game because of a
left ear infection. He was replaced by Jose Vizcaino, who went
0-for-4 after going 2-for-3 with a double and triple and two runs
scored Saturday.

<HEADLINE> GOP platform committee chairman says no deal on abortion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The chairman of the committee that is drafting
the Republican Party's statement of principles said Sunday there is
no deal with anti-abortion conservatives to keep the party's strong
anti-abortion plank in exchange for softer language on other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish there was a deal. It would be much easier if we had a
deal, but there is no deal,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said on
ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that backers of GOP
presidential contender George W. Bush had cut a deal with
conservatives to preserve existing anti-abortion language in return
for a softer stance on such issues as education, women's health and
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The platform prescribes a constitutional ban on abortion, in
conflict with Bush's views. But the Texas governor has said he
would not seek changes in the plank despite his belief that
abortion should be allowed in cases of rape, incest and to save the
life of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights Republicans have been hoping at least for a
platform that recognizes their point of view, which they failed to
achieve in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush said the campaign was confident the
platform writers would draft a document the governor can be proud
of.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope and expect the platform will respect the governor's
beliefs,'' said Ari Fleischer, the spokesman. ''We have a very
inclusive, very united party and the governor's always been firm on
maintaining the abortion language.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, meanwhile, said she did not
expect to be chosen as Bush's running mate. Whitman supports
abortion rights, and conservative leaders have warned Bush to name
someone who opposes abortion - as they do - or face defeat in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that that's anywhere in the workings,'' Whitman
said on ABC. ''If he offered, I'd be crazy not to consider it very
seriously. But I'm not counting on anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> Jewish leaders, elected officials vow pressure on Iran  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Jewish leaders and local elected officials vowed
Sunday to push for sanctions against Iran following the conviction
of 10 Jews there on charges of spying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran must pay a price for this,'' said Rep. Eliot Engel,
D-N.Y., at a news conference outside the Iranian Mission to the
United Nations attended by 150 Jewish leaders, elected officials
and protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the United States lifted a ban on U.S.
imports of Iranian rugs, pistachio nuts and caviar. Although the
change had little economic impact on the Middle Easter nation -
which gets most of its revenue from oil exports - it was considered
a symbolic step toward a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are demanding that the U.S. now rescind the concessions
that were made,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of
Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Engel and two other Democratic congressmen from New York City,
Anthony Weiner and Major Owens, pledged to work to reinstate the
trade bans and withdraw other forms of import and agricultural
assistance to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by Abe Foxman, who heads the Anti-Defamation
League; city Comptroller Alan Hevesi; American Jewish Congress
Executive Director Phil Baum; Rabbi Shmuel Blum of Agudath Israel,
an Orthodox Jewish organization; and others.
</P>
<P>
   Also present was a man Hoenlein described as a close relative of
two of the convicted Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The man would not give his name, citing concern for his family,
but said: ''We hoped for fair trial. ... We are very sad and very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''They didn't do anything wrong. We ask the Iranian
government to release them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't sure if the international pressure would help.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's verdict drew condemnation from Israel, which denied
that the convicted men had been spies, and from President Clinton,
who said he was ''deeply disappointed'' that Iran appeared to have
treated the men unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Jews - whose professions range from shoe clerk to teacher
- were sentenced by an Iranian judge to prison terms of four to 13
years. The judge acted as both prosecutor and jury, and observers
were banned from the trial. State television also broadcast
confessions from two of the defendants after months in jail.
Critics dismissed the entire process as a sham.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing against these people, except the fact that
they were Jews living in Iran,'' Hoenlein said. ''These were the
rabbis and leaders of a community, guilty of nothing else but that
they organized classes to study Jewish tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein and other officials said they thought international
pressure may have already helped avert death penalty sentences for
the Jews, and could also have a positive impact on the appeals
process. Iranian President Mohammed Khatami has the power to grant
the 10 clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is viewed as a moderate trying to refashion his
country's image, but the trial of the Jews took place in courts
controlled by Khatami's conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''If in fact that moderation is real, and if President Khatami
is sincere about what he has said, this is the time he is being put
to the test,'' said Hoenlein. ''If he is serious, then he will take
the appropriate actions and grant them all clemency and free them
all immediately.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Germany-Zeppelins,0284  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE HOGL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, Germany (AP) - One hundred years after the
maiden flight of the first zeppelin over Germany's Lake Constance,
a granddaughter of the inventor carried on a family tradition by
christening a new airship Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the dirigible was filled with inflammable
helium instead of the dangerous hydrogen that doomed the first
generation designed by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   The new ship was named Friedrichshafen, after the southern
German city on the shores of the lake where zeppelins were born a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great honor now for me to be allowed to christen a
zeppelin,'' said Elisabeth Veil, following in the footsteps of her
mother, who christened an airship herself in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the ceremony was a survivor of the 1937 Hindenburg
disaster that basically ended the use of airships for carrying
passengers. Eugen Bentele, 91, said he was happy to see them flying
again, adding: ''I'd also get back in a zeppelin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hindenburg caught fire on landing at Lakehurst, N.J., after
crossing the Atlantic, and 35 of the 96 people on board were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The new zeppelins being built in Friedrichshafen are much
smaller than the Hindenburg and designed to carry tourists on short
jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   Zeppelin-Luftschifftechnik has invested $34 million over more
than a decade to develop the new ships, flying the first prototype
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they hope to have the necessary German
aviation permits for the first ship to begin carrying passengers
early next year.

<HEADLINE> Evacuation Upsets Conservationists  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DASSEN ISLAND, South Africa (AP) -- Conservationists on Sunday
dragged thousands of wriggling penguins from their burrows and
dumped them into cardboard boxes for evacuation in an effort to
rescue the endangered birds from an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their frantic efforts, it was clear that only a fraction
of the 55,000 African penguins that live on Dassen Island off the
South African coast could be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can move 10,000 birds off in three days, we've done as
much as we can do,'' said Tony Williams, a penguin expert from
Western Cape Nature Conservation. ''It's a no-win situation. We
have taken 2,000 oiled birds off the island already.''
</P>
<P>
   Fencing erected to prevent the penguins from reaching the
oil-polluted sea must be removed in three days to avoid starving
the birds remaining on the island, Williams said. The fences were
put up Friday, two days after the island's coast was hit by oil
leaked from a tanker that sunk June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Uncontaminated birds captured on Dassen Island were to be
shipped or flown to the mainland, trucked about eight hours up the
coast and released to fend for themselves. They are expected to
swim home within about 11 days. Authorities hope that will give
them enough time to clean up the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are to be monitored through a satellite tracking
device during their swim home.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation was going painfully slowly Sunday: Heavy swell
and a lack of suitable boats made it difficult to transport workers
from the mainland. There are also very few roads on the 540
acre-island, making it hard to reach the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The spill coincided with the birds' peak breeding season,
meaning most chicks and eggs will be lost. Rescue efforts
concentrated on the adult birds, which have a higher survival rate.
Distraught volunteers left young, weak birds in their burrows,
saying they were not expected to live longer than two days.
</P>
<P>
   The spill has set the African penguin population back by at
least five years, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The population has declined by 90 percent in the last century.
About 40 percent of the current population, estimated at between
150,000 and 180,000, is at risk from the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Minister Valli Moosa on Wednesday asked the army to
help rescue the birds, but so far, the defense forces have rendered
minimal assistance -- enraging conservation officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally think it's a national scandal. I think it's
probably unprecedented that an environmental catastrophe of this
size could have been occurring for a full week already without any
significant intervention of the defense forces,'' said Ian
Macdonald of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which is helping fund
the relocation.
</P>
<P>
   The defense force said its trucks are tied up monitoring a
conflict between taxi and bus operators in Cape Town and that its
helicopters need servicing.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the mainland, authorities said Sunday about 20,000
oil-coated birds had already been captured -- up from 11,000
Saturday. Many of those birds were taken off Robben Island, another
island off the South African coast which was hit by the oil a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitating the oil-coated birds will be a mammoth task -- it
takes two people about an hour to clean each bird. Once cleaned,
the birds need to be hand-fed for up to two months before their
coats again become waterproof so that they can swim in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to accept there is going to be quite a substantial
mortality rate among the oiled birds,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Missile Test Conditions Not Actual  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon concedes a crucial test for the
planned national missile defense system is being conducted Friday
under conditions far more favorable than an actual attack would
allow, Time magazine reports.
</P>
<P>
   Crews firing the intercepter from a Pacific atoll will have
thorough knowledge of the launch, origin and power of the target
missile, probably none of which would be available during a real
attack, the magazine says in its issue on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it quotes the Pentagon's chief weapons tester saying
all attempted intercepts until 2004 will have intercept crews fully
briefed on the ''timing, direction and countermeasures'' employed
by incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There are virtually no unknowns in the procedure, Time reports.
The crew launching the interceptor will even listen in on the
countdown of the warhead's rocket -- intelligence that almost
certainly wouldn't be available if a rogue state launched a
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coyle, the chief weapons tester, was quoted as saying
such advantages ''place significant limitations'' on the value of
the test. Coyle could not be reached for comment Sunday by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The current development schedule for the system, which will cost
at least $30 billion, would have tests advanced far enough by 2005
to put its first 20 interceptors in the field. This week's test
will be pivotal to President Clinton's decision, expected this
fall, whether to give a go-ahead for further development.
</P>
<P>
   Under congressional pressure, the administration proposed the
system to protect against attacks from one or several missiles from
smaller, newly armed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Time reported other ways in which the tests are weighted in
favor of success:
</P>
<P>
   --Meant to defend against ''tens'' of incoming warheads, all 19
scheduled tests will target only one.
</P>
<P>
   --Because of safety considerations, the dummy warhead of the
target will not travel as fast as would a hostile attack.
</P>
<P>
   --Friday's Minuteman II target will fly a familiar trajectory,
the same California to Kwajalein Atoll route used in the
interceptor's previous two tests.

<HEADLINE> House Would Mull Suspending Gas Tax  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate
votes to suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would
have to be found to pay for highway construction, the House
majority leader says.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Rep. Dick Armey said, suspending the tax would be a
temporary fix to a permanent problem of high gasoline prices. More
helpful would be to augment the natural gas delivery system, deal
more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on oil
imports, he said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's look at building natural gas lines so people in the
Northeast can be ... heating with good, clean, reliable inexpensive
natural gas,'' said Armey, R-Texas. ''Let's have a foreign policy
that allows us to get some respect out of the OPEC nations that we
deserve -- and we fought for, by the way. And then let's ... reduce
our domestic dependence on foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   On the gasoline tax, most of which is supposed to go into a
highway trust fund, Armey said a source of replacement money would
be an important consideration before the tax could be suspended.
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., who controls the flow of legislation in
the Senate as majority leader, has said he may have a vote on a
suspension suggested by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the House is willing to do that, but ... we want to do
it correctly,'' Armey said. ''And the first thing you have to
answer is, 'How do you replenish the highway construction funds?'
</P>
<P>
   ''And if we can work out that riddle, I think we'll be able to
do that. It will be a good thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Republicans in this presidential election year, Armey
largely blamed the Clinton administration for high gasoline prices.
Should Vice President Al Gore become president instead of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, he said, gas prices would climb inexorably
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is his policy for the environment, to eliminate the
internal combustion engine,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   In April's reissue of Gore's 1992 book ''Earth in the Balance,''
the vice president wrote a foreword in which he reaffirmed his idea
that such engines should be eliminated within 25 years. He said he
doesn't want to eliminate the car, just to develop a car that won't
harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' Wisconsin's Republican governor, Tommy
Thompson, was asked his view of what is causing the current price
levels, more than $2 a gallon in much of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ''First,'' Thompson said, ''I don't think the Clinton-Gore
administration has any idea what a good energy policy is. Second,
we're so dependent on OPEC nations for importing our oil.''
</P>
<P>
   He added into the mix new Environmental Protection Agency rules
for less-polluting fuel and the country's dwindling refining and
delivery infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've just heard from Governor Thompson (what) you've heard
from virtually all the Republicans across America, I guess
following the lead of Governor Bush,'' responded Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., whose state also has been hit by particularly
exorbitant prices. ''You never once heard him suggest the
possibility -- even the possibility -- that the oil companies might
have been gouging us. ... They don't want to put the blame where it
should lie, and that's with the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said the Federal Trade Commission is issuing subpoenas to
major oil companies in its investigation of their activities across
the country.

<HEADLINE> Solidarity Leader Launches Campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski
kicked off his presidential campaign Sunday by challenging the
popular incumbent about his communist past.
</P>
<P>
   ''When some were joining the communist party right when the
streets were soaked with blood of Polish workers, others were
getting ready to fight for free and independent Poland,''
Krzaklewski said in his hometown of Kolbuszowa, a southern city
where he came to inaugurate the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski, who replaced Lech Walesa as the Solidarity chairman
in 1991, is credited with reuniting Poland's center-right parties
under the Solidarity umbrella and leading them to victory in the
1997 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   This October, though, he faces an uphill struggle, against
Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who defeated Walesa in 1995
and still holds a commanding lead in opinion polls of about 70
percent. Andrzej Olechowski, an economist who has served in both
left- and right-wing governments, comes in a distant second with
about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski, 49, also promised Poles to fight to protect ''our
national interests at a time when we are making a decision about
our place in the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer specialist won the endorsement of Solidarity
Electoral Action, a disparate bloc grouping Christian, national and
liberal factions.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski will also be running against Walesa, the legendary
founder of Solidarity. Opinion polls show, though, that both
Solidarity leaders can count on less than 5 percent of votes.

<HEADLINE> State attorney general settles franchise fraud case for $1 million  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The state attorney general has obtained
judgments totaling more than $1 million against a family that
allegedly cheated investors in four states by peddling franchises
to sell inferior snacks and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In what he called the largest franchise fraud case ever brought
by his office, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he won a
settlement that keeps Michael J. Glass, his wife and two sons
permanently out of franchise sales.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the Glasses, operating through three companies,
collected up to $50,000 each from dozens of people who were told
they could earn as much as $780,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Glasses collected almost $1 million, Spitzer said, selling
to investors in New York City, on Long Island, in Westchester
County, as well as 19 counties in New Jersey, and in Ohio,
Connecticut and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All of the investors lost money and two declared bankruptcy
after Glass, 67, failed to develop the business as he had promised,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Glass provided only oily potato chips and a line of
flavored water - which stores dropped when the chip bags leaked oil
and the bottle labels peeled off to reveal different beverage
labels.
</P>
<P>
   Glass's two companies - Westcool Snacks and Beverages and
Maricopa Products - were dissolved for failure to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Iglesias, 36, of the Bronx, said he quit a $30,000-a-year
job with Yankee Stadium's ground crew in early 1995 to put
everything he had into one of Glass' franchise routes. Within a few
months he was unable to get products to sell, had no income and
lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the settlements, filed last week in Manhattan's
State Supreme Court, include a judgment for $936,525 from Glass and
his two companies. Spitzer's office, however, is still trying to
find Glass's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Glass' lawyer, Gerald McMahon, said the settlement is
''much ado about nothing. It's a paper victory. It's meaningless
because he (Glass) has no money. This was not a fraud. This was a
genuine business venture that went south and now he's in
bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also includes $35,000 collected from Glass's two
sons, Joshua, 32, of Ridgefield, Conn.; and Peter, 37, of
Patterson, N.J.; and from Peter Glass' company, Wacky Snacks and
Beverages. That company, too, is now out of business.
</P>
<P>
   A case involving Michael Glass' ex-wife, Adriane, was settled
for $100,000, a deal that McMahon called ''extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the amounts recovered so far will allow investors
to recoup about 10 percent of their investments.

<HEADLINE> Gas tax cut taking time to seep in  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   As drivers hit Connecticut's roads during the holiday
weekend,
lower prices at the pumps were not everywhere to be found despite a
7-cent reduction in the gasoline tax.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some motorists continued to pay top dollar, while station owners
and managers took advantage of a grace period to sell off
previously purchased supplies of gasoline, which still carry the
32-cent tax that was reduced to a quarter on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But relief is in sight. Prices are expected to drop in a few
days as current gasoline supplies are depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Stations that immediately passed the tax cut to their customers
were rewarded with a steady flow of customers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody has noticed,'' said Tammy Eye, manager of the Citgo
Food Bag on Route 110 in Shelton. ''We've been extremely busy.''
</P>
<P>
   The station was selling regular unleaded for $1.70 a gallon - 7
cents less than the day before, and as much as 15 cents cheaper
than some other stations within two miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at (the sign) and I said, 'Man, is that right?'''
said Bill Harris of Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7-cent cutback in the price of gas is not enough to make
much of a difference, some consumers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wont help at all,'' said George Maselli of East Haven. ''It
used to cost me $5 to mow the lawn. Now it costs me $10,'' he said.
''I don't pay attention to gas prices anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Tom McCabe, who was filling up at the Country
Cloverleaf Store at the Killingworth Circle, where regular gas at
the Texaco station remained at $1.88 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price goes up and down so much, 7 cents is nothing as far
as I'm concerned. Seventy would be a hell of a lot better,'' said
McCabe, who has to pay $50 to fill the 30-gallon tank in his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the state Department of Consumer Protection will
be monitoring pump prices for the next four months to make sure
stations are passing the tax cut to customers.
</P>
<P>
   If drivers suspect they're being fleeced at the filling station,
they can call make a toll-free phone call to the consumer
protection hotline at 1-800-842-2649.

<HEADLINE> Report: Wash. Monuments Vulnerable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High-profile Washington monuments like the
Lincoln Memorial and Vietnam Veterans Memorial are vulnerable to
terrorist attack, a study commissioned by the National Park Service
concluded as it called for a budget boost to upgrade security.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-page study cites several examples of how terrorists
could easily destroy national monuments and cause mayhem similar to
the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''As symbols of America's heritage, they are high-profile
landmarks, not well protected, popular, attract many visitors daily
and require open and easy accessibility,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as thousands prepare to celebrate the Fourth of
July holiday this week on the National Mall. A Park Police official
said visitors have no need to be concerned about the holiday
celebration when virtually every officer on the force will be on
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fourth of July is not a problem,'' Lt. John Kmetz said
Sunday. ''We encourage people to come down. We believe it's going
to be safe because it's a full force commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmetz said the concern lies with a hypothetical midweek
afternoon incident where one officer might be responsible for
covering several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to do what we can within our resources to address
them, however a long term approach is going to be necessary,''
Kmetz said of recommendations in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The document makes a director correlation between the
vulnerability of the monuments, including the newly refurbished
Washington Monument and Thomas Jefferson Memorial, and funding for
the U.S. Park Police, the law enforcement arm of the park service.
</P>
<P>
   It said an additional one-time expenditure of $3 million would
bring eight of the most popular monuments up to security standards.
</P>
<P>
   It also says many shortcomings involved a lack of manpower and
poor communication equipment assigned to Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   The study was first reported in Sunday editions of The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langston, head of Park Police, told the Post that while
protection of other government buildings in the city has increased,
that has not happened with the monuments and memorials guarded by
the Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   The Post pointed out that, while neither agency would comment on
Park Police readiness, both the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service
share responsibility for protecting against terrorist acts that
might be directed against any government installation.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Hoffman, a Washington-based counterterrorism expert
for Rand Corp., a nonprofit public policy institute, said it is a
given that government monuments are potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are by very definition national monuments, which means
they're there for the public,'' Hoffman told the Post. ''So no one
can look at them and say they're not vulnerable. Of course they're
vulnerable. But everything is vulnerable. It comes to a point where
you have to accept that we can't have a risk-free society.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers 2, Royals 0  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Hideo Nomo outdueled countryman Mac
Suzuki, pitching shutout ball into the eighth inning Sunday as the
Detroit Tigers stopped the Kansas City Royals 2-0 for a three-game
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo and Suzuki, who grew up in the same area of Western Japan
and are close friends, matched each other almost pitch-for-pitch on
the hot, humid afternoon until tiring in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki (3-3) gave up just four hits and equaled his career-high
with eight strikeouts. He walked Rich Becker leading off the eighth
and was relieved by Jerry Spradlin.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo (3-7) allowed only four base runners while winning for the
first time in seven starts. Johnny Damon singled leading off the
game and Mark Quinn hit a one-out triple in the second.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he allowed only one walk until Joe Randa singled
leading off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail then relieved Nomo, who struck out seven and walked
only one.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his league-leading 23rd save in
24 chances. Jones saved all three games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major league matchup of Japanese starters. The
first was when Suzuki faced Hideki Irabu of the Yankees last May 8
in a 10-1 Yankees victory.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia hit his fifth home run leading off the game. In the
sixth, Bobby Higginson tripled leading off and scored on a single
by Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Royals manager Tony Muser, who was unhappy with the umpires
earlier in the series, was ejected in the first inning after Damon
was called out on a close play at second. Muser ran onto the field
and had a long, animated argument with second base umpire Mike
Winters before Winters tossed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who had not swept a three-game series in Kansas City
since Sept. 21-23, 1998, loaded the bases with two outs in the
eighth. But Brocail struck out pinch-hitter Scott Pose.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, thought to be possible AL wild-card contenders three
weeks ago, have lost 14 of their last 19.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Polonia has led off a game with a home run 10 times in his
career. ... The Royals have given up at least one home run in 64 of
79 games. ... Carlos Beltran made a sparkling catch of Polonia's
sinking liner into right-center in the fifth. ... Mike Sweeney and
Ricky Bottalico were voted the Royals' pitcher and player of the
month for June. ... The Tigers are off to a 3-0 start in their
longest road trip of the year, a nine-game journey to Kansas City,
Tampa Bay and Milwaukee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett yelled at Boston
Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy in the clubhouse before Sunday's
game, upset about a story that appeared in the paper a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Carl say, 'Who said (Jeff) Frye and I were
fighting?''' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy wrote that Everett and Frye got into an ''animated
discussion'' in the eighth inning of Friday's game against Chicago,
and quoted Frye as saying, ''We weren't getting into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy had tried to talk to Everett after Friday's game,
and Everett was quoted in the story as saying, ''I have nothing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tommy Harper stepped in between the two and directed
Everett into the trainer's room, but Everett continued his
obsenity-filled verbal tirade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became, 'Get out of here, I'll never talk to you again and
don't ever talk to me again,''' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett also yelled at Glenn Wilburn, Boston's baseball
information coordinator, and told him to get Shaughnessy out of the
clubhouse. Shaughnessy left on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The loud exchange was clearly heard in the visiting manager's
office, where Boston's Jimy Williams was holding court with
reporters, and at the same time chapel was going on in a separate
room.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Cubs 2  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Charlie Hayes' two-run double capped a
three-run eighth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers rallied to beat
the Chicago Cubs 4-2 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' double off reliever Tim Worrell scored Jeromy Burnitz and
Geoff Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's much-maligned bullpen failed again and blew a strong
effort from Kerry Wood (3-6). Wood allowed six hits in 7 2-3
innings, but got into trouble in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and Milwaukee down 2-1, Ron Belliard walked and
took third on Jenkins' broken-bat single. Jenkins' bat landed 12
rows into the stands behind the Brewers' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay relieved Wood, but Burnitz hit Garibay's only
pitch into left for a single, scoring Belliard with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee closer Bob Wickman, who blew a two-run lead on Friday
night, got his 11th save in 13 chances by pitching the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez, who has spent most of the year mired in a
slump, broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning when he hit a hanging
curveball from Milwaukee starter Jimmy Haynes into the right-field
bleachers to lead off the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes (8-7) pitched well, holding Chicago to six hits over
eight innings. He left the game trailing 2-1, but Milwaukee's rally
gave him his first victory at home since May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Before the eighth inning, the game was the second straight
pitchers' duel between two teams whose rivalry is known for its
offensive fireworks and crazy occurrences. Jeff D'Amico threw eight
innings of two-hit ball on Saturday night in Milwaukee's 4-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Milwaukee and Chicago played the longest
nine-inning game in NL history, and on Friday night, the Cubs
posted a 7-4 win in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored Sunday's first run when Jose Nieves tripled in
the fourth inning, scoring Sammy Sosa from first base. The Cubs
could have got more when Brant Brown flied out to right, but
Burnitz, who missed making a running catch on Nieves' triple, got
Nieves at the plate with a spectacular 200-foot, no-bounce throw to
catcher Henry Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burnitz's seventh outfield assist of the year. In the
sixth inning, Jenkins also got his seventh assist by throwing out
Sosa at second base when he tried to stretch a long single into a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has been inconsistent in his comeback from elbow surgery
that kept him out for all of 1999, but he was in control against
Milwaukee until losing it in the eighth. He allowed just one hit --
a first-inning double by Jenkins -- before the sixth inning in a
game filled with outstanding defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Wood had retired 12 straight hitters before Belliard's one-out
double in the sixth. Luis Lopez doubled home Belliard to tie it at
1, but he was cut down at third on a sharp relay throw by Eric
Young.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight day, Milwaukee's largest crowd since
opening day (37,659) was in attendance. The Brewers' three-game
weekend series against their biggest rivals attracted over 100,000
fans to County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez, who had two homers in the Cubs' series with
Milwaukee, hadn't previously driven in a run since May 27. ...
Haynes walked four batters and Wickman walked one, boosting
Milwaukee's major league-leading walk total to 409. ... After a
disastrous early season, the Cubs' starting pitchers have allowed
just 13 earned runs in Chicago's last five games.

<HEADLINE> German Christens New Zeppelin  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE HOGL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, Germany (AP) -- One hundred years after the
maiden flight of the first zeppelin over Germany's Lake Constance,
a granddaughter of the inventor carried on a family tradition by
christening a new airship Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This time though, the dirigible was filled with non-flammable
helium, instead of the dangerous hydrogen that doomed the first
generation designed by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   The new ship was named Friedrichshafen, after the southern
German city on the shores of the lake where zeppelins were born a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great honor now for me to be allowed to christen a
zeppelin,'' said Elisabeth Veil, following in the footsteps of her
mother, who christened an airship herself in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the ceremony was a survivor of the 1937 Hindenburg
disaster that basically ended the use of airships for carrying
passengers. Eugen Bentele, 91, said he was happy to see them flying
again, adding: ''I'd also get back in a zeppelin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hindenburg caught fire on landing at Lakehurst, N.J., after
crossing the Atlantic, and 35 of the 96 people on board were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The new zeppelins being built in Friedrichshafen are much
smaller than the Hindenburg and designed to carry tourists on short
jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   Zeppelin-Luftschifftechnik has invested $34 million over more
than a decade to develop the new ships, flying the first prototype
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they hope to have the necessary German
aviation permits for the first ship to begin carrying passengers
early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Will Clark hit his third homer in three games,
a tiebreaking 434-foot, solo shot in the eighth inning that carried
the Baltimore Orioles past the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who had two homers all season before Friday, hit a 2-1
pitch from Paul Quantrill (0-3) over the wall in center. The last
time he homered in three straight starts was in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Trombley (4-2) got out of a jam in the Toronto eighth and
Alan Mills got three outs for his first save since joining the
Orioles on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi homered for the Blue Jays, who dropped the opening
two games of the series by a combined 20-8 score. Toronto had won
13 straight against Baltimore before coming to town Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays blew a chance to take the lead in the eighth. With
runners on first and third and one out, Buddy Groom retired Brad
Fullmer on a popup and Tony Batista looked at a third strike from
Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Kelvim Escobar, 5-0 lifetime against Baltimore,
allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. It was only the
second time in 17 starts he did not receive a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina gave up one earned run and five hits in seven
innings. His most costly mistake was a hanging slider to Mondesi,
the 19th homer he's allowed this season.
</P>
<P>
   After an error by Orioles second baseman Delino DeShields,
Mondesi hit a 428-foot shot to center to put Toronto up 2-0 in the
first inning. It was his 20th homer, the second in two games, and
third in five career at-bats against Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore got a run in the third when Jeff Conine doubled and
Brady Anderson ended a 6-for-52 skid with a two-out RBI single. The
Orioles put a runner in scoring position in the third and fourth
innings but failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had runners on second and third with one out in the
fifth before Mussina retired Craig Grebeck on a comebacker and
Mondesi on a popup.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle and B.J. Surhoff hit successive one-out doubles to
make it 2-2 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: For the first time, Toronto has three players with 20
homers by the All-Star break (Mondesi-20, Carlos Delgado-27,
Batista-22). ... Mussina has allowed only two earned runs in his
last 14 innings. ... Delgado ended an 0-for-12 streak with a
sixth-inning single.

<HEADLINE> Police, park investigate water ride accident  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) - Officials at Lake Compounce said Sunday
that lifeguards responded as quickly as possible when a 5-year-old
boy failed to surface after sliding down a water ride at the
amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Devon M. Alexander, of Hartford, was listed in critical
condition at Connecticut Children's Medical Center Sunday
afternoon, a hospital spokesman said. He had been underwater for
nearly 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred Saturday evening on the Lake Plunge, in
which riders take an inner tube down an enclosed slide that empties
into the park's lake, said park spokesman Richard Bisi.
</P>
<P>
   Bisi said the boy fell off his tube when it hit the water. When
he did not surface after the ride, the child's father called park
personnel, Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   A lifeguard who witnessed the incident jumped in the water and
called for more help, Bisi said. Within a minute, three other
lifeguards joined the search, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, 22 additional lifeguards began searching the
water, Bisi said. The park's emergency medical technicians arrived
within minutes and local and state police dive teams were
contacted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was recovered in about 25 minutes, more than 100 feet
from where he fell off his tube, Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very fair to say that the lifeguards and supervisors did
everything humanly possible to help and find this young boy,'' Bisi
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were four lifeguards and an attendant on duty when the boy
climbed onto the ride, Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no age restrictions for the ride, there is a
46-inch height requirement, Bisi said. In addition, a sign
cautions: ''Strong swimmers only. Deep water, strong current.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The sign is posted, and if a child meets the height
requirement, we can't second-guess their parent or guardian,'' Bisi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a police investigation, Lake Compounce requested an
independent review by an aquatic safety company. The ride will
remain closed until those investigations are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Compounce, designated in 1997 as the country's oldest
continuously operating amusement park, has been managed by
Kennywood Entertainment since 1996. The West Mifflin, Pa.-based
company runs three parks in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatal accident at Lake Compounce occurred in August,
when a 16-year-old ride attendant died after falling beneath a
moving ride. The park was cited by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in the death of Matthew Henne, of
Southington.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1981, 16-year-old Michele Johnson of Bristol died after
falling from a roller coaster as she stood and reached out the side
of the car.

<HEADLINE> Long Beach Island motorists decry slower speed limit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONG BEACH TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Residents and vacationers on
Long Beach Island say the popular resort seems longer now that
speed limits on the island's main highway were reduced by 5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The changes on Long Beach Boulevard have added time to
motorists' trips, and some residents question whether the slower
speed limits have made the road any safer.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Boulevard, which extends the length of the 18-mile
island in Ocean County, had speed limits of 35 mph and 40 mph. The
island consists of the towns of Long Beach Township, Barnegat
Light, Beach Haven, Ship Bottom, Surf City and Harvey Cedars.
</P>
<P>
   The lower speed limit took effect in May. Its chief proponent,
Long Beach Township Mayor James Mancini, said he was worried
commercial trucks would be speeding along the boulevard, a county
road. The change was approved by the county's Board of Freeholders,
of which Mancini is a member.
</P>
<P>
   But the slower speeds have made some motorists livid, especially
when they drive through parts of the island such as Loveladies,
where the road is four lanes and there are few businesses and
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is up in arms about it. Everybody's yelling about
it,'' Carolyn Rode, of High Bar Harbor section of Long Beach
Township told The Philadelphia Inquirer for Sunday's editions. ''I
don't think it's any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rode said she was ''seething'' after a trip from Manahawkin to
her home in the northern tip of the island, which required her to
drive through Loveladies.
</P>
<P>
   Another driver found that the slower speeds merely made short
trips, well, seem longer. Barbara Wahberg said an eight-mile drive
to Beach Haven from Harvey Cedars to pick up some furniture took 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have made it to Toms River on the (Garden State)
Parkway faster,'' she said. ''I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach Haven Mayor Deborah Whitcraft questioned the safety that
was to be gained by reducing the speed limits. Motorists upset with
Long Beach Boulevard speeds are likely to use the side roads that
parallel it. Those roads are often used by pedestrians to get to
the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing you want to do is increase traffic on the
backroads where there's so many kids going to the beach,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mancini said he was surprised by all the complaints and added he
believed there was support for the lower limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way they talk, you'd think it went from 100 miles an hour
down to 20,'' Mancini said at a recent meeting of the town's Board
of Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Some people do support the change, especially those who like to
ride bicycles or run along the boulevard. The road's shoulders are
narrow or nonexistent in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good idea,'' said Jennifer Emrichs, a mother of
two children. Emrichs, of Holland, Pa., said she was on vacation in
Loveladies. ''What's the hurry if you're on vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   A petition protesting the change has generated thousands of
signatures said Brian Geddes, who owns Barnegat Light Deli.
''There's so many we can't even count them. It looks like a phone
book full,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   Geddes said he teamed up with a neighboring bait shop whose
owner also has a T-shirt business.
</P>
<P>
   They have been selling T-shirts for $9 each that bear a circle
around the speed limit and a slash through it. ''The profits go
right back into more T-shirts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over the speed limit has had an effect. Mancini said
the county has decided that after Oct. 1, officials would agree
with whatever speed limit island's towns want.
</P>
<P>
   ''They police it. We don't police it,'' Mancini said.

<HEADLINE> A Goal and a Hug Help Hamm Rebound  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Mia Hamm's resume includes a world record
121 international goals, two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold
medal and a dynamite battle-of-the-sexes commercial with Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the player who could quit the game tomorrow with nothing
left to prove felt compelled to run to her coach on the sidelines
after scoring a goal in Saturday night's 4-1 Gold Cup semifinal
victory over Canada. Hamm hugged April Heinrichs and said, ''Thanks
for not giving up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible scene for someone of Hamm's stature, but
her inner emotions don't always match the outer grit she shows on
the field. Heinrichs could only respond with the obvious: ''I'll
never give up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mia is the sort of player that plays for the people
around her,'' Heinrichs said Sunday, a day off as the U.S. team
prepared for Monday night's championship game against Brazil. ''The
thing I'm learning about coaching her is she's not motivated by
winning. She's not intrinsically one of those people who's dying to
win every time she steps on the field. She wants to win, but what
motivates her is playing for her team and playing for her teammates
and helping them win.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hamm plays to please others. And, lately, she
felt she hadn't been doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's 18-yard drive off the hands of Canada goalkeeper Karina
LeBlanc was her first goal against a quality opponent since March
16. Her only scores since then had come in routs of against lesser
teams such as Trinidad and Tobago when nearly the whole lineup was
scoring. Hamm went scoreless in a recent four-game Olympic tuneup
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been struggling for a long time,'' Hamm said. ''I have
expectations to score. People have expectations for me to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Heinrichs was experimenting with younger players
almost every game. Hamm needed some positive reinforcement from the
new coach who earlier this year succeeded longtime player favorite
Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold in high regard what she thinks of us as players and as
people,'' Hamm said. ''Every meeting has been extremely positive,
and it's given me confidence to go out and play the way know I can
play. That (hug) was a kind of a token of appreciation to her and
the entire team for backing me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs was the leader and Hamm was the rising star of the
U.S. team that almost anonymously won the first World Cup in 1991.
The difference between then and now, said Heinrichs, is the
expectations. Last year's World Cup triumph attracted record
television ratings and was followed by a victory tour, a players'
strike over money, a coaching change, the announcement of a new
women's league and a quick turnaround to prepare for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we won in '91, I was on cloud nine for five or six years,
and these guys were only allowed to be on that cloud for five or
six months,'' Heinrichs said. ''Then they had to come out and start
battling again. I think, bless their hearts, they are back in it,
but one quick glimpse into what last summer was like and you wonder
how they continue to dig into that well of excitement and
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's been particularly hard on Mia, given the
pressure and the flag that she carries for this team, and the
criticism that the media had at times for her. She's fighting back.
She's starting to get her groove, and in the Gold Cup we've really
seen her come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Julie Foudy agrees, saying it's been tough dealing with
the ''lot of people tugging us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was wonderful what we did last year,'' Foudy said, ''but
the rest of the world doesn't care. And if we're going to go after
another Olympic gold medal, we need to switch gears.''
</P>
<P>
   A major step toward the gold would be a victory in the Gold Cup
title game over the Brazilians, who upset China 3-2 in Saturday's
semifinals at Louisville, Ky. The United States and Brazil tied 0-0
in group play last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, we wanted another go at them,'' Foudy said. ''I think
any time you walk away from a game like that, that's mentally,
physically exhausting, you want another chance. A 0-0 tie for us is
really a loss, so we're really looking forward to another
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada and China will play in the third-place game.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Township may thin deer herd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRINCETON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Township officials are polishing
details of a plan that would allow hunters to kill deer at night
after Gov. Whitman signed a law suggesting state hunting rules may
be eased in areas where large herds of the animals are found.
</P>
<P>
   But animal rights activists say state lawmakers didn't have the
right to modify those rules in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows communities, airport owners and county
agriculture boards to waive some hunting rules in zones that are
overpopulated with deer.
</P>
<P>
   It changes previous rules that only allowed the state to break
its own rules, such as allowing special hunts by changing the
length of the hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   With the new law, state Department of Fish and Wildlife
officials can give permission to waive certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   Township officials said they're invoking that law and want to
launch a controlled hunt they had proposed two years ago. Under
that plan, sharpshooters would set out bait in secluded woods to
attract and shoot deer. The hunts probably would be conducted on
township property or on private farms where the owners give
permission, township officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The township began negotiating with a Connecticut company about
a year and a half ago to use trained sharpshooters in the nighttime
hunts. But state Division of Fish and Wildlife officials said using
silencers and rifles at night would violate state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan would be to roundup and ship deer to a farm in
upstate New York, said township Deputy Mayor Steven Frakt. Frakt
said the township would be following the example of Millburn
Township in Essex County.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Frakt said he hopes the township will have a
program in place in time for the next winter season.
</P>
<P>
   But animal-rights activists have said they want to find a way to
shoot down the law.
</P>
<P>
   A group of animal-rights organizations last year filed a lawsuit
over the proposed special hunts. The Mercer County Deer Alliance
has said it would consider amending the lawsuit in an attempt to
invalidate the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature doesn't have the right to control something as
broad as how hunting and wildlife laws are applied in New Jersey,
said Nielsen Lewis, lawyer to the group that filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been our public position that this new law is legally
indefensible,'' Lewis told The Times of Trenton for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists have said township officials should
consider alternate ways of controlling the deer herds, such as
installing roadside reflectors to keep deer away from roads.

<HEADLINE> Vote Could Alter Mexico's Course  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- From the sprawling capital to the simplest
villages and at booths along the U.S. border, Mexicans poured into
voting stations Sunday to choose whether to continue 71 years of
single-party rule or propel a maverick businessman into the
country's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election was the first in more than a century in which
the outcome wasn't clear before the vote. Despite hundreds of
allegations of pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the
ruling party -- the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that we make history today,'' said Rebeca Meza
Oliva, a 45-year-old housewife waiting in line to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Meza said she planned to vote for opposition candidate Vicente
Fox of the conservative National Action Party, who is in a tight
race with Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated voters clashed with election workers in Mexico City
when some booths for people casting ballots outside their home
districts ran out of absentee ballots shortly after noon -- with
hundreds still in line.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines formed at regular voting booths too, evidence of a
heavy turnout. Many said that more than ever before they felt their
vote could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Meza said she had voted for the PRI her entire life -- often
after pressure at her children's school, at her job and from
neighborhood leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This year she ignored the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm against the PRI now. I've seen so many things -- not any
more,'' she said in the poor Guerrero neighborhood. ''I want a
change with all my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida led by a hair in most final polls released a week
before the elections. He was counting on the powerful party
machinery and the almost unconditional support of millions of
Mexicans who associate the party with the government, and often
with the nation itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always liked it,'' said Lisa Cioron Fernandez, a
53-year-old merchant, about the PRI, the party she said she would
vote for. Asked whether she thought the PRI could lose, she gave a
disparaging ''Nah!''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the party that will always be here, fighting for Mexico
and for its ideals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   He promised more aid for the countryside, more resources for
public education and more attention to the poor. Labastida, a
former governor of Sinaloa state, was the top Cabinet secretary in
President Ernesto Zedillo's government before the campaign and said
he would continue many of Zedillo's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato state in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   Running a distant third in the polls was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a
veteran leftist leader running his third presidential campaign.
Many Mexicans believe he won the 1988 elections, only to be cheated
out of a victory by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates were on the ballot, although one told his
supporters in the weeks before the election to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox voted in his native Guanajuato state, serenaded by mariachis
and trailed by a crush of reporters. Labastida and Cardenas voted
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards and
opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While most voting seemed trouble-free on Sunday, the PRI's
official poll watchers outnumbered those of all other parties at
many voting places visited by reporters, who saw a few voters
illegally being helped in marking their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox campaign on Saturday released a 200-page list of
complaints that Fox spokeswoman Marta Sahagun said demonstrated
that the elections ''are already tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all voters were bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Cirilo Mejia, a 66-year-old lottery ticket salesman, said the
PRI gift-giving had been more widespread than ever this year -- and
that suited him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave me lots of presents: pens, caps, even a blanket. I'm
going to vote for the one they recommended -- Labastida,'' he said,
adding that ''they'' were government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why fool ourselves? The one they recommended will win.''

<HEADLINE> Bishop Says Church Should Help Gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A French bishop who was yanked from his diocese by
Pope John Paul II five years ago for challenging the Catholic
church's stand on homosexuality and priestly celibacy criticized
the Vatican on Sunday for opposing this week's Gay Pride events in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gay Pride organizers announced that the
bishop, Jacques Gaillot, would honor Vatican wishes and not
participate in a forum scheduled for Monday on religion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said he was not
aware of a request to Gaillot not to participate in the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Gaillot confirmed that he had turned down the invitation to the
forum. But he expressed disappointment over the Vatican's protests
to the city of Rome to try to have the Gay Pride events canceled
because they come in the middle of Holy Year, which is drawing
millions of pilgrims to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church must be where there is need, and homosexuals have
suffered innumerable discriminations,'' Gaillot said at a news
conference. ''If the church doesn't free people from oppression,
what purpose does it serve?''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Pride week began on Saturday and runs through July 8, when a
march is scheduled through Rome.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hundreds of supporters of the extreme right held a
counter-march in the city, displaying slogans like: ''Gays at the
Colosseum? With lions inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The church is my home and my family,'' Gaillot said, ''but I
can't help but be critical because no one must be left out,
including homosexuals. The Holy Year is the right occasion to hold
dialogue and not to divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church condemns homosexual acts but not
homosexuality itself.
</P>
<P>
   At another news conference which included Amnesty International
officials, a member of the European Parliament said that the
Vatican missed an opportunity to promote tolerance by objecting to
Gay Pride week in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, contended Lousewies van der Laan, a Europarliament
deputy from the Netherlands, ''the Catholic church is providing a
moral justification for people to promote hatred and social
exclusion.''

<HEADLINE> Study Delves Into Mental Health  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About a third of Americans say they once felt
on the verge of a nervous breakdown or had a mental health problem,
according to a study released Sunday that examines perceptions of
psychological health over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a real change in both Americans' attitudes toward
acknowledging mental health problems and in their willingness to
talk to people about it,'' said Ralph Swindle Jr., lead author of
the study, which appears in the July issue of American
Psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, more than 26 percent of adults surveyed said they had
felt an impending nervous breakdown, up from 19 percent in 1957, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, another 7 percent said they had experienced a
mental health problem, a question not asked in the earlier survey.
Most of those questioned related mental illness to more serious
psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The increase between the surveys could be caused by a
combination of more people experiencing psychological problems and
a lessening of the stigma associated with admitting to a nervous
breakdown, said Swindle of Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the 1996 study saw a nervous breakdown as
related to stress, depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the general population uses the term 'nervous
breakdown' is a mental collapse,'' said co-author Bernice
Pescosolido, also at Indiana University. ''They were talking about
getting to a point in their lives where they couldn't carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to say they had anticipated a nervous
breakdown were young, white single mothers with low incomes and no
involvement with organized religion, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   As the percentage of Americans reporting a feeling of impending
breakdown has increased over the last four decades, the cause of
those feelings and the way they're dealt with has also changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1957 survey, most people said health problems had caused
them to feel close to a breakdown. But in 1996, the most frequently
cited causes were relationship problems, including divorce,
separation and other marital strains.
</P>
<P>
   While 44 percent of people experiencing these feelings in 1957
sought medical help, only 18 percent did so in 1996. People instead
turned to non-medical health professionals like psychologists,
social workers and counselors -- about 18 percent saw them in 1996
compared to less than 1 percent in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of people seeking help from friends and family
has also increased, quadrupling to 28 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health issues have received more attention in the last
year because of Tipper Gore, who has spoken openly about her bout
with depression. Mrs. Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, the
likely Democratic presidential candidate, has said she was treated
for clinical depression after a 1989 car accident nearly killed
their son Albert, then 6. She also said the family sought
counseling after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have found an estimated 50 million Americans
suffer some form of mental illness during their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The nervous breakdown survey questioned 1,444 American adults
from March to May 1996 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Ford Wants To Keep Coaching at UNC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH (AP) -- North Carolina assistant Phil Ford, whose future
with the Tar Heels is unclear after head coach Bill Guthridge
retired, would like to stay at UNC but knows it's out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The former All-American and career scoring leader at UNC has
been an assistant coach at the school since 1988, first to Dean
Smith and then to Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody would want to (stay),'' Ford said Saturday
while attending the Pepsi 400 race at Daytona International
Speedway in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's not something that's in my control. I'll just have
to see what happens, like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge retired Friday after three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was vacationing in Florida on Thursday when Guthridge told
him by telephone that he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see it coming,'' Ford said. ''You'd have to talk to
him about it, but, boy, he had a fantastic career. If anybody
deserves to retire, it's Coach Guthridge. He's given a lot to our
basketball team and to the University of North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been mentioned in recent years as one of several
coaches that could become Guthridge's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ford pleaded guilty in November to a drunken driving charge in
Durham following his second arrest for drinking and driving since
1997. He completed a 28-day alcohol-abuse recovery program.

<HEADLINE> Moodie Wins First LPGA Title  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. (AP) -- Janice Moodie of Scotland made five short
par-saving putts on the back nine to preserve her first
professional victory as she won the ShopRite LPGA Classic by two
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie shot a 2-under-par 69 Sunday and finished the 54-hole
tournament with a 10-under 203 total on the Bay Course at the
Seaview Marriott Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hurst, who started the final round seven strokes behind
Moodie, shot an early 64 and that was good enough to give her a tie
for second with rookie Grace Park of South Korea at 205. Park shot
a 67.

into contention by making birdies on five of the final seven holes
on Saturday, never challenged after an early birdie on Sunday gave
her a share of the lead. The 41-year-old Hall of Famer shot a
1-under 70 and finished tied for fourth at 206 with Vickie Odegard
and Michelle Estill.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie, who earned $165,000, never trailed in the tournament in
joining Kathryn Marshall (1995 in Toledo) as only the second Scot
to win on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie shared the first-round lead, led by two shots after the
second round and never gave up the lead despite being tied twice on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A short birdie by Inkster at No. 1 and a bogey by Moodie after
hitting into a greenside bunker at No. 2 put them in tie for the
lead with Maggie Will and Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie grabbed it right back with a tap-in birdie at No. 3, a
par-5, and a 6-footer at No. 4. Another shot in the bunker, this
time at No. 6, dropped her back into a tie with Hurst, who won
earlier this year in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie took the lead for good with birdies in the 4-foot range
at Nos. 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   That put her up by two shots, and Moodie never lost that margin
although her putter and short game were responsible for that. She
made a 4-foot par saver at No. 10 and 6-footer at the next hole
after blowing a birdie attempt past a tough pin placement.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie also made par savers in the 3- to 5-foot range at Nos.
13, 15 and 16. Each time she made a putt, she pumped her fist in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie is the third straight foreign player to win this event,
which this year is being held over the July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam of Sweden won two years ago, and Se Ri Pak of
South Korea won last year. Sorenstam did not play this year, while
Pak missed the cut.

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Cardinals 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Richard Hidalgo hit two home runs and Scott
Elarton pitched six strong innings for his third straight win as
the Houston Astros beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell connected for a three-run homer in the fifth inning
and Hidalgo had solo shots in the second and fourth -- all off
Darryl Kile (11-5) -- as the Astros avoided a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's five-game homer streak at Busch Stadium ended. He
went 1-for-4, with an RBI single in the sixth inning, and struck
out twice. J.D. Drew homered, tripled and scored twice for the
Cardinals, who came from behind to win the first two games but
stranded five runners in the fifth and sixth innings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Hidalgo, who led off the fourth with a 456-foot
upper-deck shot, each has three homers the last two games. Lance
Berkman homered in the eighth off Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, the three-time defending NL Central champions, won
for just the third time in 13 games -- all the victories coming with
Elarton on the mound -- and hit the season's halfway point with a
28-53 record. They were 47-34 at this point last year.
</P>
<P>
   At 48-33, the NL Central-leading Cardinals are nine victories
ahead of last year's pace. They have won 15 of their last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (7-3) gave up two runs on six hits with seven
strikeouts. In his last three starts, he's allowed four earned runs
in 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes worked the ninth inning for his second save after an
18-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kile has given up a staff-high 21 homers, one more than Andy
Benes. He had 10 strikeouts in seven innings, allowing five runs on
seven hits with one walk.
</P>
<P>
   Drew hit his 13th home run in the first, and tripled and scored
on McGwire's hit in the sixth. Drew is 15-for-37 during a
career-best 10-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford added an RBI double in the eighth off Jose
Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thirty-two of the 56 earned runs Kile has given up have come
in his five losses. His ERA in the other 13 games is 2.58. ...
Second baseman Craig Paquette booted a grounder in the sixth for
the Cardinals' seventh error in three games. They entered the
weekend with the fewest errors in the NL. ... Hidalgo is 9-for-23
against St. Louis this season, with four homers and nine RBIs.
Bagwell is hitting .400, with four homers and 11 RBIs against the
Cardinals. ... Hidalgo's other multihomer game in the majors came
Aug. 30, 1998, against Pittsburgh in the Astrodome. ... The loss
was only the second in 11 games for the Cardinals at Busch.

<HEADLINE> O's Johnson Copes With Trade Rumors  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Given a choice, Charles Johnson would love to
finish his career in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy playing here. I've enjoyed it from Day One,'' Johnson
said Sunday. ''I enjoy the baseball part. I enjoy the fans, they've
always treated me well since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fate rests in the hands of Orioles owner Peter Angelos
and the rest of the team's decision-makers, none of whom appear
eager to discuss a new contract with the 28-year-old catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose contract expires after this season, is one of
several Orioles rumored to be traded before the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been hearing different things, just like everybody
else,'' he said. ''It's not a distraction at all. It's just part of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson should know. He went from the Florida Marlins to the Los
Angeles Dodgers in May 1998 trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''After my first trade, I've kind of gotten over all the trade
talk,'' he said. ''Being traded here and there, this and that.
Because I'm starting to grow up. I've learned it's part of the game
and you can't do anything bout it. A lot of times there are rumors
and you don't find out until the last minute anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no use worrying about it. I'm just trying not to let
it affect my game. I just want to go out and play the game I
love.''

<HEADLINE> Irwin Wins Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Hale Irwin overcame a two-stroke deficit
with a 6-under-par 65 to win his second U.S. Senior Open in three
years. He finished with a 17-under 267 Sunday, the lowest total in
tournament history, surpassing Gary Player's 270 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher, who had led after the first three rounds, shot a
70 and finished at 270. He was seeking his 11th senior victory in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Statements are made and statements are forgotten,'' Irwin said
when asked if he was trying to prove that he was the best player
among the seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the better player this week,'' Fleisher said with a
smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Saucon Valley Country Club was worth $400,000 for
Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third victory of the season and 28th as a senior for
Irwin, a three-time U.S. Open champion. He moved within one victory
of Lee Trevino for most wins on the Senior PGA Tour and now has 56
career victories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I wanted to do early,'' said Irwin, who birdied
three straight on the front nine for a four-stroke turnaround. ''I
let Bruce know I'm there, and put pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin shot a third-round best 65 to get within two strokes of
the lead. He wiped out the two-stroke deficit on No. 1, took a
one-stroke lead on No. 4 and made it two strokes on No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher got in trouble on No. 1 when he sliced a drive into the
right fairway bunker. He missed a 6-foot par putt, and bogeyed the
hole to share the lead as Irwin birdied with a 5-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hale was really on,'' Fleisher said. ''I didn't get off to a
good start and he got the momentum. I blipped the first hole. I
gambled and lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said he was surprised with Fleisher's approach on No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really couldn't believe he played it,'' Irwin said. ''My
camp was encouraging it, saying 'Go for it. Go for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite shot a 69 to finish third with a 12-under 272. Raymond
Floyd's 67 put him fourth at 274. Hubert Green was next at 276 and
was followed by Dave Stockton and Jim Thorpe at 277.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hale's a good player and tough to beat,'' Kite said. ''It
would've been interesting to see if one of us could've put some
pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin took the lead for good when he made a 4-foot putt for
birdie on No. 4 while Fleisher pushed a 4-footer for birdie to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   A nice approach on the 5th set up a 3-foot birdie for Irwin as
he took a two-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The momentum created yesterday carried to today,'' Irwin said.
''What I wanted to accomplish, I got done with a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, showing signs of frustration for the first time all
week, disgustedly pointed to the green when he barely missed a
birdie putt on No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted his spirits with a nice approach on No. 6 that nearly
kissed Irwin's ball as both players made nearly identical 3-foot
putts.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher cut the deficit to one stroke with a birdie on No. 8,
but Irwin regained a two-stroke lead with a birdie on No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never put the ball in position where I can be aggressive,''
Fleisher said. ''I wasn't really focused and that happens from time
to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin barely missed birdies on Nos. 9 and 13 before getting one
on 17. He flipped his putter in the air and bent over in anguish
after his putt rimmed out on 9, but never faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really on my swing. I went with instincts,'' Irwin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher parred the 10th hole after a nice shot from the bunker,
but missed a birdie for a share of the lead on No. 11. He didn't
challenge the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt if I could put pressure on him, I could beat him,''
Fleisher said. ''It went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   A journeyman who won just once in 27 years on the regular tour,
Fleisher was seeking to become the third golfer to win the U.S.
Senior Open and U.S. Amateur titles. Fleisher, who won the U.S.
Amateur in 1968, would have joined Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus
in that elite group.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing comparable to experience,'' Irwin said. ''For
Bruce, each time out, it's more experience. You can't measure
experience. I think Bruce learned a lot today.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Sosa Wants Contract Extension  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- With trade rumors still swirling and his
agents' talks with the Chicago Cubs apparently going nowhere, it
appears Sammy Sosa just wants someone to want him.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa took a little extra time stripping off his uniform in the
cramped visitors' clubhouse at County Stadium on Sunday, and his
famous smile was nowhere to be seen. He didn't speak to reporters
after the Cubs blew a one-run lead in the eighth inning of their
4-2 loss to the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of trade rumors and a slump at the plate are taking
their toll on Sosa. On Saturday, he said if the Cubs fail to offer
him a contract extension, it's a sign they don't want him around
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't show me a contract, it's telling me I'm not
going to be here,'' Sosa said. ''It's as simple as that. It hurts
my feelings because I think I deserve a little bit more than that.
But this is business, and I understand that. I just got to sit
back, relax and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   A trade between the Cubs and New York Yankees involving Sosa
fell apart last week when the Yankees decided the prospects they
would be forced to sacrifice were worth more than Chicago's
slugger. New York then swung a deal for Cleveland outfielder David
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sosa said, it's time for the Cubs to come to him. Though
the near-deal with the Yankees last week had him talking about his
time in Chicago in the past tense, he said he has never given up on
the idea of staying with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My people were looking for (an offer). We haven't had an
answer yet,'' he said. ''They know that they can talk to me. They
know I'm here. It's up to them to come talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is under contract through 2001 at about $11 million per
season. Most think he is seeking a four-year extension, worth at
least $17 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs could still trade him before the July 31 deadline, but
Sosa said he is not willing to accept a trade without a contract
extension from the new team. There are only a handful of teams with
the financial wherewithal to pay Sosa the money he likely seeks,
and most of those teams aren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to come into next year thinking about it,'' Sosa
said. ''Wherever I am next year, I want to come and not go through
all the (garbage) -- that I got to do more because I'm going into
free agency. Take care of me now, let me play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's interest in Sosa reportedly has waned because of a
variety of factors, including manager Buck Showalter's premium on
an orderly, distraction-free clubhouse. Other franchises mentioned
for Sosa have been Cleveland, Toronto and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he and manager Don Baylor have put their differences
behind them. The two hugged and exchanged small talk on Friday
before the Cubs' series in Milwaukee started, and Baylor spoke
highly of Sosa's focus through the distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd like to win and have a person like me that will go out
and play every day and take care of business,'' Sosa said. ''I
don't think the whole situation is Don and I, because we never have
problems. It was a misunderstanding, but now it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how things are going to go, but right now he's on
this ballclub and he wants to win,'' Baylor said earlier this
weekend. ''I think now it's time to finally put this aside. He's
struggling, we're all struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would imagine it would probably resurface,'' he said of the
trade rumors. ''I don't think we've heard the last of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His problem, Sosa said, is with Baylor's bosses. Chicago
traditionally has been a stingy organization, with Greg Maddux
leading the list of players in recent years who have left for
greener pastures and greener wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, if it's not going to work for me or for
them, if they feel like they are not willing to build the team
around me, then they come to the situation they got to get rid of
somebody,'' he said. ''I would love for them to tell me if they are
going to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Plays Through Pain  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- A disappointing week for Jack Nicklaus
almost ended in a withdrawal from the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicklaus wouldn't let his injured ribs force him out of
action Sunday at Saucon Valley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to play, but if I couldn't play, I wouldn't,'' he
said after shooting a 1-under-par 70 to finish at 1-under 285. ''I
didn't want to be stupid. When I went out to warm up, if I could
swing and bump it around without hurting myself, that's what I was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said he's only dropped out of three tournaments in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to be hurting pretty bad when I dropped out on those
three occasions,'' Nicklaus said. ''I hurt a little bit, but I was
able to swing the club.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans appreciated Nicklaus' effort. He received a loud
ovation when he arrived at each hole. He tipped his hat and waved
to the crowd after receiving his loudest ovation at the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said he will take a week off to get treatment, and
hopes to be able to play in the Ford Seniors Players championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not (better), we'll have to wait for the British
(Open),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus shot a 67 in the first round, but struggled the rest of
the way. A victory would have given him an automatic berth in the
U.S. Open again -- perhaps his final chance of getting back to that
major.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played well in the first round and made a couple of putts
and it looked like I was going to have a good week,'' he said. ''My
putter left me for the week, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOO LITTLE TOO LATE: Dave Eichelberger, the defending Senior
Open champion, shot his best round with a 4-under-par 67, 10
strokes better than his third-round score.
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberger, however, finished in a tie for 34th place with a
4-over-par 288.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way I felt I should have been playing all week,''
he said. ''I don't know why or whatever. Yesterday I felt terrible.
Today I felt great. I don't know. Same person, same swing. No
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberger won the 1999 championship over Ed Dougherty after
gaining a three-stroke turnaround on the 14th hole. Dougherty shot
a 70 Sunday, and again finished behind Eichelberger at 289.
</P>
<P>
   ''I putted like a wizard, drove it in the fairway, doing
everything good,'' Eichelberger said. ''I am excited about the rest
of the year to see how it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CHANCE OF A LIFETIME: Terry Laurent, the director at Saucon
Valley Country Club, got a chance to play in his first Senior Open
when he served as marker with Bill Tindall in Group 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unbelievable. It was a dream come true,'' Laurent, 46, said.
''It sunk in about the 16th hole when I started having problems. It
was all a dream before that. It's been quite an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent's 22-year-old son, Patrick, got to share the experience
by serving as a caddie for his dad.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TOUGHMAN AWARD: Jim Albus has had enough injuries over the
last five years to fill a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Albus, 60, had neck surgery in 1996, followed in 1997 by a freak
broken leg on the golf course when he stuck his leg out of a cart
and accidentally hit a tree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Albus had knee surgery, and five months ago he had a
hip replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's either (golf) or just go to the rocking chair,'' he said.
''And I'm not going to do that. I've been playing with an excuse
for the last four years. Now I don't have an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Albus shot a 78 to finish at 8-over-par 292.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ATTENDANCE: Sunday's crowd was 32,000 to bring the week's
total to 148,500, including practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At Des Moines Golf and Country Club last year, attendance was
252,800.
</P>
<P>
   ''The popularity of golf is growing,'' said Bruce Fleisher, who
finished second, three strokes behind champion Hale Irwin.
''Getting near 150,000 is always a good number.''

<HEADLINE> Begay Wins 2nd Straight PGA Event  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) -- If Tiger Woods isn't careful, they might
start referring to him as Notah Begay's college teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up right where Woods left off in the U.S. Open, Begay
won the Greater Hartford Open on Sunday for his second consecutive
victory on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Begay holed a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a
one-stroke victory over Mark Calcavecchia in the Greater Hartford
Open, making the American Indian the first player to win
consecutive tournaments since Woods won the final two events last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beyond words for me. I'm real happy with my game. And
after all the personal problems I've had, it's a pleasure to be
playing golf again,'' said Begay, who won the St. Jude Classic last
week in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in January for drunken driving and jailed for a week,
Begay missed five cuts in 10 tournaments after that. Overcoming his
personal problems and the death of a close friend this week added
to his resolve to win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He closed with a 7-under-par 64 to break the tournament record
with a 20-under 260 total on the TPC at River Highlands. Brent
Geiberger set the previous record of 262 last year.
</P>
<P>
   After holing the winning putt, Begay ran off the green, his arms
in the air when the putt dropped, mouthing the words ''this one's
for you Ronnie,'' referring to his best friend's father, Ron Marks,
who died Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, who lost his opening three-stroke lead early then
tied Begay with a late eagle, just closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think he was going to make it,'' said Calcavecchia,
who moments earlier missed his birdie attempt by inches. ''I
thought he was aiming too far to the right, but he had the ultimate
speed on it. I just kind of closed my eyes ... second again.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with his victory last week, Begay has picked up more
than $1 million in earnings to nudge him near the top 10. The GHO,
sponsored by Canon, paid Begay $504,000 for the win. It was his
fourth victory in two years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Begay made short work of Calcavecchia's three-stroke lead. He
birdied Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 7, rolling in putts of between 10 and 25
feet. He putts either left-handed or right-handed depending upon
the break. The tournament winner came from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky to be the one closest to the hole,'' Begay said.
''He couldn't really go for it, and it just gave me a green light
to get a good read and give it a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay caught Calcavecchia on the par-4 No. 7 when he rolled in a
15-footer for birdie after Calcavecchia tapped in for par.
</P>
<P>
   Begay made his biggest move on the shortest hole. Calcavecchia's
drive on the par-3 No. 11 landed in the greenside trap on the
158-yard hole. He eventually bogeyed. Begay took the lead when he
made a 2-foot par putt. He birdied the next hole for a two-stroke
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both players drove the green on the 296-yard 15th hole.
Calcavecchia's ball stopped 6 feet from the pin and he sank his
eagle putt. Begay's drive rolled across the green and into the
backside fringe. A chip and two putts later, they were tied at 19
all with three holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trying to hit a good shot and get it on the green
and make birdie. Just so happens I hit an incredible 3-wood in
there,'' Calcavecchia said. ''And he blew it by and I was surprised
when he missed the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, winless since 1998, picked up a $302,000
second-place check. Kirk Triplett shot a 67 to finish four strokes
back.
</P>
<P>
   Begay has credited part of his turnaround with using his brother
Clint as his caddie, starting in May. Clint, two years younger and
bigger at 260 pounds, has helped Begay relax by providing comic
relief while on the bag. Notah Begay has joked that his brother
won't get the caddies' usual 10 percent, but the family discount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't even seen my paycheck from last week -- he keeps
telling me the check's in the mail,'' Clint said. ''But as long as
he feeds me, I'm all right.''

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Leaders Discuss Unity  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- With the global economy beginning to
squeeze out Caribbean nations, the region's leaders were supposed
to concentrate this week on jump-starting a decades-old effort to
unite their economies. But the region's divisiveness is again
stealing the show.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing feud between Guyana and Suriname over resources
along their border has exploded. And the 15-member Caribbean
Community is being asked to step in during its summit on Canouan,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pace is slower than it should have been,''
Secretary-General Edwin Carrington said of regional unity before
the conference opened Sunday. ''Some people do not realize how
urgent this is.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, rich countries have branded a string of
Caribbean offshore banking industries as money-laundering centers,
threatening sanctions against what many tiny island nations see as
one of the few ways out of poverty in a globalized world.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean countries have watched, stunned and powerless, as
their textile and other factories shut down and moved to Mexico
after it became a partner to the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Then the United States won a ruling by the World Trade
Organization against Europe's trade preference for Caribbean banana
producers.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the first orders of business will be resolving a
dispute between Suriname and Guyana over a Canadian oil rig that
was operating under a concession granted by Guyana. Suriname,
Guyana's neighbor on the northern coast of South America, claims
the rig crossed into Surinamese waters and ordered it to move on
June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both countries vowed to try to settle the matter
between themselves, but their third round of talks broke down two
weeks ago. The Caribbean Community, known as Caricom, is trying to
smooth things over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can ill afford incidents that will divert us from
developing our resources,'' Guyanese President Bharrat Jagdeo said
as the summit opened.
</P>
<P>
   Peacemaking is becoming a familiar role for Caricom. It brokered
a peace agreement in Guyana after disputed elections led to race
riots in 1998 and helped heal a trade dispute between Trinidad and
Jamaica last year.
</P>
<P>
   The elections crisis in the Caricom's newest member, Haiti, will
also be discussed. The Organization of American States has
criticized the vote-counting process following the May polls, and
on Sunday, OAS secretary general Cesar Gaviria talked privately
with Haitian President Rene Preval at the summit. Details of their
discussion were not released.
</P>
<P>
   With so many internal problems, Caribbean leaders fret that they
have made little progress toward their original goal of forging a
common market.
</P>
<P>
   All the leaders agree that a common market would help the
region. In 1992, Caricom amended the treaty that created it to
include a single market similar to that of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But getting countries to agree and change laws and constitutions
has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford not to have (a single market),'' Carrington
lamented. ''It's costing us a lot each day.''
</P>
<P>
   A major drawback is the diversity of islands such as oil-rich
Trinidad, the banana-dependent Windward Islands such as St. Vincent
and desperately poor Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Caricom leaders are also trying to build ties with Cuba and will
sign a trade agreement with the island this week, outgoing chairman
Denzil Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda, yet again, are plans to set up a Caribbean
supreme court to replace the faraway Privy Council in London.
</P>
<P>
   The court was expected to operate this year among members
Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad, but has been delayed while
Caricom seeks ways to guarantee that it will be financially
independent and apolitical, Carrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Caricom members are Antigua and Barbuda, St. Lucia,
Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Dominica and Belize.

<HEADLINE> Reds 14, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Aaron Boone had a career-high five RBIs and Barry
Larkin went 4-for-4, including a double in Cincinnati's five-run
first inning, as the Reds routed the Arizona Diamondbacks 14-2
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, Chris Stynes and Alex Ochoa each had three hits for the
Reds, who finished with a season-high 20 off six pitchers. The 14
runs were the most at Phoenix by a visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati also scored five runs in fifth, with seven straight
batters reaching. The Reds added two runs each in the second and
fourth to build a 14-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle (7-2) scattered eight hits in seven innings and
helped his own cause with a double and an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit his 24th home run for the Diamondbacks, a solo
shot in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (2-9), who has not pitched past the fifth inning in
his last three starts, allowed seven runs and seven hits in 1 1-3
innings with three walks -- two intentional. He hasn't won since May
25 against Pittsburgh and has lost six of his last seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Stynes led off the game with an infield single and Larkin lined
a double off the bullpen wall in left. Ken Griffey Jr., back in the
lineup after twisting his right knee Saturday, hit a soft grounder
to first to score Stynes for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette singled home Larkin, Boone walked. Daal struck
out Dmitri Young, and Ochoa hit a two-run double off the wall in
right-center field to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Daal intentionally walked Benito Santiago and Neagle blooped an
RBI single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan, who started and took the loss on Friday, gave up a
two-run single to Boone in the second, his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was interrupted in the top of the fifth by a fan
running in from right field and sliding head first into second
base. ... Finley has homered in four of his last five games after
going 20 games without one. ... The Reds are 15-6 against the
Diamondbacks and have won eight of the last nine. ... Young, one of
two Reds' starters not to get a hit, struck out three times. ...
The Reds placed RHP Manny Aybar on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained right groin and purchased the contract of RHP Andy Larkin
from Triple-A Louisville. Aybar was ejected from Saturday's game
after hitting Tony Womack with a pitch.

<HEADLINE> Former Mass Gov. To Leave Politics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- William F. Weld once had grand political
aspirations, but those appear to be falling by the wayside and the
former Massachusetts governor said he could soon be out of politics
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, a New York City lawyer in private practice with a
seven-figure salary, said just a year ago he would consider running
for president or lobbying to be the vice president in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican says national office no longer holds allure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have ruled out everything except a possible run for governor
of New York in 2006 and I don't think even that is very likely,''
Weld told The Boston Sunday Globe. ''I wouldn't be surprised if my
life took a completely different turn in the next five years that
would moot the 2006 New York governor's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he lives his life in five-year chunks, and the current
five-year portion will end in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a couple of years, I will have been five years at this
stint, so I expect in two or three years there will be a turn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, already a published novelist, could turn to writing full
time, he said. He is currently working on his third novel.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he may try to get into acting. He recently had a small role
in a new Steven Soderbergh crime drama, ''Traffic,'' essentially
playing himself -- a former governor and federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   His personal life, as well as his professional life, also
appears to be changing. There have been reports of problems with
his marriage. He told the Globe that his wife, Susan Roosevelt
Weld, has had a more difficult time adjusting to New York. She is
an academic specializing in ancient Chinese law who spends most of
her time in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who turns 55 on Monday, said he's working harder than he
has almost since his Harvard days as the managing partner of
McDermott Will &AMP; Emery's Manhattan office, often working 12-hour
days.
</P>
<P>
   Weld left the Massachusetts governor's office in midterm in 1997
to pursue the U.S. ambassadorship to Mexico. His appointment was
blocked by Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. And although Weld has joked that he is
grateful to Helms for getting him out of the public eye, Weld still
has some harsh words for the North Carolina Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have come to realize that Jesse Helms stands for everything
in politics that is anathema to me,'' Weld said. ''In his position
as chairman of Foreign Relations, he does serious harm to the
national interest of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Voting Nears Close in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As voting neared a close Sunday in a historic
presidential race, the party that has ruled Mexico for 71 years
appeared to have suffered crushing losses in three major regional
races.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's presidential vote was the first in more than a century
in which the outcome wasn't clear beforehand. Despite hundreds of
allegations of pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the
ruling party -- the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that we make history today,'' said Rebeca Meza
Oliva, a 45-year-old housewife waiting in line to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Meza said she planned to vote for opposition candidate Vicente
Fox of the conservative National Action Party, who is in a tight
race with Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   As voting booths closed in central Mexico, the PRI appeared to
have lost the three key local races, according to exit polls by the
two national television networks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Televisa network's poll, the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party held onto Mexico City's mayorship as Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador won 40 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent
for Santiago Creel of National Action. It said the PRI's Jesus
Silva Herzog finished third, with 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca had the race closer -- though no better for the PRI: 34
for Lopez Obrador, 31 for Creel and 20 for Silva Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   In Morelos state, just south of the capital, the Televisa poll
had National Action capturing the governorship from the PRI by 57
percent to 29 percent. TV Azteca had it 47-22 for National Action.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's poll said National Action was holding Fox's home
state of Guanajuato with a 58 percent to 32 percent victory over
the PRI in the governor's race. TV Azteca had it 50 percent to 25
percent. The margins of error in both polls were given as plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   National results could not be released until polls closed in
later time zones in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated voters clashed with election workers in Mexico City
when some booths for people casting ballots outside their home
districts ran out of absentee ballots shortly after noon -- with
hundreds still in line.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines formed at regular voting booths too, evidence of a
heavy turnout. Many said that more than ever before they felt their
vote could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Meza said she had voted for the PRI her entire life -- often
after pressure at her children's school, at her job and from
neighborhood leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This year she ignored the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm against the PRI now. I've seen so many things -- not any
more,'' she said in the poor Guerrero neighborhood. ''I want a
change with all my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida led by a hair in most final polls released a week
before the elections. He was counting on the powerful party
machinery and the almost unconditional support of millions of
Mexicans who associate the party with the government, and often
with the nation itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always liked it,'' said Lisa Cioron Fernandez, a
53-year-old merchant, about the PRI, the party she said she would
vote for. Asked whether she thought the PRI could lose, she gave a
disparaging ''Nah!''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the party that will always be here, fighting for Mexico
and for its ideals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   He promised more aid for the countryside, more resources for
public education and more attention to the poor. Labastida, a
former governor of Sinaloa state, was the top Cabinet secretary in
President Ernesto Zedillo's government before the campaign and said
he would continue many of Zedillo's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato state in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   Running a distant third in the polls was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a
veteran leftist leader running his third presidential campaign.
Many Mexicans believe he won the 1988 elections, only to be cheated
out of a victory by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates were on the ballot, although one told his
supporters in the weeks before the election to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox voted in his native Guanajuato state, serenaded by mariachis
and trailed by a crush of reporters. Labastida and Cardenas voted
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards and
opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Jose
Woldenberg, said in a message televised in the early afternoon that
problems were the exception. He said his workers ''tell us we are
experiencing exemplary elections.''
</P>
<P>
   While most voting seemed trouble-free on Sunday, the PRI's
official poll watchers outnumbered those of all other parties at
many voting places visited by reporters, who saw a few voters
illegally being helped in marking their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox campaign on Saturday released a 200-page list of
complaints that Fox spokeswoman Marta Sahagun said demonstrated
that the elections ''are already tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all voters were bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Cirilo Mejia, a 66-year-old lottery ticket salesman, said the
PRI gift-giving had been more widespread than ever this year -- and
that suited him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave me lots of presents: pens, caps, even a blanket. I'm
going to vote for the one they recommended -- Labastida,'' he said,
adding that ''they'' were government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why fool ourselves? The one they recommended will win.''

Tight Election Being Decided in Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Francisco Labastida is counting on the powerful
Institutional Revolutionary Party machinery to deliver him a victory in today's
presidential election in Mexico, in the hopes that the party that has controlled
the country for 71 years will continue to do so. But Vicente Fox, a maverick
businessman, is posing a strong challenge to that wish. With voter turnout
heavy, the two men seem to be about dead even in the vote. Preliminary voter
returns aren't expected until 9:30 p.m. EDT at the earliest.

Mexicans In U.S. Return To Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Despite voting rules that sharply constrain their
electoral power, Mexicans living in the United States joined caravans arranged
by political parties or headed south on their own today to vote in Mexico's
historic national elections. Mexicans with valid voting cards walked or drove to
64 special booths -- with just 750 ballots each -- in Mexico's six border
states. The booths eliminate the need for Mexicans to return to home election
districts.

Engineers Blame Terrace Structure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Engineers believe the deadly collapse of a
concrete terrace at a winery on a Lake Erie island was caused by a structural
problem, not an overload of people. One person was killed and at least 75 people
were injured at the Lonz Winery when the terrace floor gave way yesterday,
dropping victims and rubble 20 feet into an old wine cellar. Police kept boaters
300 feet from the island today as tourists tried to see the damage at the
lakefront terrace of the winery's century-old main building.

Saudis Talk of Pumping More Oil
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Saudi Arabia is talking to other
producers about pumping more oil in the next few weeks in a bid to bring down
prices now at about $30 a barrel, a Saudi oil official said Sunday. The official
said the target was $25 a barrel. Saudi Arabia alone has excess production
capacity of 2.3 million barrels per day, which can be put on the market in a
short period of time if necessary, the official said. Saudi Arabia is the
world's top oil producer and exporter.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jewish leaders in the United States called for tighter
sanctions against Iran today following the conviction of 10 Jews there on
charges of spying. ''Iran must pay a price for this,'' Rep. Eliot Engel of New
York said, joining about 150 Jewish leaders, elected officials and protesters
gathered outside the Iranian Mission to the United Nations. Engel and New York

   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- The ex-communist opposition claimed a crushing

Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party would be a stunning political reversal in
the remote Asian nation, which dealt the former communists an overwhelming

   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Hale Irwin overcame a two-stroke deficit with a

with a 17-under 267 today, the lowest total in tournament history, surpassing
Gary Player's 270 in 1987. Bruce Fleisher, who had led after the first three
rounds, shot a 70 and finished at 270. He was seeking his 11th senior victory in
two years. ''Statements are made and statements are forgotten,'' Irwin said when
asked if he was trying to prove that he was the best player among the seniors.

Cubs' Sosa Wants Contract Extension
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- With trade rumors still swirling and his agents' talks with
the Chicago Cubs apparently going nowhere, it appears Sammy Sosa just wants
someone to want him. Sosa took a little extra time stripping off his uniform in
the cramped visitors' clubhouse at County Stadium today, and his famous smile
was nowhere to be seen. He didn't speak to reporters after the Cubs blew a
one-run lead in the eighth inning of their 4-2 loss to the Brewers. The weight
of trade rumors and a slump at the plate are taking their toll on Sosa.

<HEADLINE> A Second Baseman Heeds Emergencies  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Dot Richardson had taken her position at
second base between innings of a pre-Olympic exhibition softball
game when a member of the team's coaching staff yelled her name
with an urgency that didn't quite fit the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew by the sound of his voice that it was medical,''
Richardson, who also happens to be a doctor, said Sunday during the
team's Central Park to Sydney tour stop in Worcester. ''It's a
situation I've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the field to run toward the commotion behind the
first-base dugout, the second baseman listed in the media guide as
Dr. Dot Richardson found a man laid out on the ground. He had no
pulse, he was not breathing, and he was turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   With another doctor compressing the man's chest, Richardson
began breathing into his mouth, through a mask. The man opened his
eyes -- but just for a second, and then the two resumed
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   The man, 70-year-old Sal Lamendola, was pronounced dead Thursday
night at Sisters of Charity Medical Center on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is precious, and we need to live it to the fullest,''
Richardson said. ''That gentleman was there because he was a
softball umpire. He was where he wanted to be. God will take us
when it's our time.''
</P>
<P>
   In softball, as in baseball, a second baseman needs to keep
track of everything that might happen on the field: what the
pitcher will throw, where the batter tends to hit the ball, and
what to do no matter where the ball is hit.
</P>
<P>
   But it's when a player gets a call like the one Richardson did
in New York on Thursday night that her instincts are truly tested.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past week, Richardson's medical career has
interrupted her softball career, and twice she has not hesitated
before responding.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during a team meeting at its stop in Plant City,
Fla., Richardson and team trainer Laura Mincy went to help a man
who had been in a car accident; he was OK. But even after breathing
into the mouth of a dying man, Richardson never questioned her
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I never got back on that field -- if I had to stay with him
24 hours -- I would do that. Because, really, this is a game,'' she
said. ''But it's through this game that we are able to touch so
many lives. And that's what makes this game incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who had stayed with Lamendola until the ambulance
came, found herself standing by the road as the ambulance pulled
away. ''All of the sudden, it hit me: I've got a game to play,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The game had resumed with a substitute at second base -- a move
that several of the players criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game should have been stopped and all attention focused on
the man,'' said catcher Michelle Venturella, who added that the
team had gathered some things to send to Lamendola's family. ''The
whole team was very upset. We just felt that was not being very
respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said she understood why the game went on.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were so many people who had come to see us play,'' she
said. ''We could not help him any more. He was in God's hands, and
he was in the paramedics' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson ran back to the field, and went back into the game
when her spot came up in the batting order (Unlike baseball,
softball players can return after leaving for a substitution). She
swung at the first pitch and grounded out to the second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd think she already has enough going on with this game,
and she goes into the stands to help someone,'' said Steven Lajoie,
a paramedic who was working Sunday's game in Worcester.
''Performing CPR has a huge emotional effect on you, and when you
stop, all of the sudden you have to come back down from that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene in the mystical movie ''Field of Dreams'' where
a ballplayer is forced to choose between baseball and medicine.
With a little girl choking in the stands, he stands at the
first-base line, knowing that if he crosses it he can never go
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cry every time I see that part,'' Richardson said. ''So
often, I have been on that line, deciding, 'Do I go 100 percent
with medicine?'
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been so lucky that I have not had to forgo my medical
career,'' she said. ''To be able to represent my country at the
highest level of competition -- I have had the best of both
worlds.''

<HEADLINE> Aftershocks Continue in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Strong aftershocks were likely to continue for a
week on Japanese islands jolted by a powerful quake that killed one
man, buckled roads and demolished a shrine, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people living near a cliff on Kozushima island were
evacuated as more than a thousand aftershocks were recorded since
Saturday's magnitude 6.4 quake, said island official Hiroyoshi
Shimizu.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 200 residents on the island took shelter overnight at a
public facility or at relatives' homes, another island official,
Tomihiro Ishinoda, said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroyoshi said the quake destroyed roads at six places and
damaged more than 10 houses and 100 gravestones on Kozushima, 95
miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The main building of a shrine was crushed under a landslide, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shimizu said about 50 Self-Defense Force soldiers left the
island Sunday after removing boulders that had tumbled from
mountainsides and clearing roads of debris.
</P>
<P>
   A 5.4-magnitude quake jolted the island at 5:03 a.m. Monday and
was centered at a depth about 6 miles under the seabed near the
island, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's earthquake center said magnitude 4.5 and 4.9
aftershocks were registered Sunday and predicted that fairly strong
quakes would continue to shake the island.
</P>
<P>
   It warned residents to be on the alert for four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   The quake Saturday afternoon struck the Izu islands with the
biggest force on Niijima and Kozushima, an island of about 2,300
people.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old motorist was buried under falling rocks on
Kozushima and died at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It also shook Miyakejima, just southeast of Kozushima, where
residents were allowed to return to their homes on Friday after
fears of a volcanic eruption subsided.

<HEADLINE> State reopens Interstate rest stops between Albany, Plattsburgh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state will rebuild and reopen rest areas
along the Northway starting with a $17.2 million project this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   That project funded with state and federal money will tear down
and replace an old rest stop between exits 29 and 30 near North
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 14 rest stops along Interstate 87 between Albany and
the Canadian border have been closed since 1991. Officials said the
decision as made to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Transportation's long-range plans call
for 12 rest areas within two years, including the renovation of
stops in Schroon Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially at night and during the long winters, you'll feel a
lot more comfortable stopping at some of those rest areas,'' said
Thomas Bergin, spokesman for state Sen. Ronald Stafford,
R-Plattsburgh. ''I've been up there plenty of times in February at
10 or 11 o'clock at night, and it's like you're on another
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   New rest areas will include space for state police and the U.S.
Border Patrol. There won't be restaurants or gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   The design will reflect old Adirondack Great Camps. Exteriors
are proposed to be wavy wood siding stained a dark earth tone with
a dark green asphalt shingle roof.

<HEADLINE> BBC: Hacker Endangered Astronauts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A computer hacker endangered shuttle astronauts in
1997 by overloading NASA's communication system, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the shuttle docked at the Russian space station Mir, a hacker
tapped into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
computer system that monitors the heartbeat, pulse and medical
condition of astronauts aboard the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an activity at NASA center where a hacker was
overloading our system ... to such an extent that it interfered
with communications between the NASA center, some medical
communications and the astronaut aboard the shuttle,'' Roberta
Gross, inspector general at NASA, said in a BBC documentary to be
aired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was forced to switch systems and talk to the astronauts via
the Russian station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released ahead of premiere of ''Cyber Attack,''
which looks at how hackers are able to penetrate the defense
systems of such countries as the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said NASA has numerous fail-safe measures to ensure
communications, ''but it shows the potential hackers have for doing
some real damage to NASA's mission and astronaut safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, NASA has experienced more than 500,000 cyber
attacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows if there's a problem at Houston, a potential
vulnerability or someone is able to supersede the system we set up,
that's dangerous,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Michael Foale, who was part of the 1997 mission, told
the BBC he was not informed of the problems at the time, but found
the revelations intriguing.

<HEADLINE> Operation Sail 2000 Underway in NY  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy dropped
anchor near the Statue of Liberty on Sunday, dwarfing a growing
armada of tall ships, sailboats and military vessels gathering for
the city's Fourth of July celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The skies over New York Harbor were abuzz with helicopters, and
white-uniformed sailors joined the throng of seafarers taking part
in Operation Sail 2000 and International Naval Review 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that this will be the largest assemblage
ever of tall ships and naval vessels,'' said Greg Perrin, vice
president of OpSail 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 150 tall ships from 23 countries and 25 naval ships from
14 are expected for an 11-mile military review and tall ship parade
down the Hudson River on the Fourth of July. President Clinton
plans to review the military ships from the missile cruiser USS Hue
City, then board the USS Kennedy for the tall ships' ''parade of
sail.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 miles to the northeast, in the seaport in Mystic,
Conn., a replica of the 19th-century slave ship Amistad set sail
Sunday for the New York Harbor celebration on its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a joy to sail,'' said the ship's captain, William
Pinkney. ''It doesn't take a lot of wind to get her moving. That
she is responsive is what you want a sailboat to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was aboard the original Amistad in 1839 that 53 captive
Africans, headed for a life of slavery, revolted and eventually won
their freedom after a long legal battle in Connecticut. The
129-foot long replica was built to spread the message of
cooperation, leadership and perseverance that can be drawn from the
story of its namesake.
</P>
<P>
   While the Amistad and other stately tall ships are the
celebration's main attraction, Navy officials had hoped to also
grab the spotlight with the largest naval review in history.
Sixty-one nations were invited to take part, but officials now say
this year's gathering isn't likely to surpass the record 25 navies
represented at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Naval ships from Canada, Ireland, Britain, Ukraine, India,
Greece, France, Italy, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, Turkey and
the United States are expected, said U.S. Navy Capt. Woody Berzins,
a spokesman for the International Naval Review.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong event includes tours of some of the ships and a
Fourth of July fireworks display billed as the largest ever: 60
tons of explosives launched from barges, with a grand finale blast
planned over the Statue of Liberty.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn man was charged with reckless
endangerment after throwing a baseball at Atlanta Braves' pitcher
John Rocker during the New York Mets' game Sunday afternoon at Shea
Stadium, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Sweeney, 25, was arrested around 3:30 p.m. when police
say he threw a ball at Rocker after the Braves reliever tossed it
into the stands. Rocker had been warming up with outfielder Reggie
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's presence this weekend brought out about 700 police
officers and created a media circus to Shea. He has repeatedly
enflamed New Yorkers' emotions with derogatory comments about the
city.
</P>

   In other trouble surrounding the last of the Mets four-game

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As voting is nearing a close tonight in a historic
presidential race, the party that has ruled Mexico for 71 years appears to have
suffered crushing losses in three major regional races. Today's presidential
vote was the first in more than a century in which the outcome wasn't clear
beforehand. Despite hundreds of allegations of pressure and vote-buying -- most
perpetrated by the ruling party -- the elections were widely seen as Mexico's

120-mile course from Futuroscope to Loudun in 4 hours, 46 minutes, 8 seconds.
Steels edged Australia's Stuart O'Grady in a frantic sprint to the finish line
but Britain's David Millar retained the yellow jersey as the overall leader and
stretched his advantage over Armstrong to four seconds.

Rockies Nip Padres 3-2 in 10
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Woody Williams pitched eight strong innings in his first
start following surgery for an aneurysm, but the Colorado Rockies scored an
unearned run in the 10th inning to beat the San Diego Padres 3-2 today. Jeff
Cirillo's second sacrifice fly of the game, off closer Trevor Hoffman (1-3),
scored Mike Lansing, who had reached with one out on second baseman Bret Boone's
fielding error and third on Todd Helton's single.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Brooklyn man was charged with reckless
endangerment Sunday after throwing a baseball at John Rocker during
the New York Mets' 10-2 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Sweeney, 25, was arrested around 3:30 p.m. when police
say he threw a ball at Rocker after the Braves reliever tossed it
into the stands. Rocker had been warming up outfielder Reggie
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's presence this weekend brought out about 700 police
officers to each game at Shea. He has repeatedly enflamed New
Yorkers' emotions with derogatory comments about the city, but
apologized Thursday before the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   In other trouble surrounding the last of the Mets four-game
series with the Braves, police issued 272 summonses for people with
open beer containers and charged 64 people with ticket scalping.

<HEADLINE> Girl, embarrassed by school's tattered flag, gets one flown over Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) - Ten-year-old tiffany Small was upset that
the flag flying in front of her elementary school was tattered and
faded.
</P>
<P>
   So she did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hated seeing that old flag,'' she said. ''It is very rude to
fly a flag that is like that ... We need to respect our country. I
wanted to show how much we really cared for our flag. If a soldier
came by and they saw our flag the way it was, he would have thought
that our school wouldn't care about our country. That would be very
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The student enlisted her teacher and a friend and wrote letters
to get a new flag for the Genesee School, 23 miles west of
Syracuse. She recently ended up with a beauty, one that was flown
over the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   She celebrates July 4th for the freedom it represents.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday is ''something that would make us think about our
country and (try) not to be as cruel as everybody is in our world
today. We need to stop teasing and all the things that people do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I like our freedoms.'' she told The Citizen of Auburn.
''That's why we had all of these wars, so we could have freedom.
The freedom I like best is happiness. I like going out and shopping
with my friends, having fun, doing yard work and playing with my
dogs.''

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Protestants Plan March  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Signaling a potentially
violent week ahead, leaders of Northern Ireland's major Protestant
group vowed Sunday to march past Roman Catholic homes in this
bitterly polarized town.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 members and supporters of the Orange Order
marched to Drumcree, an Anglican church near Portadown, where
British security forces for the past two years have prevented the
Protestant group from parading past a nearby Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers in armored personnel carriers blocked the
Orangemen's intended route, a narrow country lane between the
church and Garvaghy Road, and rows of riot police in helmets and
flame-retardant uniforms stood ready. A British army helicopter and
police observation plane monitored the scene as Orange leaders
handed police commanders a formal protest letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This struggle goes on for as long as it takes,'' Portadown's
Orange leader, Harold Gracey, told the crowd from a podium in front
of the armored vehicles. A few dozen men, some of them members of
outlawed anti-Catholic gangs based in Portadown, scuffled with
police and threw stones, but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic violence resumed after dark when a 150-strong group
hurled ball bearings and firecrackers at police lines. The army
deployed electric generators and spotlights to pinpoint rioters but
made no immediate arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a hard-line fraternal group founded near
Portadown in the 1790s, is still influential today. Tens of
thousands of Orangemen march each July, often to celebrate
17th-century military victories over Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown march, which commemorates the losses suffered by
Protestants during World War I's Battle of the Somme, has
traditionally gone past the Catholics living on Portadown's
Garvaghy Road. The event has caused violence whether or not police
have permitted the Orangemen to parade: Police violently forced
anti-Orange protesters off the road in 1996 and 1997, provoking
riots in many Catholic areas, but have banned the parade route
since 1998, triggering Protestant disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the parade route blocked once again, Orange
Order leader Gracey said he hoped to see hundreds of thousands of
Protestants rally on Northern Ireland's streets in the coming week
to support their demands. Gracey has maintained a 726-day vigil at
the church to protest the 1998 parade route ban, and he has refused
to negotiate directly with Catholic protest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easy for the security forces to contain a crowd here at
Drumcree. But if you can get people out on the streets in your
towns and villages ...'' Gracey said, his rallying cry cut short by
enthusiastic cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey said he expects 6,000 to 10,000 Protestants to turn out
for a bigger Orange attempt to march down Garvaghy Road next
Sunday. He said he would welcome crowds massing outside the church
-- another tactic that has inspired attacks on police lines in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   While the Orange Order has emphasized that it doesn't sanction
bloodshed, past efforts by members of the Protestant majority to
pressure British authorities by blocking roads and mounting snap
protests have frequently turned violent. Orangemen backed off from
their standoff in 1998 only after three Catholic brothers were
burned to death in an arson attack. Last year's protests were
deliberately muted, sparking little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent response to Gracey's latest appeal, Protestants
blocked roads in north Belfast and a predominantly Protestant
village late Sunday, but no violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's demonstrations also attracted visible support from the
province's murderous anti-Catholic groups. Youths at the
confrontation line with soldiers draped the lead armored cars with
banners honoring two outlawed groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Loyalist Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
   Like the outlawed Irish Republican Army, the outlawed Protestant
groups are supposed to be observing cease-fires in support of
Northern Ireland's two-year-old peace accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Even-money favorite Happyanunoit won
the $250,000 Beverly Hills Handicap by three lengths over Sweet
Life on Sunday at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Happyanunoit, ridden by Brice Blanc, covered 1&AMP;frac14; miles in 1:59
1-5, one-fifth of a second off the stakes record set by Estrapade
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old mare carried 121 pounds and paid $4, $3 and
$2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 purse pushes the New Zealand-bred Happyanunoit's
career earnings to nearly $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Polaire, ridden by Corey Nakatani, finished third as Astra, the
6-5 second choice who had beaten Happyanunoit in last month's
Gamely Handicap, faded to fourth after setting the early pace.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Life, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 116
pounds, paid $4.80 and $2.60. Polaire, carrying 116 pounds, paid $3
to show.
</P>
<P>
   The tiring Astra was eventually disqualified and placed last in
the field of five for drifting out and impeding Country Garden in
the stretch.

Air Canada To Prolong Contract Talks
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada and its pilots agreed Sunday to
prolong their contract talks, giving travelers at least a few more
days of worry-free flying.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not given strike notice at this time,'' Peter Foster,
a spokesman for the Air Canada Pilot's Association, said in an
interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fair to say there's enough happening at the table to
warrant the continuation of talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood among Air Canada negotiators was equally optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been considerable progress made during the past four
days of negotiations and we remain firmly focused on negotiating a
settlement without disruption to our customers,'' said Calin
Rovinescu, an executive with Corporate Development Strategy, the
company leading the talks for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have been in a legal strike position since June 26,
when the union announced its members had voted 95 per cent in favor
of a strike mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues for the union, which represents 2,200 pilots,
are wages, pensions, working conditions and job security.

Labrador Helicopter Back in Service
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- A Labrador helicopter that was
grounded Saturday was fixed and back in service Sunday in the
search for a missing home-built airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The Labrador is part of the hunt for a Pelican Cub airplane with
two 43-year-old men aboard. It was to join another Labrador on
Sunday evening to search for the tiny airplane in an area of about
6,000 square kilometers
</P>
<P>
   The airplane disappeared over the southern tip of Baffin Island
in Nunavut on Thursday, after leaving the community of Lake Harbor
on a one-hour flight north to the territorial capital Iqaluit.
</P>
<P>
   The search also includes two Hercules airplanes, two bush planes
and a small Coast Guard helicopter.

Motorhome Plows Into Crowd, Injures Seven
</P>
<P>
   OSOYOOS, British Columbia (AP) -- Canada Day celebrations turned
chaotic when a motorhome plowed into a crowd of people, injuring
seven, at least one seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the motorhome lost control and struck two parked
cars and a motorcycle before plunging into the crowd, Sgt. Ted
Cronmiller said. He said was wasn't clear what caused the driver to
lose control.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands were celebrating the July 1 holiday Saturday at the
annual Osoyoos Cherry Fiesta in Osoyoos, British Columbia, about
260 kilometers east of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person who suffered a head injury was flown to
hospital in Kelowna, British Columbia The others were taken to
hospitals in nearby Oliver and Penticton, B.C, MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest victim was an eight-year-old girl, who suffered a
broken wrist. Several others had minor cuts and bruises.

   Balanced Budgets Too Late for NDP
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- British Columbia's attempt to
put the brakes on a decade of red ink by introducing a
balanced-budget law won't be the political salvation of the NDP,
says a University of Victoria political expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense, in talking to people, is the die has been cast,''
says Michael Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fudge-it budgets are still lingering in people's minds.
This isn't going to be a magic wand to save them politically.''
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh said his government's
law, introduced last week, will help restore NDP credibility and
show he means business when he says he wants to get a handle on the
province's finances.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nine consecutive deficits and a doubling of the
provincial debt to $36 billion under the NDP government.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 provincial election, the NDP tabled what it
said were two surplus budgets. But shortly after being re-elected,
the government said the economy had worsened and the budgets were
in the red, touching off what became known as the fudge-it budget
scandal.

<HEADLINE> Paris Celebrates Euro Soccer Win  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The French capital broke into a chorus of hollers,
honks and whoops Sunday night as Parisians took to the streets in a
frenzied celebration after the 2-1 triumph of their team over Italy
in the Euro 2000 soccer final.
</P>
<P>
   The win crowned France's 1998 World Cup victory, making France
the first country to win first the World Cup followed by the
European championship.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight on the Champs-Elysees, where crowds of joyous
revelers brought to mind the massive national pride that turned
Paris into a giant street party two years ago, when France beat
Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 ecstatic fans, some waving French flags, crowded
onto Paris' most famous avenue to mark the victory, made possible
only by a last-minute goal to tie the game 1-1 and put it into
overtime when the French finally came out in front 2-1. The match
was in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans were joyous, not violent, though an ugly standoff
broke out between a small crowd of people and riot police just off
the famous tree-lined avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, all along the Champs-Elysees, people crowded at
apartment windows and on balconies to watch the show below.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't watch the game because I was too afraid,'' said
Stephanie Rey, a 25-year-old Parisian who was wearing a World Cup
T-shirt from 1998. ''We just walked through the streets. Now my
heart is beating very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans in Italy sank into a kind of sorrowful stupor after the
loss, but some of the disappointment erupted into violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, a half dozen Italian fans, waving sticks and bars,
started chasing a group of jubilant French soccer supporters who
had just emerged from a bar near Piazza Navona after the victory. A
French fan was injured in the face. The Italian fans fled before
police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Before the match, most French had confidence that their adored
team, ''les Bleus,'' or the Blues, would win. Ninety percent of
French people were expecting victory, according to a poll by the
Ifop agency, published in Sunday's Le Journal du Dimanche
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Both French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin attended the match.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight, I am proud for France and I am proud for the
French,'' Chirac said on live television on France's TF1 channel
after the game. ''The French team has kept its genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin called the victory a great ''joy'' following the World
Cup victory. ''This team deserved to win,'' Jospin said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Opposition Has Edge  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Four national exit polls gave an edge to
opposition candidate Vicente Fox in historic presidential elections
Sunday that could bring an end to the ruling party's 71-year lock
on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory would be almost unthinkable for many in Mexico,
where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
almost synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself
-- to millions of supporters and detractors alike.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Televisa television network showed Fox, of
the conservative National Action Party, with 44 percent, the PRI's
Francisco Labastida with 38 percent and leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
with 16 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll by the rival TV Azteca network gave Fox 38.8
percent, Labastida 30.5 percent and Cardenas 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And an exit poll by the Chamber of the Radio and Television
Industry had Fox with a 43 percent to 34 percent lead over
Labastida. A poll by two U.S. polling firms showed Fox ahead 42-36.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trailed in a distant third in all
exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's margin of error was one percentage point; Azteca's
was 1.5; And the U.S polling firms' was 1 percentage point. The
other exit poll didn't give a margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the first in more than a century in which the
outcome wasn't clear beforehand. Despite hundreds of allegations of
pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the ruling party --
the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that we make history today,'' said Rebeca Meza
Oliva, a 45-year-old housewife waiting in line to vote -- for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI appeared to have also lost three key local races,
according to exit polls by the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Televisa's poll, the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party held onto Mexico City's mayorship as Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador won 41 percent of the vote, compared with 33 percent for
Santiago Creel of National Action. It said the PRI's Jesus Silva
Herzog finished third, with 22 percent. TV Azteca had the race
closer -- though no better for the PRI: 34 for Lopez Obrador, 31 for
Creel and 20 for Silva Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   In Morelos state, just south of the capital, the Televisa poll
had National Action capturing the governorship from the PRI by 57
percent to 29 percent. TV Azteca had it 47-22 for National Action.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's poll said National Action was holding Fox's home
state of Guanajuato with a 57 percent to 33 percent victory over
the PRI in the governor's race. TV Azteca had it 50 percent to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato state in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   He promised more aid for the countryside, more resources for
public education and more attention to the poor. Labastida, a
former governor of Sinaloa state, was a top Cabinet secretary
before the campaign and said he would continue many of President
Ernesto Zedillo's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a veteran leftist leader, was in his third
presidential campaign. Many Mexicans believe he won the 1988
elections, only to be cheated out of a victory by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates were on the ballot, although one told his
supporters in the weeks before the election to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox voted in his native Guanajuato state, serenaded by mariachis
and trailed by a crush of reporters. Labastida and Cardenas voted
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards and
opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Jose
Woldenberg, said in the early afternoon that problems were the
exception. He said his workers ''tell us we are experiencing
exemplary elections.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to
suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay

Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Signaling a potentially violent week
ahead, leaders of Northern Ireland's major Protestant group vowed Sunday to
march past Roman Catholic homes in this bitterly polarized town. More than 2,000
members and supporters of the Orange Order marched to Drumcree, an Anglican
church near Portadown, where British security forces for the past two years have
prevented the Protestant group from parading past a nearby Catholic
neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong in Second at Tour  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDUN, France (AP) -- Defending champion Lance Armstrong
remained in second place in the Tour de France despite finishing
way back in Sunday's first road stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Steels of Belgium won the close stage, finishing the mostly
flat 120-mile course from Futuroscope to Loudun in 4 hours, 46
minutes, 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Steels edged Australia's Stuart O'Grady in a frantic sprint to
the finish line but Britain's David Millar retained the yellow
jersey as the overall leader and stretched his advantage over
Armstrong to four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was close with O'Grady,'' said Steels, a member of the
Mapei team. ''It's very important to take a victory early on,
especially with a team like ours, with lots of sprinters.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady, of Credit Agricole, just beat Erik Zabel of Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert of France remained third in the 21-stage event,
15 seconds off the pace. Germany's Jan Ullrich is 16 seconds back
and Spain's David Canada 18 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who took a nap after the race and did not speak to
reporters, appeared content to stay back and get ready for
Tuesday's important team time trials.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's right-hand man on the U.S. Postal
team, cut his elbow when he fell after 23&AMP;frac12; miles. He continued
after receiving medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''My handlebars went into some guy's rear wheel and I crashed,''
he said. ''I was a little shaken up. But it could have been
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said that the mood of the pack had been ''nervy'' in
the first day of road racing.
</P>
<P>
   Millar had the right to wear three jerseys -- yellow for race
leader, green for points leader, and white for best young rider.
</P>
<P>
   Millar chose yellow and gave the green to his nearest rival
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Steels won three stages on last year's Tour and
would have had a fourth but was disqualified for bumping an
opponent in a dash to the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's open road race came as a relief to the riders after
Saturday's tense battle against the clock at the Futuroscope theme
park.
</P>
<P>
   The second stage wound its way along narrow roads, slicing
through fields of sunflowers and haystacks. Thousands of local
residents and visitors lined the route even before midday.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Dekker of the Netherlands and Frenchman Jacky Durand were
the first to attack and led for more than 60 miles, before being
reeled in by the pack as it braced for the final sprint.

<HEADLINE> Libertarians Nominate Browne  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- More than a thousand Libertarians
gathered at the party's national convention on Sunday nominated
Harry Browne, their 1996 candidate for president, to run again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old investment banker from Nashville, Tenn.,
acknowledged he has little chance of winning the presidency. He
said he hoped his campaign would reinvigorate what was formerly the
nation's top third party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the only political party that's offering to set you
free,'' Browne said. ''It's the most powerful political message in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Libertarian Party, which advocates individual
liberties over expansive and expensive government programs, claims
some 30,000 dues-paying members.
</P>
<P>
   It also identifies itself as the biggest third party movement in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, the party has lacked the star power of the Reform Party
and the Green Party in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Browne finished fifth in 1996, behind Reform Party candidate
Ross Perot and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, garnering less
than 1 percent of the national vote.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed a 12-step program that would eliminate income
taxes, Social Security, the war on drugs and federal welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against Browne were: Don Gorman of Deerfield, N.H., a
former four-term New Hampshire state legislator; Barry Hess, a
salesman from Phoenix, Ariz.; David Hollist, a charter bus driver
from Alta Loma, Calif.; and Jacob Hornberger, president of the
Future of Freedom Foundation, a libertarian think tank in Fairfax,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   A first ballot to choose a nominee for vice president did not
determine a 51 percent majority winner, said party spokesman Bill
Winter. A second ballot was taken, but results will not be
announced until Monday, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates for the vice presidential nomination was
Steve Kubby of Squaw Valley, Calif., the Libertarians' 1998
candidate for governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   Kubby, a backer of the medical marijuana law Californians'
passed in 1996, ran fourth in the governor's race but made
headlines last year when he and his wife were arrested and charged
with possessing drugs for sale after authorities found 300
marijuana plants in their home. The case has not yet gone to trial.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS to restore dropped AP logo  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy dropped
anchor Sunday near the Statue of Liberty, where it will serve as
centerpiece for New York's nautical Fourth of July extravaganza of
warships, tall ships and thousands of private watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   With the party just two days away, there were other foretellings
of the massive influx of vessels expected to jam the harbor from
Brooklyn to New Jersey and Verazzano to Manhattan. The U.S. Coast
Guard has estimated as many as 70,000 small craft might show up.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 sailing ships from 23 countries and 25 naval ships from
14 nations will take part in the dual event - Operation Sail 2000
and an International Naval Review, the sixth in just over a
century. In numbers at least, the naval review appeared to be
falling short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, skies over the harbor were abuzz with military
helicopters, and small groups of white-uniformed sailors on shore
leave were the vanguard of an expected throng of some 28,000
seafarers for the weeklong celebration. Some 3,000 to 4,000 small
craft already were at moorings in the harbor and shore marinas,
Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tempo is picking up,'' said U.S. Navy Capt. Woody Berzins,
a spokesman for the INR. ''This is the culmination of the things
we've been planning for more than two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that this will be the largest assemblage
ever of tall ships and naval vessels,'' said Greg Perrin, vice
president of OpSail 2000. As for the spectator fleet, he said
experience shows that many arrive just before the event, and
''within hours, there's no water any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant said the service was
standing by its estimate of 40,000 to 70,000 spectator craft for
the July 4 event, ''depending on the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   As for security and other preparations, ''we're on target of
where we wanted to be,'' Bryant said. ''If we can just get the
weather and the cooperation of everyone, this should go off without
a hitch.''
</P>
<P>
   While the stately sailing ships are the main attraction, Navy
officials originally had planned for history's largest naval
review, with 61 nations invited to take part. That was scaled back
to a more modest 50 entries, but the event appeared to be falling
well short of any chance to break the record of 25 navies
represented at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official list given out to news organizations said
36 ships would take part in the review, a list provided by Berzins
showed only 25 - 10 from the United States, two from Canada and two
from Japan, plus one each from Ireland, Britain, Ukraine, India,
Greece, France, Italy, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesmen said they couldn't explain the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   While many ships will be visiting Gotham for the first time, the
Norfolk, Va.-based Kennedy is no stranger. Commissioned in 1968 as
the Navy's last conventionally powered carrier, it has participated
in the city's annual ''Fleet Week'' festivities for a decade. The
Navy's eight newer, nuclear-powered carriers are not allowed in New
York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK, 80,000 tons and 1,052 feet long, anchored at midday
just south of the Statue of Liberty, near the amphibious assault
ship USS Nassau, a helicopter carrier that arrived on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, President Clinton will inspect the 11-mile line of
warships in the Hudson River from aboard the missile cruiser USS
Hue City, then transfer by Coast Guard cutter to the JFK, where he
will view the ''parade of sail'' from the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Hue City, one of the Navy's powerful, billion-dollar
Aegis-type cruisers, steamed up the harbor late Sunday, bound for a
Hudson River pier near the Intrepid, a famed World war II carrier
turned military museum. The Hue City is the only U.S. Navy ship
named for a Vietnam war battle.
</P>
<P>
   The all-day harbor activities will be capped at night by what
organizers call the largest fireworks display ever: some 60 tons of
explosives launched from barges at five locations, capped by a
grand finale blast near the Statue of Liberty. Organizers say as
many as four million people may see some part of the day aboard
watercraft or from vantage points in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to naval ships, the official U.S. contingent will
include two Coast Guard cutters and the oceanographic vessel Rude,
famous for its undersea scanning achievements that included
locating the crash sites of TWA 800 and John F. Kennedy's private
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Rude, owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), also surveyed the bottom of New York harbor
last year as part of the preparations for OpSail 2000, and located
six previously unknown shipwrecks, said NOAA spokeswoman Connie
Barclay.
</P>
<P>
   Other vessels were gathering in waters outside the Narrows in
preparation for their entry into the harbor. A Canadian warship was
to lead the naval contingent into the harbor before noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The naval craft will form a line at anchor 11 miles long in the
Hudson River, south of the George Washington Bridge. The sailing
ships are to parade up the Hudson, then turn and disperse to
various preassigned piers and moorings, for public visits through
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Party Fights for Capital  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A left-of-center candidate appeared headed
for victory in Mexico City's mayoral race, while two center-right
candidates were leading in two key governorships, according to exit
polls released late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll for the Televisa network showed center-left
Democratic Revolution Party candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador
ahead in the Mexico City mayor's race. The poll said he had 40
percent compared with 34 percent for Santiago Creel of the
center-right National Action Party and 22 percent for Jesus Silva
Herzog of the nationally ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another exit poll, done for the TV Azteca network, had Lopez
Obrador with 34 percent to Creel's 31 percent and Silva Herzog's 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Morelos, just south of the capital, National
Action's Sergio Estrada captured the governorship from the PRI by
57 percent to 29 percent for the PRI's Juan Salgado Brito,
according to the Televisa poll. TV Azteca had it 47-22 for National
Action.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's poll said National Action was holding presidential
candidate Vicente Fox's home state of Guanajuato with 57 percent
for Juan Carlos Romero Hicks to 33 percent for the PRI's Juan
Ignacio Torres Landa in the governor's race. TV Azteca had the race
at 50-25.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's poll had a 1 percentage point margin of error, while
TV Azteca's margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised statement, National Action's national
president, Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, declared victory in Morelos and
Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolution Party almost swept the board in 1997,
when Mexico City held its first mayor's race in decades, replacing
a presidentially appointed mayor with an elected one.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the party's presidential candidate this
year, won a stunning victory and his party crushed the opposition
in races for local and federal legislators in chaotic Mexico City,
North America's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the party has won three other governorships and is
part of an alliance in another state. But Cardenas was trailing in
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Obrador is a former PRI state leader who lost a 1994
election in Tabasco. State electoral officials, most close to the
PRI, rejected complaints of massive overspending by the PRI. The
federal attorney general's office said there was strong evidence of
election violations, but said it had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Lopez Obrador moved to Mexico City and became
national president of Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Sunday, Mexico City residents also elected
the presidents of the city's 16 boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls had shown that while Lopez Obrador led in the
mayoral contest, Fox was leading in presidential polls in the city.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Police Charge Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Police in riot gear charged
some 200 hard-line Protestant demonstrators early Monday,
dispersing a daylong protest that signaled a potentially violent
week ahead in this bitterly polarized town.
</P>
<P>
   The ground around Drumcree Bridge was littered with rocks and
shards of concrete hurled at security forces by supporters of
Northern Ireland's major Protestant group, intent on marching past
Roman Catholic homes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 members and supporters of the Orange Order
marched to Drumcree, an Anglican church near Portadown, where
British security forces for the past two years have prevented the
Protestant group from parading past a nearby Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers in armored personnel carriers blocked the
Orangemen's intended route -- a narrow country lane between the
church and Garvaghy Road -- and rows of riot police in helmets and
flame-retardant uniforms stood ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''This struggle goes on for as long as it takes,'' Portadown's
Orange leader, Harold Gracey, told the crowd from a podium in front
of the armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At midday a few dozen men, some of them members of outlawed
anti-Catholic gangs based in Portadown, scuffled with police and
threw stones.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic violence resumed after dark when a 150-strong group
fired ball bearings and firecrackers at police lines. An armored
personnel carrier, its tires smoldering, appeared to have been hit.
</P>
<P>
   A number of police officers reportedly suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a hard-line fraternal group founded near
Portadown in the 1790s, remains influential today, particularly
over its opposition to Northern Ireland's 2-year-old peace accord.
Tens of thousands of Orangemen march each July, often to celebrate
17th-century military victories over Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown march, which commemorates the losses suffered by
Protestants during World War I's Battle of the Somme, has
traditionally gone past the Catholics living on Portadown's
Garvaghy Road. The event has caused violence whether or not police
have permitted the Orangemen to parade: Police violently forced
anti-Orange protesters off the road in 1996 and 1997, provoking
riots in many Catholic areas, but have banned the parade route
since 1998, triggering Protestant disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the parade route blocked once again, Gracey said
he hoped to see hundreds of thousands of Protestants rally on
Northern Ireland's streets in the coming week to support their
demands. Gracey has maintained a 726-day vigil at the church to
protest the 1998 parade route ban, and he has refused to negotiate
directly with Catholic protest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While the Orange Order has emphasized that it doesn't sanction
bloodshed, past efforts by members of the Protestant majority to
pressure British authorities by blocking roads and mounting snap
protests have frequently turned violent. Orangemen backed off from
their standoff in 1998 only after three Catholic brothers were
burned to death in an arson attack. Last year's protests were
deliberately muted, sparking little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent response to Gracey's latest appeal, Protestants
blocked roads in north Belfast and a predominantly Protestant
village late Sunday, but no violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's demonstrations also attracted visible support from the
province's murderous anti-Catholic groups. Youths at the
confrontation line with soldiers draped the lead armored cars with
banners honoring two outlawed groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Loyalist Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
   Like the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which draws some
support from hard-line Catholic areas like the Garvaghy Road, the
illegal Protestant groups are supposed to be observing cease-fires.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Mexican Opposition Has Edge  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- National exit polls gave a clear edge to
opposition candidate Vicente Fox in historic presidential elections
Sunday that could bring an end to the ruling party's 71-year lock
on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory would be almost unthinkable for many in Mexico,
where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
almost synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself
-- to millions of supporters and detractors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, of the conservative National Action Party, held a lead of
between 6 and 9 percentage points over the PRI's Francisco
Labastida, according to five exit polls by Mexican news media and
U.S. polling companies.
</P>
<P>
   The official count was still fragmentary, with only 5 percent of
polling places reporting -- most of them in urban areas where Fox is
strongest. He led 49.6 percent to 31.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the exit polls were released, Fox said he would
wait for more official results before declaring victory and
assuring Mexicans there would be a calm transition if he won.
</P>
<P>
   ''From today forward, we need to unite. ... We have to work
together to make Mexico the great country we have all dreamed of,''
he said. He called Sunday a ''historic day for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   People began gathering beneath the gilded angel of Mexico City's
Independence Monument as the polls poured in, all favoring Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to do away with the bad governments, the
narco-politicians, dishonest people,'' said Miguel Morlet, a
60-year-old hotel administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, celebrating youths waved the blue and white National
Action flag while plastic trumpets blared amid chants of ''Yes you
could!'' for the rapidly gathering television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Televisa television network showed Fox with
44 percent and Labastida with 38 percent. Another poll by the rival
TV Azteca network gave Fox 38.8 percent to Labastida's 30.5
percent, and one by the Reforma newspaper group showed Fox with a
44 percent to 36 percent edge.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Chamber of the Radio and Television Industry
had Fox ahead 43-34 and a poll by two U.S. polling firms showed him
ahead 42-36. Leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a distant third in all
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The polls by Televisa and the U.S. firms had a margin of error
of one percentage point; Azteca's was 1.5 and the others didn't
give margins of error.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the first in more than a century in which the
outcome wasn't clear beforehand. Despite hundreds of allegations of
pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the ruling party --
the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that we make history today,'' said Rebeca Meza
Oliva, a 45-year-old housewife waiting in line to vote -- for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early in the morning, long lines formed at voting
booths, evidence of a heavy turnout. Frustrated voters clashed with
election workers in Mexico City when some booths for people casting
ballots outside their home districts ran out of absentee ballots
shortly after noon -- with hundreds still in line.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also appeared to have lost three key local races,
according to exit polls by the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed the leftist Democratic Revolution Party
holding onto Mexico City's mayorship with Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador well ahead of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In Morelos state, just south of the capital, the polls had
National Action capturing the governorship from the PRI, and they
had National Action holding Fox's home state of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   He promised more aid for the countryside, more resources for
public education and more attention to the poor. Labastida, a
former governor of Sinaloa state, was a top Cabinet secretary
before the campaign and said he would continue many of President
Ernesto Zedillo's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a veteran leftist leader, was in his third
presidential campaign. Many Mexicans believe he won the 1988
elections, only to be cheated out of a victory by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates were on the ballot, although one told his
supporters in the weeks before the election to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards and
opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Jose
Woldenberg, said in the early afternoon that problems were the
exception. He said his workers ''tell us we are experiencing
exemplary elections.''

<HEADLINE> Hanford Fire Crews Sent Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Workers at the Hanford nuclear
reservation were allowed to return Sunday, following a 191,000-acre
fire that disrupted thousands of lives and raised fears about
possible radiation releases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of firefighters drafted from around the
region had returned home, leaving a few local firefighters to
ensure hot spots would not flare up.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford managers, who had barred all but a few essential workers
from the site during the crisis, said Sunday that all employees
could return. On Monday, most of the site's 10,000 workers will
resume the task of cleaning up nuclear waste at Hanford, which
contains the nation's largest volume of such wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the return-to-work directive was issued, a team examined
all Hanford buildings to check for damage and ensure telephone
networks and power systems were operating, said Erik Olds, a U.S.
Department of Energy spokesman at Hanford. No major problems were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Air sampling conducted by the Energy Department and the state
Department of Health has indicated no radiation releases occurred
as a result of the fire. Further test results from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, started Tuesday by a fatal traffic accident, destroyed
20 homes and scores of other buildings just south of the Hanford
border. One man suffered serious burns.
</P>
<P>
   At the fire's peak late Wednesday, about 7,000 people were
evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Opposition Party Sees Chance  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- It has been a long, hard wait for Mexico's
largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing its activists ignored, jailed, or derided as
anti-patriotic for generations, the National Action Party on Sunday
was apparently on the verge of electoral triumph behind its
presidential candidate, Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   National Action -- known by its Spanish acronym PAN -- was founded
in 1939 under Manuel Gomez Morin, a leading Mexican intellectual
who opposed the big-government trends of the ruling party at that
era.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the party appealed to religious, middle-class
Mexicans frustrated by the single-party domination of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and to what were then
tough restrictions on the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling PRI of that era allowed other parties -- but not real
opposition. It used fraud and violence to crush foes at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   National Action was long associated in the popular mind with
Catholic lay groups -- stifling its development among other sectors
opposed to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Even this year, critics on the left accused it of of
''fascism,'' a reference to the conservative social views held by
many of its leaders and to a minor thread within the party that
dates back to the pro-fascist Sinarquista movement of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   But the PAN has always worked peacefully through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   And since the 1970s, it has increasingly become a party of
Mexico's growing urban middle classes and business sectors who were
less interested in the church than in a cleaner, smaller
government.
</P>
<P>
   The party's candidate this year, pragmatic businessman Vicente
Fox, has tried to broaden the party's base further, promising to
embrace even some leftist policies in efforts to make the party the
center of efforts to topple the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the late 1940s did National Action party manage to
elect its first few congressmen, after a legal battle. Not until
1952 did it bother even trying to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1961, it only ran for about half of the congressional
seats on offer. By the 1970s, it was winning more than 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alvarez, National Action's presidential candidate in 1958,
recalls seeing his campaign workers -- even himself -- jailed during
the campaign and some physically attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some hotels refused to give us a room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The party finished third in the crucial 1988 election. Many
thought the PRI stole the election from a leftist coalition headed
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking legitimacy, then-President Carlos Salinas forged a
tactical alliance with the PAN -- under Alvarez -- which pushed him
into a series of major political reforms that significantly opened
the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the PAN won its first governorship. On Sunday, it won
its sixth state governorship, in Morelos, and it is part of a
coalition in another. Entering Sunday, the PAN also governed eight
of Mexico's 10 largest cities.

Poll: Opposition Candidate Leads in Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Four national exit polls are giving an edge to opposition
candidate Vicente Fox in historic presidential elections today that could bring
an end to the ruling party's 71-year lock on the presidency. A Fox victory would
be almost unthinkable for many in Mexico, where the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is almost synonymous with the government -- and
even the nation itself -- to millions of supporters and detractors alike. One
poll showed Fox, of the conservative National Action Party, with 44 percent, the
PRI's Francisco Labastida with 38 percent and leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas with
16 percent of the vote.

Engineers Blame Terrace Structure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Engineers believe the deadly collapse of a
concrete terrace at a winery on a Lake Erie island was caused by a structural
problem, not an overload of people. One person was killed and at least 75 people
were injured at the Lonz Winery when the terrace floor gave way yesterday,
dropping victims and rubble 20 feet into an old wine cellar. Police kept boaters
300 feet from the island today as tourists tried to see the damage at the
lakefront terrace of the winery's century-old main building.

House Would Mull Suspending Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to
suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay
for highway construction, the House majority leader says. At any rate, Rep. Dick
Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem
of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas
delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on
oil imports, he said on ''Fox News Sunday.''

Schools Seek More Male Teachers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- At a time when recruiting qualified teachers is a
challenge for school districts nationwide, trying to find men to teach in
elementary school is proving to be particularly difficult. Across California,
for instance, just 14 percent of the roughly 159,000 public elementary school
teachers are men, equal to the national average. Educators say reasons vary for
the absence of male teachers in elementary grades. Among them: Men often find it
easier to relate to older students.

Mongolia Opposition Claims Victory

   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- The ex-communist opposition claimed a crushing

weekend parliamentary elections, even though official results were not yet in.
Such a victory for the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party would be a
stunning political reversal in the remote Asian nation, which dealt the former
communists an overwhelming defeat in 1996 elections. The party said it had
clinched 69 seats in the 76-member legislature.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- With just 30 seconds to go, Italy
was celebrating its first European Championship title in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   The party began a little too early
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Wiltord shocked Italy by tying the game 3&AMP;frac12; minutes into
injury time, and David Trezeguet scored the winner 13 minutes into
overtime to give the World Cup champions a 2-1 victory Sunday in
the final of the European Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thought we were dead,'' Thierry Henry said. ''With
the French team, it is never over. I was pretty annoyed the
Italians were already thinking of victory. They were clapping hands
and high-fiving. It was bothering me so, I was really happy when
the ball went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The win gave Les Bleus their first European title since 1984 and
made them the first World Cup champion to win the European
Championship. It continued a run of disappointment for the
Italians, who lost to France on penalty kicks in the 1998 World Cup
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a thing like this you won't forget for a lifetime,''
defender Alessandro Nesta said. ''Thirty seconds from the end and
it all goes up in air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Italians dropped to the ground in dismay and
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you feel victory is in your hands and it slips away, it
takes a lot out of your spirit,'' Italy coach Dino Zoff said. ''But
it was a great effort. I'm really sorry, but this is soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy went ahead in the 56th minute when Gianluca Pessotto
curled a low cross into the penalty area, and Marco Delvecchio
stabbed it into the upper part of the net. Delvecchio, playing just
his fifth international game, redirected the ball with the inside
of his left foot, and goalkeeper Fabien Barthez had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Azzurri could have opened up a bigger lead, but Alessandro
Del Piero missed two good scoring chances in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   When all seemed lost for the French, Wiltord finally found a
hole in the Italian defense, beating goalkeeper Francesco Toldo
with a low angled shot as injury time was coming to an end. It
followed a length-of-field kick by Barthez that defender Fabio
Cannivaro tried to clear, only to have the ball go straight to the
unmarked Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   The French pushed ever harder in overtime, and Robert Pires
broke on the left and passed low into the path of Trezeguet, who
volleyed high into the net from 10 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the willpower of the team that did it,'' France coach
Roger Lemerre said. ''The team wanted this trophy since the day it
won the World Cup. We said that, if there was a second left, we had
to go all out for it. The miracle happened and we caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Wiltord and Trezeguet started the game on the bench, with
Wiltord entering in the 58th minute for Christophe Dugarry and
Trezeguet in the 76th for Youri Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
   Zoff had been less than a a minute away from becoming the first
man to win the European Championship both as coach and player.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unexplainable,'' defender Gianluca Pessotto said. ''Maybe
this was the best game we played in the whole tournament, and it's
the only one we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero should have made it a 2-0 game in the 58th minute when
Francesco Totti's pass sent him clear. But with only Barthez to
beat, Del Piero rolled his shot wide of the far post.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero had another open shot in the 83rd minute, but Barthez
blocked it with a leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regret is to say little,'' Del Piero said. ''I feel guilty.''

<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Engineers believe the deadly
collapse of a concrete terrace at a winery on a Lake Erie island
was caused by a structural problem, not an overload of people.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed and at least 75 people were injured at the
Lonz Winery when the terrace floor gave way Saturday, dropping
victims and rubble 20 feet into an old wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Police kept boaters 300 feet from the island Sunday as tourists
tried to see the damage at the lakefront terrace of the winery's
century-old main building, a fortresslike mansion on the National
Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse left a 16- to 18-foot-wide hole in the floor of the
terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Structural engineers examined the concrete flooring and the
steel beams that supported it late Saturday, said Ottawa County
Sheriff Craig Emahiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked to (them) to be a structural problem,'' Emahiser
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the terrace was built in 1964 and he wasn't
sure when it was last inspected.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of thousand people at the winery Saturday,
but only 100 were on the 25-by-20-foot terrace, said Put-in-Bay
Police Chief Jim Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody was dancing in that area, the floor just gave out,''
said Fire Chief Mark Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Read of Milan, Mich., was playing piano while the crowd
sang along.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a gorgeous afternoon. Everybody was enjoying the day,''
Read said. ''It was extremely crowded, a typical holiday weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse he ran from the stage to the edge of the
terrace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked down in the hole and there were people just laying
down there,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews arrived within 10 minutes of getting the call,
said Wilhelm, and when they got there everybody had already been
pulled out by people in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winery and all of the customers did everything they could
to help those suffering,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Neagle, 50, of Chicago, said there were four or five doctors
on the island who showed up right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody came together, it was pretty amazing,'' Neagle said.
''Thank God there were those doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who helped pull people from the rubble were
Cleveland Browns offensive lineman Steve Zahursky and New York
Giants receiver Joe Jurevicius.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got pretty chaotic. I carried out maybe 14-15 people out of
there,'' Zahursky said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the most seriously injured were flown to St. Vincent
Medical Center in Toledo. As of Sunday night, five were in stable
condition, two were in serious condition and one was serious but
stable, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead man was identified as Mark Reighard, 29, of Columbus,
said Mike Drusbacky of the Ottawa County Emergency Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The winery sits on about 120 acres on Middle Bass Island, which
lies about 6 miles from the mainland and north of Sandusky. Only
about 40 people live on the island but as many as 1,500 visitors
stay during busy summer weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was famous as a winery in the 19th century, grapes
haven't been grown there for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The state is buying the site for $6.75 million for a park.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks for Help with Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAN MAE LA, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand has asked the international
community to hold talks on repatriating more than 100,000 refugees
who have fled military rule in neighboring Myanmar, reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The call was made on Sunday as Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
toured the largest refugee camp along the Myanmar-Thai border,
accompanied by senior Thai officials and U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees representative Jahanshah Assadi.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights groups have criticized Thailand for deporting
some of the refugees to Myanmar, also known as Burma, where human
rights abuses have been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuan told reporters that the refugees would be allowed to
remain on Thai soil as long as the situation remained unsafe for
them in Myanmar. However, he said migrant workers would be
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the Thai government said it intended to send back all
refugees within three years, but Chuan said ''maybe it will take
more time, three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuan called for more help, particularly from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, in pressing for negotiations with
Myanmar on returning the refugees, who come mostly from the
country's minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Their temporary refuge on Thai soil is a burden on civilians and
military, and is at the expense of the environment and security, he
said, as he met with some of the camp's nearly 31,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch has over the past two
months denounced the Thai government for forcibly repatriating more
than 100 Karen refugees and urged it to provide more protection for
those remaining on its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand toughened its policy after a raid on the Myanmar
embassy in Bangkok last October by student radicals opposed to the
Myanmar regime, and a hostage-taking in January by the rebel God's
Army.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Edgar Martinez hit a two-run homer and
Mike Cameron added a two-run single in a seven-run seventh inning
as the Seattle Mariners beat the Texas Rangers 11-4 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-1, the Mariners loaded the bases with none out in the
seventh against Matt Perisho (2-2) on John Olerud's double, a walk
to Jay Buhner and David Bell's single.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Stan Javier's grounder off reliever Tim Crabtree
nearly resulted in a double play, but Javier barely beat shortstop
Scott Sheldon's relay to first as Olerud scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore grounded to third, but rookie Mike Lamb threw the
ball wildly to second for an error, allowing Buhner to score the
go-ahead run. McLemore was credited with an RBI on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's two-run single, Alex Rodriguez's RBI single and
Martinez's two-run blast, all against Crabtree, stretched Seattle's
lead to 8-2 in support of starter Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the seven seventh-inning runs were unearned due to
Lamb's error.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's 15th homer, a three-run shot in the eighth off rookie
Doug Davis, capped the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (10-3) allowed two runs and six hits over seven innings to
improve to 8-1 in his last 10 starts. He struck out five and didn't
issue a walk.

	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A mother going to pick up her sons from
a visit with their father Sunday discovered that her estranged
husband had killed them and then turned the gun on himself,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City police confirmed that the father and the boys, ages
5 and 7, died of gunshot wounds to the head. Authorities did not
release a motive or the type of weapon used.
</P>
<P>
   An official reached at the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office
Sunday night would only say the incident is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the victims were Oscar Aquieles and his sons,
Oscar, 7, and Brian, 5. A neighbor said the mother, Victoria
Espalliat, forced the door of Aquieles' apartment open after no one
answered.

   ''The next thing I heard was all kinds of screaming and
crying,'' neighbor Daisy Pickett told the Star-Ledger of Newark.
''She just kept saying, 'My babies, my babies.'''
