<HEADLINE> Global Issues Must Garner International Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre Moussa said here Friday that global security issues
must garner a consensus among the international community and
concepts that go far beyond the established norms of international
relations cannot remain unchecked as they directly affect the
political and security environment of all regions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the circulation of new and undefined concepts
such as "humanitarian intervention", "preventive diplomacy" and
the role of the United Nations, Moussa said that "Such matters
cannot remain unchecked" and "must be discussed and defined with
the involvement of all member states, large and small, rich and
poor alike."
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Singapore's Distinguished Public Lecture,
organized by the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies of the
Nanyang Technology University, Singapore, he criticized the claims
that the world is heading towards a "clash of civilizations" as "
flawed and dangerous. "It stems from the false assumption that the
'pillar and principles' of globalization must be based on the
prevalence of the value system of one single and dominant
civilization experience: that of the West."
</P>
<P>
"It supposes that the adoption of the western model of economic
development by necessity entails the adoption of other western
values," he added, underlining that "This is an approach that
bears the seeds of intolerance and suspicion and promotes conflict
and confrontation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that globalization may result in widening further the
existing economic gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" and
even exacerbating it, by a technological gap between the "knows"
and the "know-nots."
</P>
<P>
On the peace process in the Middle East, he said it has arrived
at the eleven hour, saying "what is needed to make the historical
reconciliation can no longer be delayed, ignored or circumvented."
</P>
<P>
He said the clear and unavoidable formula is full withdrawal
from the occupied Arab territory and the establishment of a viable
Palestinian state in exchange for Israel's right to full
integration as a partner in the region enjoying all the equal
rights of security and peace.
</P>
<P>
"Unreturned Arab territory or any cardinal issue that remains
unresolved will be a dormant regional time bomb...capable of
exploding at any moment in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the world community to find a way to
urgently lift the economic sanctions that are imposed upon the
people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot debate and consider measures for intervention in
order to avoid possible humanitarian crises...while a humanitarian
disaster is already in the making," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived here this morning for a three-day visit -- his
first official visit to Singapore. During his stay in the city
state he will meet with his Singapore counterpart S. Jayakumar and
call on Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.

He taught at the Journalism Department of Cairo University's Arts
Faculty.
</P>
<P>
He also worked at MENA for several years until 1965 after he was

<HEADLINE> Iraq Appreciates FAO Efforts to Alleviate Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq appreciates efforts made by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to alleviate
the plight of the Iraqi people, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the remarks while meeting the visiting FAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf, who arrived in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan also criticized the U.S. and British representatives at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee for putting on hold contracts Iraq
signed with other countries to import food, medicine and other
humanitarian necessities within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-
food program, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the FAO director-general promised that his
organization will continue to make efforts to better implement the
U.N. oil-for-food deal, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf also met on Saturday with Iraqi Agriculture Minister Abdul
Ellan Hameed and Irrigation Minister Mahmoud Diyab Al-Ahmad, the
INA said.
</P>
<P>
However, the INA report did not say whether they talked about
the killing of FAO staffers in Baghdad Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, burst into the
FAO office building in central Baghdad early Wednesday morning,
shot and killed two FAO staffers and wounded several others.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Baghdad, Diouf told reporters that he would meet
Iraqi officials to get acquainted with Wednesday's incident.
</P>
<P>
"What happened was a mistake. The criminal (Fuad Haidar) did not
have the intention to kill anybody, but the exchange of fire caused
the casualties," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf has made no hints that the tragic incident will affect the
work of the FAO in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The FAO office in Iraq is mainly in charge of the implementation
of the U.N. oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amount of oil to buy daily necessities to offset the crippling
impacts of the U.N. sanctions in place since Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Bashar Meets Iraqi Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Syria's anointed new leader Bashar
al-Assad received visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-
Sahaf and his party on Saturday afternoon, the Syrian Arab News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral relations as well as the
situation in the Arab world and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Bashar, leader of Syria's ruling Baath
Arab Socialist Party and its presidential candidate, discussed with
al-Sahaf means of boosting bilateral ties as Syria was keen to play
an express role in lifting the United Nations sanctions on Iraq in
place since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Damascus said the visit is very important
as it might signal a normalization of Syrian-Iraqi diplomatic
relation, which was severed in 1980 due to Syria's support to Iran
in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Syria also took part in the multi-national troops that drove
Iraq out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries started to improve in 1997
with the opening of joint borders for trade and mutual visits. The
two countries also signed an agreement in 1998 for repairing oil
pipelines from Karkok Oil fields in northern Iraq to Syria's Banias
Port overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent Vice President Taha Mohyiddin Marouf to Damascus last
month to attend the funeral of late Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad, who died on June 10 at the age of 69. Marouf was the first
senior Iraqi official to visit Syria in two decades.

<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher State Security
Prosecution on Saturday arrested Saad Eddin Ibrahim, director of
Ibn Khaldoun Center for Human Rights, and remanded him for 15 days
in custody pending interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim was accused of collecting funds without prior permission
from the authorities and taking money from foreign sources to draft
reports on the internal situation in Egypt and produce a film
tarnishing the country's image, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also charged him with exploiting the Ibn Khaldoun
Center at the American University in Cairo to get into contact with
a number of countries and to foment internal problems that could
threaten Egypt's stability, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The professor, a United States citizen, was accused of obtaining
several million Egyptian pounds from foreign parties on the pretext
of conducting research work in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He could be sentenced to 15 years in prison if convicted,
prosecutors were quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Reveals NHS Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Decisions on hospital closures and
bed reductions in Britain are to be taken by an independent panel
and NHS (National Health Service) managers.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted Health Secretary Alan Milburn Saturday as saying "
the change would be included in next month's National Plan for the
NHS."
</P>
<P>
Milburn told the annual conference of the NHS Confederation in
Glasgow the aim of the change is to give those who used and worked
in the NHS more power to decide what facilities should be
available within the service.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the National Plan will propose a"traffic
light" system of ratings for NHS organizations. Each Organization
will be rated green, amber or red.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, high performing green-rated units will
be given extra resources, and greater autonomy over how they are
spent.
</P>
<P>
Red-rated failing units will be given expert advice and support
to help them improve - and if necessary "hit squads" will be sent
in to impose change.
</P>
<P>
Milburn also announced a six-month maximum waiting time from
referral to surgery for cataract patients in 60 areas of the
country, saying "We need shorter waiting times not just for
certain conditions but for all conditions".
</P>
<P>
A guaranteed maximum wait of 18 months for hospital treatment
was no longer acceptable, and efforts must now focus on cutting
waiting times, especially for cancer and heart disease patients,
he said.

Press reports from Tegucigalpa received in Mexico City said
that the IMF decision is part of a project for Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
Honduran Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez said that the IMF
governing board made official its approval to reduce the payment
of her country's foreign debt service Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
She said that the World Bank will decide next week the amount

percent of the payments the Central American country must make to
the organization.
</P>

The minister said that the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB),
the main multilateral Honduras creditor will also approve the
reduction of 50 percent of the service of the debt for an eight-
year term.
</P>

Nunez said that all these supports help maintain the Honduran
economy afloat and reduce poverty.

<HEADLINE> Mauritian Prime Minister Calls on Africa to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mauritian Prime Minister
Navichandra Ramgoolam Saturday called on African countries to
unite and mobilize resources for the common good of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Zambia International Trade Fair in Ndola, capital
of Copperbelt Province, the prime minister said what Africa needed
was stability, peace and unity of purpose.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said in order to break out of the vicious cycle of
poverty, conflicts and hopelessness that had besieged the
continent, Africans needed to put aside pride and prejudices and
resolve differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said much as it was the duty of Africans to resolve its own
conflicts and problems and that the international community should
commit itself anew to bringing peace to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said the growth of the developing countries in Africa
was centered on peace on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 33 out of 48 developing countries in the world were
from Africa, he said Africa was currently only contributing about
1 percent to global investment and about 2 percent towards
international trade.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramgoolam said that there was a resurgence of hope as
countries in Africa began to cooperate through regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he praised Zambia for its major role in fighting
the abominable racist regime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's involvement in the liberation of other countries meant
 sacrifice and courage by Zambians, Ramgoolam said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia, through the able chairmanship of President
Frederick Chiluba, was still making frantic efforts to bring peace
to the Great Lakes region and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said he was pleased to note that Mauritius and Zambia
had shared the same hopes and aspirations and bilateral relations
had continued to grow since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba expressed the hope that the hosting of this
year's trade fair would result in new investment and trade
opportunities among Zambia, Mauritius and the regional markets of
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia was one of the most liberal economies in
the world.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the liberalization policies of the government,
he said Zambia would be among countries of the COMESA region that
would facilitate zero tariff entry for all imports from COMESA by
October 31 this year when the COMESA free trade is operational.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government was also studying the draft agreement on
the promotion and protection of investment recently submitted by
Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The draft will likely be concluded at the inaugural session of
the Mauritius-Zambia joint Permanent Commission on cooperation set
for October this year in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he was optimistic that bilateral cooperation
between Zambia and Mauritius would continue to grow following the
signing of the general agreement of economic, technical and
scientific cooperation in Mauritius on May 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was in the process of ratifying this agreement which
offers additional development possibilities between the two
countries in all areas of cooperation and socio-economic activity,
he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African UDM to Contest Local Govt Elections on Own Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Democratic Movement
(UDM) of South Africa would not affiliate itself to other
opposition parties to contest the local government elections in
November, the party's leader Bantu Holomisa said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The position of our national conference in 1998 was that we
should go it alone in all elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the UDM National Council meeting in the Free State,
Holomisa expressed the confidence that his party would be able to
secure a substantial number of votes.
</P>
<P>
"The breakdown of our demographics suggests that we stand a
good chance to target both rural and urban communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa's affirmation that the UDM would not align itself with
another opposition party came in light of this week's merger of
the New Nationalist Party (NNP) and the Democratic Party (DP).
</P>
<P>
The NNP and DP announced that they would contest the local
government elections under the banner of the Democratic Alliance
to present the government with a formidable opposition.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raises Oil Output in Line With OPEC Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh said here Saturday that Iran has decided to raise its
crude oil output by 104,000 barrels per day as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Iran is raising its quota based on the agreement reached by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on June 21,
Zanganeh was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the output rise would lead to the increase of oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of 10 OPEC members agreed in Vienna on June 21 to
boost their output quota by 3 percent, or 708,000 barrels, a day as
of July 1. It was the second time in three months that the
organization voted to raise its quota in an effort to bring down
the soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
With the new output rise, OPEC's official quota, not including
Iraq, is now about 25.4 million barrels a day. The cartel pumps
about 35 percent of the world's oil.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second biggest producer after Saudi Arabia in the
OPEC, with a quota of some 3.6 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
With the new production increase, many believe that the country
is approaching its reported output capacity of about 4 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
But Iran insists that it has enough potential and production
capacity to meet any new quota allocation.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Declare Independent State This Year Despite Foreign Pressure: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Council Selim Zanoun said Saturday the independent Palestinian
state will be declared this year according to the international
resolutions in spite of foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun told reporters at the council headquarters on the eve of
the inauguration of the Palestinian Central Council meetings in
Gaza on Sunday on the issue of the Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian state will be verified shortly, and the
international community will support the cause, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that there still exists international
pressure to delay the declaration of the state.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the Israeli threats to retaliate if the Palestinian
state is declared unilaterally, Zanoun said the Oslo Agreement does
not require consultation with Israel over this topic, but the
Palestinian people are always eager to verify the state with
Israel's approval.
</P>
<P>
However, if Israel insists on its procrastination, The
Palestinians have to embody the state, he noted, adding,"We will
seek international legitimacy for preserving our security and
protecting us from any Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. stance on the declaration of the
Palestinian state, Zanoun expressed hope that the U.S.
administration would recognize the Palestinian state as this
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has not yet officially notified the
Palestinian side of its position on the unilateral declaration of
the Palestinian independent state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States said last year that the declaration of the
Palestinian state should be made with Israel's approval.
</P>
<P>
As to the agenda of the Central Council meetings, Zanoun said
the attendees would mull over the practical preparations for
declaring the state.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Issues Prison-Term Verdict on Jewish Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's revolutionary court on
Saturday issued the final verdict for 13 Jews and four Muslims who
had been accused of spying for Israel, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Hussein Ali Amiri, head of judiciary of the
southern Fars Province, 10 Jews and two Muslims in the case were
sentenced to different prison terms, while the other five were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Asher Zadmehr and Hamid Tefeleen, two main Jewish defendants,
were each sentenced to 13-year terms on charges of forming illegal
group and espionage network and collaborating with Israeli security
service in gathering classified information.
</P>
<P>
The other eight Jews were sentenced to prison terms varying from
four years to 11 years. Two Muslims were sentenced to two-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
The official said that three Jews and two Muslims were acquitted
due to insufficient evidence and documents pertaining to the
charges brought against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
on Saturday welcomed the conclusion of the spy case, which had
drawn international concern.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews along with the four Muslims were arrested one year
ago in Shiraz, capital of Fars Province. Court hearings for them
started in the southern city on April 13.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and trial of the Iranian Jews sparked protests from
Israel and Western countries who feared that the Jews would be
given the death penalty and demanded that Iran release them. But
Iran insists that the case has nothing to do with religious beliefs
and no foreign country should interfere in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a Jewish community of about 25,000 people, the largest
in the Middle East outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Special Session on Social Development Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The week-long special session on
social development of the United Nations General Assembly ended
here Sunday with GA President Theo-Ben Gurirab describing it as a
success.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot go backwards. We must move forward in earnest and
meet the time-bound targets that were set in Copenhagen to make
this a better world for all," said Gurirab, who was also elected
as the president of the special session on June 26 when the
session began in the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The special session marks the fifth anniversary of the 1995
World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The Copenhagen summit decidedly promoted the social development
agenda as an international and national priority.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing developments since Copenhagen, countries agreed
that progress in reducing poverty and unemployment had not
materialized,and that countries were still far from reaching
internationally set goals on health and education.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 160 UN member countries at the session
reached consensus on many topics relating to social development,
including the agreement on a target of 2015 to reduce the
proportion of people living in extreme poverty by a half, the
adoption of a global employment strategy and a global campaign
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
In assessing the overall impact of the special session, Nitin
Desai,UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs,
drew attention to the greatly strengthened framework of
cooperation for poverty eradication, the clearer connection
between globalization and its social impact, and the focus on the
HIV/AIDS pandemic.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on EU to Help Relaunch Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
Saturday called on European Union (EU) to play an effective and
big role in helping relaunch the Middle East peace process, which
he said is at a dangerous and difficult turning point.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the appeal after a meeting with French President
Jacques Chirac at the Elysee presidential palace here.
</P>
<P>
According to French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna,
Arafat expressed his concern about the perspective of the peace
process during his meeting with Chirac, whose country took over
the rotating presidency of EU on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president listed a series of barriers in the
peace process, including Israel's delay in implementing its
agreement with Palestinians over withdrawal of troops from West
Bank, and the continuation of illegal construction of Jewish
settlement on Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed the commitment of EU to the principles which
serve as the basis for the peace process, including the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 242 which calls for the
pullout of Israeli troops from all Arab territories it occupied in
1967, according to Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Israel has delayed the carrying out of a third phase of pullout
from the West Bank scheduled for June 23 and Israeli leaders have
hardened their position recently over Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also threatened to crack down any demonstration by
Palestinians after June 23 and to foil the Palestinian plan to
declare independence in September.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The people of Uganda were able to
vote peacefully and free from intimidation in the referendum held
on June 29 to determine the country's political system, said Canon
Grace Kaiso, national co-ordinator of Non-government-organization
Monitoring Cluster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Saturday, Kaiso said: "The
NGO observers were generally satisfied with the conduct of the
voting, and the people were free to vote for their chosen
political system, the Multiparty System or the Movement System,
in the referendum throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
The monitoring cluster of the Referendum 2000 NGO Consortium
has monitored the referendum for the last five months. On the
polling day, they deployed 7,213 observers throughout the country
who witnessed voting in 10, 115 of the 16,500 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement by Donor Referendum 2000 Group said,
"The voting itself appeared to be conducted in a peaceful and
orderly fashion."
</P>
<P>
"The Group has, however, concluded that the referendum campaign
as a whole was not conducted on a level playing field," it said.
</P>
<P>
Resources available to the ruling Movement were substantially
larger than those available to pro-multiparty advocates, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Observers from 15 countries and regional organizations
monitored the polling exercise.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Claim over 60 Lives in Ethiopia in One Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two heavy traffic accidents
occurred successively this week, killing 64 people and injuring a
dozen of others, mass media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty people were killed Thursday when the bus with 66 people
on board was swept away by floods in the vicinity of Nazareth,
about 100 kilometers south of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when the bus was in the middle of a
bridge over a river called Mer Merssa, located between the towns
of Welenchiti and Nazareth, witnesses were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A heavy downpour on that day morning resulted in the swelling
of the river and the submersion of the bridge. The driver of the
bus was trying to imitate a heavy-duty truck driver who managed to
cross the inundated bridge, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ill-fated bus gave in to the currents of the
flood, and fell on the main course of the river. The vehicle
drifted for more than two kilometers, police said.
</P>
<P>
Seven survivors were initially reported, but one of them died
later while undergoing medication, Radio Ethiopia said.
</P>
<P>
Just one day after the accident, four people were killed and
nine others injured when a truck collided with a passenger bus in
Jimma town, about 250 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
All of the killed were passengers of the bus, police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police Saturday said they
had arrested more than 50 people in connection with post-election
violence around the country since last weekend's parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
This prompted them to issue a warning that people who engage in
 such violence would meet the full wrath of the law irrespective
of their political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner Griffiths Mpofu told reporters:
"Police would like to warn that those people who are caught on
the wrong side of the law will be severely dealt with. Political
parties should also encourage their supporters to desist from
political violence."
</P>
<P>
He said the police were on firm ground to deal with any
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who are bent on carrying out the
pre-election excitement to the post-election period," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this week suspected supporters of the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) were alleged to have barred market
supplies at Mbare Msika, accusing the farmers from rural areas of
betrayal since the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) won most of its seats in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the tightly contested parliamentary election, Zanu-pf won by
a majority of 62 of the 120 seats followed by MDC with 57 seats
and then Zanu (Ndonga) with one seat.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 people were killed in political violence
countrywide in the run-up to the election.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Court Ends Trial of Bin Laden Followers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese military court on Friday
night concluded the trial of 29 alleged followers of Saudi-expelled
billionaire terrorist Osama bin Laden on charges of planning
attacks on U.S. and Israeli targets in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Two of the accused were sentenced to five years in jail and the
others, including Lebanese, Egyptian and Syrian defendants, were
given jail terms of one year or less. Some were tried in absentia,
including an Egyptian who was sentence for life.
</P>
<P>
According to the list of charges, the accused had planned to
carry out attacks on orders from bin Laden. "They formed a group
aimed at committing crimes against people, trying to carry out
terrorist acts, forging passports and using them, counterfeiting
foreign currencies and transferring weapons and ammunition without
licenses," it said.
</P>
<P>
The trial in Beirut coincided with court proceedings in Jordan,
where 28 suspects are being tried on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden is on the list of the most wanted by the United
States, which accused him of masterminding the 1998 bombing of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa, killing more than 200 people.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows How Red Wine Fights Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers have revealed
the mechanism of how an antioxidant found in red wine and grapes
fights cancer.
</P>
<P>
The compound resveratrol, which acts like antibiotic to protect
grapes from fungus, may turn off a protein that enables cancer
cells to survive even chemotherapy, said the researchers with
University of North Carolina Medical School.
</P>
<P>
Experiments showed that when the protein was blocked in mice,
the cancer cells were eradicated by the chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The findings were published in the July issue of Cancer
Research.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit is that it certainly provides an open door for
potential therapies," said Minnie Holmes-McNary, the study's lead
author. That may include taking a pill similar to vitamin
supplement.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a University of Illinois researcher reported
resveratrol's link to red wine and fighting cancer. Resveratrol
also blocked cell inflammation, which is linked to arthritis and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Resveratrol exists in dozens of foods, including mulberries and
peanuts. All wines have some resveratrol but red wine seems to be
its richest source.

BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania, in an effort to deny
media reports on alleged contacts with Taiwan, said Saturday that
it does not intend to enter into official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Romanian state institutions neither keep contacts nor engage
in any talks with the Taipei authorities," Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Ireny Comaroschi said in a statement released to the
press.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some international news agencies reported that a

is secretly negotiating the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Taiwan," speculating that "Romania would be among the three
southeast European states ... that show special interest in Taiwan.
"
</P>
<P>
"The Romanian Foreign Ministry pointed to the absurd and
totally untrue nature of this piece of information and recalls its
official stand: Romania recognizes the existence of only one China
-- the People's Republic of China -- and considers that the
Beijing administration is the only legitimate government of the
whole country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory, with the
dispute between Beijing and Taipei being a domestic matter," it
said.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf Saturday ruled out instituting a treason case against
ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his statement about last
summer's Kargil conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Nawaz Sharif will not be tried on sedition charges for his
statement on the Kargil issue. If the matter is taken to the
court, many national secrets will be exposed," Musharraf said in a
press talk after inaugurating a highway project in Balochistan
province.
</P>
<P>
"It is surprising how Nawaz Sharif talked about this issue. I
will neither respond to these statements nor will we institute any
case against him as it will affect the national security," the
chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, in a speech last month, said he was kept in dark about
the Kargil operation which had led to the one-month long fighting
between Pakistan and India along the Line of Control in the
disputed area of Kashmir last summer.
</P>
<P>
The then prime minister demanded formation of a high-powered
commission to probe into the episode.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, a Pakistani citizen named Arif Noor filed a
petition to the Lahore High Court seeking registration of treason
case of Sharf for "leaking state secrets" to the public. However,
the petition has not yet been accepted by the court.

Sharif has been sentenced to life imprisonment in a hijacking
case and is being tried in a corruption case. (Pakistan-Sharif)

GUANGZHOU -- The death toll from an explosion at a fireworks
factory Friday morning in Jiangmen, south China's Guangdong
Province, has risen to 36, and 160 others have been reported
injured, according to latest reports.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people are still missing following the blast,
which investigators believe may have occurred when sparks produced
by employees pounding iron nails ignited inside the warehouse
building, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion at 8:05 am Friday at the fireworks factory built
in 1992 by Jiangmen Local Product Export Company leveled the 3,200-
sq-m factory, and blew off roofs, shattered windows and collapsed
walls of buildings up to one kilometer away, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured were wounded by flying debris, according to
doctors in local hospitals. (China-Fireworks Explosion-Toll)

Majlis (parliament) held in Tehran constituency on Friday, it was
announced here on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has asked the World Bank (WB)
to increase the technical assistances provided by the WB to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The WB is currently financing many projects in Jordan, including
reforming of the public sector, privatization, anti-poverty, and
supporting the private sector, particularly in tourism and in the
export-oriented sectors.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman's Magid Elfatim company said it plans to build a
commercial, tourist and recreational complex in the country at a
cost of over 30 million Omani rials (79 million U.S. dollars),
covering an area of 150,000 square meters. The work in this complex
will be completed within 15 months starting August.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to expand its operations in Egypt, Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The volume of Japan's exports to the United Arab
Emirates in 1999 witnessed an 11.6-percent decline from 2.85
billion U.S. dollars in 1998 to 2.52 billion dollars, according to
statistics released by the Dubai-based Japan External Trade
Organization (Jetro).
</P>
<P>
Electrical machinery, transport equipment and textiles were the
major categories that suffered a decline in Japanese exports to the
UAE last year.
</P>
<P>
"This decline can be attributed to market sluggishness that
prevailed in the re-export markets of the UAE due to a general
slump in the price of crude oil during the preceding years," a
newsletter of Jetro said.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus and Sri Lanka Friday signed a cooperation
agreement in the shipping field.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for cooperation in employment issues, the
improvement of sailors' working and living conditions and the
acceptance of certificates issued by each country.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for cooperation in the case of nautical
accidents.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two reformists, Elias Hazrati and Ali
Akbar Mohtashamipur, won the runoff election for the sixth Iranian
Majlis (parliament) held in Tehran constituency on Friday, it was
announced here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates, Ali Akbar Rahmani and Rasul

<P>
Two seats in the constituency, the political center of the

Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
But the senior politician, believed to be a member of the
conservative establishment, has refused to take his seat in the
parliament and his substitute is to be elected through a by-
election.
</P>
<P>
Friday's election in Tehran actually could not change the new
political balance in the new parliament, which has managed to start
work on May 27 after overcoming all kinds of obstacles set up by
the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Reformers supporting President Mohammad Khatami control some 80
percent of the seats in the new parliament. The reformist victory
in February's election was seen as a great push to the country's
reformist movement growing since Khatami took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of the seats in the new parliament are still
vacant due to the cancellation of partial election results by the
Guardians Council, which is among one of the many major state
organs still in the hands of the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> No Trace of Missing Indonesian Ferry Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of finding a missing
Indonesian ferry were dashed Saturday after sighting of the ship
turned out to be false, according to the Antara News Agency
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Antara quoted Indonesian Director of Sea
Transportation Tjuk Suhardiman as saying that the ferry ran
aground on an island about 80 mile off the northern coast of North
Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
But a fly-over by the Indonesian Navy turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
"We spotted a ship from the air, but it wasn't the missing
ferry," Commander Djoko Sudarman, head of the search and rescue
operation, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Cahaya Bahari, left Tobelo on Halmahera in North
Maluku province on Wednesday en route to Manado, capital of North
Sulawesi. Radio contact with the vessel was lost after its captain
M.M. Paparaga radioed an "SOS" advising that the ship was taking
water in fast during a violent storm at noon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But rescuers were puzzled that they have found no debris or
other signs of a sinking.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted some sources as saying that the ferry had been
taken hostage in Morotai island in North Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's SCTV television channel correspondent reported from
Manado that the navy and rescue team would fly to Morotai to check
the report.
</P>
<P>
There is conflicting data about the total number of passengers
on board as the Cahaya Bahari was licensed to carry only 270
people. The National Search and Rescue Agency claimed that at
least 492 passengers, refugees from Maluku and crew may have been
aboard.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Scholars Demand Fair Resolution of "Hanaoka Incident" Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scholars and activists from
civic groups attending a symposium in Odate, Akita Prefecture in
northeastern Japan, urged Saturday the Japanese judicial
authorities to bring about a justice end to the lawsuit relating
to the "Hanaoka Incident."
</P>
<P>
The symposium was held at the Labor and Welfare Hall in Odate
city as part of a series events marking Friday's 55th anniversary
of the "Hanaoka Incident" in which some 130 forced Chinese
laborers in Japan were slaughtered during an uprising at the end
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japanese scholars and lawyers who have consistently supported
surviors of the Chinese laborers' bid to seek fairness from
competent Japanese authorities, such as Shigeyuki Kawada, Hiroshi
Tanaka, Takashi Nimi and Shuichi Adachi, delivered speeches at the
symposium, disclosing some historical facts on Japan's past
aggressive war against China and briefing on the current
development of the "Hanaoka Incident" lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the Tokyo High Court to speed up efforts to
resolve the lawsuit which demands apology and compensation for
Chinese surviors and relatives of the victims in the incident.
</P>
<P>
On June 30 1945, more than 700 Chinese laborers forcibly
brought to Hanaoka town by Japanese aggressor troops in China,
angered at the hard labor, launched an uprising. The upring was
later suppressed by Japanese military police and more than 130
laborers were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
On June 28, 1995, 11 surviors and relatives of the victims in
the "Hanaoka Incident" filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District
Court, demanding the court to fairly resolve issues such as
compensation pending between Chinese surviors and Japan's
construction firm Kajima, which used the Chinese laborers at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo High Court put forward a "reconciliation advice" to
both sides in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some 200 people, including officials from the
Chinese Embassy in Japan, Odate municipal government officials and
representatives of local civic groups, attended a ceremony held in
Hanaoka town to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the "Hanaoka
Incident."

<HEADLINE> 36 Killed, 160 Injured in Fireworks Explosion in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from an explosion
at a fireworks factory Friday morning in Jiangmen, south China's
Guangdong Province, has risen to 36, and 160 others have been
reported injured, according to latest reports.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people are still missing following the blast,
which investigators believe may have occurred when sparks produced
by employees pounding iron nails ignited inside the warehouse
building, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion at 8:05 am Friday at the fireworks factory built
in 1992 by Jiangmen Local Product Export Company leveled the 3,200-
sq-m factory, and blew off roofs, shattered windows and collapsed
walls of buildings up to one kilometer away, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured were wounded by flying debris, according to
doctors in local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The factory, leased in December 1993 to be run by the Hong Kong
Overseas Oriental Fireworks Company, has reported several fires in
its short history. On April 4, local fire departments urged the
factory to improve its fire-fighting and alarm systems and to
strengthen management, but the order was ignored.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, provincial leaders including Governor Lu
Ruihua rushed to the scene to oversee rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
An emergency meeting was held today by the Guangdong provincial
government to order all fireworks factories and manufacturers of
cigarette lighters in the province to suspend production.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa to Strengthen Capacity Building for Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- African countries have determined to
further strengthen capacity building for sustainable development
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended "Regional Workshop for National Focal Points
on Capacity-Building Coordination in Africa" held in Lusaka,
participants from 14 African countries noted that a country cannot
hope to make much progress toward sustainable development and
poverty reduction unless it has the requisite human and
institutional capacity to effectively design, implement and manage
its development policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
There is consensus among African leaders, leading scholars,
academics and donors that capacity building is Africa's most
urgent challenge and the cornerstone of its development strategy.
</P>
<P>
National development capacity refers to a nation's collective
capacity to design and implement all of its development programs
so as to uplift the quality of life of its citizens. Capacity
building entails both human skills enhancement and institution
strengthening.
</P>
<P>
According to a report presented to the workshop, the linkage
between capacity building and sustainable development has been
amply illustrated by the outstanding records of the fast growing
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, several of these countries had the same per
capita incomes as some Africa countries but these countries are
now much more developed with per capita incomes 25 times those of
African countries.
</P>
<P>
These countries lack natural resources and also faced
discrimination against their exports to the West. These countries
invested heavily in all levels of education and other social
services. They also determinedly shared the fruits of growth, thus
reducing inequality.
</P>
<P>
Also, in the 1960s to 1970s, most African countries invested
heavily in all levels of education, health and physical
infrastructure. Some African universities were renowned the world
over, as centers of excellence in both teaching and research.
Significant inroads were made in building government's capacity to
manage the nation's development.
</P>
<P>
However, by the 1980s, most governments were experiencing
serious economic crises and reduced their investments in
education, health and physical infrastructure. As the 21st
century begins, Africa is lagging behind of other regions in
socio-economic development. Africa has many of the world's poorest
countries, with per capita income lower than before independence.
About 50 percent of Africa's people are classified as poor and 30
percent as extremely poor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most African countries have inadequate or collapsing
infrastructure, environmental degradation, high unemployment,
growing maldistribution of available incomes, assets and services.
Both the universities and the civil service continue to suffer
from massive brain drain, estimated at 23,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
The situation is a result of both internal and external
factors. These factors have reduced the capacity of African
countries to invest sufficiently and sustainable in human and
institutional capacity building.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of many countries is being further eroded by armed
conflicts which according to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), claimed two million lives in the last five
years. In addition, there are massive flows of refugees and
displaced persons currently estimated at 12 million, over 40
percent of the world's refugee population.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS pandemic that is decimating the population of some
African countries, threatens to reverse the gains made cross the
spectrum of socio-economic development. In the most affected
countries, the disease is taking upward of 25 percent of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Standing at the crossroad of renewal and transformation in this
new millennium, African countries are sharing a common awareness
that without the requisite capacity, countries cannot take
advantage of globalization and world technological advances, both
of which require educated work forces and new organizational and
administrative systems.
</P>
<P>
Established in November 1991, the African Capacity Building
Foundation (ACBF)'s initial mandate was to play a leading role in
the strengthening of skills to formulate and implement
macroeconomic policies through research, training and
institutional development.
</P>
<P>
The foundation's interventions over the past nine years have
provided African countries an opportunity to rethink their
dependence on foreign technical assistance, to set up investment
and appropriately channel external funding support into the
building and sustenance of indigenous capacity.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Harare based independent, development funding
institution has a project portfolio comprising 32 projects, of
which 12 are training projects and 20 are policy units spanning
more than 23 African countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December 1999, the 14-member foundation had
awarded 42 grants, through the collaborative efforts of three
multilateral institutions including the African Development Bank,
the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, to
build capacity in policy analysis and development management. The
cumulative cost of projects stood at 213.08 million U.S. dollars,
out of which ACBF commitment was 86.52 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the institutional level, the foundation has spearheaded the
establishment from scratch of institutions entirely devoted to
policy analysis on a continent. These policy units have raised the
consciousness of policy-makers to the need to design and implement
policies based on information generated through sound research and
analysis.
</P>
<P>
As regards human capacity building, several policy units
supported by the foundation have undertaken multi-pronged
in-service training programs, whose impact on the increase in the
number of qualified policy analysts and development managers in
their respective countries is indisputable.
</P>
<P>
The training programs have enhanced post-graduate economics
education in several African countries. Some 33 department of
economics in universities across Africa have been strengthened,
resulting in an improvement in their teaching and research
capacities.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, programs targeting finance ministers,
governors of Central/Reserve Banks and Permanent Secretaries for
finance have strengthened commitment to policy reforms awareness
of strategies of the need to improve economic governance.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ACBF approved the integration of the Partnership
for Capacity Building in Africa (PACT) into ACBF. This new
framework will enhance public sector performance and
effectiveness, strengthen public-private sector-civil society
interface and strengthen the capacity level of regional
institutions.
</P>
<P>
And at its meeting on May 3-5, 2000, the ACBF approved 17 of
the new projects and support for 11 national focal points. A total
funding commitment of 24.29 million dollars was made in May 2000
under the foundation's expanded mandate. The countries include
Botswana, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland and Zambia.
Each country will receive a funding support of 50,000 dollars over
a period of two years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in a press conference shortly after the
end of the workshop, Soumana Sako, the executive secretary of the
foundation, stressed that Africa needs to assume the leadership

Donor assistance is critical but African countries need to be in
the driving seat.

<HEADLINE> NBA Free Agents Get Ready to Cash In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Detroit's Grant Hill and San
Antonio's Tim Duncan headlined a lengthy list of players who could
be changing teams as the NBA free agency period started at
midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
Along with Hill and Duncan, Toronto Raptors swingman Tracy
McGrady, Charlotte guard Eddie Jones and Portland forward Brian
Grant are expected to be the most coveted free agents.
</P>
<P>
The Orlando Magic has cleared more than 20 million US dollars
in salary-cap space and is believed to be the leading candidate
for Duncan and either Hill or McGrady. All might re-sign with
their current teams, although McGrady has said he probably will
not return to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls are roughly 18 million US dollars under the
cap and also will be a major player in free agency. McGrady,
Indiana's Jalen Rose and Milwaukee's Tim Thomas have been
mentioned as players they will pursue.
</P>
<P>
Rose is not the only free agent among the top players for the
Indiana Pacers. Reggie Miller, Austin Croshere, Rik Smits and
Mark Jackson are expected to re-sign, but a source said the
Detroit Pistons might make a move for Rose, who grew up in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Other notable free agents include Maurice Taylor, Glen Rice,
Toni Kukoc, Rashard Lewis, Cuttino Mobley, Tim Hardaway, Iriah
Rider and Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Teams can negotiate deals with players through July, but no
contracts can be completed until August 1 when NBA will announce
the cap salary for the new season.

<HEADLINE> China Greets Upsurge of Returned Students (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 students who have
returned to China after going to school abroad today signed
contracts with domestic enterprises at the 2000 China Liaoning
Week for Enterprises of Overseas Scholars and Forum of Science and
Technology, which started here June 29.
</P>
<P>
The contracts, involving 130 million U.S. dollars in total,
cover several areas in the high-tech industry including electronic-
information, bio-engineering, energy-saving and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The forum attracted 370 students, mostly Ph.D.s, returning from
24 countries and regions. They brought over 500 high-tech projects
for cooperation to the fair, which was organized by the ministries
of Education, Science and Technology and Personnel and Liaoning
Provincial People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Minister of Science and Technology Xu Guanhua said
this year's forum was much bigger than the previous two, both in
scale and in the number of signed contracts.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yanhui, who holds a Ph. D. in medical science, said, "Now is
a golden time for Chinese students who have finished their studies
abroad to go back to the motherland and build up their own careers.
"
</P>
<P>
Ma, 40, enrolled in a U.S. graduate school in 1987. After
graduation, he remained in the U.S. to conduct research on
diabetes, and set up his own pharmaceutical company in Silicon
Valley in 1997. Ma came back China to set up two pharmaceutical
companies for producing artificial insulin pumps he had developed
in Tianjin and Shenyang in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government supports students going abroad, and
encourages them to make contributions in their homeland after they
have completed their schooling. Between 1978 and 1999, 320,000
Chinese students and scholars had gone abroad to study -- double
the figure of the previous 100 years. Of these students, 110,000
have returned to China and in turn supported China economic and
cultural development.

"Present-day China provides a favorable environment for
returned students. After two decades of reforms and opening-up,
the country is enjoying brisk economic growth, long-term social
stability and an improved investment climate," Xu Guanhua said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that returned students have a decided advantage
over foreign entrepreneurs doing business in China because they
have gained new technological and managerial expertise, keep
abreast of new development of international market, and understand
Chinese customs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Baisong, 45, who came back to China after earning a Ph.D.
in the United States, said that the two eye clinics he opened in
the U.S. sell only four or five pairs of reading glasses a month,
while his shop in the Dalian High-tech Development Zone has sold
hundreds of the same types of glasses daily since it opened in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
"China has a big market and numerous opportunities. I am
optimistic about future development in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
China greeted the first wave of returned students in the 1950s.
Many returnees have made tremendous contributions to the
motherland and are now noted scientists.
</P>
<P>
Qian Lingxi, an 84-year-old academician at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences who returned from Belgium in the 1930s, said, "We came
back to meet the national crisis before new China was founded. The
returned students of today came back to revitalize the country."
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in an interview with the
American magazine "Science" in May that China is taking steps to
create better working and living conditions, and establish a more
flexible mechanism to attract talented Chinese students in school
abroad to come home.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has built 53 state-level and high-tech
development zones in Beijing, Tianjin and Xi'an, in which 32 high-
tech parks for returned students were established. The combined
annual industrial and trade profits of these parks increased from
8.7 billion yuan in 1991 to 670 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, the only technical innovation experimental
zone in the country, plans to allocate 200 million yuan in each of
the next five years to support high-tech projects launched by
returned students, said Zhang Guoguang, governor of Liaoning.

<HEADLINE> 10 Iranian Jews Convicted of Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Ten Iranian Jews Saturday were
sentenced to prison terms of four to 13 years on charges of spying
for Israel, while three others were acquitted, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Tefeleen, the main defendant among the 13 Iranian Jews
arrested in March 1999, were sentenced to 13 years in prison, his
lawyer Shirzad Rahmani told IRNA in Shiraz, capital of the southern
Fars Province, where the verdict was issued.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict issued by the court is unfair and my client has not
had any activity in the espionage network," Rahmani said, insisting
that the court lacked any evidence for its verdict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of the provincial judiciary chief Hussein Ali
Amiri said that the 10 Iranian Jews and two Muslims accused of the
same crimes were sentenced by the revolutionary court. The
punishments included jail terms, whipping and cash fines.
</P>
<P>
He said that the other three Jews, who had been out on bail
since February, and two other Muslims were acquitted, adding that
the final 71-page verdict on the case would be made public later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews along with four Muslims were arrested last year in
Shiraz, more than 800 kilometers south of the capital of Tehran.
Court hearings for those accused started in the southern city on
April 13. In all, eight defendants had confessed to passing on
classified information to Israel and having links with Israel's
security service, four had pleaded innocent, and one acknowledged
passing information but insisted that his action did not constitute
espionage.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, there has been debate in Iran about
whether the Jews would be sentenced to death, with the judiciary
officials divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and trial of the Iranian Jews sparked protests from
Israel and Western countries who demanded Iran to release them. But
Iran insists that the case has nothing to do with religious beliefs
and no foreign country should interfere in its domestic affairs.

LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian UN peacekeeper was
confirmed to have been killed on Friday and four others wounded
by the rebels in Sierra Leone, reports reaching here from Freetown
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They were caught in an ambush near the town of Mile 91, about
145 kilometers east of the capital, Freetown, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The atrocity immediately invited condemnation from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday that he was
"appalled"
</P>
<P>
to learn of the incident and expressed "his deepest condolences
to the family of the victim" and the Jordanian government.
</P>
<P>
He made clear that the attack would not alter the UN's
commitment to assisting the achievement of a lasting peace in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place when the UN Security Council was about to
vote on a proposed embargo on Sierra Leone diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to choke off the illegal trade in diamond which has
funded the rebels' campaign, while allowing the government to
certify diamonds sold with its agreement.

<HEADLINE> Russian Rocket Carries U.S. Satellite Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Proton-1 carrier rocket
Saturday successfully sent a U.S. commercial satellite SD-RADIO
into a planned orbit, the press service for the Russian Aerospace
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The rocket fired off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan at 2:09 a.m. Moscow time (2309 GMT Friday).  The
satellite was put by a Russian rocket-space transport system into
an optimum geo-stationary orbit with a height of 47,102 kilometers
and an inclination of 63.4 degrees, at 4:34 a.m. Moscow time (0134
GMT) Saturday, said the press service.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has already been separated smoothly from the
platform, and the satellite will further be positioned with its
own engines.
</P>
<P>
It was the 275th launch of a Russian Proton carrier rocket.
</P>
<P>
The SD-RADIO satellite is designed to perform high-quality
radio transmission to mobile radio-receivers. It will also
provide automobile satellite communication on the continental part
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The satellites of this type weigh about 4,000 kilograms and
their construction provides for 100 relaying channels.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Krunichev Space Center has signed a contract for
two other launches of the Sirius-type satellites scheduled for
August and October of 2000, said the press service.

<HEADLINE> China's Rule on JV Hospitals Becomes Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China has renewed administrative
measures governing Sino-overseas joint-venture (JV) hospitals and
clinics, hoping the sector's sound development can provide people
a wide range of health care services.
</P>
<P>
According to a rule published by ministries of Health and
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, which becomes effective
today, overseas hospitals and firms can launch joint ventures in
China after they get permission from the two ministries.
</P>
<P>
Solely overseas-funded hospitals are still not allowed in China.
</P>
<P>
A JV hospital should be internationally advanced in equipment,
technology and management, and should be able to provide service
that local hospitals can not give, stipulated the rule.
</P>
<P>
Investment in a JV hospital should not be less than 20 million
yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars), stock shares of the Chinese
side should not be less than 30 percent, and the term of JV
hospitals should not exceed 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, exceptions may be made for hospitals opening in China'
s central and western regions, as well as remote and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will have to obey
this rule when launching JV hospitals in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
China is reforming its hospitals by dividing them into not-for-
profit and for-profit categories, and will exercise different fee-
charging and taxation policies. Most JV hospitals are expected to
fall into the for-profit classification.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are about 200 JV hospitals and
clinics in 19 Chinese provinces; however, only 18 hospitals and
some 60 clinics have official permits.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the rule
aimed to "create a healthy environment for development of this
sector."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Legitimizes Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has recognized
the legitimacy of the traditional Chinese medicine, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Public Health Korn Dabbaransi announced
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has ruled that the traditional Chinese medicine
is a legal and widely-accepted medicine science and treatment," he
said at the annual meeting of the Thai-Chinese Health Cooperation
Committee, which is held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the satisfactory result of past five
years' trial of standard medical services of the traditional
Chinese medicine, which was conducted with the cooperation of Thai
and Chinese medical institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, Chinese health minister who led a Chinese
medicine delegation attending the meeting, welcomed the move as a
"wise decision."
</P>
<P>
"The preservation and promotion of the traditional medicine now
is a common opinion of most countries in the world," he remarked,
"and Thailand showed its respect to the science and the will of
its people by making this decision."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's firm support to help Thailand to develop
a center of study, education and treatment of traditional Chinese
medicine in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
With the traditional Chinese medicine becoming legal in
Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health is now passing a
regulation on licensing of traditional Chinese medicine, Korn
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The applicants for the temporary traditional Chinese medicine
license, which will be valid for two years, must pass professional
and ethical training and the evaluation of the Traditional
Medicine Committee, he stated.
</P>
<P>
With a large number of applicants expected, the official said
the evaluation must be strict, in order to prevent unqualified
persons to conduct traditional Chinese medicine in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the standardization of traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Xie Qiangming, a Thai Chinese and one of the first four Thai
doctors who got the license of traditional Chinese medicine, told
Xinhua at the meeting that there are still lots of improvements
for traditional Chinese medicine to achieve in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, many Thai people think that a doctor of traditional
Chinese medicine can treat any disease, and this need to be
changed, "he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, by imposing certain regulations, traditional
Chinese medicine in Thailand will become more standardized and
specialized, just like modern western medicine.

<HEADLINE> Israel Condemns Verdicts on Jews in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel Saturday condemned the "
harsh verdicts" passed on some of the Iranian Jews on charges of
spying for Israel, and urged Tehran to change its mind on
sentencing the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel wishes to express its profound shock
and concern following the harsh sentences passed on some of the
Jewish prisoners, who are innocent of any wrongdoing," Israeli
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Shiraz, about 800 kilometers south of the capital
of Tehran, said that three of the 13 Iranian Jews tried on charges
of spying for Israel were acquitted and the rest were sentenced to
prison terms of four to 13 years on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hossein Ali Amiri, the provincial judiciary chief of Fars
Province where the trial has been held since April, said earlier in
the say the sentences included fines and lashings.
</P>
<P>
"These harsh verdicts will deprive innocent people of their
freedom for many years...and we call upon the international
community to continue working together with Israel and to do their
utmost to bring about the prompt release of the Iranian Jews," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement denied once again that the Iranian Jews were
agents of Israel. Iran's Jewish community remains the Middle East's
largest outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Court hearings for the accused Jews began on April 13 in Shiraz,
capital of Fars Province, and formally concluded last Saturday.
Eight of the defendants have confessed to passing on classified
information to Israel and having connections with Israel's security
service.
</P>
<P>
Under the Western powers' pressure to release the Jews, Tehran
insists that the arrests of them, in March 1999, had nothing to do
with their religious backgrounds and no foreign country should
interfere in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Renews Vow to Keep Country Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
reiterated Saturday that he will not allow armed groups to
threaten the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"As Commander in Chief of our armed forces, it is my sworn duty
to see to it that the independence of our nation is not impaired
nor any portion of its territory dismembered," Estrada said in the
southern city of Davao, according to a press release from the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he remains committed to achieving a
lasting and just peace for Mindanao not only for the present
generation of Filipinos but also for future generations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government agreed on Friday to extend a June 30
deadline by 28 days for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
to forge a peace deal with the government, as the deadline set by
Estrada passed unobserved.
</P>
<P>
But the government stressed that it would not declare a
ceasefire with the MILF until the rebels agree to sign an interim
agreement which requires them to abandon their secessionist bid
and terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for the establishment of an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao in the southern Philippines.
The rebel group has also been blamed by the government for a
series of bombings in the capital and other parts of the country
in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who went to Davao for a working visit, urged the
people not to lose hope and called on them to work harder to make
sure progress and peace are achieved.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict is not fully over, but we are already starting
rehabilitation work as part of efforts to provide peace and quiet
to our Mindanao residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president will convene on Sunday the first meeting of the
Mindanao Coordinating Council, a high-level government body he has
formed to bring focus to his administration's efforts to
rehabilitate and develop Mindanao, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said Saturday on TV.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Force to Be Under President's Direct Purview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Saturday that on January 1 next year, the police
force in the country would officially come under the direct
purview of the president.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement at a function marking the
54th anniversary of the Indonesian Police.
</P>
<P>
Since last April, the police has been functioning under the
supervision of the defense ministry after having been part of the
military (formerly ABRI or Indonesian Armed Forces) for several
decades.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the police's status as a force under the president's
direct authority was until now only based on a presidential decree.
It still has to be confirmed by a law.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been following developments affecting the police
with "mixed feelings." In his view, certain traditions observed
when the police were still part of the military, are worth
preserving. "However, I'm also afraid that doing so would lead to
militarism whereas the tradition of militarism itself must be
changed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the tradition of militarism in a
political sense no longer exists in Indonesia. What remains is
militarism as represented by the professionalism of the country's
National Defence Force (TNI).
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the Indonesian National Police has passed a
major milestone in its history, changed into a brand new
Organization as it has decided to separate from the military. The
police has had to shed its military image and turn itself into an
effective, civilian-based law-enforcing apparatus.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Erupts in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The fiercest fighting of this
year erupted Saturday between Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia
and opposition forces to the north of the Afghan capital of Kabul,
news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources in Afghanistan, the Pakistan-based Afghan
Islamic Press (AIP) reported that heavy fighting began on Saturday
morning at the frontline near Baghram Airforce Base, barely 50
kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the opposition alliance, led by former Afghan
Defense Minister Ahmed Shah Masood, were using tanks, artillery
and rockets. The Taliban also twice air-bombed opposition
positions, said AIP.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban accused the opposition of firing the first shot. "
Last night they fired heavy weapons at us. We are ready to
negotiate but we will defend ourselves and now we are in a
defensive position," said Abdul Rehman Ottaq, Taliban deputy
information minister, when contacted by press.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was also a report of fighting in the northern
Afghan province of Takhar, another opposition stronghold and base
of the ousted president, Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks both sides in Afghanistan's bitter conflict
have been reinforcing their frontlines with fresh manpower and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which control over 80 percent of Afghanistan, have
been combating the northern-based opposition alliance for the
control of the whole country for several years. Almost every past
summer, when snow melts in northern Afghanistan, witnessed new
rounds of fighting between the two factions.
</P>
<P>
Last week United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan warned of
a major round of fighting and urged both sides to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the U.N. Security Council and General
Assembly, Annan warned that the ruling Taliban harbor "hopes of a
military victory" and opposition groups believe they "can redress
the balance of power through gains on the ground."

morning, said the General Committee of Election (GCE).
</P>
<P>
The committee said that more than 15,600 people have been
mobilized to work in 330 sub-committee groups for the election
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A total 13 parties, 3 coalitions and 24 independent candidates

</P>
<P>
The committee will release the preliminary results on Monday (
July 3). Official results will be declared about 10 days later.
</P>
<P>

percent of voters said they would support Mongolian people's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP), far ahead of the ruling party
Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) and the Mongolian
Social Democratic Party (MSDP).
</P>
<P>
One third of the country's 2.4 million people live on less than
10 dollars a month, and thousands of nomad families lost their
livelihoods last year in the worst winter in 30 years that wiped
out more than 2.5 million head of livestock.
</P>
<P>

over 10 countries and regions, and 21 foreign observers from
United States, Britain and Japan have arrived in Mongolia to
monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's parliament has 76 seats, serving a 4-year term. The

The public prosecutor of Millau in southern France, Alain
Durand, said he recommended 10 months of jail for Bove, including
nine months of suspension.
</P>
<P>
He said Bove should be punished "with a deterrent sentence"
because he had threatened to blow up the Macdonald's with bombs.
</P>
<P>
During the anti-globalization demonstration on August 12, 1999,
Bove said he would place a bomb in the restaurant if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Durand also recommended light jail terms of up to three months
of imprisonment for nine other members of the Peasant
Confederation who participated in the attack on the Macdonald's.
</P>

The trial of the 10 peasants started Friday and drew about 20,
000 anti-globalization protesters on the opening day of the trial,
which is expected to last for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Intensify Attacks to Counter Russian Mop-ups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have toughened
attacks against Russian federal units as Moscow's mop-up
operations go on in various parts of the war-torn republic, the
Russian military said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the past 24 hours alone, federal block-posts have been fired
upon and attacked for eight times and local self-government bodies
five times. In addition, border guard units were fired on nine
times and federal convoys four times, Interfax cited the
headquarters of the Russian forces in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen explosive devices have been discovered and neutralized
in Chechnya over the past 24 hours. Four wounded guerrillas were
found and 29 peoples detained on suspicion of the involvement in
unlawful armed formations in the course of repeated mopping-up
operations, with 38 items of weapons, two remote-controlled land
mines and two vehicles seized.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops lost 13 servicemen with 18 wounded during a five-
day fierce fighting near south Chechnya's village of Serzhen-Yurt,
killing over 100 rebels of a 200-250-strong mercenary group and
injuring scores of the others, Russian presidential aide Sergey
Yastrzhembsky told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"According to latest information, a rebel group consisting of
about 50 people is trying to break through thick woods in the
mountains to the village of Nozhai-Yurt. A chase is underway," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another nine Russian soldiers in an armored vehicle were killed
and seven others wounded by a mine explosion during a rebel ambush
near the village of Avtury in the central Chechen district of
Shali on Friday evening, when a federal motorized convoy was
heading for the station base after the Serzhen-Yurt battle, said
an Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of Russia's combined force
in Chechnya, told the press Saturday that now federal forces are
conducting "several dozens of special operations" in the republic.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, an operation on wiping out a rebel group and
their ammunition and medicaments caches has been going on for the
fourth day in the Vedeno district," the general said.
</P>
<P>
Special operations are also being conducted near the populated
areas of Benoi and Tsa-Vedeno, he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the number of rebels opposing the federal force at
1,500 people, confirming that "the border of Chechnya with Georgia
is completely blocked by our units" despite "no proven information
on rebel reinforcements' attempts to break to Chechnya from the
Georgian territory."
</P>
<P>
The bandit formations in Chechnya do not possess heavy armored
vehicles and large caliber artillery, Troshev said. "All what they
had have been destroyed or seized. If they had artillery, they
would raze (the key town of) Khankala to the ground," the general
suggested.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Claims Picasso's Missing Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has applied to the Turkish
Foreign Ministry for the return of Pablo Picasso's famous
painting "La Fermiere," reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claimed that the painting was stolen from the Kuwaiti
Palace during the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police seized two of Picasso's oil paintings, "La
Fermiere" and the "Dora Maar" in two separate raids in the
country's southwestern city of Izmir in May.
</P>
<P>
Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), a Spanish painter, moved to settle
down in Paris in 1904 and later became a leading painter of French
modernist school.
</P>
<P>
"La Fermiere," a portrait of Madame Putman painted in France in
1908, and the "Dora Maar," a portrait of Picasso's Yugoslavian
lover painted in 1938, were smuggled by Syrian and Turkish
nationals through Syria to Turkey to be sold in Izmir.
</P>
<P>
Izmir, Turkey's third largest city, is located at the end of a
smugglers' route coming from the Middle East to Europe because of
its seaport. It is also in close proximity to Greek islands.
</P>
<P>
Police initially stated that the two paintings were not
registered on the list of stolen paintings of the International
Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). However, a stamp from a
French museum on the back of the "Dora Maar," and a stamp from
Kuwaiti Palace on the back of "La Fermiere" raised a question
whether they are original or not.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Interpol said in a later statement that this "La
Fermiere" was registered in St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum and
is claimed to have been stolen during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
But experts say that "La Fermiere" is definitely original and
has Picasso's signature on the back.
</P>
<P>
Police in Izmir hence issued a statement that the painting
stolen from the former Soviet Union during the Second World War was
Picasso's "Farmer Wife," not "La Fermiere."
</P>
<P>
Now that if "La Fermiere" proves to be the original, Turkey will
have to surrender it to Kuwait because stolen art should be given
back to its rightful owner according to international practice.

<HEADLINE> UAE Ranks Third in Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)held
a proven recoverable oil reserve of 97.8 billion barrels at the end
of 1999, third largest in the world, according to the latest BP
Amoco annual statistical review of world energy.
</P>
<P>
UAE's oil reserves accounted for 9.4 percent of the total global
proven oil reserves, said the review.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia with 263.5 billion barrels, or 25.5 percent of the
global total, and Iraq with 112.5 billion barrels or 10.9 percent
of the total are ranked as the two leading oil reserve holders.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, with 96.5 billion barrels, or 9.3 percent of the total,
holds the fourth place, followed by Iran (89.7 billion barrels, or
8.7 percent), according to the review.
</P>
<P>
In all, the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and Iran have proven
reserves of 675.6 billion barrels or 65.4 percent of the world
total.
</P>
<P>
The UAE alone has more reserves than any of the other
geographical regions into which the BP Amoco review divides the
globe, said the review.
</P>
<P>
"North America (63.7 billion barrels), Central and South America
(89.5 billion barrels), Europe (20.6 billion barrels), the former
Soviet Union (65.4 billion barrels), Africa, including North Africa
(74.9 billion barrels) and Asia and the Pacific (44 billion
barrels)," the review added.
</P>
<P>
UAE's total proven recoverable reserves remained unchanged at
the end of last year from the end of 1998, despite a year of
production, according to the figure cited in the review. "This is
ascribed to the proving of new reserves during the year."
</P>
<P>
One of the key objectives of the exploration strategy of UAE's
oil companies is the delineation and proving of new reserves to
replace those produced.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, this strategy has paid off handsomely,
with total reserves declining only slightly from 98.1 billion
barrels at the end of 1989 to 97.8 billion barrels at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
At the rate of production last year, the UAE has sufficient
reserves to allow for production at the same level for over 100
years, one of only three countries in this position, the report
said. The other two are Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Proven reserves are defined by the review as being those, which,
with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in the future from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
They take no account, therefore, of possible future advances in
recovery techniques.
</P>
<P>
UAE's total daily production last year was 2.505 million
barrels, the review said, a decline of 8.7 percent from the
previous year, and accounting for 3.2 percent of global production.
</P>
<P>
Among those, 345,000 barrels a day were consumed locally, with
the remainder being available for export, the review added.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Japan's Izu Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 6.1 on
the open-ended Richter scale jolted the Izu island chain south of
Tokyo on Saturday afternoon, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) quoted an official at the isle
of Kozushima as saying that one person is feared to have been
buried by a landslide triggered by the quake, which occurred at 4:
02 p.m. (0702 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Power outages affected much of Kozushima, and water pipes burst
in some places, the NHK said.
</P>
<P>
The quake may cause some movement in the surface of the sea but
there is no danger of tidal waves, reported the Meteorological
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was estimated to be about 10
kilometers below the seabed in the Pacific off Kozushima and
Niijima isles, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
A series of moderate to strong quakes hit several islands in
the island chain early in the day.
</P>
<P>
About 2,600 of Miyakejima's 3,800 residents were evacuated
during the week to safer parts of the island for fear of a
volcanic eruption, but the agency said recent quakes were not
directly caused by volcanic activity.

Chechnya Sergey Yastrzhembsky told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A federal motorized convoy that had been involved in the

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sees Poor Economic Performance in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey posted a 4.2 percent growth in

gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 2000, while
the figure stood at 8.7 percent in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was put at 5.6
percent, while the figure was 9.1 percent in the first three months
of 1999, according to provisional figures issued recently by the
State Institute of Statistics (DIE).
</P>
<P>
Although both GNP and GDP growth rates have beaten the
expectations that centered on 3.5 percent, the GDP growth is
regarded by economists as a poor performance, saying that the
outlook on the production front was not bright despite a pent-up
consumer demand, Turkish Daily News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"GDP growth could have been 1 to 1.5 percentage points higher if
it was not for a restriction on building licenses," said Faruk
Selcuk, professor of Economics at Bilkent University.
</P>
<P>
Building licenses dropped by 60.4 percent in the first quarter,
according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The government has projected a GNP growth of 5.5 percent for
2000, following a record 6.4 percent contraction in 1999, when the
economy bottomed out due to the impacts of Russian financial crisis
and a major earthquake that hit Turkey's industrial heartland.
</P>
<P>
Altug Karamenderes, an economist with Ata Securities, said
that "overall the growth performance is quite poor because one
would expect the economy to have achieved the level in 1998, yet
figures remained considerably below that."
</P>
<P>
Selcuk said that "there is a misconception that the economy is
overheating in a way that would fuel inflation."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the Turkish economy has considerable room
to grow without causing inflation, adding that a GDP growth of 6-7
percent for the whole year would not fuel inflation, but only match
the 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government targets a 5.5 percent growth in the
economy in 2000 within the framework of a three-year stand-by
package of 4 billion U.S. dollars with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), approved last December.
</P>
<P>
Ankara also plans to reduce the country's chronic inflation
rate, 65.8 percent in February, to 20 percent by the end of this
year, 10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002.

and educating people on traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, an average of 4,600 people die of traffic accidents

law guarantees individuals' rights and freedoms, and all the
actions of the rulers in a state of law are inspected by
jurisdiction and therefore the state of law provides legal security
to people."
</P>
<P>
He said this at the 55th graduation ceremony of the Police
Academy on Friday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
A high level Israeli official said that Turkey is ready to sell
water and they are expecting to agree on price this time.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Goods Promise to Become Bangladesh's Big Export Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Local entrepreneurs see an immense
scope for locally manufactured rubber goods in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Rubber could be one of the bigger export sources in the country
like garments and frozen foods if proper incentives were available,
the New Nation said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the quality, not the quantity, of local rubber remains the
main problem in developing rubber-based industries. Leading
entrepreneurs of rubber-based industries have had to import the
raw rubber they need just to ensure the quality of products.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the import spending for
rubber and rubber goods was over 44 million U.S. dollars in 1998-
99.
</P>
<P>
Mubash Shar, senior vice-president of Dhaka Chamber and
Managing Director of Emen Rubber Products Limited, was quoted as
saying that the country needs to form a rubber board, comprising
people from public and private sectors, to allot lands to growers,
determine price of rubber as per international price levels and
monitor quality.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 200 small-scale industries are producing
rubber products, including beach sandals, tubes, shoe soles and
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Local rubber industries consume around 6,000 tons of raw rubber
annually, excluding best-quality imported variety, leaving some 1,
800 tons surplus.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 7,800 tons of rubber is extracted annually from gardens
in the country. It was projected that some 20,000 tons of raw
rubber would be surplus by the year 2007 after meeting the
domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Missing Ferry Found: Antara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's missing ferry had been
seen and the passengers were believed to be safe, the Antara News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted Indonesian Director of Sea Transportation Tjuk
Suhardiman as saying that the ferry ran aground on an island about
80 mile off the northern coast of North Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Indonesian Navy had sent planes and
ships to the island to check reports a missing ferry carrying
hundreds of passengers and Maluku refugees had been sighted.
</P>
<P>
The search had now been switched to Siau island off North
Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the focus of the search has been shifted to Siau
island because the Navy has received information from the Customs
Office that they have sighted the boat," said Lieutenant Colonel
Sudarsoni, a naval intelligence officer in Manado, capital of
North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Cahaya Bahari, left Tobelo on Halmahera in North
Maluku province on Wednesday en route to Manado, capital of North
Sulawesi. Radio contact with the vessel was lost after its captain
M.M. Paparaga radioed an "SOS" advising that the ship was taking
water in fast during a violent storm at noon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting data about the total passengers on board
while the Cahaya Bahari was licensed to carry only 270 people. The
National Search and Rescue Agency claimed that at least 492
passengers, refugees from Maluku and crew members may have been
aboard.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Up 30 Percent in April-May 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest monthly trade data released by the ministry of
commerce Saturday, however, indicated that the trade deficit
continued to be high at 2.1 billion dollars in the first two
months of this fiscal as against a mere 1.2 billion dollars in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the country's imports was higher than exports in
the first two months of the current fiscal year at 9 billion
dollars, registering a growth 36.7 percent over the 6.6 billion
dollars in April-May 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly attributed to huge oil imports during April-May
2000 which were valued at 2.6 billion dollars, recording a 110
percent growth over the 1.25 billion dollars in April-May 1999.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- some 1,500 tons of maize from South
Africa has arrived at Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa since the
government waived a 25 to 50 percent tariff on maize early this
month.
</P>
<P>
More imports are expected following reports that Kenya's relief
stocks have been dwindling to less than 60,000 bags from the
beginning of June, Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 860,000 bags of maize were bought for drought
relief. It is estimated that more than three million Kenyans
are in desperate need of food assistance compared with 961,000 in
1992, the last time when the east African country experienced a
severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The number of the drought victims could rise dramatically to 23
million, about 80 percent of the country's population, if the
short rains fail in September.

Saturday reiterated the country's "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>

history. "We will not only cherish the friendship established by
leaders of the older generation but also strengthen and further
develop this friendship," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Bids Farewell to Economic Crisis by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Just prior to the third anniversary
of the eruption of the Asian financial crisis, Thailand heard one
after another good news assuring of its economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, Thailand formally "graduated" from the three-year-
old International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported program. The
executive board of the IMF hailed the country's recovery as "
impressive" so far.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB) of Thailand revised its growth projection for the
year to five percent, up from 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, influential U.S. credit rating agency Moody's
Investors Service announced that it had upgraded Thailand's
sovereign credit rating to investment grade from "junk" status,
citing the country's broad economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said all of these news indicate that Thailand is now
on track for economic recovery after three years of hardship.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, 1997, the decision by the Bank of Thailand to give
up its currency pegging system triggered the collapse of the baht
and brought down with it many currencies in the region, thus
touching off a full-scale financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the 17.2-billion-dollar IMF rescue package and
after the adoption of numerous reform measures, the Thai economy
recorded a 4.2 percent growth last year after a 10.2 percent
shrink in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB said it revised its growth projection for the year
because of the country's impressive economic growth in the first
three months, which reached 5.2 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Among growth sources in the first quarter, exports -- a main
driving force of the country's economic growth -- topped the list
with 25.2 percent growth, followed by combined investment in the
government and private sectors of 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government think-tank and planning agency said it has also
revised its export growth projection for the year to 12 percent
from the previous 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing also grew 9.5 percent across the board with
rising exports and stronger domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The strong global demand for computers helped put integrated
circuits and electronic parts at the top of Thai exports. Gains
were also shown in the auto, petrochemicals, steel, jewelry and
textile industries.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates, the continued fiscal stimulus program and
slight gains in consumer confidence helped boost domestic
consumption, with department store, car and motorcycle sales, and
value-added tax collection all posting gains.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales grew 62.1 percent in the first quarter from the year
before due to the stronger domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Private investment also increased sharply by 14.6 percent year-
on-year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the brighter macroeconomic picture, economists agree
that Thailand still faces many challenges to sustain the recovery.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, admitted recently
at a seminar that the Thai economy would require at least another
year before recovering to pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
"We must accept reality. While recovery has been steady, it has
not yet reached all sectors," Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
Among the main economic concerns are the level of the non-
performing loans (NPLs) of the banking sector, the weakness of
agricultural commodity prices and the overhanging glut in the
property sector.
</P>
<P>
With the NPLs level in the Thai banking sector remaining
stubbornly high, at more than 37 percent of total loans at the end
of the first quarter, many analysts expressed cautious optimism
that the worst might be over.
</P>
<P>
The property sector, the biggest recipient of credit from the
financial sector, remains weak, as increases in demand remain
insufficient to absorb supply.
</P>
<P>
While the agricultural production has been high, commodities
prices have fallen by about 30 percent in U.S. dollar terms over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
External factors, such as global oil prices and the overheating
U.S. economy, will also play significant roles in the pace of
Thailand's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Another major uncertainty is in the political arena. The
current government must call a general election by November, and
questions remain about whether the new government would continue
carrying out reform policies.
</P>
<P>
The new government will face hard decisions on public debt
management, state enterprise privatization and fiscal stimulus
policies amid tighter budget constraints.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Defeats Bangladesh-Myanmar Border Trade Purpose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Well-knit smugglers' chains along the
Bangladesh-Myanmar border have defeated the purpose of border
trade between the two countries, according to the Financial
Express on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The border trade between the two countries came into effect in
1995 with the major objective of containing informal trade between
Bangladesh and Myanmar. But syndicates of smugglers did otherwise,
marginalizing the volume of border trade.
</P>
<P>
The unofficial transaction is now greater than the official one.
Salt, cigarette, fish and narcotics are some of the major items
smuggled into Bangladesh and diesel, medicine and cement are items
going to the other side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Trawlers, cargo vessels and local small and large boats are
principal transports used in the movement of smuggling goods
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Grants Credit to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Samurdhi Banks have
granted credit amounting to 16.8 million U.S. dollars to the poor
to launch self-employment projects to raise their income level,
the official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The banks which set up by the government in 1995, had granted
this amount of credit to more than 257,800 poor families by the
end of March 31 this year, Youth Affairs, Samurdhi and Sports
Minister S. D. Dissanayake was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the newspaper Friday that the banks have thus
become the country's key provider to the poor in the island.
</P>
<P>
The banks issue loans up to a maximum of 330 dollars to each
poor family recipient to embark on ventures to augment their
income,the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Samurdhi Authority will provide credit
facilities through a special fund to low-income families seeking
loans exceeding 330 dollars. A 15-percent interest is charged on
these loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present at least 1,000 Samurdhi Banks have been established
in Sri Lanka by the government since 1995 as the key credit
facilitator of the poor.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Ranks Second in IDUs in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- There are 20,000 intravenous drug
users (IDUs) in Nepal, the second highest in Asia after India,
according to Nepali health experts.
</P>
<P>
"Among 50,000 drug abusers in Nepal, there are almost 20,000
IDUs,of which 40.4 percent are HIV-positive," said Dr. T. N.Jha,
director of the National Center for AIDS and STD (sex transmitted
diseases) Control, at a workshop on IDU that began here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Intravenous drug use has played a critical role in fueling an
HIV epidemic in Nepal in the past six years," said Jha. "IDUs are
more prone to HIV infection because they directly exchange
syringes and needles among their peer group."
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that there are 10,000 HIV-positive drug
abusers all over Nepal, a majority of whom share needles without
hesitation due to lack of money," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that if the increasing trend of HIV-positive
and drug abusers is not checked immediately, there will be at
least one HIV positive in each household on average in two years,
said a paper presented at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Youth Power Nepal, the organizer of the two-day workshop, came
to the conclusion after need assessment among drug abusers that
their needs include free treatment, education and counseling,
methadone treatment, employment, cooperation and affection from
family and society and checkup in public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the workshop called for coordination between
private and governmental bodies to help drug abusers return to
normal life.

NEW DELHI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two engine drivers of Howrah-

rake of a passenger train between Ambala Cantt and the Ambala city
railway station in North India's Haryana state early Saturday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economic Indicators Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic indicators
continued improving despite a slight drop in non-oil and gas
exports, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
The monthly inflation rate jumped by 0.5 percent in June, down
from the 0.8-percent increase in May while the year-on-year
inflation in the month was 2.14 percent as compared with 2.86
percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Kusmadi Saleh from the BPS said that the rise in the June
inflation was mostly contributed by an increase in food prices.
</P>
<P>
"After the increase in electricity rates, elements of the food
price index that had previously been negative have all turned
positive now," Kusmadi was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
BPS said price increases for foodstuffs reached 0.16 percent
with those for meat rising by 4.41 percent, the highest level
recorded in the food category.
</P>
<P>
Kusmadi said that with the January to June inflation rate
already reaching 2.86 percent, it was unlikely that this year's
inflation target of 5 percent could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said the August general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly and the upcoming hike in fuel prices in October are
likely to further boost inflation.
</P>
<P>
BPS recorded a decline of 2.94 percent in total exports in May
to 4.8 billion U.S. dollars from 4.9 billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
The drop was triggered by a decline of 3.99 percent in non-oil
and gas exports to 3.8 billion dollars in May from 3.9 billion
dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas exports rose by 1.3 percent due to soaring crude
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose by 1.15 percent to 2.355 billion dollars in May
from 2.329 billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in May rose 18 percent to 2.47 billion
dollars from 2.1 billion dollars in May last year, but dropped
from 2.66 billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
"Our industries are already too dependent on imported raw
material, an increase only shows that production is improving,"
Kusmadi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that if the rupiah continued to depreciate
it would adversely affect the ability to purchase the products by
these industries.
</P>
<P>
BPS also reported that tourist arrivals in May dropped by 11.5
percent to 298,815 people from 337,818 in April.
</P>
<P>
However, between January and May this year, tourist arrivals
rose by 3.16 percent compared with the same period last year.

JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia would host ministerial
talks for the leading rubber producing nations on July 7 to
jointly map out a strategy to boost rubber prices.
</P>

Sutanto said however that Indonesia would not be interested in
forming a new cartel replacing the defunct International Natural
Rubber Organization.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Deadline for Peace Deal With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government agreed
Friday to extend a June 30 deadline it had set for the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to forge a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the MILF, which
failed to meet the deadline set by President Joseph Estrada, was
given another 30 days to sign an interim agreement, according to
local press reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although President Estrada has yet to formally extend the
period of of negotiations until July 29, talks will continue, said
Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the government would not
close the doors on the MILF just because the deadline had passed.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had tried to reach an interim agreement on the
sidelines of the four-day foreign ministers' meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) which ended in the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF balked at government conditions requiring the
rebels to first drop their demand for independence, stop terrorist
activities and lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Manila rejected a resolution passed by the OIC meeting Friday
demanding that it halt military offensives against the MILF in
Mindanao in the southern Philippines, but welcomed an OIC plan to
send a probe team to Mindanao to determine the real situation
there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government forces launched a final push on the
MILF headquarters, Camp Abubakar, unleashing ground and air
bombardments on it, as the June 30 deadline passed unobserved.
</P>
<P>
The military has claimed that some 5,000 rebels, or one-third
of the rebel force, have been killed and some 40 rebel camps
overrun since government troops launched sustained offensives
against the MILF early this year in Mindanao, where more than 500,
000 civilians have reportedly been displaced.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanian Boy Attacks KFOR Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A 14-year-old ethnic Albanian boy
blew up a stronghold of the international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo (KFOR) Wednesday, injuring a peacekeeper, said a KFOR press
release issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
KFOR arrested the boy the same day, who admitted that he had
thrown a bomb at the stronghold, said a Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug report based on the press release.
</P>
<P>
Following the explosion, KFOR tightened security around all
strongholds and intensified inspection of vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Violence against non-Albanians, and recently against
peacekeepers also, has occurred continuously in this Yugoslav
province ever since the Kosovo War ended June last year.
</P>
<P>
Escalating friction between ethnic Albanians and peacekeepers
are believed to be related to the recent discovery of huge arms
depots in central Kosovo and subsequent demolition of them by the
KFOR.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, over 1,000 ethnic Albanians protested at the KFOR
actions, waving banners saying "These weapons belong to ethnic
Albanians" and "KFOR out of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, KFOR troops destroyed anti-tank rockets,
mortars, machine guns and tens of thousands of grenades found near
the village of Klecka in central Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges U.S. to Extradite Lazarenko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
Friday criticized the United States for refusing to send former
Ukraine premier Palvo Lazarenko back to Kiev for trial.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Lazarenko, detained in a federal prison in
San Francisco since February 1999, was convicted of money-
laundering by a Swiss court and given a 18-month suspended prison
term.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma had repeatedly asked Washington to send back Lazarenko,
who is also on charges of misappropriating state property, abuse
of power and murder of a member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was ready to sign "any agreement regarding this problem
" with the United States, the Interfax News Agency quoted him as
saying. The two countries have no extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that Washington has undermined trust in its
willingness to promote the worldwide fight against corruption by
refusing to send Lazarenko back.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of trust would our society have for the American
legal system, which has been keeping Lazarenko in the United
States for a year and half now?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"If Lazarenko had no money, he would have been thrown out of
America," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, 47, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister since
September 1995 and prime minister from June 1996 to June 1997, was
arrested in Switzerland in December 1998 as he entered on a
Panamanian passport.
</P>
<P>
After being indicted by a Geneva judge on charges of money-
laundering, he was released after paying a 3 million U.S. dollars
on bail. In February 1999, he was detained by U.S. immigration
authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy airport for visa
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
A wider investigation in America charged Lazarenko with
laundering 114 million dollars allegedly stolen while in office.
Earlier this month, Lazarenko had once again pleaded not guilty to
these charges.
</P>
<P>
Under the American legal system, the case will be handled in
the United States and Lazarenko's illegal property will be
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko had fought extradition, saying he would not get a
fair trial in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier this week, Lazarenko admitted that he funneled
9 million dollars in stolen money through Switzerland and a Swiss
court had confiscated 6.6 million from his Swiss bank accounts.
The funds will be eventually restituted to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Swiss prosecutors believed that he has stolen a total of 880
million dollars from Ukraine between 1994 and 1997, with more than
170 million passing through Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Epidemic Threatens San Francisco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco, known around the world as a gay capital, became
one of the first centers of the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome epidemic in the early 1980s, when as many as half the gay
men in the city were believed to be infected with HIV. Since 1981,
more than 18,000 San Franciscans have died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Quick action by the city's gay community and public health
officials also made San Francisco a model for the fight against
AIDS, pushing new HIV infections down from an estimated high of 6,
000 in 1982 to a fairly steady 500 per year during 1990s.
</P>
<P>
City health officials, however, now estimate that, after years
of relative stability thanks to aggressive prevention programs,
safer-sex publicity and new drug treatments, new HIV infections in
San Francisco doubled to 900 in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The estimated total for 2000, however, is between 800 and 900,
with gay men accounting for about 575 of the new HIV infections,
Dr. Willi McFarland of the city's Department of Public Health said.
</P>
<P>
The latest released statistics show that, 1.3 percent of all
gay and bisexual men who were anonymously tested at San Francisco
clinics were diagnosed as HIV positive in 1997. That rose to 2.6
percent in 1998 and 3.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We see in San Francisco what is going to happen next in the
epidemic. We saw the first AIDS infection, and now we're seeing
the first rise in new infections," Dr. Thomas Coates, director of
the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California-San
Francisco, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We think this needs to be a wake-up call for the rest of the
nation," said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy director of the
National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors said the soaring rate of HIV infection, while
alarming, is no surprise. They have tracked a similar rise in
risky behavior as new AIDS drugs have made the disease seem less
threatening.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of gay men in San Francisco who reported always
using a condom during sex fell from 70 percent in 1994 to 54
percent in 1999, and the proportion who said they had unprotected
anal sex with more than one partner grew from 23 percent in 1994
to 43 percent in 1999, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 new HIV infections are reported each year in the
United States, with gays and bisexuals accounting for 40 percent
of that.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released in advance of the International AIDS
Conference, set for July 9-14 in Durban, South Africa.

<HEADLINE> No Trace of Survivors Found in Indonesian Ferry Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rescuers are still
struggling Saturday to find any survivors or wreckage from the
wooden-hulled Cahaya Bahari ship in the stormy waters of North
Sulawesi Province.
</P>
<P>
However, rescuers returning from search operations have
reported no trace of the ship or any other scattered items such as
baggage or wreckage of the ship, which left Tobelo on Halmahera in
North Maluku Province Wednesday en route to Manado, capital of
North Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Radio contact with the vessel was lost after its captain M.M.
Paparaga radioed an SOS advising that the ship was taking in water
fast during a violent storm at noon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to national newspapers Saturday, at least three
warships and a ship belonging to the search and rescue team have
been scouring the area where the ferry sank about 64 kilometers
off the northern coast of North Sulawesi, 2,300 kilometers
northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to locate the ship. The search will
continue as it is still unclear whether the ship has completely
sunk," Udianto, the administrative chief of the North Sulawesi
Ministry of Communications Office, was quoted by The Jakarta Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A navy reconnaissance plane and an air force helicopter were
also conducting an aerial search.
</P>
<P>
"We looked from the air and there was nothing to be found.
Usually when a boat goes down there is debris and bodies floating
in the water," Commander Djoko Sumaryono, head of the search and
rescue effort, told The Indonesian Observer.
</P>
<P>
Heavy seas, low cloud cover and strong tidal waves reaching
three meters high were hampering the search. A ferry of this kind
rarely comes equipped with adequate life jackets or lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said hopes of finding any survivors were fading.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a miracle if we find anyone still alive," head of
the Manado Search and Rescue Office Soleman told the Antara News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
There is conflicting data about the total number of passengers
on board as the Cahaya Bahari was licensed to carry only 270
people. The National Search and Rescue Agency claimed that at
least 492 passengers, refugees from Maluku and crew might have
been aboard.
</P>
<P>
In Manado Port, hundreds of anxious relatives sat waiting for
news of their loved ones. They swarmed the port soon after news
broke that the ship had gone missing on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Italian Expert Injured in Mine Sweeping Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An Italian mine-sweeping expert,
who works for the Slovenian Ronko mine clearance company, was
injured Thursday when a mine exploded in the border areas between
Albania and the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old expert, whose name was not given by the local
press, was one of the 22 specialists sent to Albania by the
Slovenian company.
</P>
<P>
He was also the first victim since the company began its mine
sweeping operations there on June 5.

Kosovo conflict broke out in 1999. Mine explosions have left 17
persons dead and more than 120 injured since the conflict ended.
</P>
<P>
The United States provided 2 million U.S. dollars to the
company for the mine-sweeping operation.

<HEADLINE> Italian Scientist Identifies Osteopetrosis Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Renato Dulbecco, a scientist with the
Italian Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technologies, announced
Saturday the identification of the gene responsible for malignant
osteopetrosis, a fatal hereditary disease which strikes one in 100,
000 newborns.
</P>
<P>
Dulbecco, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize for medicine,
explained in Italy's northern city Milan that the gene is
manifested as an alteration of bone structure which leads quickly
to death.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that the discovery of the
osteopetrosis gene is an important step in regulating bone
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
Dulbecco said that the results of research could lead to a
better understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, an
extremely widespread disease.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the institute said in the case of osteopetrosis,
the bone is harder than normal and is not modeled as it should be.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the marrow is unable to produce blood cells
in the quantities needed and the cranial nerves are progressively
compressed causing blindness and ultimately death.
</P>
<P>
Dulbecco said the identification of the gene will make early
diagnosis possible, with a uterine intervention, and
identification of the carrier of the recessive gene.
</P>
<P>
All the findings will be reported in the July edition of the
journal Nature Genetics.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Israeli-Palestinian Talks Should Be Based on U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government on Friday
said that Israeli and Palestinian negotiations should be based on
U.N. Security Council resolutions calling on Israel to return
territory it seized in the 1967 Middle East war in exchange for
peace.
</P>
<P>
"It's our view that all negotiations should be based on
Resolutions 242 and 338, all negotiations between Israel and the
Arabs, including the negotiations between the Israelis and the
Palestinians," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"That's the framework that we've always worked in and it's the
one we believe we should continue to work in," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to a question about an
Israeli court decision Friday on the applicability of U.N.
Resolution 242 adopted in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 338 was adopted in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein reportedly ruled
that the Palestinian Authority could not lay claim to the West
Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem under the resolutions because
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's government did not exist at the
time.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Schools Enroll Private Businessmen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Schools run by the Communist Party
of China (CPC), which previously enrolled only the Party elite,
have recently been eyed by private businessmen as excellent
training centers.
</P>
<P>
Created by the Party's committees at different levels, Party
schools are characterized by a special educational system designed
to spread Marxism among cadres. Doctoral programs are available
for the most distinguished students.
</P>
<P>
Now, courses targeting private businessmen have been launched
in Party schools at both central and local levels. Sources say
that the enthusiasm for applying a seat in a Party school is
soaring, particularly in the coastal regions where the market
economy is on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanju, president of the private-owned Chuanhua Corporation
in the coastal province of Zhejiang, and a Party school student,
said that the courses have helped him "thoroughly understand Deng
Xiaoping's theory and the Party's lines in the preliminary stage
of socialism."
</P>
<P>
Xu was enrolled in a master's degree-level business refresher
course in the provincial Party School. Xu said he supported the
Party members to establish a Party committee in his company.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
last month visited Xu's company and learned how a grass-roots
Party organization carries out its activities in a private company.
Jiang was pleased with Xu's success.
</P>
<P>
Xiaoluxia Party school is the first village-level Party school
in Zhejiang province. Every Saturday, the parking lot outside the
school is filled with the luxury cars owned by heads of private
companies.
</P>
<P>
"We want to know the Party's new policies, as we all remember
that it was the Party's policy that has made us rich," said Xie
Senmiao, a village entrepreneur who operates a successful
electrical fitting company.
</P>
<P>
Xie, like most private businessmen, is not a Party member.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 private companies in Xiaoluxia village,
pop. 2,000, which exported 25 million-U.S. dollars-worth of goods
last year.

<P>
Yu Zhangqian, deputy president of Xiaoluxia Party school, said
that Party school courses are very helpful because they always
provide useful guidance to the bosses, who are willing to re-
charge them with some knowledge after their businesses were
expanded.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee opened a course on the market economy for some 70
private businessmen from Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. It is the
first time the ruling Party of a socialist country has opened a
special class for private business people, who were previously
condemned as the "exploiting class."
</P>
<P>
The Party's doctrines are incorporated into the curriculum, as
well as China's economic development strategy, world economic
trends, high-technologies, regulations of the WTO, modern
enterprise systems and economic laws.
</P>
<P>
"The courses are very useful. I have become aware that China's
entry into the WTO means a great opportunity for my textile
company. I am ready to rake it in," Zhou Yanming, a private
business owner from Wenzhou said.
</P>
<P>
A teacher with the Party school's advanced studies department
said that the remarks by Jiang Zemin that the CPC represents the
development requirements of the advanced productive forces are
widely accepted among private businessmen, who know how they
themselves got rich under the leadership of the Party.
</P>
<P>
The teacher said that Party schools at various levels will
further satisfy the private businessmen's demands.
</P>
<P>
There are 80 million people engaged in private business in
China. At the suggestion of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese
lawmakers revised the constitution last year at the National
People's Congress, including a statement about the protection of
private business into the new version.
</P>
<P>
The CPC was set up on July 1, 1921, and now has more than 63
million members. Some 90 percent of the private companies in some
prosperous coastal provinces have set up CPC committees.

 Chinese Scientists Hails Mapping of Human Genome
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have highly praised the completion of the

beings know more about themselves and how to treat and prevent
some major diseases," said Yang Huanming, director of the Human
Genome Research Center of the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton E-Signs Electronic Signature Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Using a smart card and his
dog's name as password, U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday e-
signed into law a bill that gives electronic signatures the same
status as their ink-and-paper counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The president inserted the smart card into a computer and typed
in his dog's name, Buddy, as the password. After a while, the
computer screen said: "The Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act is now a law." The signing ceremony took
place in Congress Hall of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
"It works," Clinton told the audience of about 100 local
college students.
</P>
<P>
He said Americans will soon be able to use the cards "for
everything from hiring a lawyer to closing a mortgage."
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the electronic signature bill, passed in mid
June by Congress, will make it easier for both companies and
consumers to do business online.
</P>
<P>
For instance, computer users would be able to take out
mortgages, buy insurance, even enter a binding contract with their
roofer without ever leaving their home, signing a piece of paper
or waiting for back-and-forth of mailed paperwork.
</P>
<P>
And business negotiating contracts with each other could enter
binding agreements without having to send paper documents
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The bill could revolutionize banking by letting buyers close
mortgages and car loans 24 hours a day, said Jerry Buckley of the
Electronic Financial Services Council, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hogan, senior vice president of online brokerage DLJ
Direct said his company will let clients open accounts and receive
statements online.
</P>
<P>
The technology to allow for secure e-signatures is still being
developed, however. Among the approaches are encrypted numeric
coding devices and fingerprint or iris scans attached to computers
that verify a person's identity.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Warning for Star's Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Jelena Dokic's father Damir will be
banned from Wimbledon if there is any repeat of his misbehavior,
the All England Club has warned.
</P>
<P>
Dokic was led away by police on Thursday after an incident when
he smashed a journalist's mobile phone and uttered drunken rants
against the Women's Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
The police decided not to take any action against Dokic, who
also fell foul of the law at Edgbaston last year.
</P>
<P>
But an All England Club spokesman said: "Following discussions
with the WTA Tour, in the light of yesterday's incident we will be
monitoring the conduct of Mr Dokic closely."
</P>
<P>
"Should this again fall below acceptable standards it would
lead to Mr Dokic being banned from the grounds."
</P>
<P>
WTA Tour chief executive officer Bart McGuire backed the move,
saying: "If future disruptions occur on the site during this
tournament we would support the Club's removal of Mr Dokic from
the grounds."
</P>
<P>
He added that the WTA will be looking at the incident
separately and did not rule out further action being taken.
</P>
<P>
Dokic, 17, came through a doubles match today with Jennifer
Capriati, beating Conchita Martinez and Patricia Tarabini 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards she implored the Wimbledon authorities not to block
access to her father.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavia-born Australian said: "I have a great
relationship with my dad. He's always been with me and is a big
influence on me and my tennis. I like having him around."
</P>
<P>
"He knows my game more than anyone else, he's someone I can
work with. He's always on the court with me, we do things together.
Parents and the family are the biggest support you can have."
</P>
<P>
The incident yesterday culminated in her father shouting that
the WTA were run by "criminals and fascists". He was escorted to
the police office clutching a flag of St George.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham last year he was thrown out of the DFS Classic in
Edgbaston for making too much noise. He was then arrested by
police for lying down in the road.
</P>
<P>
During the Australian Open in January he was involved in a
scuffle with a camera crew.

<HEADLINE> Bidding Set to Open for Barmby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Everton are waiting for Liverpool to start the bidding for England
forward Nick Barmby.
</P>
<P>
The Goodison club are expecting an official approach from
Liverpool after Barmby told the Blues he wants to move across
Stanley Park to Anfield.
</P>
<P>
It is now down to Liverpool to follow up their initial interest
in Barmby after they had asked their Merseyside rivals to keep
them informed of developments.
</P>
<P>
The fee could prove to be a sticking point with the two clubs
likely to be miles apart in their valuations of the player.
</P>
<P>
Everton will at least want to recoup the 5.75 million pounds
they paid Middlesbrough for Barmby in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Reds may be reluctant to pay that much for a player with
just 12 months left on his contract who could join them for
nothing next summer.
</P>
<P>
Everton may consider a player in part exchange, with Titi
Camara or David Thompson being touted as possible makeweights in
any deal.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea have also been linked with Barmby and Smith has
transfer-listed him in a bid to speed up his sale regardless of
the buyer.

<HEADLINE> Sidot: "I'm not Racist" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Anne-Gaelle Sidot, the French
player alleged to be part of a racist campaign against American
rival Alexandra Stevenson and her mother Samantha, bowed out of
Wimbledon insisting that her accusers were guilty of talking
through their hats.
</P>
<P>
Sidot, 20, who went out after an exciting three-set third-round
match against Thailand's Tammy Tanasugarn having beaten Russian
pin-up Anna Kournikova in the second, admitted she had pulled
Samantha Stevenson's straw hat down over her ears following a
practice-court row.
</P>
<P>
It happened at Birmingham's Edgbaston Priory Club more than a
year ago and Sidot claimed she had only done it because she had
been verbally insulted by the woman who is popularly known among
other players on the Women's Tour as "the mother from hell".
</P>
<P>
Sidot is amazed that the incident has been brought up only now
by Stevenson, who revealed it after her own second-round defeat by
Austrian Paula Wartusch on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sidot said: "I just tried to forget it when I played today. She
says these things but you don't have to believe what she says and
I'm not upset about it because I know I'm not a racist."
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand her because, I mean, I never had any
problems with players or coaches before. Really, this is the first
time with me but not with everybody else. Maybe she just doesn't
feel good in this world, but that's her problem, not mine," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Stevensons made a shoal of headlines last year at Wimbledon
when Alexandra, 19, became the first women qualifier to reach a
semi-final. There seemed to be a new controversy raised in news
conferences after every match she played.
</P>
<P>
First, her mother spoke about her worries for her daughter over
the "lesbian tendency" in women's tennis. Then there was the
debate, raised by a journalist from the United States, over the
identity of Alexandra's father, said to be a top former black
American basketball star.
</P>
<P>
Just as this year, the race-card was also played by the
Stevensons.
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's latest diatribe told how she is often treated like
a second-class citizen in major stores when she goes shopping and
she also claimed that another French player Amelie Cocheteux
racially abused her during a match. Meanwhile Mrs Stevenson
alleged her daughter was stalked by Sidot at the French
Championships a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Stevenson said she also feared Alexandra would suffer "A
Tonya Harding incident" - a reference to the American ice skater
who conspired to have her main rival Nancy Kerrigan attacked with
an iron bar before the 1994 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But the Women's Tour Association have so far received no
documented complaints despite requesting them from the Stevensons
after the French Open.
</P>
<P>
And it is clear that many players on the tour believe the pair
are just to have a grand plan to install Alexandra as a
controversial celebrity in the public perception. After all, they
point out, the teenager's stated ambition is to attend the Yale
School of Drama and become an actress after her tennis career is
over.
</P>
<P>
There will not be many of them sad to see the back of her at
Wimbledon, but Sidot's exit provoked mixed feelings. She produced
another gutsy display against Tanasugarn but was not quite good
enough to prevent the American-born Thai girl reaching the fourth
round for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Tanasugarn, who has already reached two finals on grass in
Britain this summer - losing both to British number one Louise
Latimer at Surbiton and American Lisa Raymond at Birmingham -
raced through the first set 6-1 in just 23 minutes but Sidot
leveled matters with a 6-4 success only to be edged out by the
same score in a 48-minute decider.

<HEADLINE> England World Cup Bid Suffers Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England's 2006 campaign team had reacted angrily to the secret
document drawn up by FIFA which it is understood was leaked to the
FA.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa was seen as the favorite on subjective
grounds, England's bid was widely considered to be the best in
terms of infrastructure and stadia - a view which was reinforced
by the glowing praise from FIFA's inspection team when it visited
England last October.
</P>
<P>
However, FIFA insist that although categories have been used
the countries have not been ranked.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman said: "As you probably know FIFA conducted an
inspection visit of each of the five bidding countries and looked
at various things, such as stadia, infrastructure,
telecommunications etc and compiled a report for the executive
committee."
</P>
<P>
"Various countries were put into certain categories according
to competence or facilities... but this does not constitute a
ranking. There's no ranking that says England are third choice or
that Germany are second choice and South Africa first choice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
England's 2006 campaign chief Alec McGivan told the BBC that
they were "very angry".
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to praise those bids, and we accept that. But
to suggest that England, after investing so much in the
development of grounds, is not as ready as other two is amazing.
We will take it up with FIFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which could prove to be the fatal blow for England'
s World Cup hopes has been sent to FIFA's 24 executive committee
members ahead of the selection vote in Zurich on July 6.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Advances, Enqvist Moves Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Andre Agassi of the
United States just had a narrow escape at the Wimbledon tennis
championships on Friday after saving two match points in a 6-4, 2-
6,7-6, 2-6, 10-8 victory over compatriot Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Thomas Enqvist, one of only two seeds left in the
top half of the draw, also came through a grueling five-setter
with German qualifier Christian Vinck to move into the last 16.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Pete Sampras has another day to recover from
a leg injury picked up on Wednesday after his third round match
against fellow American Justin Gimelstob was held over until
Saturday because of rain.
</P>
<P>
Women's top seed Martina Hingis swept past Croatia's Silvija
Talaja while eighth seed Serena Williams wasted little time
disposing of Cristina Torrens-Valero of Spain 6-2, 6-1 - the U.S.
Open champion has lost just nine games in three rounds.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Byron Black sailed into the last 16 at Wimbledon for
the first time in his life and has his sights set on making the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Black, a rare grasscourt specialist in his half of
the draw, thrashed Spaniard Albert Portas 6-2, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
With the early culling of seeds -- Magnus Norman, Greg Rusedski,
Richard Krajicek and Cedric Pioline have all vanished from Black's
quarter of the draw -- the veteran Zimbabwean now has no seeded
players between him and the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
He will next face Italian veteran Gianluca Pozzi, at 35 the
oldest player in the men's singles, who ended the giant-killing
run of Belgian qualifier Olivier Rochus 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Belarus qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov, a former boy's singles
champion here, defeated Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco 7-6 (7-4), 7-
5,7-6 and will play Wayne Ferreira in the last 16 after the South
African beat Andrei Pavel 3-6, 7-6, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman steered a course into the fourth round
with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory over qualifier Neville Godwin of
South Africa. His next opponent could be top seed Sampras.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Condemns Angolan Rebels for Continuing War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Friday strongly accused the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
of violating peace agreement and continuing war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session of a five-day meeting of the
Angola-Zambia Joint Permanent Commission on Defense and Security,
Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said "the current situation
of conflict in the Republic of Angola continues to be a source of
great concern to my government."

<P>
He said "UNITA-Savimbi's intransigence, as we all know, is
responsible for the collapse of the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol on
Angola."
</P>
<P>
"This sad development denied us of yet another golden
opportunity that should have brought about lasting peace to
Angola," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampa called on all peace-loving countries to continue and
intensify renewed efforts to realize peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The cost of war to the Angolan people in terms of loss of human
life, forced migrations and economic development is one that can
not be redeemed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, we in Zambia have paid a high price for the war not
only in terms of the loss of lives of our people and the
displacement of those in the vicinity of the common border, but
also in terms of handling the refugee problem," the Zambian
minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is with these realities, he said, Zambia fully supports the
U.N.- imposed sanctions against UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi and all
other initiatives taken under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity and the Southern African Development Community to
resolve the protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
Sampa assured Angola that his country will do all it can to
deny UNITA- Savimbi and his war machinery territorial transit
facilities for its logistical shipments.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants of the session to consider any other
measures that the two countries can take to help put an end to the
wanton destruction of human life and property in Angola
perpetrated by UNITA- Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Angolan Home Affairs Minister Fernando
Dos Santos said the best way to remove obstacles between the sides
is dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He called for joint efforts to sort out the obstacles and
promote closer bilateral relations, stressing that his country
will honor its commitment to ensuring security on the common
border area.
</P>
<P>
Angola has accused Zambia of allowing its territory to be used
to transport military and logistical supplies to UNITA but the
latter denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Worldwide Reaffirm Cause of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 scientists from
around the world have united to prepare a resounding assertion
that HIV causes AIDS, a U.S.-based global perception management/
communication consulting firm reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Burson-Marsteller, their statement, called the
Durban Declaration, calls for an immediate end to the debate on
the fundamental causal relationship between HIV and AIDS, noting
that the insistence of a vocal minority in denying that HIV causes
AIDS "will cost countless lives."
</P>
<P>
The name of the declaration, to be published in the coming
issue of Nature, refers to Durban, South Africa, site of the 13th
International AIDS Conference to begin July 9.
</P>
<P>
It affirms that the scientific evidence supporting the link
between HIV and AIDS is "clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous."
It stresses that the data, compiled from years of HIV/AIDS
research, "fulfill exactly the same criteria as for other viral
diseases, such as polio, measles and smallpox."
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories of the declaration are 11 Nobel Laureates
as well as directors of leading research institutes, academies and
medical societies.
</P>
<P>
Burson-Marsteller said that the document comes at a time when
19 million people have already died of AIDS in less than 20 years
since the emergence of the disease. More than 34 million people
are now living with HIV-AIDS, of whom 24 million live in sub-
Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Among those who have challenged the virus-AIDS is Peter
Duesberg, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the
University of California-Berkeley. He has proposed the hypothesis
that the various AIDS diseases are brought on by the long-term
consumption of recreational drugs or AZT itself, which is
prescribed to prevent or treat AIDS. His Web site contains his
written works on the subject as well as other scientists,
including two Nobel prize winners, who support his views.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak Discuss Middle East Peace Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak discussed prospects for the
Middle East peace process in a phone call on Saturday but made no
decision on whether to hold a three-way summit with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the 45-minute call was a "serious conversation" on the issues
involved in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the peace process, no decisions have been made," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He did not ruled out the possibility that Clinton would also
talk to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians have set September 13 as the
deadline for a
final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Barak hope to have a summit with Arafat in the
near future to hammer out details for a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have argued, however, that a summit was
doomed to fail without a further narrowing of the gaps, and have
asked for more talks at a lower level.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Candidate Promises to Promote Mexico's International Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential candidate Francisco
Labastida promised Saturday that if he wins Sunday's elections he
will "deepen" Mexico's relations with Latin America, especially
with Central America, and with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Some hours before the crucial presidential elections, the most
competed for in the history of the country, Labastida said that
his government would promote "areas of wider development with
Central America," including not only trade , but also the fields
of culture and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Central America will be "a prioritary area" for
Mexico in his government, said Labastida.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government he will preside will develop "very
close relations" with Latin American countries, including Cuba. "
We would seek to strengthen them."
</P>
<P>
Labastida met Saturday morning at a Mexico City hotel with
donzens of correspondents and special envoys from various
countries who will cover the elections.
</P>
<P>
The PRI candidate also mentioned Mexico's relations with the
United States and Canada, its partners since 1994 in the North
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
He said he will expand the relations with the United States and
Canada, " and go on to fields still not touched," but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the relations his government would develop with
other countries, Labastida said that he would expand the ties of
Mexico with Russia, Japan, and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Labastida, convinced that he will win Sunday's elections, even
forecast he would defeat his closest rival by a margin of two
million votes.
</P>
<P>
Labastida faces Vicente Fox, the candidate of the extreme right
opposition Alliance for Change, led by the National Action Party (
PAN), in the most fierce fighting of the Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took power in 1929,
with opinion polls predicting a neck and neck race between the PRI
's Francisco Labastida and conservative candidate Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
The almost 59 million eligible voters are also called upon to
choose a new 500-member Congress, replace 128 Senators, elect
three state governors and pick a new mayor for Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), whose
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas runs a distant third in
opinion polls, appears certain to retain the government of the
Mexican capital, while the PRI is unlikely to regain the
congressional majority it lost in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill to Ban Secret Political Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday signed legislation to ban unlimited secret political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The law "will help clean up the system by forcing organizations
to come clean about their donors," Clinton said on the White House
's South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the law as the first new restriction on political money
in 20 years, Clinton said Congress should move quickly to use it
as a building block for comprehensive campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good law, an I thank everyone for voting for it,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which passed the Senate Thursday by a vote of
92-6, addressed the U.S. Tax Code known as Section 527, which
permitted tax-exempt groups to use hidden, undisclosed donors to
pay for advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Citing an organization called Citizens for Better Medicare as
example, Clinton said the organization "has flooded the airwaves
with negative ads."
</P>
<P>
He also said some private-interest organizations such as
pharmaceutical companies, trying to influence the debate over a
prescription drug benefit for older Americans, could "pour
millions of dollars into these efforts while keeping citizens in
the dark."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Considers Evacuating Penguins From Polluted Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South African authorities are
considering the evacuation of 55,000 penguins from Dassen Island
in Western Cape after the island was polluted by oil spill.
</P>
<P>
Schalk Carstens, deputy-director of disaster management in
Western Cape, said on Saturday that a meeting would be held soon
to discuss the latest development.
</P>
<P>
He said all the penguins affected by last Friday's oil spill
from the bulk oil carrier, Treasure, were being evacuated on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"But at this stage the clean birds are still remaining on the
island," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carstens said although it was a "very bad situation",
everything was still under control, adding: "We are closely
monitoring the situation."
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists held that it might not be necessary to
evacuate the birds off Dassen Island.
</P>
<P>
They have been fenced in to prevent them leaving the island and
entering the sea after oil from the sunken Treasure encircled the
island.
</P>
<P>
An aerial picture taken in the vicinity of the island showed
that strong sea currents and the wind appeared to be causing the
oil slick to drift past the island.
</P>
<P>
A change in weather conditions -- which was likely -- could
result in the oil being blown away from the island and then the
pollution would not be as bad as feared earlier.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 penguins had so far been taken off Dassen
Island and were being rehabilitated in Salt River.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the South African National Foundation for the
 Conservation of Coastal Birds, Christina Pretorius, said 400
penguin chicks were being cared for at a private sanctuary in
Melkbosstrand on the Cape West coast where they would be hand-fed
and reared. A further 94 chicks were being cared for in a separate
facility in Milnerton.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a second batch of 160 penguins was trucked overnight
to Port Elizabeth and released into the sea in Algoa Bay on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges African Unity for Fair Global Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has urged African countries to stand together in demanding
for a more just trade and investment regime so as to participate
effectively in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an official dinner hosted for visiting Namibian
President Sam Nujoma in Dar es Salaam on Saturday, Mkapa said
there is no way a poor African country can, on its own, face the
challenge of the process under an unfair world economic order.
</P>
<P>
"Our only hope is in standing together. United we stand,
divided we fall. We must not waver from demanding a more just
world trade and investment regime no matter how formidable the
odds," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He warned that given the ever widening wealth gap between the
rich and the poor, African countries are standing higher chances
of being net losers in the evolving world trade regime.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, at the beginning of the 20th
century, the wealth gap between developing and industrialized
world was one U.S. dollar to nine U.S. dollars, while at the end
of the century, it widened disproportionately to one U.S. dollar
to 65 U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Africa received marginal interest by foreign
investors and he wondered if there is sufficient political will in
governments of rich countries to facilitate the transfer of a fair
share of technology and production activities to Africa.
</P>
<P>
He cited last year when Africa, including South Africa,
received only 11 billion U.S. dollars or 1.3 percent of the 827
billion U.S. dollars inward investment in the world.
</P>
<P>
That is why African countries must stand together and help each
other and increase the speed at which they share experiences and
facilities and integrate their economies, said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
On democracy, he said there is no uniformity in the entire
world and stressed the need for African countries, like other
countries elsewhere, to continuously seek to improve democracy and
governance in accordance with its own history and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Some of those who today appear so intolerant of the
imperfections of African democracy have conveniently forgotten
that when they colonized us, they permit us no right to vote at
all," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the attempts during the recent Zimbabwean
parliamentary elections to vilify the contribution of those who
fought for the freedom of that country and its people, saying such
move is an insult to not only Zimbabwean freedom fighters, but
those who worked hard to rid all of Southern Africa of colonialism
and racist minority rule.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Nujoma arrived here Saturday for a three-day
state visit during which he will officially open the 24th Dar es
Salaam International Trade Fair on Sunday.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defence Secretary William
Cohen said Saturday that the United States may review the size of
its military presence in South Korea if relations between Seoul
and Pyongyang continue to improve,
</P>
<P>
"So I would say, at some time in the future, depending on the

Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) decide to unite.
</P>
<P>
"I think our troops should remain there, even if there were to
be a unification or some kind of federation, a confederation or
whatever the political arrangement might evolve," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently maintains 37,000 troops in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula is
facing increased criticism in the aftermath of last month's
historic summit in Pyongyang between DPRK leader Kim Jong-Il and
South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung.

<HEADLINE> Chile To Create Fund for Exports Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government announced
Saturday that it will have ready in one hundred days the project
for a Fund for Exports Protection, said Economy, Mining, and
Energy Minister Jose de Gregorio.
</P>
<P>
The project is the answer to businessmen concerns over the
recent abundance of accusations and threats to Chilean exports,
said De Gregorio, adding that it will be necessary to define who
will administer it.
</P>
<P>
De Gregorio announced that private entities will take part in
the administration of these resources and that it will not
necessarily be a project that will need a parliamentary processing.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that this and other themes related to
the modernization of the exporting activity will be jointly
tackled with the private sector through the creation of working
groups.
</P>
<P>
Chile is negotiating at this time a political, economic, and
cooperation association with the European Union (EU), its
inclusion as a full member of Mercosur, and a free trade agreement
with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chile is an associate member of the Southern Common
Market, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil, followed by the United States, Mexico
and the EU, are the countries that raise more barriers to their
commerce with Chile.
