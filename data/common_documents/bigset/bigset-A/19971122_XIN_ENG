<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Coalition Endorses Formation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of all 14
component parties of Malaysia's ruling National Front today
endorsed the formation of the proposed National Economic Action
Council (NEAC) for helping the government solve present economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement was given at a special meeting of the National
Front Supreme Council chaired by its chairman Mahathir Mohamad
here today.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC was proposed by the ruling party United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) led by Mahathir at an UMNO Supreme
Council meeting Thursday night and it will be established next
month.
</P>
<P>
The proposed NEAC will function as an advisory body to the
government on the measures needed to be taken to overcome the
effects on the economy following the fall in the value of the
Malaysian currency ringgit and the stock market, Prime Minister
Mahathir told reporters after today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NEAC would include cabinet ministers involved
in economic matters as well as professionals in the field. The
council would not take on the role of the cabinet, but the two
would cooperate with each other, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All the leaders have pledged to take action to overcome the
effects on the national economy arising from the ringgit
depreciation and the fall in the stock market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of the NEAC would enable the government
to take immediate action with the powers entrusted to it by the
cabinet while the ministries would implement the decisions made by
the council.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC would report to the cabinet from time to time,
Mahathir said.

MADRID, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Valencia coach Claudio Ranieri
on Friday sidelined Brazilian super star Romario from the line-up
for this weekend's league match with Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Romario said earlier in the week that he wanted to go back
home in a bid to secure a place in the Brazilian World Cup
squad.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri responded by saying that he will not do anything to
stop the striker if he leaves.
</P>
<P>
Romario joined Valencia last summer, but quickly went back
to Brazil on loan to Flamengo. Flamengo officials quoted in the
Spanish press have said Romario is unlikely to return to the
club.

<HEADLINE> WMO Holds Meeting on El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) held a first follow-up meeting on El Nino here
today after a United Nations inter-agency task force on the
phenomenon was set up on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will provide scientific and technical information
on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces
acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect
weather patterns in many areas of the globe.
</P>
<P>
According to WMO, strong warm episode (El Nino) conditions have
persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997. Sea surface
temperatures throughout the equatorial east-central Pacific
increased during April and May, when temperatures normally
decrease in this region.
</P>
<P>
During August and September, ocean surface temperatures reached
near-record levels in many sections of the equatorial Pacific.
Departures from normal exceeded +4 degrees Celsius along the
Equator east of 120 degrees West, and were greater than +5 degrees
Celsius near the Galapagos Islands and along the coast of northern
Peru, WMO says in its new publication, El Nino Update.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Calls for Formulation of East African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister
Musalia Mudavadi today urged the business community in three East
African countries to draw investment guidelines in order to
promote regional investment.
</P>
<P>
Opening the East African Secretariat Joint Investment
Promotion Seminar here, the minister noted that an important
issue the seminar should address is the appropriate investment
guidelines designed to guide local people to invest
within the region.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the challenge to the business community in
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda is to move away from the traditional
economic activities of producing commodities such as coffee, tea,
sisal, cotton or minerals for export.
</P>
<P>
To escape from the vagaries of price fluctuations in the
international commodity markets, Mudavadi stressed, "We must
shift our emphasis to non-traditional exports."
</P>
<P>
"We need to invest in food processing, production of
manufactured goods and production of high value goods and
services," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said that the enlarged market in East
African region will enable the three countries to attract more
investment.
</P>
<P>
He urged the recently formed East African Business Council to
play an important role in identifying opportunities for
investments, markets for finished goods, services and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that over the last couple of years, the
three member countries had been implementing a series of economic
reform measures to facilitate regional trade and investments.
</P>
<P>
The three East African governments endeavor to create a
conducive environment for regional investment, he said, adding
that "It is the responsibility of the business community to take
up the challenges together with the opportunities the
co-operation has created."
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is the first of the East African
Co-operation joint investment promotion seminar which will be
held in rotation in member countries.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar were representatives from the Kenya
Investment Promotion Center, the Uganda Investment Authority, the
Tanzania Investment Center and the Zanzibar Investment Promotion
Agency, and about 150 local private investors.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Increase Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Some Zambian parliament
members today urged the government to increase education
budgetary allocation to more than 15 percent by the year 2000
from the current nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Kasuka Mutukwa, Chairman of the Select Committee on Education,
Science and Technology, said education in Zambia is not
adequately funded and that the utilization of available resources
has not positively contributed to national development.
</P>
<P>
"Our committee, therefore, wishes to recommend that resource
allocation to education be increased to at least 15 percent of
the national budget by the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Independent parliament member Robert Sichinga warned that in
the 21st century countries lag behind in education, science and
technology will face stiff competition from other advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for a massive investment in education in order to
reduce the high level of illiteracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another independent parliament member, Crispin Sibetta said
the country has been robbed of highly energetic and educated
teachers who have migrated to neighboring countries in search for
greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
He said early retirement coupled with deplorable conditions of
service have forced highly qualified teachers out of the
education system in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to improve the conditions of service
for teachers in rural areas by providing them with hardship
allowances, decent houses and promotion opportunities as a way of
attracting more teachers in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye conceded
that education in Zambia is the least funded in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the government is making frantic
efforts to raise the standard of education.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will ensure increased
enrollment in schools, quality education through the provision of
text books and equal opportunities in education for both sexes.

<HEADLINE> UNDP: DPRK Needs Sustainable Support for Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The emergency response of the
donor community to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) cannot provide a sustainable solution to the food shortage
in the country, said the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
here today.
</P>
<P>
What DPRK needs, UNDP said, is a general rehabilitation of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is doing a lot in North Korea,"
said Christian Lemaire, UNDP Resident Representative in DPRK. "But
the crisis will be ongoing if we keep conceiving aid as a
hand-out. We need funding and implementation of sustainable
practices if we are to help the country get back on its feet."
</P>
<P>
As one of the successful initiatives, UNDP said, the first
cooperation to rehabilitate the agricultural sector between DPRK
and the Republic of Korea will shift an initial 1.2-million-dollar
worth of heavy equipment directly from the South Korean port of
Inchon to DPRK's Nampo Port on November 22.
</P>
<P>
Other successful initiatives this year have included the
first-ever double crop program which was implemented on some
30,000 hectares of land and yielded 65,000 tons of grain. A
cooperation in the rehabilitation of agriculture has started
between DPRK and China.

<HEADLINE> France to Put on Trial 38 Involved in Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- France will put on trial from
Monday in Paris 38 people, most of them Algerians or naturalized
immigrants, who were accused of running a logistic back-up network
for terrorists in Algeria, said judicial sources in Paris.
</P>
<P>
These people were arrested in August 1985, when French police
launched a campaign against terrorists after France was struck by
a wave of terrorist attacks claimed by the Algerian Islamic
militant group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).
</P>
<P>
All the accused could face 10 years in prison for "association
with wrongdoers in relations with a terrorist enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Most of the accused, who were from the region of Rhone-Alpes in
southeast France, were arrested after a home-made bomb was found
on a TGV bullet train from Lyon to Paris in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Police tracked down the Islamist suspects in the Rhone-Alpes
region and discovered a Islamic support network spreading into
several European countries including Belgium, Germany, Italy and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The network was involved in "recruitment of activists,
spreading information on GIA, looking for fund, arms and other
materials for the Algerian GIA guerrillas, their transportation
and the transportation of combatants toward Algeria and provision
of false government documents."

HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education, Sports

throughout the country that the government will take stern
measures against students demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Machinga, who was touring a former army establishment in
Nyajena in southern Zimbabwe which will soon be converted into a
secondary school, said pupils should concentrate on their school
work rather than resort to violence.
</P>

"We are going to be very strict with student who engage in
demonstrations," he said. They forget they are primarily at school to
learn, he added.
</P>
<P>
His warning came in the wake of violent demonstrations by
students countrywide who destroyed property worth of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Serge Dassault, the president of
the Dassault Industries group of France which makes Mirage and
Rafale combat aircraft, today described as "fiction" the theory
that a merger between his company and the state-run Aerospatiale
group will help compete with the Americans in airspace market.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Dassault said that he has nothing to
gain if the Dassault Aviation, an affiliate group of Dassault
Industrie, combines its activities with those of Aerospatiale,
which makes Airbus and ATR civilian planes.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fiction to think that one should put together the
civil with the military because the Americans are concentrated and
one should do the same," said Dassault.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of France supports a combination of
France's best high-tech companies, including airspace companies,
to compete with U.S. airspace giants such as Boeing-McDonnell
Douglas and Lockheed-Martin, which had experienced a series of
mergers lately.
</P>
<P>
"One should not do the same unless the industrialists have an
interest to do it," said Dassault, adding that he prefered to
"be small and gain money" and to have "good materials and
competent men."

<HEADLINE> France Congratulates Georgian President on Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- France today congratulated
Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze on the agreement concluded
lately in Geneva between Georgia and Abkhazian separatists.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said that
much work remains to be done to obtain a global solution to the
conflict and to restore territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"France can already congratulate the relaunch and primary
progress of the talks thanks to the efforts jointly made by the
United Nations, the Russian diplomacy and President Shevardnadze,
whose courageous initiatives have contributed to allowing this
resumption of dialogue between the two sides," she said.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, Britain and the United States have played the
role of observers in the negotiations between Georgian government
and Abkhazians, while Russia played the role as a "facilitator."
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to establish a council of coordination on
security, refugees and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
From 3,000 to 10,000 people were estimated to have been killed

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Stocks Enough Maize Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Zimbabwe) -- The Zimbabwe Agricultural
Commodity Exchange (ZIMACE) today ruled out rumors of
insufficient maize stocks on the market following speculative
economic situation and the unprecedented fall of local currency
last week.
</P>
<P>
In its review of weekly marketing trends, ZIMACE said maize
continued to be a major trader, with a wider variety of
commodities being sold than in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Despite rumours to the contrary, there appears to be
sufficient maize in the market with millers indicating they had
sufficient stocks until the New Year," ZIMMAC noted.
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to the agency, there had been a swing in
the market with more offers to sell maize than there were buyers
at present.
</P>
<P>
However, ZIMACE noted that this situation could change just as
quickly and producers and buyers needed to monitor the market
fairly closely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ZIMACE said, although there had been problems with
the quality of some of this year's wheat crop, producers could
take comfort from the increasing number of bids being registered
for both undergrade and sample grade wheat.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for this quality of wheat are also increasing and it
would seem that there is definitely a market for it," it added.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges Israel to Stop Settlement Activities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief peace
negotiator Saeb Erekat today urged Israel to stop the settlement
activities in the West Bank city of Hebron, reports reaching here
from the Gaza Strip said.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to the Israeli negotiation team, the Palestinian
official said Israel's violation of the signed peace accords, the
kidnaping of the Palestinian civilians and settlement activities
in Hebron will lead to the undermining of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat asked Israel to release two Palestinian youths and two
soldiers detained by the Israeli forces in the West Bank recently.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israel to set free Ataf Alayan, a female
Palestinian prisoner who was rearrested by the Israeli police last
month after she was released several months ago from Israeli
prison under the Oslo accords signed by Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Alayan went on a hunger strike to protest against the arrest
and her detention without charge by Israel. Her hunger strike has
entered the fourth week.
</P>
<P>
In his note, Erekat condemned the Israeli decision to expand
the settlement activities in Hebron and deemed it a grave
violation of the agreement signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Erekat has earlier sent a similar note to the office of Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Rallies Held to Defend Supreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Massive rallies and
demonstrations were held across Iran today in show of support for
the country's supreme leadership Velayat-e-Faqih (Governance of
Supreme Jurisprudent).
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the rallies
were held after the normal Friday prayer congregations in various
cities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators attacked the recent remarks of some senior
religious figures of the country, including Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, the former designate successor of Iran's late Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Rowhollah Masavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
They have reportedly said the supreme leader, whose duty was to
supervise the country's affairs, had no right to directly handle
concrete issues.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that demonstrators today condemned the remarks
about the supreme leadership and reiterated their allegiance with
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Tehran, Iran's judiciary chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi also blasted the remarks over the issue, saying
that it was a plot which had originated from the elements from
outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Khamenei is both the leader of Islamic revolution
and one of the highest authorities among the world's Shiites,
Yazdi said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, hundreds of religious instructors and students
stormed the office and residence of Ayatollah Montazeri in the
religious city of Qom, showing their protest to his recent
statement about the legitimacy of the supreme leadership.

<HEADLINE> World Sugar Production Forecast to Fall in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- World sugar production is
expected to fall to 122.8 million tons this year, 320,000 tons
less than last year, Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Czarnikow, a sugar market analyst, was quoted by the newspaper
as also reducing its forecast for global sugar consumption for
1998 from 124.37 million tons to 123.98 million tons, compared
with the expected 121.91 million tons for this year.
</P>
<P>
The sugar analyst said in its latest sugar review that sugar
production levels in the European Union countries have outstripped
forecasts earlier this year and its total beet crop is now put at
19.05 million tons, an increase of 1.07 million tons over last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, sugar production in Russia and Ukraine have slipped
back sharply and it forecast a combined production drop of 1.19
tons in east Europe.
</P>
<P>
It continued to forecast India's sugar production for this
season at 11.69 million tons, and said that India will need to
import sugar for its third-quarter supplies next year.

<HEADLINE> Ogata Urges Bosnia to Allow Return of Minority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minorities must be
allowed to return safely to Bosnia and Herzegovina, United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees Mrs Sadako Ogata said in a
statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
"I was encouraged to see returnees rebuilding their houses, but
so far only a fraction of those who lost their homes during the
war have returned," said Ogata, who had a three-day visit to the
region recently.
</P>
<P>
"Next year must become the year of minority returns," Ogata
pointed out, saying that particular emphasis must be placed on the
return of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued one month before the second
anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accord signed in Dayton, Ohio, on
November 21, 1995, which ended the four-year civil war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The war forced some 2.3 million Bosnians to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 Bosnians returned both from abroad and within
Bosnia-Herzegovina since the Dayton Accord, according to UNHCR.
But the vast majority of them returned to areas controlled by
their own ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
There are still some 700,000 refugees and an additional 800,000
remain displaced within Bosnia-Herzegovina, most of whom are
unable to return to places where they would be in a minority,
UNHCR says.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Russia not to Influence U.S. on Iraq Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia, though having
defused standoff on the weapons inspections by persuading Iraq
to back down, would not influence the United States in getting
sanctions on Baghdad to be lifted, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
There is "no quick answer" to the question of lifting the
sanctions on Iraq, Albright told ABC's "Good Morning America"
when asked if Russia could influence the United States in voting
for that.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the last six and one-half years and during the
four years that I was at the U.N., the Russians did the same
thing. They would argue the case of lifting sanctions," she
said.
</P>
<P>
But "we always made it very clear, first of all, that the
United States would not agree until Saddam Hussein fulfilled his
obligations under the relevant sanctions resolutions, and
second, ultimately the rest of the Security Council agreed with
us."
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with CNN, Albright thanked Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov for his mediation role in
breaking the deadlock of the weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
"What Mr Primakov has done was very useful. We appreciated
the work that Mr. Primakov had done," she said.

<HEADLINE> 120,000 Kenyans Facing Starvation in Wajir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
airlift emergency food supplies and drugs to Wajir District in
Northeastern Province to curb a looming food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Wajir District Commissioner David Mutemi was quoted as saying
Thursday that more than 120,000 people are facing starvation in
the district due to the current floods.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the road between Nairobi and Wajir had been
heavily flooded by torrential rains in the past month, making it
difficult to transport food to the district.
</P>
<P>
John Koech, Minister of State in the Office of the President,
who is leading a national disaster management team to assess the
flood situation, said in Wajir that the district had been worst
hit by the heavy rains in the past one month in the East African
country.
</P>
<P>
He directed the National Cereal and Produce Board to
distribute the available 500,000 bags (90 kilograms per bag) of
maize to the needy families in the district.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced Wednesday that the
government had declared the Northeastern Province a flood
disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
The Mandera District of the disaster province are facing fuel
crisis with all government departments and other organizations
going to cease their operations in four days time due to lack of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
District Commissioner Richard Rakuomi told Kenya News Agency
today that out of the five filling stations in the district, only
one is supplying fuel while others have gone out of stock.
</P>
<P>
He noted that their tankers had stalled on the roads between
Isiolo and Mandera and between Garissa and Mandera as a result of
heavy rains which have hit the area in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a local businessman as saying today that his
efforts to import the commodity from neighboring countries by
road proved futile when his convoy of 10 tankers got stuck in
Somalia and three in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Army Warns Israel Against Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Israeli South Lebanese
Army (SLA) Commander Antoine Lahd said today that Israel will be
perceived as a "traitor" if it withdraws from Lebanon without
considering the needs of the people there.
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanese National News Agency reported that the
commander of the Israeli-backed militia made the warning in a
letter to Israeli opposition legislator Yossi Beilin, who is
leading a grass-root campaign for a unilateral withdrawal from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
With mounting Israeli military casualties in south Lebanon
caused by resistance of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas,
opposition to continuous occupation and calls for unconditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon is becoming stronger in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The possible withdrawal from Lebanon cannot be considered an
internal Israeli issue, as it directly affects the future of the
area's inhabitants who have fought alongside with you," Lahd
wrote to Beilin.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will be perceived as a traitor," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, with its 2,500 militiamen, is controlling Lebanon's
southern city of Jezzine which faces the 1,200-square-kilometer
buffer zone in south Lebanon which was set up by Israel in 1985 to
protect its northern towns from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has an estimated 2,000 soldiers in the so-called
"security zone."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea to Conduct Trade in U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Economic
Development and Cooperation Girma Birru said today business
transaction between Ethiopia and Eritrea will as of tomorrow be
conducted in U.S. Dr and other world-recognized hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made here after Eritrea introduced its
own currency Nakfa on November 8 after using the Ethiopian
currency Birr since its independence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the local press on the new business relationship
between the two countries, the Ethiopian minister said the two
countries have agreed on the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has been necessitated, Birru said, as a result
of the different financial and trade policies prevailing in both
countries, which will pose problems on both economies under
different scheme than the one already agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Beginning tomorrow, he said, transactions between Eritrea and
Ethiopia will be conducted through bank guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopia's Ministry of Trade and Industry today
issued a directive regarding small cross-border business
activities along the Ethio-Eritrean border.
</P>
<P>
According to the directive, the value of commodities crossing
the border cannot exceed 2,000 Birr (about 294 US dollars). The
directive stipulates that any person intending to engage in small
cross-border trade should obtain licenses from the relevant
authorities.
</P>
<P>
This decision will not have a significant impact on the
balance of trade of both countries, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> UN Wants All-Round Settlement to Cyprus: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Special Advisor for Cyprus Diego Cordovez said here today
that both he and the U.N. chief want to reach a comprehensive
settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press conference at the end of his
three-day fact-finding mission in Cyprus, during which he had
separate meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez arrived here late Tuesday night for his first visit to
the island since he was named special Cyprus envoy by Kofi Annan
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez told reporters that he felt there was "historic
distrust" between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus with
neither side believing that the other wants an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The worst enemy of an agreement is distrust and distrust is
very high in this case," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said he will visit the island in March,
immediately after February's presidential elections, to begin his
efforts for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Denktash agreed "very strongly" on his
March visit during which he will discuss the modalities of the
negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez warned the two community leaders that increased
international interest in a Cyprus settlement will diminish if a
solution can not be reached in next year's peace effort.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders have to understand that this concern of the
international community is not going to last forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy also expressed welcome to U.S. interest in a
settlement in Cyprus and said he depends on both the U.S. and the
European Union (EU) in his mission.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez chaired two rounds of direct talks between Clerides
and Denktash in New York and Switzerland this year in an effort
to break the deadlock in the U.N.-sponsored talks for the
reunification of the island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
The talks collapsed in Switzerland after Denktash declared he
would not attend further joint meetings unless the EU canceled its
plans to open entry negotiations with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been split into the
Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north since 1974 when Turkish troops took over the northern third
of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez left here today for Athens, and then will go to Ankara
to meet with the government officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to hold talks on the Cyprus issue with
European Union Commissioner for External Relations Hans Van den
Broek in Brussels and the EU presidency envoy for Cyprus
Kester Heaslip in Paris.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Blocks GE Soya Oil Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace today blocked a
tanker truck containing 35,000 liters of genetically engineered
(GE) soya oil, the environmentalist group announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The block was made in Austria early in the morning after
Greenpeace tracked down the import and distribution of the soya
oil from the United States to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The oil was out from a processing mill in Germany to a firm in
Austria. Twelve Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the
truck, stopping the delivery of the freight.
</P>
<P>
The genetically engineered cargo of soya was first held up by
Greenpeace last week when it tried to enter the Dutch port of
Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Greenpeace's genetic hazard patrol confronted a
barge shipment from the Rotterdam cargo that was then tracked to a
processing mill in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace activists held up the unloading of the soya at the
processing mill on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was at the German mill, owned by the Archers Daniels Midland
according to Greenpeace, where the genetically engineered soya was
processed into oil and animal fodder.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace shadowed tankers transporting the processed oil to
Austria. It is tracking four other trucks in the country for
shipment of genetically engineered soya oil.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalist group is campaigning against consumption
of genetically engineered food without being informed of the fact.
"No consumer in Europe should be force-fed genetically engineered
food," said campaigner Michelle Sheather.

<HEADLINE> UN Decides to Extend Mandate of UNDOF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force for a period of six
months until May 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council made the decision after reviewing the
latest report on UNDOF by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In the report Annan said despite the present quiet situation in
the Israeli-Syrian sector, the situation in the Middle East
continued to be potentially dangerous and was likely to remain so,
unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects
of the Middle East problem could be reached.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the UN chief recommended to the Security Council
that the mandate of UNDOF be extended for six months.
</P>
<P>
UNDOF was established in 1974. Its present mandate expires on
November 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's national airline
Lufthansa is on the course to forge an alliance with Singapore
Airlines to boost its business in Asia, German news reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA today quoted officials of the German
Federal Cartel Office as saying that Lufthansa had requested a
meeting with the office to discuss a "bilateral alliance" with
Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa today declined to comment on the reports, with a
company spokesman only saying that Lufthansa was planned to
disclose "something very significant" at a press conference in
Singapore on November 24.
</P>
<P>
According to German newspaper reports, Lufthansa and Singapore
Airlines would cooperate bilaterally for the time being. It had
not been discussed for the moment whether the Singapore carrier
would join the multilateral "Star Alliance", which links Lufthansa
with United Airlines of the United States, the SAS Scandinavian
Airlines System, Air Canada, Varig and Thai Airways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some industry analysts reportedly said that the
alliance between Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, and its
possible link with the "Star Alliance" would put a question mark
on the German airline's current cooperation with Thai Airways as
well as Singapore Airlines' cooperation with the U.S. Delta Air
Lines and Swissair.

BRUSSELS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Public prosecutors are
scheduled to interrogate on Saturday the daughter of the
Hungarian-born pastor who was charged with murdering six members
of his family.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine-year-old Agnes Pandy, arrested late Thursday in

Police sources said that the human bones found in the pastor's
houses belonged to different human beings.
</P>
<P>
Though neighbors and a Dutch priest reported to local
authorities about the unaccounted disappearance of the family
members, Pandy explained that the disappeared family members had
gone back to Hungary.

<HEADLINE> APEC Trade Ministers Meet to Liberalize Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers and
senior officials from the 18 economies of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are meeting this morning,
focusing on the selection of trade sectors for early
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
APEC senior officials concluded a two-day meeting on Thursday
and prepared a list of 15 sectors for the trade ministers to
choose for early liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The sectors include environmental goods and services,
fisheries, forest products, gems and jewellery, oil-seeds,
chemicals, telecommunications, energy, food, rubber,fertilizers,
automotive standards, medical equipment and civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will probably be able to choose one, or two from
the list for discussion in the next one year, sources said.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial meeting, which is to be attended by trade and
foreign ministers and senior officials from APEC, will begin this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, APEC leaders agreed in Subic Bay of the Philippines
that ministers will identify sectors where early voluntary
liberalization would have a positive impact on trade, investment
and economic growth and submit recommendations to the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a list of 61 proposals came up at the senior
officials meetings and was narrowed down to 41 in Singapore in
October.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have not reached consensus on a single sector so
far because many are expected to protect their interests in
sensitive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Canada, host of this year's meeting, pursued a number of
priorities in early liberalization sectors ranging from primary
and manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in forefront efforts to identify fishery sector,
wood product, oil seeds and primary product material," a senior
Canadian official said.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil in South East Asia, another major subject
for discussions, casts shadows over the meetings, which is aimed
at liberalizing trade and investment on the Pacific rim.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, deputy finance ministers from Asia and the U.S.,
along with top officials from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) agreed to a framework for regional cooperation to promote
financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the Canadian official said, was "greeted with a
good deal of pleasure by officials here" and send a strong,
confidence-building message about liveralizing trade, but it still
needs to be studied.
</P>
<P>
The APEC, which was initiated in 1989, now groups Australia,
Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, China's Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States.

VANCOUVER, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto will make an official visit to Canada after the
APEC Economic Leaders Meeting here, the Canadian government has
announced.
</P>
<P>
This will be Hashimoto's first official visit to Canada in his
capacity as prime minister of Japan, and the first visit by a

United States. Two-way trade reached a record 24 billion Canadian
dollars in 1995. This dropped slightly last year to about 22
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is a key source of both direct and portfolio investment in

"I look forward to strengthening the friendship between our
countries and working together to further our common interests as

<HEADLINE> Survey Indicates Jobs Shortage for Ex-Welfare Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Conference of Mayors
survey on welfare reform in 34 cities suggests a jobs shortage for
welfare recipients and lack of availability of child care and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The survey found 13 cities responding to the question of job
availability suggest a shortage in the number of low-skill jobs
available for one-time welfare recipients seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
Detroit expects a shortfall of 75,303 jobs, Philadelphia 53,400
and Seattle 28,522 jobs to meet the demand of employment seekers,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Other cities that will fall short of jobs include Boston with a
shortage of 9,990 jobs; St. Paul, Minnesota, 9,682; St. Louis,
6,734; and New Orleans, 6,763 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many new low-skill jobs are in suburbs so transportation is a
problem because heavy concentrations of welfare recipients live in
the cities.
</P>
<P>
Welfare reform got its unofficial start in the early 1990s,
when states got permission to experiment with measures to nudge
recipients into the world of work.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a sweeping bill, crafted by
Republicans in Congress, into law in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Government estimated 3.5 million people, about one-quarter of
all welfare recipients, have left the rolls over the last three
years as a result of an improved economy and the new law.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Visits Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz arrived here this evening for a two-day visit to Syria,
the first by an Iraqi official of such level in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa received him at
Damascus International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Aziz told reporters that he was glad to visit
Damascus to brief the Syrian leaders on situation in Iraq and
Iraq's views on the future and to express his country's
appreciation of Syria's stance towards the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions on
Iraq, he said "We hope that our brothers in all the Arab countries
would work to lift the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions can only be lifted after
U.N. inspectors make sure that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But a crisis rose when Iraq announced to deny entry to
U.S. members of the U.N. inspection team earlier this month and
the U.S. threatened to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As for Iraq's agreement to allow the U.N. weapon inspectors
resume their work, Aziz said "I think the Iraqi problem was made
more clear for the world than it had been before the recent
UN-Iraqi standoff. Certainly when the problem becomes clear, there
are more chances for supporting our legitimate demands and lifting
the embargo on Iraq."

<HEADLINE> NATO Tests CJTF Headquarters Command Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNSTER, Germany, November 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO Military
Committee Chairman Klaus Naumann today proclaimed the try-out of
the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) headquarters an "unqualified
success".
</P>
<P>
The military chief of the western military alliance gave the
high mark while addressing a press conference on the penultimate
day of the week-long trial of the command post.
</P>
<P>
All but two of the NATO member states participated in the trial
that was carried out in a fictitious scenario.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg and Iceland opted out. France and Spain, though not
yet back into the NATO integrated military command structure, took
part in the test.
</P>
<P>
The command post trial was the final phase of the preparation
of the formation of the CJTF headquarters. The year-long
operation cost NATO 1.7 million U.S. dollars, according to General
Wesley Clark who is the supreme allied commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the trial, codenamed Allied Effort '97, was to
design, exercise and evaluate information processing, coordinating
and tasking capabilities of the CJTF headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Experiences were drawn from NATO peace-keeping operations in
Bosnia-Herzegovina through its multinational Implementation Force
(IFOR) and Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
Preliminary doctrines, structures, personnel and equipment
requirements and resource implications had to be considered and
plans formulated during the trial.
</P>
<P>
The concept of CJTF, which actually stands for multi-national
and multi-service task force, was first conceived in January 1994
and received endorsement in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The concept marks an important step in NATO's adaptation to the
changing global security settings, especially beyond-NATO-area
peace operations.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Effort '97 trial was based on a made-up peninsula
named Gem that extends into the Indian Ocean from the southeast
corner of Africa.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-led peace implementation force (PFOR), under the command
of the CJTF headquarters manned by a 2,200-strong staff, was
called upon by a United Nations mandate to separate the two
warring nations on the southern tip of the peninsula and guard a
50-kilometer-wide demilitarized zone in between.
</P>
<P>
Build-up of the CJTF command post started on November 3 with a
short notice and the trial that went underway last Sunday tested
such areas as personnel, intelligence, operation, logistics,
planning, communications and control, budget and finance,
relations with the civilian and engineering.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Military Committee chief described the CJTF
headquarters as a separate yet inseparable command within the NATO
command structure.
</P>
<P>
NATO is planning a sea-based trial run for CJTF following the
land-based trial in Munster. The next trial, to be known as
Strong Resolve '98, can be conducted as early as next March.
</P>
<P>
Asked when CJTF will be ready for operation, General Naumann
said that the multi-national and multi-service task force should
be ready to act between mid-1998 and the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Central China to Become Rising Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-day seminar on
development in central China oriented to the 21st century closed
today in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Over 140 experts and economists from some leading government
departments including the State Planning Commission and the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences put forward many valuable
suggestions on speeding up economic development in central China.
</P>
<P>
Central China embraces Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi
provinces, which cover nine percent of the total area and a
quarter of the farmland of the country. Its output of farm produce
accounts for one third of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region is a leading base of raw materials, water
energy and 25 mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Experts deem that central China should fully tap its potentials
and build a closer, coordinated relationship among them with the
aim to become a fast growing economic zone at the turn of the
century. They suggested that the central government adopt
preferential policies towards the central part.

<P>
ALMA ATA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A regional meeting has worked
out a blueprint for the ecological protection of the land-locked
Caspian Sea, the weekly Panorama said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored by the United Nations Development
Program and an international foundation, was called to coordinate
the implementation of the Caspian Sea ecological protection
program put forward by Kazakhstan two years ago.

U.S. dollars in damage. It also inundated seven settlements and
some 630,000 hectares of grain field in Kazakhstan.

BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Rental fees for office space
in the Chinese capital are expected to fall with the completion of
a large number of office towers by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, office towers in the city had total
floor space of over 1.5 million sq.m., with the figure expected to
rise by as much as one million sq.m. by early next year, according
to the Information Center of the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources note that as much as 35 percent of available
office space has remained idle this year, and the proportion will
rise by five percentage points in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rental fees for one sq.m. of office space hit a record 78 US
dollars in early 1995, but fell to 63 US dollars at the end of
last year. The figure plummeted further to 39 US dollars in the
first quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Buy Patriot Missiles Worth 300 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has sealed a
contract with the U.S. Reython Company to buy 300 million
U.S. dollars worth of Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company is also obliged to invest in a joint venture
with Kuwait to set up an alumium smelter under Kuwait's offset
program, an official of the Executive Bureau for Offset Operations
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Mazen Madouh, whose bureau is affiliated with the Finance
Ministry, was speaking on the sidelines of an offset and economic
development conference.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Offset Program requires any foreign arms supplier
winning a contract worth more than 1 million Kuwaiti dinars (3.3
million U.S. dollars) from the oil-rich emirate to reinvest 30
percent of the contract's value in Kuwait or Kuwait's ventures
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The program is mainly aimed at getting back some of the funds
which have poured out in defense contracts signed with mainly
Kuwait's western allies since it started a massive rearmament plan
following the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The aluminum project is one of the largest projects approved
under the Offset Program with an designed annual capacity of
230,000 tonnes of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
Reython Company is obliged to invest some 100 million
U.S. dollars in Kuwait for eight years, but the fund might not be
totally invested in the smelter project, Nadouh said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has so far received 1.5 billion U.S. dollars of
investment obligations from its arms suppliers under its Offset
Program launched in 1992, according to the Offset official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 companies, almost exclusively defense companies
have signed offset agreements with Kuwait. France and Britain
also have offset projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Finance Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan told Kuwaiti
parliament in September that Kuwait currently had seven major
offset projects either being implemented or under formation.

<HEADLINE> OAU Launches African Education Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) today formally launched the decade of
education in Africa (1997-2006).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony here, Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the OAU, said for many years now, Africa has
been characterized by the high level of illiteracy among its
peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has an illiteracy rate of 56 percent which is said to
be the highest in the world. In the early 1990s, 18 million girls
in Africa and 12 million boys were without access to primary
education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 26 million African girls are reported to be
out of schools and most of them are in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration of the ministerial meeting on the
education of girls held in Ouagadougou in 1996, the figure is
likely to increase to 36 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Salim described the eighties as " the lost decade for Africa",
and said that "the launching of the education decade provides yet
another opportunity for all of us to re-dedicate ourselves to the
objectives of promoting education in our continent and ensuring
education for all."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU to Lift Ban on Imports of Iranian Pistachio Nuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is
considering lifting a ban it imposed last September on the imports
of Iranian pistachio nuts provided that certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The European Report issued today said that a commission
decision on lifting the ban is expected to be taken early next
month.
</P>
<P>
The imports of Iranian pistachio nuts were suspended after
several consignments were found containing toxic substance which
is usually caused by mould forming on damp cargoes.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from several EU member states found that in some
cases contamination levels of carcinogenic aflatoxin were between
11 and 400 parts per billion (ppb), as against a permissible limit
of 2 ppb for pistachio nuts ready for direct consumption.
</P>
<P>
Permissible limit for raw pistachio nuts not yet intended for
direct consumption should not exceed 5 ppb.
</P>
<P>
The commission imposed the ban on a food hygiene ruling that
gives it the right to take safeguard measures if a hygiene problem
likely to create a serious risk to human health appears or spreads
on the territory of a non-EU country.
</P>
<P>
Exports of pistachio nuts are Iran's third main source of
foreign currency after hydrocarbons and carpets and earned the
country 500 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
EU member states imported 90,000 of the 130,000 tons of
pistachio nuts produced by Iran last year.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the world's leading importer of pistachio nuts,
followed by the Gulf states and the countries in Far East.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- While computerized financial
transactions can be completed within seconds, it has taken China's
major financial cities and towns some 10 years to accomplish the
same task.
</P>
<P>
China introduced a nationwide computerized system to commercial
banks and department stores almost a decade ago, with the
framework for an advanced network currently in place, according to
sources attending this week's financial seminar held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 medium- to large-sized computer systems were
operational in China by the end of last year, as well as 4,000
smaller systems, 12,000 automated teller machines (ATM) and
80,000-odd point-of-sales terminals department stores.
</P>
<P>
Some 110,00 branches of Chinese commercial banks have been
computerized, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank,
has installed a ground station and 648 remote stations for a
satellite communications network specially designed for financial
institution. The network provides links to all Chinese cities and
a number of developed counties.
</P>
<P>
A financial data exchange network jointly funded by major
commercial banks and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
which went online in 1996, currently links 198 major Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded major progress in computerizing bank account
settlements within cities, with facilities in more than 400 cities
currently providing rapid and convenient services.

<HEADLINE> Yamaichi Securities Considers Closing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Yamaichi Securities Co., one of
Japan's "Big Four" brokerage houses is considering a voluntary
shutdown because of severe financial problems, according to press
reports.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi, with debts of about 3 trillion yen (about 23.9
billion dollars), said it will make a final decision by Monday on
whether to terminate operations about 100 years after foundation.
</P>
<P>
If Yamaichi declares bankruptcy, it will be the biggest
collapse of a Japanese company since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi finally gave up after its main clients canceled mutual
fund contacts with the brokerage, which resulted in a severe cash
crunch, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation is attributed to Yamaichi's worsening business
performance, a sharp drop in stock price and the downgrading of
its bonds early this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an emergency news conference, Atsushi Nagano,
director general of the Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, said
Yamaichi is projected to have more than 200 billion yen (about 1.6
billiond dollars) in unlisted hidden debts.
</P>
<P>
But he said the situation is "not a serious one" because the
brokerage has no capital deficit, with about 430 billion yen
(about 3.4 billion dollars) in its capital account.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will provide
Yamaichi with rescue loans so that the company's clients are
protected.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi's image was seriously tarnished by an infamous
financial scandal in Japan earlier this year involving payoffs to
a "sokaiya" corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi is likely to negotiate a liquidation scheme for
voluntary closure with the Finance Ministry, the central bank and
major commercial banks, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under a voluntary closure arrangement, a securities company is
required to repay cash and securities to its customers and
liquidate its assests before shutting itself down.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1897, Yamaichi is a brokerage with the longest
history among Japan's four biggest securities firms that also
include Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko
Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi's move follows the collapse of two major financial
institutions -- Sanyo Securities and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the collapse of several large financial
institutions is an indication that Japan's financial industry is
undergoing a major restructuring ahead of a so-called Big Bang
deregulation.

WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Russia asked the governing board of the United Nations
commission in charge of disarming Iraq to declare Baghdad free of
nuclear weapons and near to compliance on prohibited missiles,
diplomats said. United Nations arms inspectors returned to Iraq to
search for a supposed arsenal of biological and chemical
weapons, whose existence has been suggested by six and a half
years of inspections and reconnaissance photographs.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law a major overhaul
for the Food and Drug Administration, saying the agency would earn
"a gold medal for leading the way into the future," but he offered
no indication of when he would choose someone to lead the agency
on that path.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- As South Korea joins other Asian nations in seeking a
massive financial bailout, some economists are warning that the
cost of such rescue efforts may be greater than the global economy
can easily bear.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton turned his attention from Iraq
to another intractable problem in the Middle East Friday, applying
renewed pressure on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to recognize
"the need for urgency" in salvaging the peace process before it is
too late.

<HEADLINE> Inaugural Asian Hockey Federation Cup Kicks off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural Men's Asian
Hockey Federation Cup kicked off here Saturday with six
participating teams vying for one berth in the 1999 Asian Cup.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, Sri Lanka, Oman, Macao, Singapore, Uzbekistan
and host Hong Kong (China) will compete in the tournament,
introduced specially for the low-standard teams in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The idea was brewed out by the Hong Kong Hockey Association
(HKHA) at the 1994 Asian Hockey Federaton Congress.
</P>
<P>
HKHA believed this would encourage those Asian countries and
regions that are less competitive to gain experience and catch up
the first rate teams such as Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1997, the major international field hockey tournaments
available for Asian countries and regions were the Asian Games and
the Asian Cup, both held every four years.
</P>
<P>
While the strong teams are able to get enough sponsorship for
their solid programs, the weak teams have been suffering a lot as
their national associations couldn't make their ends meet.
</P>
<P>
To take this into consideration, AHF has voted to stage the
Men's and Women's Asian Federation Cup tournaments, and
commissioned HKHA to host the inaugural Men's AHF Cup.
</P>
<P>
AHF also decided the winners of the current tournament would be
invited to the Asian Cup, which was postponed to 1999 to
accommodate the new tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Women's Asian Hockey Federation Cup will be held
on December 4-14 this year in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Hong Kong (China) and host Singapore will take part.

<HEADLINE> Haihe River Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 35.8 billion
yuan (4.47 billion US dollars) over the next 12 years to control
water pollution in the Haihe River Valley, according to sources
from the State Bureau of Environment Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
The key environmental protection project will be the second the
nation has launched for a river. The first one was for the Huaihe
River.
</P>
<P>
Zang Yuxiang, deputy director of the SBEP Department of
Pollution Control, said the project will guarantee potable water
for Beijing, Tianjin and various other medium- to large-sized
cities, and will improve water quality for both industrial and
agricultural use. He said the project will also lead to the
overall ecological improvement and increase of water resources in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Seven key pollution control projects, including efforts to
protect the Guanting and Panda reservoirs, two important water
resources for Beijing and Tianjin, will by carried out.
</P>
<P>
Zang said that projects to tackle the Zhanghe and Weihe rivers
and the Nanyun Canal are expected to ease serious water pollution
in the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong and areas along
rivers flowing through Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The water quality in the Haihe River Valley is expected to
fulfill state standards by the year 2010, according to Zang.
</P>
<P>
The Haihe River Valley, which covers 318,000 square kilometers,
encompasses Beijing and Tianjin, and six provinces including
Hebei, Henan and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Some 11.7 million tons of waste and polluted water, or 12
percent of the national total, has been discharged into the Haihe
River Valley in recent years, a level second only to the Yangtze
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Per capita water resources in the area account for only
one-sixth of the national average due to serious water pollution.

CHONGQING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Five years of efforts to

The Wujiang River, which flows from Weining County, Guizhou
Province, and empties into the Yangtze River in Fuling near
Chongqing, is one of the eight major tributaries along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Shipping along the Wujiang River has developed slowly due to
the river's rapid currents.
</P>
<P>
Sine the end of 1991, the local government has invested 42
million yuan to upgrade the navigatable section from Gongtan to
Fuling. The effort included the extensive demolition of reefs,

FREETOWN, November 22 (Xinhua) Nigeria's contigent attached to
western Africa's peace keeping force (ECOMOG), has released 28
Sierra Leonean prisoners of war (POW) Friday, senior navy
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Defence Administration, Sammy Davies said that the
ceremony took place at Tagrin, three miles west of the Lungi
International Airport where the Nigerian troops are based.
</P>
<P>
The POWS were captured during series of clashes between
Nigerian and Sierra Leone forces at Jui, 13 miles east of the
capital and at the International Airport, 10 miles across the
Sierra Leone estuary.
</P>
<P>
The released prisoners include five soldiers, eight policemen,
six civilians, six former rebel combatants, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
One of the released, Tamba Musa, a former rebel combatant
said, "The experience was frightful. The Nigerians at First
tortured me with cigarette burns and later they used their
bayonets to open wounds on my back and then poured iodine into
them."
</P>
<P>
Musa said he was captured early July during an RUF attack on
Nigerian troops position near the airport.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his reaction to the peace agreement and the call
for a cessation of hostilities, Musa said, "It is a good sign. We
are all West Africans and we should be cementing our relationship
rather than fighting among ourselves. I hope the Nigerians will
realise that you cannot influence people through fighting. "

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union's extraordinary summit on jobs held in
Luxembourg ended Friday evening with the heads of state and
government agreeing upon a modest consensus: offering training
to 20 percent of the unemployed, harmonizing the way to count
unemployment and learning from each other the efficient methods to
fight unemployment. Each country of the European Union will also
give each of its unemployed youth and chronically unemployed
people a new chance to start.
</P>
<P>
-- A great part of Eastern Africa, from Djibouti to Kenya
through Ethiopia, and above all, Somalia, is flooded because of
torrential rains which are continuing without ceasing for one
month. In the most affected zone, between the River Juba and River
Shebelle in southern Somalia, 1,343 people have been killed by the
flood. France, after debating whether to mobilize the 3,200
French soldiers stationed in Djibouti, now prefers to provide
rescue aid to Ethiopia and Djibouti rather than Somalia, which is
considered a no man's land for humanitarian actions.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In the wake of the European Union job summit in Luxembourg
and while the Socialist Party opened its congress in Brest, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said on Friday that there is now a ``real
awareness by Europeans of the need to face up to the problem of
massive unemployment.'' He congratulated the action of his
government on the development of talks on 35-hour working week
plan and on creating jobs for the youths.
</P>
<P>
-- General Paul Kagame, Vice President of Rwanda whose
misunderstanding with France started in 1992, revealed in an
interview with Le Figaro the story about his arrest five years ago
by French police in Paris, when he was chief of the Tutsi rebellion
in his country. He said that French Foreign Ministry officials
warned him at the time: ``If you don't stop the fight, you will not
see your family again, because all will be massacred.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Warns Against New Scramble for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has rejected to joint
initiative for African intervention force by the United States,
Britain and France, describing it as an attempt to sideline the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and divide the continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the just-concluded 7th ordinary session of the OAU
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,Management and Resolution,
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi warned that the plan would
render OAU's mechanism for conflict resolution impotent.
</P>
<P>
The attempt by some members of the international community to
divide Africa into Anglophone and Francophone peacekeepers is
unacceptable, Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the initiative, according to Ikimi, is to
"begin a new repartitioning of Africa into spheres of influences
and interests and thereby weaken the existing OAU authority".
</P>
<P>
The minister said that any initiative outside the African
continent must be implemented within the existing OAU mechanism,
adding that "it must be transparent and non-selective. It must
respond to the collective consensus of our leaders, our peoples
and our organizations."
</P>
<P>
Ikimi explained that Nigeria is not opposed to training of
African soldiers from individual African countries under
bilateral arrangements, but called on African leaders to be
cautious on extra-African initiatives.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that 7-10 African battalions are expected to be
trained by the U.S. special force, which has already begun the
mission, in order to strengthen the capacity of those selected
countries to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operation in Africa
and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Term Poll, Only Solution: Party Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of India (Marxist) Harkishan Singh Surjeet today
said that a mid-term election to Parliament appeared to be the
only solution to the present political uncertainty, created by the
Congress demand to drop the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)
ministers from the Gujral government.
</P>
<P>
The Jain Commission report, tabled before Parliament here on
Thursday, had not indicted Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK
President M. Karunanidhi for the conspiracy leading to former
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's killing in 1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Congress for demanding the removal of DMK
ministers even before the Jain Commission report was discussed in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear possible at present that the Congress will
climb down from its demand for removal of the DMK ministers,"
Surjeet told reporters in Bhopal city of Madhya Pradesh in central
India.
</P>
<P>
The present political climate of instability was unlikely to
change even after a mid-term poll, he said, adding that it would
be difficult to say now whether the political fog at the Center
would be cleared during the winter session of Parliament.

The plan includes cost-saving measures, promoting use of local
products, boosting the competitive edge of Made-In-Malaysia goods,
reducing imports and checking the outflow of the ringgit by
encouraging people to spend their holidays in the country,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"In our efforts to keep the economy on track, some of the
measures may not go down well with the people but everybody need
to make sacrifices," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama as telling reporters in Johor Baharu, some 370
kilometers southeast from here.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the action plan, the people should switch to
a new lifestyle by adopting cost-saving measures and giving
preference to locally-manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
The people, who have enjoyed the country's prosperity in the
past 10 years, were left with no choice but to support the
government's programs to rejuvenate the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that this time, the economic problems faced by the
country were serious as the ringgit and the stock market had been
attacked by currency speculators and manipulators.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC was proposed by the United Malays National
Organization, the largest component party of the coalition
National Front, and endorsed by all the other 13 component parties
of the Front led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC, to be chaired by Mahathir, will be set up next month,
comprising ministers whose portfolios were related to the economy
and representatives from the manufacturing, export, banking and
finance sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today left for the fifth annual unofficial summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Vancouver,
Canada.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session scheduled to begin on November 24,
Kim and leaders from 17 other APEC members will discuss ways to
develop infrastructure in the world's fast-growing region.
</P>
<P>
Other topics include cooperation to stablize the region's
currencies and foreign exchange markets, and to monitor progress

to economic and financial challenges, with the aim of enhancing
foreign confidence in the South Korean economy, Ban said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials predicted that the APEC leaders, who
will discuss the emerging financial crisis in Asia and the world
as well, will adopt a declaration to make efforts to cope with the
regional and global financial crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Arms inspectors working with
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction resumed their normal work here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The six permanent weapons inspection teams as well as the air
reconnaissance group the includes helicopters resumed operation
today, an unidentified Iraqi official told the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
These teams left here this morning in different times heading
for sites marked for inspection and the Iraqi authorities offered
all necessary facilities.
</P>
<P>
Today's development followed the diplomatic solution to a
three-week standoff between the U.N. and Iraq, which expelled
American inspectors in order to draw world attention to its demand
for the lifting of seven-year-old crippling sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The teams returned to Iraq on Friday after Baghdad had
officially told the Security Council its agreement to the
resumption of the work of UNSCOM with all its members, including
the Americans, taking part.

<HEADLINE> Industry Executives Predict Big Day for E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Internet will have
as much an impact as the Industrial Revolution, but it will take
only 20 or 30 years instead of 200, the chief executive of a
leading U.S. software and hardware producer said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is going to change everything, and at a pace we
have never seen before," said John Chambers, Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of the northern California-based Cisco Systems, at
the end of the two-day Asia-Pacific Information Technology Summit.
</P>
<P>
Before an audience of some hundreds of U.S. and foreign
government officials and industry executives at the gathering, the
first of its kind, Chambers made his prediction: "Companies who
don't know how to use high-tech will be left behind."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, those that do know how to use will get rich
at cyberspace speed.
</P>
<P>
Founded seven years ago, Cisco now boasts annual sales of over
7 billion U.S. dollars, 40 percent of which are made over the Net.
</P>
<P>
The 3.2 billion dollars of electronic sales Cisco is expected
to achieve this year will approach what experts predicted a few
years ago to be today's total electronic commerce sales worldwide.
</P>
<P>
James Barksdale, CEO of Netscape Communications Corp.,
predicted that much of the business now done through the 300
billion product catalogs printed in the United States each year
will be transferred to the Net soon.
</P>
<P>
And he said as much as 80 percent of all purchases made have
the potential of being done over the Net.
</P>
<P>
While the United States is the leading innovator of Net
technologies and applications, Asian countries are well aware of
the potential benefits. Barksdale said 35 percent of Japan's
current seven million Internet users have used it for electronic
purchases.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, he said, 76 percent of enterprises will have
deployed Internet by the end of 1998, and that by the end of the
century, 95 percent of all residents of Singapore will be
connected by a high-speed, broadband network.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference also indicated that not all
businesses will benefit. One such industry seems to be the
newspaper business, said Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, whose empire includes newspapers, magazines,
television networks and the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., said
the future of many newspapers is threatened by a loss of their
lifeblood -- classified advertising -- which he said is
"vulnerable to attack by the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Only those papers that somehow can adapt, he said, will survive.
</P>
<P>
But he said information technology makes more winners than
losers, citing that it has created more than 9 million jobs in the
U.S. over the past decade, while destroying only 2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Dominate Asian Speed Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South Koreans swept three gold
medals out of four while a Japanese stole the other one in the
first day of Asian Short-Track Speed Skating Championships here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The competition reached a climax when all the six finalists
skated inside the listed Asian record in the men's 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jung-Young of South Korea led all the way from the start,
clocking two minutes and 19.71 seconds, followed by his teammates
Lee Seung-Chan, 2:20.19, Kim Hyun-Chui, 2:20.39, Jung Suk-Ju,
2:21.47, and China's Wang Xuefeng, 2:21.63. A Japanese was
disqualified after the race.
</P>
<P>
The previous Asian record of 2:22.41 was set by South Korean
Kim Ki-Hoon in Japan four years ago.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Park Hye-Rim, 13, led a medal clean sweep in the
women's 1,500 meters, winning the title in 2:27.82, followed by
Park Hye-Won, 2:36.86, and Joo Min-Jin, 2:37.37.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also made a 1-2 finish in the women's 500m when Joo
Min-Jin romped home in 46.82 seconds, edging Park Hye-Rim's
46.93. China's Xu Jin took the third in 48.11.
</P>
<P>
Nishitani Takafumi of Japan was awarded with the men's 500m
title after the South Korea's Park Sae-Woo was disqualified later
for dangerous sprinting.
</P>
<P>
China's Wang Xuefeng settled for the runner-up spot in the
cliff-hanger, only 0.01 second behind Takafumi's 43.46.
</P>
<P>
About 40 skaters from Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, China's
Hong Kong and China are participating in the two-day
championships.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Refuses to Comment on Current Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral today refused to comment on the current political crisis in
the country in the wake of the Congress' demand to dump Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) from the 14-party United Front (UF)
government on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Jain Commission report, which was tabled before Parliament
here on Thursday, linked the DMK with the conspiracy in
assassination of Indian former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Angry Congress MPs called on the Gujral government to sack the
DMK. Yet the core committee of the UF has rejected the Congress'
demand. Political impasse at the Center continues.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the country was facing a crisis at the
Calcutta airport, Gujral refused to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
He went to Calcutta today to take part in an official function
and would return to the capital soon after the function.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the country was heading for a mid-term poll,
he also refused to reply.
</P>
<P>
Political activities are expected to gain momentum this evening
when Gujral returned from Calcutta. UF spokesman Jaipal Reddy said
that doors have not been slammed for negotiations between the UF
and the Congress.

<HEADLINE> Study Correlates Smog to Lung, Heart Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Medical researchers said
they have confirmed that more people are hospitalized for lung and
heart diseases as smog increases.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results were released here today by the Kaiser
Foundation Research Institute (KFRI), which conducted a year-long
study based on more than 10,000 admissions to Kaiser Permanent
hospitals throughout 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hospital admissions for chronic respiratory disease were found
to rise by 7 percent for every 10-microgram increase in coarse
particles in the air. Admissions rose 3.5 percent for acute
respiratory illness and 3 percent for those with cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
"It is a surprisingly big increase in the number of patients
for a relatively small change in the level of pollution," said
Henry Gong, a professor of medicine and environmental health
specialist at University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
A number of previous studies have shown connections between smog
and various types of illness. One research project, released last
year, estimated that 64,000 people in major American cities may
die each year from lung or heart problems by inhaling particulates.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 90 percent of health effects studies relating to
smog have been conducted in the Eastern and Midwestern United
States, where there are significant sources of pollution not found
in Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Subsides Slowly: Geologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that
Bangladesh is subsiding slowly, Bangladesh's English weekly
magazine Independent reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by German marine geologist Dr. Hermann
Kudrass, who is now heading a 25-member scientific research team
on board the German research ship of RV Sonne in the Bengal Bay.
</P>
<P>
The German research ship, equipped with modern drilling
equipment, is studying the natural and climatic changes which
have taken place in the Bengal Bay during the last 100 years or
more, the magazine quoted Kudrass as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We'll work on sediment balance in the sea, cyclone history and
subsidence position," he said.
</P>
<P>
The research, which started on November 17, will also look into
sea warming or sea level rise, the geologist said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is sea warming, there will be sea level rise. So
you'll have to be prepared for consequent changes," he said,
refusing to make any prediction.
</P>
<P>
The current research work is a follow-up of a 1994 survey. It
is being carried out under a agreement between Geological Survey
of Bangladesh and Geological Survey of Germany, and with the
assistance from the German Ministry of Research and Technology.
Five geologists from Bangladesh are participating in the research.
</P>
<P>
"You know, Bangladesh is subsiding slowly and our second task
will be to have as accurate an estimation as possible of the rate
and process of subsiding," he added.
</P>
<P>
The research may require at least one year to process all the
data and finalize a report, the German geologist said. "We've a
plan to hold an international seminar in Dhaka on the research
findings within one year".

<HEADLINE> China Beats Japan in World Volleyball Grand Champions Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Asian Champion China overcame a
first set down to defeat host Japan 3-1 in the fourth round of the
men's competition at the current world volleyball grand champions
cup tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China improved its record to 2-2 and assured its place among
the top-four in the six-team men's competition, while Japan fell
to 1-3 with a sole victory over winless Australia.
</P>
<P>
After lossing the first set 15-8, the Chinese spikers stayed in
calm to fight neck to neck with their Japanese rivals at 11-all
till the set ran into the 25-minute time limitation and the
rally-point scoring system was applied.
</P>
<P>
Paced by Zheng Liang's quick spike over the net and Zhang
Xiang's powerful smashes behind the rear line, China made no
mistakes to clinch their last four points and set at 15-13.
</P>
<P>
With over-net blockings and smashes, China tamed the
never-say-die Japanese by taking the next two sets 15-12 15-11.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't show our best forms today but we stayed in calm when
trailing behind. We won with better blockings and higher fighting
spirits," said Chinese head coach Wang Jiawen after the tow-hour
game.
</P>
<P>
China's solid blockings gained them 17 points, the same as
their attacking smashing had produced.
</P>
<P>
"After we had a good start in the first set, we lost our rhythm
afterwards. China beat us by effective blockings and quick hits
from Zheng Liang and Lu Weizhong," said Japanese head coach
Futoshi Teramawari.
</P>
<P>
In a tough confrontation between European champion the
Netherlands and South American champion Brazil, the latter are
leading 15-9, 15-12, 13-15 in the first three set. The match is
not over yet now.
</P>
<P>
Cuba will takes on Australia in Saturday's last match later in
the evening.

<P>
MAPUTO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique needs 170 million
U.S. Dollars to boost its higher education by the end of the
century, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Arnaldo Nhavoto, Education Minister of Mozambique made the
statement at a symposium on higher education development held
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from national and local expansion programs, the country
is to use Internet for its higher education development for the
remote areas, Nhavoto said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, with a population of 15.74 million, has five
universities, three of them are state universities, while the
other two are private schools in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
People have been urging the government to establish a
university in northern Mozambique, but the lack of money in the
under-developed area has hindered local government from meeting
their demand.
</P>
<P>
There are now 7,000 students at the three State universities,
while the two private universities are taking in very small
number of students.
</P>
<P>
The country has 1.7 million students at primary and middle
schools.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Tightens Security to Protect Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda army forces and local
defense units are to be deployed along Sudan-Uganda border to
secure the farming of the displaced people in the area, local
media said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local military sources as saying that the
deployement is to be made after a decision was made at a joint
meeting of northern Uganda's Kitgum Disaster Committee, the army
and the district council.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 people in Kitgum had been displaced people due to
the harassment of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the north.
</P>
<P>
local displaced people asked the authorities to provide
maximum security for harvesting during the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
LRA had penetrated into the district in February this year to
kill 350 people and burnt down several houses.
</P>
<P>
The district decided to relocate the displaced by mid of the
next month and advised them to plant quick harvesting crops like
potatoes, sorghum and green vegetables.
</P>
<P>
lRA, with 700-800 members now from last year's 2,000, is a
rebel launching a ten-year guerrilla war to topple Ugandan
government led by President Yoweri Museveni. It has bases in
southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> German, French Ambassadors Back to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The German and French
ambassadors to Iran returned to their posts this morning, marking
the end of a seven-month diplomatic crisis between Iran and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
German ambassador Horst Baechmann and French ambassador
Jean-Pierre Masset arrived here on a Lufthansa flight from
Frankfurt. They were the last two of EU envoys to resume their
missions in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Other EU envoys were back in town November 14, one day after
Iran reached a compromise with the EU by announcing to accept a
proposal of EU rotating Chairman, Luxembourg Foreign Minister
Jacques Poos.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries recalled their ambassadors last April in
protest after a Berlin court ruled Iranian leaders were involved
in a political assassination of Kurdish dissidents in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of German and French ambassadors in Tehran will
allow Iranian envoys to these two countries to return in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on last Friday voiced
Iran's welcome to the return of EU ambassadors, local newspaper
Iran Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that, with the ambassadors' return, the process of
developing our ties is going to resume its course," Kharrazi was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's deputy foreign minister for Euro-American
affairs, Morteza Sarmadi, claimed last Wednesday that Iran's
relations with EU countries would not be at the same level
despite the end of diplomatic row.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said that the grounds for joint cooperation and the
understanding of EU countries about the reality in Iran,
especially under the new government, determine the level of Iran's
ties with them.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has developed a negative mentality about certain
counties and the continuation of long-term relations with them as
a result of their bad performance. They must strive in the future
to make corrections, he demanded.

<HEADLINE> Novotna, Spirlea Through to Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Jana Novotna of
the Czech Republic and eighth seed Irina Spirlea of Romania
survived three-set matches to reach the semi-finals of the Chase
Championships on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech, the only surviver of the top six seeds in the
event, beat Spaniard Atantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, while
the Romanian outlasted 11-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez 5-7, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
World number 3 Novotna will take up Spirlea in her ninth
consecutive season-ending event.
</P>
<P>
Novotna broke twice at 3-1 and 5-1 in the final set, thanks to
a combination of backhand errors and double-faults of the
Spaniard, who had won none titles this season.
</P>
<P>
Novotna clung to the only match point of the game to dump
Sanchez, the third-time Grand Slam titlist.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez apparently had the better of the game when she
created three match points at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
But Spirlea, who had never let the Spaniard win a single set
before the clash, held up in the exciting 10th game and rallied
on two break points.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez saved one break point but surrendered the game when
she sent a forehand out.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final matches will be played between two French
players seventh seed Mary Pierce and Nathalie Tauziat.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Calls for Putting Into Full Use of African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki appealed the people in Africa to put into
full use of the continent's rich natural resources to speed up
its economic emancipation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the appeal Friday at the opening ceremony of the
United Nations Economic Commission's second regional conference
of African Ministers responsible for the development and
utilization of minerals and energy resources.
</P>
<P>
He said it is Africa's natural resources and varied sources of
energy which served as the main catalyst for the integration of
Africa. in the history of world.
</P>
<P>
But the tragedy of the past is that the European scramble for
African natural resources, which had accelerated the development
of Europe and bring the African continent to a state of under-
development.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki urged the two-day conference in Durban of South Africa
to focus its discussions on how Africa develop and put into full
use of its rich resources to put the continent on the road to
renewal, prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
"What is not in doubt is that despite the many decades of
exploitation of these natural resources, vast amounts still
remain either unexplored, badly merchandised, or their value
completely lost to most of us."
</P>
<P>
Africa should seek social and economic emancipation in a world
characterized by the universal impact of the revolution in
science and technology and the globalization of all economic
activity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Thrown at Settlers' House in Ras Amud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A grenade was thrown Friday
night at the house occupied by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem's
Ras Amud Arab neighborhood, but no one was hurt, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Israeli
police have not made any arrests yet.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after the Wednesday night's shooting attack
against two Jewish religious students near the Damascus Gate in
the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. One of the students was killed
and the other seriously injured by automatic rifle fired by
unknown Muslim militant.
</P>
<P>
Israel reacted strongly to the attack by setting up a police
station near the site of shooting and increasing armed protection
of Jews walking through the Muslim Quarter. A number of
Palestinian residents suspected of involvement in the attack have
been arrested by Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
Ras Amud is a controversial neighborhood, where a group of
Jewish seminary students are residing in two houses allegedly
bought by American billionaire Irving Moskowitz who intends to
build a Jewish settlement in the area.
</P>
<P>
The students moved in late September under a deal to replace
the two Jewish settler families which occupied the houses and
sparked a widespread crisis between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes: Israel maintains it has sovereign control over the
whole holy city including the mostly Arab East Jerusalem it has
been occupying since the 1967 War, while the Palestinians hope to
establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its
capital.

<HEADLINE> Residents in Tanzanian Capital Drink Sub-Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- About three million
residents in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam drink dirty water
that fail to meet the international standards, Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The city has no supply of safe, adequate and reliable water because
of lack of necessary infrastructure which has been caused by financial
difficulties, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Mtoni, Upper Ruvu and the Lower Ruvu water treatment plants
cannot treat water to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards,
said Rajab Mtoro from Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority
(DAWASA) at a workshop Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Mtoni plant is in a state of disrepair while its source of
water has inadequate flow, the official read a speech on behalf of the
DAWASA Director Arcado Mutalema at the workshop on The Dar es
Salaam Water Demand.
</P>
<P>
"The Lower Ruvu water filters have never worked and are currently
out of date," Mutualemwa revealed.
</P>
<P>
The buildings for the water treatment plants have cracks and
their equipment is old, Mutalema said.
</P>
<P>
The poor situation of water provision in the city is due to lack of
investment over the 30 years, he said, complaining that the water
tariffs has been kept low and the subsidy from the government is
inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Kim Appeals for National Support to Overcome Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam apologized Saturday to the people for the nation'
economic problems and pleaded for collective cooperation to
overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his nationwide-televised address, the President asked the
people to join forces with the government's efforts to overcome the
present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive admitted that the dazzling development over
the past 30 years had also given birth to structural problems in
the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Some strategic industries had been protected in their competition
with foreign counterparts and had received financial and tax benefits,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the era of boundless competition following the
inauguration of the World Trade organization, South Korean companies
reached the maximum limit of their growth potential under the
high-cost and low-efficiency structure, going bankruptcy and leaving
financial institutions with bad debts, President Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Kim pledged every means possible to minimize the problems from
financial structural changes within the range of possible economic
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
"We will make use of International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s support
loan to acquire urgent foreign currency, and we will make utmost
efforts to endure the burden for structuring," the President said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea filed on Friday evening the application for 20
billion US-dollar loan from the IMF as a last resort to save its
economy, paralyzed by corporate bankruptcies, devaluation of
national currency and crumbling stock market.
</P>
<P>
Promising the government's own budget reductions, Kim asked that
"the managers do more for industrial restructuring than competing for
loans, workers do more to improve productivity than to fight for
higher wages."
</P>
<P>
The President asked economic and social leaders to provide the role
model for frugality.
</P>
<P>
Under the basic economic conditions such as healthy financing and
consumer prices, competitive in industry and exports, South Korea can
overcome the crisis, if all politicians, businessmen and workers can
unite with a determination to do, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The President also said he will seek support from South Korea's
allies and cooperate with the leaders in overcoming the nation's
economic difficulties at the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The President is leaving Saturday afternoon for Vancouver to attend
the November 24-25 APEC leaders' meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Health facilities in
South Africa have been put on alert to prevent a possible cholera
outbreak in the country, the Department of Health said Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the death of 184 people in neighboring
Mozambique from the disease in recent months.
</P>
<P>
With the recent spread of the disease southward in Africa, the
possibility of an outbreak in South Africa does exist if
precautionary measures were not taken, the department said in a

Since international experience had shown that travel and trade
restrictions did not prevent the spread of the disease, emphasis
mut be placed on detection and prevention within the country, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a possible outbreak, provincial health facilities
had been placed on alert and the necessary guidelines for
managing a potential cholera outbreak had been distributed,
according to the department.
</P>
<P>
"Bacteriological surveillance is being carried out in sewers
of the major cities to detect the cholera bacteria and laboratory
facilities are prepared for confirming clinical diagnosis of the
disease," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Disappointing Year for NZ Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The past year for the first
New Zealand coalition government has proved to be disappointing
with the partners beset with troubles one after another and their
support plummeting.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the coalition also cost the political
career of Prime Minister Jim Bolger, who was replaced by Transport
Minister and Minister for State-Owned Enterprises Jenny Shipley as
leader of the National Party early this month. Shipley will become
New Zealand's first woman prime minister in history after Bolger
resigns in early December.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted in early October indicated that the
approval rate for the government sank to an all-time low: only
less than 10 percent of those polled approved the government,
while over 90 percent showed their disapproval.
</P>
<P>
The government was fraught with pains one after another shortly
 after the coalition was formed by the National Party and the New
Zealand First party last December.
</P>
<P>
The government had to spend most of its time and energy to deal
with many trivial issues, like a financial scandal of a MP of New
Zealand First party, which is a coalition partner; a scuffle
between a National Party MP and New Zealand First leader Winston
Peters; and a judicial review of the findings of a tax evasion
inquiry lodged by Peters, who is the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The biggest setback for the government came in September when
92 percent of the voters rejected a compulsory savings scheme
masterminded by Peters to replace the present universal
superannuation. The scheme even encountered opposition from many
government ministers, including Shipley.
</P>
<P>
These incidents hampered the government from carrying out
normal business and prompted a disappointed National Party
minister to resign from the government, challenging Bolger's
ability to lead the government and his own party in particular.
</P>
<P>
To reassert his leadership in the government and in his
National Party, Bolger in October again signaled privatization of
state assets, a program differentiating National Party from New
Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to revive the confidence of his supporters, Bolger said
he believed it was "springtime again" in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
But the "springtime" did not come as privatization efforts met
stiff opposition from New Zealand First, which insisted some
assets classified as "strategic" could not be sold under the
coalition agreement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, support of the business communities for the coalition
also slid. A recent survey of business people in Wellington, the
capital, showed that only 2 percent of those polled thought the
coalition was good for business, while 62 percent thought it bad.
</P>
<P>
Now, with Shipley at the helm, the National Party hopes that
their fortune could be turned around.
</P>
<P>
The first difficulty facing Shipley is to cope with Peters, who
does not expect to enjoy the kind of good relationship with Bolger
as with Shipley.
</P>
<P>
Shipley has promised that the direction of the coalition and
the main points of the coalition agreement will not change, except
the style of the government.
</P>
<P>
This can be explained in many ways. One is that the National
Party will play the leading role in the government. But whether
Peters will allow this to happen is still a matter of
wait-and-see.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of withholding support for Shipley to ponder
the pros-and-cons in working with a Shipley-led National Party,
New Zealand First finally decided last week to stay in the
coalition. The uncertainty following the National leadership
change was temporarily tided over.
</P>
<P>
But no one is now sure whether the coalition will get through
its full term of three years. Given the personality of both
Shipley and Peters, divergence may arise from time to time in the
future, creating fresh uncertainties for the relations between the
two partners.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, voters favor an early election. The latest
opinion poll showed that two thirds of those surveyed wanted an
early election instead of waiting for another two years. It also
indicated a Labor Party victory if an election is held now.
</P>
<P>
The coalition must do better in the future. If the voters see
no significant change in government performance in the near
future, both partners are destined to be voted out of the
government two years later, if they can hang on that long.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market this week, December South ended the
week at 1,725 ringgit (497.1 U.S. dollars) per ton, five ringgit
higher from last week's close at 1,720 ringgit (495.7 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals are expected to hover around the current
levels due to currency factors next week with prices unlikely to
drop as the commodity is still enjoying good demand, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
Prices next week are projected to remain steady at above the
1,700 ringgit (490 dollars) level, reflecting the firmer trend on
the futures, the dealer said, adding that the projection by
private forecaster Van Wong that Malaysia's November palm oil
output was down 13.2 percent to 792,000 tons to some extent will
influence market sentiment and spark speculative activities.
</P>
<P>
This week, the price of tin on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market
(KLTM) rose 13 sen to close the week at 19.33 ringgit (5.57
dollars) per kg compared to 18.01 ringgit (5.19 dollars) per kg
last week.
</P>
<P>
Turnover this week declined to 423 tons against 358 tons last
week with locals, Europeans and Japanese buyers accounting for
the bulk of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The tin price next week is likely to remain firm, expected to
touch 19.50 ringgit level on follow-through buying support and
bullish sentiment from the London Metal Exchange (LME) based on
the KLTM's steadier performance this week which stemmed from
strong buying interest influenced by London's uptrend, according
to dealers.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices on the Malaysian rubber market this week were
also higher in a quiet market on lack of interest from buyers, as
November RSS One ended 1.5 sen higher at 278.5 sen (80 U.S.
cents) per kg and SMR 20 was up 5.0 sen to 282.5 sen (81 U.S.
cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for November 20 was at 201.54
Malaysia/Singapore cents (sen) per kg against 202.40 cents (sen)
on November 13.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 200.73 cents (sen) versus
204.86 cents (sen) last week.
</P>
<P>
As dealers predicted, the local rubber market is expected to be
firmer next week on technical adjustments due to currency factors,
however, trading is expected to be thin in the absence of fresh
leads.
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to move up on shortage of raw materials
which was said to continue in the near-term due to the rainy
season which affected rubber production.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
now actively considering formation of a cooperative council to
make the system more dynamic and potential through amending
cooperatives rules.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister of Local Government Rural
Development and Cooperatives Zillur Rahman while inaugurating the
37th annual conference of the Christian cooperative Credit Union

<P>
Massive schemes are being taken through cooperative system for
alleviation of poverty, creation of employment opportunity for
both rural and urban areas particularly for women cooperators, he
noted.

agriculture, it is going to attain self-sufficiency in food, and
its peasantry should be inspired to apply modern technology
through cooperatives to achieve prime objective of economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The government had already procured two billion taka (about
44.64 million U.S. dollars) for a project for marketization of
local agri-products through the cooperative system, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in a developing country like Bangladesh,
there is no alternative to an organized and effective cooperative
system for eradicating poverty of the people in an abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
Without cooperative movement, there is no other means for
farmers, laborers and other working people to change their
destiny, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Offered in Consideration of Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A settlement with the
offering of more than 300,000 U.S. dollars in back pay could end a
landmark U.S. Supreme Court case on diversity in hiring and firing
in order to protect affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Washington-based Black Leadership Forum, a civil
rights coalition, agreed to pay the huge amount of money,
two-thirds of the 433,500 dollars demanded by Sharon Taxman from
the Piscataway Board of Education, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Board attorney David Rubin is asking the Supreme Court to
declare the suit moot.
</P>
<P>
Taxman, a 50-year-old white woman, sued the board after she was
laid off from teaching in 1989 while a black teacher with equal
qualifications was retained in the name of diversity.
</P>
<P>
Taxman, who was hired in 1992, continued her pursuit of back
pay. She won a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court last
year.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Friday, "Once the case was accepted by the
court ... a number of national civil rights organizations
expressed to the board their genuine concern that an adverse
ruling in this case could gut the infrastructure of affirmative
action across the country."
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders feared that pursuing the case could have
done more harm than good to the affirmative action -- a formal
effort to increase employment and school admission opportunities
for the country's women and ethnic minorities to overcome past
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The board voted 5-3 late Thursday to end its appeal, saying it
was in the best interest of the district.
</P>
<P>
The nation's Supreme Court had agreed to hear the case in
January.
</P>
<P>
In the review of the first affirmative action dispute this
term, the court let stand California's Proposition 209, a ban on
race and gender preference in hiring and school admission.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Jackson, who helped raise some of the money in the
settlement, said Friday the case was "riddled with problems; the
battle is fierce."

<HEADLINE> Indian President Keeps Close Watch on Fluid Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan is reported to have been keeping a close watch on
the fluid political situation in the country in the wake of the
Congress party's threat to withdraw support to the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Political circles here are agog with speculation over the
president's reaction to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although the strategy adopted by both the Congress and the
United Front (UF) appears to be one of buying time, once the
Congress decides to deliver its letter informing the president of
its decision to withdraw support for the UF government, the scene
would automatically shift to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Narayanan may not be in a hurry to decide on
dissolution of the parliament if the government led by I.K. Gujral
falls.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he may explore the possibility of another
government before deciding on general elections.
</P>
<P>
The president knows that none of the MPs wants to face mid-term
elections. Elections may be the last option for the president, a
political party leader said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, the main supporter of the 14-party United Front
government, has demanded the government to sack Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (DMK), one of the constituents of the UF coalition, for
its links with the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
As the UF has already rejected the Congress demand to dump the
DMK, it is now up to the prime minister to either write to the
Congress president or talk to him personally to resolve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
If the Congress delivers the letter of support withdrawal to
the president, he may refer it to the Lower House of Parliament.
Since the House is in session, the trial of strength has to be
decided on the floor of the House.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Hails UNTAES Scheduled Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Ministry
issued a communique here today hailing the United Nations
Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) for its
scheduled pullout of Croatia when its mission terminates on
January 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after the Administrator William
Walker confirmed at a news conference here today that the United
Nations police will stay in Eastern Slavonia as observers to help
establish peace and trust between the nations and protect local
residents after UNTAES withdraws in January.
</P>
<P>
The administrative power in Eastern Slavonia will be fully
transmitted to the Croatian government, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
sent a letter in reply to Croatian Foreign Minister Glonich
guaranteeing that UNTAES will pull out of Croatia on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The UN police, whose task will be to prevent transgressions and
provocations, will be allowed to stay in the country until the end
of October next year, the communique said,
</P>
<P>
it is beneficial for UN observers to remain in order to prevent
behaviors that might disrupt peace and the integration process.
</P>
<P>
Neven Jurica, the spokesman for the Croatian government, told
reporters that the smooth ending of the UNTAES's mission indicates
that peace and integration along the Danube River has been
established, and the Croatian government has maintained
territorial sovereignty as recognized by the international society.
</P>
<P>
Jurica also said that Croatia is ready to invite the United
Nations to send 150 observers to supervise the peace process in
the Danube area of Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Senior Official on Central Bank's role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- India's new governor of the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Bimal Jalan has said that the central
bank in a developing economy like India should concern itself with
employment generation and poverty eradication as much as inflation
control.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Business Standard today quoted the governor as
saying that "Inflation control is important but much depends on
what kind of trade-off you want. The central bank in a developing
country has to determine what level of inflation is acceptable for
achieving what level of growth."
</P>
<P>
The RBI's role is different from a central bank in a developed
economy, where the main concerns are price stability, employment
and exchange rate stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the lesson from the Southeast Asia crisis, Jalan said that
"the broad lessons for India are that you have to be constantly
watchful and take a medium-term view of the economy. We should not
take stability for granted. If you perceive a problem, it is
better to take action now rather than later."
</P>
<P>
Yet he refused to discuss the value of the Indian currency
rupee.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was better to wait for detailed studies on the
Southeast Asia crisis before taking a view.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Thai Finance Firms Urged to Increase Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's financial
restructuring authorities (FRA) Friday announced criteria for the
rehabilitation of 58 suspended finance firms, urging them to
increase capital for restoring operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the criteria, the 58 firms, whose operations were
suspended in June and August this year by the government due to
shortage of funds, are to maintain a capital-to-risk assets ratio
at 15 percent for the first year, 12 percent for the second year,
and 10 percent for the third year.
</P>
<P>
The firms are also required to work out plans to repay debts
and improve management, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The FRA is expected to submit a report on the current position
of the 58 finance firms to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for review early next month to facilitate the transfer of the
IMF's second lot of loans from its 17.2 billion U.S. dollar aid
package.
</P>
<P>
Streamlining the financial sector was one of the requirements
set by the IMF when it decided to offer the aid package to
Thailand earlier this year. The suspended 58 firms currently
remain as the key problem facing the country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said last week during
his visit to Bangkok that he expected few, if any, of the
suspended firms will reopen.
</P>
<P>
The FRA is calling for mergers with the suspended firms.

BUDAPEST, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Kovacs Laszlo will travel to the United States in February with
his Polish and Czech counterparts in an attempt to persuade
U.S. senators to agree to NATO's eastern expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Laszlo said today that all European member countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to NATO's enlargement,
but in the U.S. Senate, at least 20 senators have raised
objections to the necessity of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Laszlo is worried about the U.S. Senate's disapproval of NATO's
eastward expansion, so he will journey to Washington with the
Polish and Czech foreign ministers to meet with them, Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
At a NATO summit in Madrid in July, Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic were accepted as new members in the first group to

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam to Start Joint Marine Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Vietnam will
start a joint survey of marine resources in the waters of the Gulf
of Thailand which once triggered disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The survey is expected to be conducted from November 26 to
December 10 to cover an area of 33,150 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Thailand and Vietnam will carry out
such a project to assess the marine resources in the Gulf of
Thailand, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Vietnam Joint Commission on Fisheries and Law and
Order at Sea, which is chaired by vice foreign ministers of the
two countries, approved the project in April last year in a bid to
forge cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, the Vietnamese and Thai foreign ministries
signed in Bangkok an agreement to delimit some 6,500 square
kilometers of overlapping maritime claims between Thailand and
Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the pact ended nearly two decades of disputes
between the two countries over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn, who signed the
agreement, said then that the pact marked a transition from
conflict to joint cooperation in the exploration of natural
resources and security at sea.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam also said that the
agreement was a big leap forward in the diplomatic relations
between the two countries and reflected the two countries' will to
cooperate.

economy will support the long-term development of the stock
market, with annual economic growth estimated at 8 to 10 percent
in the years to come and inflation at less than five percent.
</P>
<P>
The indicators mean a favorable macro-economic environment for
the stock market and the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Law, which took effect in October, will
deter financial crimes and protect the rights and interests of
investors, which will in turn reduce risks at the marketplace and
attract more funds to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
However, economists say that the expansion of the stock market
must be met with increasing demand, or there will be slumps.

<P>
SEOUL, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea welcomed the
breakthrough in diplomatic talks to realize the four-way talks on
peace on the Korean Peninsula, the Presidential Office said in a
statement released today.

An agreement was reached at the third round of preliminary
meetings held in New York Friday by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), South Korea, China and the United States
to hold the first session of the Four-party Talks on december 9,
in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"We assess it to be the result of a common understanding that
the job of setting peace on the Korean Peninsula by the parties
concerned is more pressing than anything else," Presidential
Spokesman Shin Woo-jae said.
</P>

<P>
The spokesman said, "we look forward to seeing all parties
concerned showing the same sincerity in the talks and work out
broad measures for easing tensions and building trust on the
Korean Peninsula and contributing to peace and stability in
Northeast Asia as well."

President Kim Young-sam and U.S. President Bill Clinton in April
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 21 (Xinhua) -- From January 1, 1998, the
depreciation rate of the forint, the Hungarian currency, will be
controlled within a 0.1 percentage rate, local newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made jointly by government and the National Bank
of Hungary, said the forint's automatic devaluation rate will fall
to 0.9 percent from the present 1 percent beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the decision was based on the country's
improved economy. The growth of GDP in the country this year will
outstrip the former figure of 4 percent, and the budget deficit
will be less than the former plan, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The country's rate of inflation this year will reportedly fall
to 18 percent from 23 percent last year, the export volume is much
more than the import volume, and the real revenue of residents
will increase by 4 percent, the report said.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 animal species are
in danger of extinction in the Mexican southern state of Chiapas,
because of deforestation and other environmental depredations in
the state.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the National History Institute show that
deforestation in Chiapas has resulted in the destruction of more
than 70 percent of the natural habitat of several animal species.
</P>
<P>
The institute's biodiversity conservation director Alberto
Guichard said that the loss of animal habitat is alarming, but
even more dangerous is the fact that the remaining 30 percent is
also threatened by forest fires, excessive lumbering and
over-exploitation of the soil.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that during the past 30 years, the habitat of
the nearly 60 extinct species has been turned into grazing and
agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
He said some species, such as the green parrot, or the jabiru,
have not been seen in the state in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He added that species such as the harpy eagle, the tapir, the
jaguar, and small birds such as tangara, quetzal and pavon, are
also in grave danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Small species, such as salamanders and lizards, could also
vanish because of the destruction of their habitat.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Reform Package Drafted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's think
tank is stepping up drafting an economic reform package to be
implemented in 41 pilot cities across the country, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Included in the package are the reform of State-owned
enterprises, urban economic restructuring, housing and market
reforms and the establishment of a social security system.
</P>
<P>
According to Tong Daning, division chief of the Comprehensive
Programming and Experimentation Department with the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring, the reform measures are
designed to answer the question: what is the socialist market
economy?
</P>
<P>
Some large state-owned firms with a good economic performance
or large market potential are encouraged to form themselves into
group enterprises through merging or buying loss-making firms.
</P>
<P>
Such measures can help optimize the capital structure in
certain regions, said Tong.
</P>
<P>
The means of alleviating the debts of state-owned enterprises
and adjusting their debt structure is another important issue.
</P>
<P>
The State Commission for Economic Restructuring, together with
the State Economic and Trade Commission, are launching experiments
in some cities to find ways of solving the debt problems of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China selected 18 pilot cities to initiate its comprehensive
urban reform program in 1992. The number of cities was increased
to 39 last year, with Urumqi and Shihezi in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region being added to the group this year.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Minister Urges New Gun Laws After Recent Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Austria's Interior Minister
Karl Schloegl called for tough gun laws today shortly after the
country's worst shooting incident in many years.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for a tough, strict gun law and I will
be seeking a majority (vote for it) in parliament," he told state
television after a man shot and killed six people Thursday night
at Mauterndorf, a village about 100 kilometers south of Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, an applicant for a gun license must
undergo an assessment to prove suitability to own a weapon, and
shotguns have to be registered with the local police.
</P>
<P>
Josef Gautsch, a 36-year-old unemployed machinist, committed
suicide when police caught up with him. Earlier he killed his
former wife, her new husband and their three-year-old daughter.
Other victims included the school master of the middle school
where he graduated and the deputy mayor of the village.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the shooting is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Villagers said Gautsch was a loner and familiar with guns.
Police found several weapons and a stack of ammunition in his flat.
</P>
<P>
The sale of pump action shotguns was banned in Austria in 1995
after a sharp increase in the number of murders committed with the
guns reported, many of them by teenagers who killed members of
their families.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, nearly 20 shooting cases between family members
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Just two days ago, a 39-year-old official with the country's
Agriculture and Forestry Ministry killed his elder sister and
wounded his mother and brother in a dispute over the inheritance
of a vineyard.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents are gaining
easier access to knowledge in the municipal government's drive to
popularize science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Displays stored in museums are moving out to be shared by more
people, said Li Yanjun, an official with the social development
department of Beijing Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the capital's more than 30 scientific and
technological museums will be invited to created paintings and
illustrations to circulate in the city's roadside stands next
year, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Ranging from 10 meters to 100 meters long, the stands will
cover a wide scope of knowledge, from ideas on environmental
protection to what medical treatments have been established.
</P>
<P>
The stands can be found along streets in each of the city's
districts and in 10 popular parks, including the Zizhu (Purple
Bamboo) Garden, Zhongshan Park and the Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that, museums are also encouraged to arrange
tours for the displays, especially to villages, where science and
technology center are almost empty.
</P>
<P>
Beijing set up a special committee to popularize science and
technology in 1995. Since then, there has been an annual
government investment in science and technology popularization,
which started at 5 million yuan (602,000 US dollars) in 1995 and
is increasing by 20 percent each year.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Plans to Relax Foreign Equity Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian businessmen
will push for the further liberalization of foreign equity
investments in the region next year to boost confidence and lure
back investors, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Khoo Hock Aun, executive director of the ASEAN
Business Forum (ABF), as saying that allowing foreigners to own up
to 100 percent equity even in domestic-oriented enterprises is one
of the key measures being considered to boost foreign direct
investments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN countries allowed full foreign ownership in
export-oriented enterprises in the early 1980s as a strategy to
attract foreign investors, Khoo said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the ABF feel that this strategy is applicable to
the current crisis but this time they want full foreign equity
extended even to domestic industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What the region needs now is stability and the best way to
achieve this is to attract more foreign direct investments in the
region especially next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ABF meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month will discuss the
further easing of foreign ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since a currency crisis hit Southeast Asian countries in July,
foreign investors have lost their confidence in the region and
shifted their funds to other parts of the world. ASEAN members are
taking confidence-building measures to lure back investors.

<HEADLINE> China's Satellite Export Targeted for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to have the
capability of exporting entire satellites by the year of 2000,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Having successfully entered the international market for launch
services, China currently only exports some satellite spare parts,
said Hua Chongzhi, vice-director of the China Aerospace
Corporation (CASC) International Co-operation Department.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim that China needs to develop satellite technology
as well as explore business opportunities in the world market.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts, a Sino-German joint venture is acting
as the supplier of Sinosat-1, the first communications satellite
built for a Chinese customer.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1994, in Munich by CASC and Daimler Benz Aerospace on
a fifty-fifty basis, EurasSpace aims to win contracts as the prime
contractor with the tasks of developing, manufacturing and
delivering all types of satellites for civil application, Hua
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 per cent of EurasSpace's first satellite project,
Sinosat-1, is financed by German banks, according to Cao
Zhengbang, EurasSpace's Chinese managing director.
</P>
<P>
This has diversified funding sources for the development of
satellites in China, Cao said. In the past, the government
provided all the investment.
</P>
<P>
Hua said that further research was needed into prospective
customers and market demand.
</P>
<P>
China's aerospace industry is focused on the development of
satellite technology and related products, added Hua.

VANCOUVER, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The economy of South Korea
will soon stabilize with the bailout from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Japanese prime minister's spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's present difficulties are "short-term," and its
"economic fundamentals are not bad," said Hiroshi Hashimoto, who

"We sincerely hope that Korean economy would be stabilize" with
the help of the IMF, Hashimoto said in a media briefing here.

<P>
In Seoul, South Korea confirmed today that it is seeking a loan
of some 20 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF to overcome its
deepening financial crisis.

<P>
So far, South Korea "has not separately asked the Japanese
government to extend bilateral assistance," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Gets Rid of Tropical Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese public health
officials has recently announced that Hunan, in south central
China, which used to have a high incidence of filariasis, has
finally rid itself of the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, filariasis ranks
with malaria as one of the six tropical diseases most harmful to
humans.
</P>
<P>
About 30 million Chinese in 15 provinces suffer from the
disease and Hunan alone had some 1.6 million cases.
</P>
<P>
The province launched an all-out attack on the disease in 1952,
sending medicines to remote mountainous areas. By 1986, the
Ministry of Health declared that filariasis had basically been
reduced in Hunan.
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, the province has continued its prevention
and treatment of the disease by building a monitoring
network. And, after a one-week check, experts say they are
convinced that filariasis has finally been eradicated in the
province.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth of fifteen provinces to get completely free
of the disease, health officials say.

<HEADLINE> Shell Mounds Reveal Prehistoric Life in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent study of shell mounds
along the Jiaodong Peninsula coast in east China's Shandong
Province has shown that people were living by farming there some
4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ancestors of people there built mound dwellings out of
shells some 10,000 years ago and depended on shellfish, fishing,
and hunting, according to a team of archaeologists from
Beijing-based Chinese Social Science Academy.
</P>
<P>
The team studied 23 mound sites scattered in 16 counties in
Shandong over the past two years and found that the shells were
smaller and fewer in number as time went by, suggesting a decline
in the shell resources because of the existence of shell-gathering
over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the number of shells is accompanied by an
increase in the amount of rice remains, indicating that the locals
shifted from fishing to farming, the scholars say.
</P>
<P>
The mound studies are just one example of how Chinese
archaeologists have begun to pay more attention to how ancient
people tried to adapt to the environment, something that has lead
to a new branch of the field -- environmental archaeology.

<P>
SHENYANG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in
northeast China plans to establish an export-oriented economy in
the next five years, sources at a provincial conference have
reported.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, Liaoning's governor, told the recent conference
that the province will get two-thirds of its 926 state-owned
enterprises to set up co-operative ventures with overseas
companies over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is the home to about a tenth of China's large- and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and it gets more than 80
percent of its revenues from them, whose fixed assets are valued
at 500 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to prod the provincial economy will involve
bringing in foreign capital, technology, and managerial techniques
to the old enterprises, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
To further promote foreign trade, Liaoning will expand its
export volume to 23 billion U.S. dollars worth by the year 2002,
from last year's 13 billion dollars worth.

SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Standard &AMP; Poor has given the

</P>
<P>
The rating is identical to China's sovereignty rating and is
the first given by Standard &AMP; Poor to a state-owned enterprise in
China that is not in the financial sector. The high rating will
help the company raise funds on the international capital market.
</P>

The triple B-plus rating is an indication of Baogang's good
management and sound financial standing, according to a senior
executive at JP Morgan, the steel works' advisor on rating affairs.

No other steelworks in the world have been reportedly given a

<HEADLINE> Qian Confident of Bright Future for Southeast Asia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The current
financial difficulties in Southeast Asian nations can surely be
overcome after necessary economic structural readjustment, Chinese
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 9th ministerial meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Qian said that he
was quite confident that the economy in this region will have a
bright future.
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial crisis in some countries in the region,
the Asian Pacific rim is still a region with the fastest-growing
economy, Qian told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the countries which sufferred from the
crisis will be able to overcome the difficulties and lay solid
foundation for a new round of economic growth, making even greater
contribution to regional and global economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in the prospects for the growth of the
East Asia economies," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He listed three points of lessons from the financial
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the growing trend towards globalization and
integration, all members need to constantly improve their
respective macro-economic management system and make timely
readjustments to the economic structure to be more responsive and
more flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important prerequisite for an economy to adapt to
external changes and ensure its sound development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Financial turmoil in the Southeast Asia has cast shadows over
the ministerial meeting, which focused on liberalizing investment
and trade.
</P>
<P>
"Speculation has become a very salient problem in international
financial activities," Qian added, urging steps to be taken to
rein in excessive speculation.
</P>
<P>
"The increasingly closer economic ties have made it all the
more necessary for enhancing international and regional
cooperation, which will help maintain a stable and favorable
international economic environment for their economic growth and
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a cooperation is particularly important for developing
economies that are more vulnerable to external economic
fluctuations and speculations owing to their relatively weak
economic foundations," added the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
China has actively joined in the program of financial
assistance to Thailand and Indonesia. "We take a positive
attitude towards enhanced regional financial cooperation in Asia,"
Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Cases Decrease in Russia: Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Just over two million criminal
cases were reported in Russia between January-October this year,
nine percent lower than the same period last year, Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This reduction in crime has occurred in most regions of the
country, Kulikov said, adding that the rate of murder and serious
wounding cases has gone down by two and 15 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Robbery cases have also decreased by seven percent and 118
cases of murder-for-hire have been solved, which is more than
three times the number last year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kulikov said, it was too early to say if this trend
can be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the Russian government will attempt to crack down on
organized and economic crimes, especially those in the financial
field, Kulikov said.

<HEADLINE> Crew Ordered to Abandon Satellite Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) today ordered the crew
aboard shuttle Columbia to temporarily abandon a tumbling
solar-watching satellite.
</P>
<P>
The Spartan satellite was released from the shuttle at 4:03
p.m. EST (2103 GMT) today, but failed to perform a pre-programmed
spin that would have indicated it was ready to begin its
free-flight.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Kalpana Chawla attempted to retrieve the craft, but a
latching mechanism on the shuttle's robot arm failed to snare it.
As Chawla drove the crane back for another try, it inadvertently
bumped the 1 1/2-ton spacecraft, causing it to tumble.
</P>
<P>
The crew waited for the satellite to move into a safe position
for recapture, but after an hour they were told to steer the
shuttle away to leave enough propellant for a later rendezvous and
possible spacewalk to retrieve the craft.
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, NASA had lost any chance of conducting solar
observations with the satellite, now or later in the mission. The
space agency still wanted the satellite back, however, for the
trip home.
</P>
<P>
Spartan was supposed to observe for two days the sun's ionized
outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and the solar wind, the
charged particles hurtling from the sun. The solar wind can
disrupt radio communications and power stations on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's international crew of six was supposed to retrieve
Spartan Sunday night and then gear up for the practice spacewalk
Monday night.

<P>
FRANKFURT, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of European central
banks today reasserted the demand for strict adherence to the
qualification criteria of the planned single European currency,
the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a congress of European banks in Frankfurt today,
German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said, "Any watering
down of the Euro requirements must be avoided."
</P>
<P>
This was the most important prerequisite to ensure a smooth
transition to the monetary union, he added.
</P>
<P>
Like Tietmeyer, French central bank governor Jean-Claude
Trichet also described the adherence to the Euro standards as "an
absolute condition for a smooth transition from national monetary
policies to a common monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence in the punctual start of the Euro on
January 1, 1999, he also said, "The Euro must and will have the
credibility of the most credible European Exchange Rate Mechanism
currencies, in particular the guilder, the mark and the French
franc."
</P>
<P>
In order to qualify for the Euro, European Union states must
bring their budget deficit and national debt to no more than 3
percent and 60 percent of the gross domestic product respectively.

BONN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany said today that it hopes
to resume dialogue with Iran after the return of its ambassador to
Tehran on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Bonn wanted "substantial dialogue" which did not exclude
controversial issues, Martin Erdmann, spokesman for the German
foreign ministry, said today in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Germany, along with other European Union (EU) states, recalled
their envoys from Teheran in April after a Berlin court ruled that
Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish
dissidents in a Berlin restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Ending a seven-month diplomatic dispute, the EU reached a
compromise with Iran earlier this month to allow their envoys to
return in two groups, with the German and French ambassadors to
come back in the second group. Iran insisted earlier that the
German envoy be the last one to resume his post.
</P>
<P>
After the return of most of EU envoys last Friday, the German
and French ambassadors are due to leave for Teheran on Friday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Hague Sacks Pro-European Conservative MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Conservative Party leader
William Hague said today the resignation of pro-European MP Peter
Temple-Morris as a Conservative MP was "inevitable."
</P>
<P>
Hague, who expelled him from the Parliamentary Party, said, "He
is like a footballer who says he will play for the other side at
half-time."
</P>
<P>
"He had to go. We can't have MPs in the party who are not
committed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tory party officials said the reason why Hague decided to expel
the veteran Tory member was because Temple-Morris had "repeatedly
and publicly questioned his continued commitment to the
Conservative Party."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 59-year-old Temple-Morris also announced today that
he was resigning from the Conservative after being suspended from
the parliamentary party.
</P>
<P>
He said he would sit in the parliament as an Independent One
Nation Conservative, but he denied it was the beginning of a split
in the Conservative.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Temple-Morris, an MP for 24 years, had held two
meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair about defecting, but
pulled back in October after another MP pressed Hague to soften
his line on the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Germany's CSU Party Calls for Strict Adherence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Munich, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's conservative
Christian Social Union (CSU) party today renewed its call for
strict adherence to the qualification criteria of the planned
single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
In a position paper adopted today during a party congress in
Munich, the CSU said that under normal circumstances, future
members of the single currency should keep budget deficits well
below the limit of three percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The three-percent limit should be viewed as "a maximum value"
which could only be touched during recession periods, the CSU
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bavarian sister party of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today also stressed that an
independent European central bank was "a central prerequisite" for
a stable Euro.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech to the CSU party congress, Edmund Stoiber,
leader of the German state of Bavaria, also accused Kohl's party
of not being able to take a tough line on asserting the Euro
standards.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his demand that the Euro criteria not be watered
down just in order to jump start the single currency at its
scheduled launching date of January 1, 1999, Stoiber said: "It is
the criteria that should determine the timetable."

<HEADLINE> Greece Finalizes Positions Towards New NATO Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece today finalized its
positions towards the new structure of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a joint meeting chaired by Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos and and National Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Pangalos failed to give the details of Greece's
positions, but described Athens' positions as "solid and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Greece's positions would help not only strengthen the country's
role in that context but also develop the alliance in the new
conditions that had been created in Europe and worldwide, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos also said that following the finalization of
Greece's positions, the desired results would be achieved at the
alliance defense ministers' meeting which will take place in
Brussels on December 1-3.
</P>
<P>
Greece has initially taken a positive view on the new structure
of the alliance, which provides for the establishment of
headquarters of its southeastern Europe flank in Italy with four
sub-headquarters in Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said the abolition of the operational control areas
would not pose any problem for the country's sovereign rights and
Greece maintained the right of veto on issues regarding the
planning, design and materialization of military exercises.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill to Speed Up Drug Approvals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed legislation authorizing the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to speed up the approval of drugs to combat
fatal diseases including cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Although some critics have argued that the law will expose
patients to risky medicine for the benefit of the makers of
experimental drugs and new devices, Clinton said at a White House
signing ceremony, "the FDA has always set the gold standard for
protecting the public safety."
</P>
<P>
Legislation of The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 took three
years.
</P>
<P>
"We know that for many patients, experimental treatments
represent their best -- perhaps their only -- chance for
recovery," Clinton said. "That's why this bill writes into law
current FDA policies that allow doctors and patients to use new
drugs before they are formally approved."
</P>
<P>
"Already thousands of AIDS, cancer, and Alzheimer's patients
have found new hope -- even new life -- with these experimental
therapies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said, "This fall alone, the FDA has
approved new drugs and treatments for everything from HIV to
breast cancer, cardiovascular disease to cystic fibrosis,
Parkinson's to epilepsy."
</P>
<P>
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, said, "The challenge now
is to implement this far-reaching legislation rapidly and
effectively, so that the full benefits of these changes will be
available to patients and industry as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Sydney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, said, "This bill is good for corporate profits and
bad for public health -- period."

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Welcomes South Korea's Request for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, the
Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today
welcomed South Korea's request for financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said,"I have already assured the Korean authorities of our
full support," and "The management of the IMF has been in contact
with the Korean authorities in recent weeks on ways to overcome
the financial crisis, which has arisen despite sound macroeconomic
trends."
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief noted that an IMF mission would be dispatched to
Seoul next week to begin discussions with the Korean authorities.
"We will work closely and intensively with the authorities in
their finalization of a strong program which I could forward to
the Executive Board for approval under the IMF's emergency
financing mechanism."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus issued the statement in the wake of South Korea's
request for IMF's 20 billion U.S. dollar bailout of its foundering
economy.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also asked for an open line of credit in case 20
billion dollars was not enough. Some financial analysts say it
could take three times that amount to stabilize Seoul's economy.
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the South Korean government called the idea of
an IMF loan "unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
The economic situation has been worsening for almost a month,
due to a series of major corporate bankruptcies that brought a
loss of foreign confidence.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has been exacerbated by economic meltdowns elsewhere
in Asia, particularly in Thailand and Indonesia, both of which are
being rescued by the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Release Solar Observatory But Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Astronauts aboard the space
shuttle Columbia today released a sun-watching satellite, but
troubles occurred minutes later and the crew was ordered to
retrieve it immediately.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Kalpana Chawla tried to grab the satellite with the
shuttle robot arm as the spacecraft soared over the Pacific, but
the satellite started to rotate, and she had to pull back the
crane, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Spartan satellite was released shortly after 4:00 p.m.
without any problem. But it failed to perform a pirouette maneuver
to check its onboard systems and then began to spin slowly in
space.
</P>
<P>
Spartan was supposed to fly in the outer space for two days to
observe the sun's ionized outer atmosphere, known as the corona,
and the solar wind, the charged particles hurtling from the sun.
The solar wind can disrupt radio communications and power stations
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's international crew of six was supposed to retrieve
Spartan Sunday night and then gear up for a practice spacewalk
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Computers, Aerospace Predicted to Lead Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Strong demand for computers
and other high-tech goods should maintain the U.S. economy growing
into the next decade, a government report predicted today.
</P>
<P>
Apart from computers, hot industries for 1998 also should
include aerospace, dental equipment and management consulting, the
Commerce Department said today in a revival of an annual
publication discontinued since 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, businesses projected to shrink by the department's
"U.S. Industry &AMP; Trade Outlook '98" include shipbuilding, printing
services, footwear and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The report evaluated 350 business sectors of manufacturing and
services. All major services and more than 80 percent of
manufacturing industries were projected to grow through next year
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the department projected an inflation-adjusted growth
rate in manufacturers' shipments of 5.5 percent annually this year
and next.
</P>
<P>
Computer equipment is leading the way, with 29.6 percent growth
projected annually in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this industry to the economy cannot be
overstated," said Jonathan C. Menes, director of the department's
Office of Trade and Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
"If computers are excluded, the total of all manufacturing
output... would be about 3 percent annually for 1997 and 1998
instead of the 5.5 percent growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
With strong orders for commercial airliners, the aerospace
industry is projected to increase shipments by 17.4 percent a year
in 1997 and 1998. Dental equipment should increase 10.5 percent, a
result of the aging of the Baby Boom generation, and radio and
television equipment, 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
But more traditional sectors of the economy are expected to
show only modest growth compared with high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles and parts shipments should increase 1.8 percent
in 1997 and 1998. The slower growth of the driving-age population
is cutting into sales, but the average cost per vehicle is rising
as older drivers opt for luxury vehicles, especially larger sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, housing starts are slowing so growth in consumer
durable goods should average only 1.3 percent in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some industries face not just slow growth, but contraction.
Shipbuilding should fall 8.5 percent this year and next, a victim
of reduced defense spending. Some printing services such as
typesetting, platemaking and production of color separations
should decrease 6.5 percent as computerization transforms the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Other declines are expected in industries suffering from
competition from imports: handbags and purses, down 6.1 percent;
footwear, down 2.1 percent; and jewelry, down 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among services, a range of computer-related services such as
data processing all are projected to show better than 10 percent
growth in receipts, as are professional services such as
management consulting, public relations and accounting.
</P>
<P>
Travel spending should have a healthy gain of 7.9 percent, a
reflection that many households have purchased the big-ticket
goods they want during the nearly seven years of economic
expansion and are spending disposable income on vacations.
</P>
<P>
Growth in health care services is projected to rise 5.6 percent
this year and 5.9 percent in 1998. Still, U.S. health spending,
forecast at 1.16 trillion U.S. dollars next year, remains 13.5
percent of total economic output, the highest of any
industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department issued annual industrial outlook
reports from 1959 through 1994, but had to suspend the annual
publication due to government budget cuts. The renewal of its
publication is a product of a joint venture between the department
and the McGraw-Hill Companies this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to be Vigilant against Iraq Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that the United States would keep vigilance despite
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to the return of U.N.
weapons inspectors including four Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We must be constantly vigilant and resolute, and with our
friends and partners we must be especially determined to prevent
Saddam's ability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction
program," Clinton said at a ceremony at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the return of the inspectors to Baghdad was an
important achievement and the United States would do whatever to
make sure their mission be resumed unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure that inspectors are able to resume their
mission unimpeded," he said. "They must be able to proceed with
their work without interference to find, to destroy, to prevent
Iraq from building nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
the missiles to carry them."
</P>
<P>
The White House said Washington was looking at how the
inspection teams could assume a "stronger presence" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes they are going to have a stronger
presence in Iraq in order to accomplish" their work, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry declined to specify what kind of stronger presence
would be taken, and only said, "There are a variety of ways you
can make it stronger." Political analysts speculated that that
could include more flights of U-2s over Iraq for U.S. mission or
an enlarged inspection team.

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- One of Britain's top tour
agencies today canceled all holiday trips to Egypt until the end
of the year following a terrible massacre in upper Egypt Monday in

In the massacre six Britons and 53 other tourists were shot
dead by six Egyptian fundamentalists at Luxor's Hatshepsut temple,
dealing a heavy blow to the country's thriving tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He said about 8,000 British holiday makers would be affected
and these people would be offered alternative destinations.
