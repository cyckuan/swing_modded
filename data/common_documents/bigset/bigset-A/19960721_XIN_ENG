<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani to Visit Turkey in Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani is going to visit Turkey in autumn in a bid to mend
ties between the two neighboring countries, a press report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper +Ettellat+ reported that President
Rafsanjani had sent separate messages to Turkish President
Sulleiman Demirel, and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan who heads
the pro-Islamic Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new Turkish prime minister is going to
visit Tehran at the invitation by President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no specific dates for the visits of
the Iranian president and the Turkish prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press reported that the Turkish prime minister was
unhappy with the present state of Tehran-Ankara relations, which
have turned ice-cold since Turkey signed a military accord with
Israel early this year.
</P>
<P>
In his message to President Sulleiman Demirel, Rafsanjani
stressed the common interests and deep cultural ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also called for continued dialogue and
consultations between the two sides, a vehicle of peace and
stability in the region as he termed.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also expressed Iran's pleasure at the formation of
the new Turkish government headed by Erbakan and stressed the
importance of expaning ties with Islamic and neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed to the recent "unpleasant incidents" in the
border regions of the two countries, expressing confidence that
Demirel's special policy and insight would prevent the repetition
of such incidents.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Build Giant Oil-Processing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will soon build a giant
project to process crude oil extracted from oil fields in western
desert into petroleum products, Minister of Oil Hamdy el-Banbi
said today.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be situated in the Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria, will be part of the country's efforts to increase oil
revenues, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to produce 39,000 tons of butane gas,
256,000 tons of solar and 9,300 tons of naphtha a year, according
to Sameh Fahmi Said, Deputy Chairman of the Egyptian General
Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost a total of 350 million Egyptian
pounds (100 million U.S. dollars), is expected to be finished in
42 months.

<HEADLINE> French Company Rejects Reports of Child Labor in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The French energy group Total has
rejected reports that the group is exploiting child labor in a gas
field in Yadana, Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde published for
its Sunday-Monday edition, Daniel Valot, general director of the
Exploration and Production Department of Total, said that there
are no children in the gas field.
</P>
<P>
He said the television report, made by the British ITV channel
belonging to Carlton UK and shown on television in several
European countries in May, is inconsistent between its commentary
and picture, and Total is "the victim of a persistent and
malicious campaign of disinformation."
</P>
<P>
"The pictures were taken in a construction site which is not
ours," said Valot, adding that reporters and human rights groups
are welcome to see for themselves in Myanmar whether Total employs
children or not.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company employs 500-600 local adult men and
women during the drought season there, has built a medical network
for local villages, helps develop local cattle trade and help
eradicate the malaria epidemic there.
</P>
<P>
Valot said that Total is not the only company joining the
project and the American company Unocal, the Thai company PTT-EP
and the Myanmar company MOGE also have investment in the project
which totals 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, the biggest energy project in Myanmar which is
developed to provide energy to neighboring Thailand, is expected
to start producing gas in 1998, and making profits by 2002, he
said.

<HEADLINE> 300 Soldiers killed in Mullaitivu Fighting: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Around 300 government soldiers
have been killed and over 200 others injured during the recent
Tamil rebel attack on the Mullaitivu army base in the northeastern
coast of Sri Lanka, according to a military news release issued
tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, the release said that the exact number killed or
wounded cannot be ascertained yet due to the difficulty in
communicating with the troops at Mullaitivu town.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebel transmissions monitored so far indicated that over
400 rebels were killed and a large number injured, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan navy was able to ferry a large number of fresh
troops today to strengthen the troops advancing towards
Mullaitivu. The first such group was beach landed at 14:30 hours
today. The Sri Lankan Air Force provided close air support to
ensure safety of the troops while landing.
</P>
<P>
The release said that operation code named "Thrivida Pahara"
(three sides attack) was launched on July 18 with the aim of
providing assistance to troops who came under the Tamil rebel
attack on the Mullaitivu base.
</P>
<P>
Initially troops of the special forces were landed three to
four kilometers south of Mullaitivu in order to secure a beach
head. As reported earlier these troops came under the enemy's
fire, resulting in a delay in advancing towards the Mullaitivu
base, said the release, adding that the Sri Lankan air force
continued to provide fire support to the reinforcing troops.

<HEADLINE> French FM to Start Mideast Tour Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette Monday will begin a three-day visit to the Middle East to
renew the peace process which has stalled since Israel's
right-wing forces came to power at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who will visit Damascus, Beirut, Jerusalem, the
Gaza Strip, Amman and Cairo, will be the first foreign minister
from a European Union country to visit Israel since Bejamin
Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
However, de Charette's first meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu is overshadowed by the dispute over whether the
foreign minister should visit the East House, the official seat of
the Palestine Liberation Organization in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
France has insisted on the freedom to travel to East Jerusalem,
while the Israeli government has recently increased pressure on
East House, indicating that it is studying measures to ban senior
foreign officials from visiting the place.
</P>
<P>
"We will not give in to pressure (from Israel). The minister
will do what is considered to be worth to do," Foreign Ministry
officials said last Friday.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that he would carry no prejudice against
anyone, but will be firm on the point that the commitments already
made by both sides of the Mideast should be taken into action.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will also remind the leaders of the Mideast
countries that the enemies of peace will take advantage of the
present deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The commitments, made between former Israeli Prime Ministers
Yitzak Rabin and Shimon Peres and Arab leaders, have been
jeopardized by the intransigent stance of Netanyahu, who succeeded
in silencing criticism from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak but
made no concession during his latest visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
De Charette's visit coincides with one by U.S. coordinator for
Mideast peace process Dennis Ross, who will also be in the Mideast
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the parallel visits by
de Charette and Ross could lead to another Franco-U.S. rivalry in
mediating peace talks in the region.
</P>
<P>
France and the United States have competed in arranging a
ceasefire after Israel launched raids against Hezbollah guerillas
in south Lebanon and Beirut in April.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, France-U.S. diplomatic cooperation at that time
led to the establishment of a monitoring committee of ceasefire in
south Lebanon, which will hold its first session on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The committee, consisting representatives from Israel, Syria
and Lebanon besides France and the United States, will be a place
to test whether Paris and Washington can work hand in hand on the
Mideast, said the AFP.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report Reveals Britain as Most Unequal Western Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain is now the most unequal
country in the Western world with an increasingly widening gap
between the rich and poor, said a United Nations report carried in
today's Sunday Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Inequality in Britain has grown sharply over the past few years
and the poor now have to "live on much the same incomes as their
equivalents" in some developing countries, said the U.N. Human
Development Report.
</P>
<P>
"The United Kingdom, unfortunately, has an exceptionally high
degree of inequality," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The poorest 40 percent of the British people share only 14.6
percent of the national wealth, much lower than any other Western
country, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the report show that the richest fifth of Britons
enjoy, on average, incomes 10 times as high as those of the
poorest fifth.
</P>
<P>
Comparison with earlier Human Development Reports also
indicates that inequality has been growing very fast in Britain,
which was ranked around middle of the industrialized countries for
the gap between the incomes of the richest and poorest fifth in
1991.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 report, the richest fifth of Britons had incomes
6.8 times as much as those of the the poorest fifth.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Telecom Workers' Union Calls off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A workers' union of the
state-run Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC) today called off a major
strike in protest of the government's policy to privatize the
country's telecom industry.
</P>
<P>
The NTC Employees' Association today issued a statement calling
upon all NTC workers to resume their work after the over
two-week-long nationwide strike had caused inconvenience to
telecom customers in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the government has agreed to fulfill its demand for
providing autonomy to the NTC, the union decided to end its
protest campaign, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information and Communications last week
justified its privatization policy but promised to give full
autonomy to the NTC within three years. The NTC monopolizes the
country's telecom services at present.
</P>
<P>
The NTC workers' strike was triggered two weeks ago by the
Ministry's earlier decision to allow private companies to open new
 telecommunication services like radio paging and mobile phone in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far granted permissions to nine
companies, mostly supported by foreign investment, to begin to
operate such modern telecommunication services in Nepal, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Growing New Jobs Are Good Ones in U.S.--New York Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A rising share of new jobs in the
United States have paid more than average since 1992, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
After years of downsizings of companies, many Americans have
worried about their earnings. But millions of them have found in
the past five years that new jobs more than replace the lost ones,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that people usually got less pay in new
jobs. But it is not the situation, according to a set of
government figures of the past five years about the changes in
jobs and earnings. It said 25 percent of the new jobs in 1995 paid
at least 30 percent more than the national average income, which
was 29,420 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the jobs created across the country last
year paid more than the national average wage of 29,420 U.S.
dollars. In 1992, that proportion was just 22 percent. Of the new
jobs created last year, fully one-quarter paid more than 30
percent above the average. In 1992, only 4 percent of the new jobs
paid that well.
</P>
<P>
These jumps are encouraging, the paper said, considering that
many new jobs, such as Internet, are for young people just
entering the work force, and they typically earn less than
experienced workers.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that the economy is churning out better
jobs than many Americans might think.

<HEADLINE> Two Other Bombs Defused After 35 Hurt in Blast in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two other bombs were found today by
Spanish police in luxury hotels and defused without injury, hours
after 35 people, most of them British, were injured in an
explosion at Reus Airport in Tarragona, northeastern Spain.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the Saturday blast, the Basque separatist
group ETA called newspapers to warn of four bombs, according to
reports from the Efe news agency.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said one of the two other bombs was found
in a washroom of the hotel in Salou, on the northeast Spanish
coast. Police had to evacuate some 500 Dutch tourists there before
detonating the device. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The third exploded shortly afterwards at a beach hotel in
Cambrils without any injury because police had time to clear the
area after warnings.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are searching for the fourth bomb claimed in the
telephone warnings. There was no fourth explosion.
</P>
<P>
Police had just begun evacuating 1,000 people from Reus Airport
in Tarragona, about 85 kilometers south of Barcelona, when the
bomb exploded in a trash can outside a restaurant in the passenger
lounge.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 of the 35 injured were British holiday-makers, four
of them in serious conditions, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was a six-year-old British boy.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Secretary of State for Communications Miguel Rodriguez
condemned the bombings in a statement and called for public "calm
and serenity" facing the ETA bloody move.
</P>
<P>
ETA separatists had claimed a series of small bomb attacks this
month at tourist sites around Spain with an aim to cripple the
country's tourist industry, but most came after warnings. Until
Saturday, there were no injury.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the ETA has killed some 800 people since 1968
when it began to fight for independence of northern Spain's Basque
region.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Students Banned From Commemoration in French City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A dozen Jewish students in the
southern city of Toulon today were banned from joining a local
commemoration of the rounding-up of Jews in the Velodrome d'Hiver
in Paris on July 16, 1942.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration was jointly organized by the Prefecture of
Val and the Municipality of Toulon, which is run by a mayor from
the ultra-rightist Front National (FN) party, the Agence France
Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted prefecture officials as saying that the students
were banned because they carried boards with letters of "Former
collaborators, Members of FN."
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-four years after the rounding up of Jews in Velodrome
d'Hiver, it is illogical to observe that the Jewish students of
France are considered as second class citizens," said Yariv
Abshsera, president of the Union of Jewish Students of France.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration was presided over by Val prefect Jean Charles
Marchiani, but Toulon's FN mayor Jean-Marie Le Chevallier did not
attend.
</P>
<P>
French police rounded up 13,000 Jews on July 16, 1942, in
Velodrome d'Hiver of Paris and then transported them to Nazi death
camps.
</P>
<P>
The event represented one of the darkest pages of the history
of the Vichy collaboration period in France from 1940 to 1944.

<HEADLINE> Four Auto Production Bases Set up in Xiangfan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Five years after development work
began, four auto industry bases have been set up in Xiangfan
Automotive Industry Development Zone in central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Using an investment of two billion yuan (about 241 million US
dollars), the zone has established an auto power base, a
light-duty vehicle base, an auto parts production base, and a
research and development base for light-duty cars, covering a
total area of 955,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The power base, which includes auto power, diesel engine and
casting plants, provides equipment for the Dongfeng and Shennong
companies.
</P>
<P>
The light-duty vehicle base is undertaking a project involving
two billion yuan (about 241 million US dollars) in investment,
that will soon form an annual production capacity of 150,000
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In the auto parts production base, the Shenlong Auto Main
Engine Processing Plant, a Sino-French project, is expected to
equip 300,000 automobiles a year. The plant is currently capable
of producing parts for 150,000 automobiles annually.
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng Company's light-duty vehicle research and development
center, the largest of its kind, has been set up in the
development zone.
</P>
<P>
The new zone has become a vital auto production base in central
China. So far, 110 enterprises involving 69 projects have been
established there.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met today with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Syria's
port city of Latakia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was attended by Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara, Moussa briefed President al-Assad on the
outcome of the talks held between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Cairo Thursday,
reliable Syrian sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed the developments in the Middle East region
and the recent contacts made by both Syria and Egypt at the Arab
and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Moussa also held talks on ways of developing the
outcome of the recent Cairo Arab summit and boosting Arab joint
action so that a fair and overall peace can be established in the
region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived in Latakia this morning for a visit to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu visited Cairo Thursday, his first visit to an Arab
country after his victory in Israel's May 29 elections. His public
remarks in Cairo appeared to signal a softer Israeli approach
toward future Arab-Israel peace moves.
</P>
<P>
But Syria said that Netanyahu's statements in Cairo have failed
to clearly affirm his commitment to the land-for-peace principle,
on which the Middle East peace process was based.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Syria Times said today that Damascus
would not resume peace talks with Israel unless the Jewish state
pledged to return to its control the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Banks Urged to Lend More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will extend the lending
ceilings of its commercial banks to encourage them lending more to
Vietnamese businesses, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Le Van Chau, deputy governor of Vietnam's central bank, the
State Bank, was quoted by (VNA) as saying that the central bank
will also give priority to long and mid-term loans.
</P>
<P>
The move by the central bank is aimed at cutting the huge "dead
lending capital" in the commercial banks of the country, estimated
at 10,000 billion dong (nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars), VNA said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will work together with the Ministry of Finance to
regularly open treasury bill biddings and issue state bank bonds
aimed at regulating capital sources among commercial banks, the
deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that loans given by Vietnamese banks account for
only 60 to 70 percent of their usable capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, some commercial banks were still yet to use
the credit ceilings set for 1996 by the State Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the commercial banks, however, do not agree. They
argued that stagnation in the capital lending market has been
caused by low lending limits set by the State Bank.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that commercial banks could not put their
idle money to use by increasing investment in businesses, as
Vietnamese laws impose limits on the proportion of bank investment
in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
VNA said it is a paradox that while large amounts of money
remains idle in banks, many businesses are badly in need of
capital to purchase advanced technical equipment for long-term
development.
</P>
<P>
At least both sides agree that the present interest rates of
bank loans are too high, averaging 21 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The current lending regulations is too harsh and complicated,
often beyond the capacity of businesses, VNA said, for instance,
to get bank loans, a business must hold at least 30 percent of its
total investment, and have enough property to mortgage.
</P>
<P>
VNA said many businesses, especially private companies, do not
fulfill bank lending regulations. At present, only 5 percent of
Vietnam's private businesses have access to bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the lending capital surplus at Vietnamese
banks is that domestic businesses have borrowed an estimated total
of 1 billion U.S. dollars from foreign banks, who offer lower
interest rates and longer repayment terms than Vietnamese banks.
</P>
<P>
By offering annual interest rates of only 7 percent, many
foreign banks are luring domestic customers away from Vietnamese
banks, and placing domestic banks in an untenable situation, VNA
said.

<HEADLINE> European Union Urges Pakistan to Diversify Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan must diversify its
exports to the European Union (EU) to maintain its share of trade
on the European market, a visiting senior EU official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here this afternoon, Manuel
Marin, vice president of the European Union (EU), said that
Pakistan's exports to the EU concentrated on only three items
including textile, garment and leather.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan needs to diversify its industrial production and
exports to the European market as it will be in open competition
with other exporters of textile, garments and leather in the next
few years," Marin said.
</P>
<P>
"In the next five to ten years, all elements of the World Trade
Organization agreement will be in force and Pakistan will be in
the open competition," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Pakistani government to provide economic and
financial assistance to other industries to create opportunities.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Pakistan, Marin had discussions
with Pakistani leaders on the matters relating to signing a new
accord of cooperation between Pakistan and the European Commission
(EC).
</P>
<P>
"We want to upgrade the economic relations between the EU and
Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU, the largest trading partner of Pakistan, digested 27.5
percent of Pakistan's total exports in the 1995-96 fiscal year
starting from July 1, 1995.

BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The investigation into the
criminal case involving the appropriation of public residences for
private use by Beijing's former vice-mayor Wang Baosen, has ended.
</P>

According to a municipal source, Wang illegally obtained 116
residences for private use and distribution between July 1988 and

center of China.
</P>
<P>
Among those companies swarming to the investment hot spot this
year are the US Philip Morris Company, Germany's Robert Bosch
GmbH, and Japan's Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (NEC).

industries.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the output value of local leading

<HEADLINE> Prince William Suggested to Open Sydney 2000 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer said today that he would be happy to see the Queen
open the Sydney 2000 Olympics, but suggested Prince William might
be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the "Meet the Press" program in TV Ten Network,
Fischer said "Yesterday's Olympic Games opening ceremony failed to
properly show aspects of American or Greek culture, and Sydney's
effort in four years' time should combine Australian culture and
Olympic razzmatazz."
</P>
<P>
In this context, he said Prince William -- second in line to
the British throne behind his father Prince Charles -- might be
appropriate, "perhaps Prince William should try his hand."
</P>
<P>
His remarks immediately renewed debate on the issue of the
Australian republic, the federal oppositions, Democrats and
Republicans condemned the suggestion by Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Australian Republican Movement Chairman Malcolm Turnbull said
he was astonished by the idea, "the Olympic Games are opened by
the Head of State of the host country, that is why President
Clinton declared the Games open in Atlanta yesterday."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Labor Party said, his party believes the
Sydney Olympics should be opened by the Australian head of state.
"We hope by that time the Australian people will have been given
an opportunity to express an opinion on whether our head of state
should be an Australian."
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot also opposed the
Fischer's idea and expressed that the Democrats would campaign in
a referendum for Australia becoming a republic.
</P>
<P>
So far as the ruling coalition is concerned, although many of
them support the monarchy, they also agreed to hold a referendum
to decide whether Australia should become a republic, however,
they would hold a people's convention ahead of the referendum with
half of the members of the convention appointed by the coalition.

<HEADLINE> EU, Pakistan to Upgrade Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The economic cooperation between
the European Union (EU) and Pakistan will be upgraded, a visiting
senior EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the Pakistani Foreign Office this
afternoon, EU Vice President Manuel Marin said, "last year, the
total export of Pakistan to the EU got an increase of 25 percent."
</P>
<P>
However, the total export volume which stood less than 2
billion US dollars was modest, Marin said, adding that both the EU
and Pakistan expressed the hope to further increase the bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's export to the EU concentrated on three items
including textile, garment and leather, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is a country which plays an important role in this
region and in the Islamic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
So, the EU is willing to enhance its cooperation with Pakistan
in more fields, he said, adding that both sides will create more
opportunities and possibilities in the bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU has submitted to the European Commission a
detailed mandate of new cooperation and partnership between the EU
and Pakistan, which is expected to be singed early next year.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit in Pakistan, Marin held talks with
the Pakistani president, the prime minister and other senior
government officials on various issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali today spoke
highly of the Marin's visit.
</P>
<P>
He said, "this is the first time for high-level contacts
between Pakistan and the EU."
</P>
<P>
All the meetings between Marin and Pakistani senior officials
were "creative, productive and satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Although there were still some problems which needed to be
solved through discussion, Pakistan was encouraged to strengthen
its cooperation with the EU, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Han Prince's Remains Unearthed in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Complete skeletal remains of a
prince who lived during the early Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) have
been unearthed from a lacquer coffin decorated with more than
1,600 pieces of jade.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was found in a large tomb, where China's most
precious jade robe was unearthed earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists were surprised that the skeleton had
remained intact for 2,100 years. They said that the prince, Liu
Wu, was 1.72 m tall and died when he was about 35.
</P>
<P>
Experts have sculpted a likeness of the prince, who has a
strong, wide lower jaw and is said to appear arrogant.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that Liu, Prince of Chu of the third
generation, united with six other princes to fight against the Han
emperor, his cousin.
</P>
<P>
Liu was defeated and committed suicide. However, he was buried
with honors in a 117 m long, 13.2 m wide tomb, dug deep into Mount
Lion in present-day Xuzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, the
site of his fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it took at least twenty years to build the
tomb.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was robbed soon after it was completed, but it still
contained 1,500 objects of gold, silver, bronze, iron, jade,
pottery, and lacquer, plus nearly 100 pieces of weaponry, 176,000
copper coins and 200 official seals.
</P>
<P>
Experts place the highest value on the jade, including the jade
coffin and jade robe, which were made of highest quality stone
from Hetian in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Excavation of the tomb began in 1994, and is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists are now trying to find the chamber that
contains the remains of Liu's wife. Princes who lived during the
Han Dynasty were buried with their wives and a unique scent,
probably from the wife's chamber, can be smelled in tomb, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Shows Concern for Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has toured
flood-stricken Hunan and Hubei Provinces in central China to
express his sympathy and concern for the flood victims and oversee
the relief work there.
</P>
<P>
The Premier, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, the State Council and President Jiang Zemin, extended
regards for the people affected by the floods, particularly the
People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, the armed police
and the public security forces who are battling the raging waters.
</P>
<P>
Since July, torrential rains have caused serious flooding in
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake
Valley. Water levels in the flooded areas have surpassed the
danger mark.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun flew
to the most seriously-hit areas in Taiyuan County in the Dongting
Lake region to visit the flood victims and relief workers.
</P>
<P>
Today, they went on to Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, to inspect the relief efforts along the embankments of
the Yangtze River and give speeches on combating the floods.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the flood-stricken people, under the
leadership of provincial Party committees and governments, have
been successful so far in their fight against the severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Premier urged them to be on the alert in their drive
against heavy flooding. He called on local residents to be
confident about conquering the floods, and to start reconstruction
and the restoration of crop production where the flood has
receded, so as to have a bumper harvest in spite of the flooding.

<HEADLINE> Fossilized Human Skulls, Bone Ware Found in Stone Age Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two fossilized human skulls,
nearly 1,000 utensils made from bone, and traces of fire have been
discovered in Chuandong Cave, about 120 km from this capital of
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts says that the skulls, which date back 8,000
years, are the first from that time period ever found in south
China. The bone items, which scientists say are older than the
skulls, dispel the long-held belief that boneware was non-existent
in China in the late Paleolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 animal bone fragments and 500 teeth were also
found in the cave.
</P>
<P>
Relics from the cave date from 16,000 to 8,000 years ago,
indicating that the history of human beings living in the region
can be traced back that far, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the cave, 30 m long, 13 m wide and nine m
high, is warm in winter and cool in summer, and offered favorable
living conditions for the ancient residents.
</P>
<P>
The cave was discovered in 1978 and has been listed among 500
historical sites under state protection.

<HEADLINE> SLA Prisoners Freed by Hezbollah Arrive in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kafr Tibnit, Lebanon, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen prisoners
of the militia of the South Lebanese Army (SLA) set free by
Hezbollah arrived here as part of the swap of prisoners and
remains between Hezbollah and Israel in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over ceremony will be conducted in the presence of the
International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) at a square in the
village.
</P>
<P>
The 17 prisoners were ferried here in nine vehicles of the
IRCC, which are parked at the eastern entrance of the village Kafr
Tibnit, which is situated on the Israeli-Lebanese border in the
Israeli self-claimed "Security Zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The IRCC officials, who arrived here at 8:00 local time (0500
GMT) in 50 ambulances of the Red Cross, are awaiting the arrival
of the prisoners set free by Israel so as to conduct the ceremony
of swapping prisoners between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
An IRCC spokesman told Xinhua that the 17 prisoners were handed
over to them by the Lebanese authorities in Beirut this morning.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there are the remains of two Israeli soldiers in
the convoy, the spokesman said that this morning the Lebanese
authorities sent two coffins to the IRCC, which in turn handed
them to a German delegation at the Beirut airport.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unclear for the time being whether the two
coffins contained the remains of the Israeli soldiers. "We are not
part of the arrangement. We are only responsible for the transfer,"
he said, adding that it is not their responsibility to identify the
prisoners and remains.
</P>
<P>
A thin-faced SLA prisoner told Xinhua that he is 30 and has
been held by Hezbollah for two years and eight months. He also
said the jail terms vary considerably for the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He refused to reveal his name, saying that all of the prisoners
were told not to answer questions by reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 17 prisoners sat in four ambulances, and are forbidden
to go out of the vehicles before the hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Several bearded youths attempted to pass the security line
by police, resulting in a minor conflict with the police. The two
sides exchanged kicks and blows, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel will also hand over 45 prisoners to Lebanon. The
prisoners were jailed at Khiam deeply inside the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon,
</P>
<P>
As Hezbollah called on the families of the dead soldiers to
converge in the village today, about 3,000 of them arrived by 9:00
a.m. (0600 GMT) and many more continued to arrive in the village.
</P>
<P>
According to Red Cross officials, only nine of the 150 remains
have been identified.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers' Remains Return Home in Swap Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A German military plane carrying
the bodies of two Israeli soldiers died in 1986 in south Lebanon
arrived at Tel Aviv today in a German-brokered swap deal between
Israel and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Yosef Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh were
immediately transferred to the Israeli Army's chief rabbi for
identification check when the plane arrived this morning at the
Ben-Gurion Airport from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the bodies of the two Israeli
soldiers were firstly handed over to the Red Cross in Beirut, and
then over to German mediator Bernd Schmidbauer.
</P>
<P>
Fink and Alsheikh were abducted in 1986 in an ambush by the
Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon. The two later died in
captivity. Several previous efforts to secure return of the two's
bodies failed before the latest efforts launched by the German
team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Army handed over more than 100 bodies of
slain Hezbollah soldiers to the Red Cross in a south Lebanon
village, which will be transferred to the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
And, as the second part of the swap deal, the Israeli side
released 45 Hezbollah prisoners in exchange for 17 South Lebanon
Army soldiers captured by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Mediator Schmidbauer, a top intelligence adviser to German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said that it took him three months
to secure the swap deal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to meet with
Schmidbauer this afternoon to discuss the whereabouts of other
Israeli soldiers missing in action. It is hoped that the swap
will lead to a bigger deal in the future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman welcomed the exchange as a
relief for the families of the two soldiers, who have
suffered long pains and sorrows. He added that, despite the
anger against "enemies", "there are also mothers waiting in
the other side."

According to official sources at Syria's Irrigation Ministry,
Syria will provide all the facilities necessary for the center
including a residence, provided that the Arab League will bear
the research expenses and wages of technical experts and other

Most Arab countries in the region have to share water resources
with their neighboring countries. The establishment of such a

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Enterprises Seek Help from Short-term Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in Shanghai are
raising an increasing amount of capital by issuing short-term
bonds, which totaled nearly one billion yuan in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The money went to 83 local firms, including 13 listed in the
stock market, considerably relieving their shortages of operating
funds, according to the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
With a tight monetary policy, the bank could not provide
sufficient indirect financing for the businesses. Thus, short-term
bonds have proved to be an effective way for raising operating
capital.
</P>
<P>
Last year, short-term bonds brought in almost 1.8 billion yuan
in new capital.
</P>
<P>
Almost 800 enterprises have issued short-term bonds in Shanghai
since 1987, raising a total of 10 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: 29th AMM, Most fruitful Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here today that the 29th Ministerial Meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) broke new ground as
it forged ahead in the directions set forth by the ASEAN leaders
and has been a most fruitful meeting -- an appropriate finale to a
watershed year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the two-day meeting
attended by all the seven ASEAN members, Alatas said that the
joint communique which emanated from the meeting addressed a broad
range of issues and common concerns and manifested ASEAN's firm
resolve to carry out decisions taken by its leaders during the
fifth summit in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who is also chairman of the ASEAN's annual meeting,
said that "We have moved considerably closer to the realization of
a Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN), a development
made possible by the fact that the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation
(TAC) and the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Free Zone have
already been signed by all ten countries of Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a set of criteria for participation in the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
In view of the keen interest of many countries outside the
region to participate in the exchange of views and information on
political and security matters that take place in this Forum,
Alatas expected that the ARF process will advance much further.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, he said, the meeting has focused on the
theme of "greater economic integration" and thereby accelerated
and deepened its common commitments under the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has also expanded its economic cooperation into new
sectors and strengthened its linkages with economies within the
region and beyond, he added.
</P>
<P>
Following the AMM, the third ARF meeting and the annual Post
Ministerial Conference (PMC) will be held here from July 23 to 25.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Serious Water Crisis (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newspaper cited the official as saying that droughts are
among the problems that have had the greatest influence on the
country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million hectares of farmland are hit by disastrous
droughts every year, and the reduction of grain output caused by
droughts in the first four years in the 1990s reached over 3.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages also threatened the people's lives in some
areas where the survival environment is deteriorating with land
subsidence and cracks.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has a water shortage of 30 billion
cubic meters for rural areas and six billion cubic meters for
urban people. By the year 2000, the country will need at least 60
billion cubic meters more of water.
</P>
<P>
In addition to water shortages, water pollution has been a
major concern for the Chinese government, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's daily discharge of sewage and polluted
water totals more than 100 million tons, and over 80 percent is
directly poured into rivers and lakes without any pre-disposal
treatment, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
Among 532 rivers monitored by the ministry, 436 are polluted in
various ways, he said, adding that out of 15 sections of the
country's seven biggest rivers near major cities, 13 are seriously
polluted.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River is known as the only water source in northern
Anhui Province, but water pollution has occurred frequently in the
area, local residents have become sick, and fish have been
poisoned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited the minister as saying that the Chinese
government has paid close attention to issues of water shortage
and pollution, and formulated a range of regulations on water
control and supply.
</P>
<P>
Many projects in water control, sewage disposal, water supply
and water safety, have been implemented during the Eighth Five
Year Plan (1991-1995), and more are expected to be built in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged governments at all levels to take effective
steps to strengthen the management of water resources, halt water
pollution and ensure fresh water supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people will be unable to
drink clean water in the coming two or three decades if no
effective measures are taken, a senior government official has
warned.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage and water pollution are becoming a major
headache in current and future China, "Science and Technology
Daily" cited Minister of Water Resources Niu Maosheng as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among more than 600 large and medium-sized cities, over half
are short of water, and 108 are badly in want of water, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
China has a total water resource of 2,800 billion cubic
meters. The nation's average per capita water availability is
about 2,300 cubic meters, while in its nine northern provinces it
is only 500 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the average per capita water availability is less
than 400 cubic meters, one seventh of the country's average, and
one twenty-eighth of the world norm, the newspaper cited Niu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies from local reservoirs are far less able to meet
the demand. The capital city has to exploit 2.6 to 2.7 billion
cubic meters of underground water each year. As a result, the
underground water level reduced to 50 meters below the sea level
in 1993, from five meters in 1950, and the over-use of underground
water has caused subsidence across 2,100 square kilometers, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that by the year 2010, there will be a lack
of one billion cubic meters for industrial and daily water use,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The average water availability per capita in north China's port
city Tianjin is the smallest in the country, amounting for 6.7
percent of the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In other big cities, like Xi'an, Taiyuan, Datong, Qingdao,
Yantai and Dalian, water has been in short supply for a long
time. Water is supplied at regular intervals in many cities, and
residents have to get up at midnight to store water.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, south China's Shenzhen City was badly in
need of water. More than 100,000 residents were reported to have
had no access to water for a week. In 1995 college students in the
city of Xi'an had to leave school in advance without terminal
examinations, because of water shortages.

<HEADLINE> Relief Food Sent to Refugee Camp in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) sent
emergency food aid to Acholpi refugee camp in northern Uganda --
the first relief food to arrive at the beleaguered camp since a
bloody rebel attack over a week ago.
</P>
<P>
A WFP release issued here today said the U. N. food aid agency
sent five trucks carrying 80 tons of food to Acholpi camp on June
15, and they pulled into Lira, some 90 kms from Acholpi the next
day and arrived at the camp this morning after the convoy
received security clearance.
</P>
<P>
Acholpi camp is home to some 16,000 refugees from southern
Sudan and the food delivered can cater for them for a period of
two weeks, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan rebels attacked Acholpi camp on July 12 and 13,
killing more than 100 refugees and burning down 335 makeshift
homes in "most horrific assaults on refugees ever in the region."
</P>
<P>
WFP's convoys are usually escorted by soldiers to northern
Uganda because rebels attacks would occur at any time.
</P>
<P>
On July 4, rebels ambushed 11 WFP trucks returning from
northern Uganda, killing several people and burning four trucks.
Two Ugandan nationals hired were killed in the raid.
</P>
<P>
Civil war forced Sudanese refugees to flee to northern Uganda
and they began arriving in the districts of Moyo, Arua, Masindi
and Kitgum in 1988. WFP has been providing food to 216,000
southern Sudanese living in refugee camps and settlements there
since.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Wipe out Iodine Deficiency Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to eliminate its
alarming occurrence of iodine deficiency diseases (IDD) in the
next few years, according to a health official.
</P>
<P>
"Over 80 percent of Chinese have now used iodized salt and all
the people in areas prone to the endemic goiter and cretinism have
access to iodized salt," said Vice-Minister of Public Health Yin
Dakui, after hearing a report from the United Nations officials.
</P>
<P>
The UN delegation conducted a 15-day assessment and discussion
of the country's international cooperation projects for
elimination of IDD by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Aided by the World Bank, China has built a 980-million yuan
project for salt iodization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tough task for a country with a population of 1.2
billion people to spread in a long run the standard iodized salt,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
This task is even more difficult in the 592 poverty-stricken
counties with 65 million inhabitants, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Chinese government is to make all salt in the
country iodized by 1996, and to eliminate IDD nationwide by the
year 2000.

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Ministry of Culture has asked the country's entertainment industry
to serve the ordinary people, instead of pleasing a small group of
well-off along, according to the China Culture News.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xiaosi, an official in charge of the cultural market,
attributed the recent slump in the recreation industry to
"irrational development", the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, there are more than 170,000 places of
recreation across the country, but most of them only cater to the
needs of "big shots" or the rich, Meng noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture will strengthen control of the culture
market and the entertainment industry so as to ensure better

<HEADLINE> EU Reduces Duty on Import of Rice from Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
agreed to reduce 50 percent of the duty on its import of rice from
Pakistan, a visiting senior EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here this afternoon, EU Vice
President Manuel Marin said that the reduction solved a negative
point in the trade between the EU and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Marin said that Pakistan had criticized the EU for levying
higher duty on its import of rice from Pakistan than that from
India.
</P>
<P>
Marin admitted that it was a kind of "discrimination" to
Pakistan and said, "now we have found a common solution."
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement in this regard, the duty on the EU
import of rice from Pakistan will be reduced to nearly 190 US
dollars per ton from 380 dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
India will also pay 190 dollars per ton for its export of rice
to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Marin arrived here Friday on a three-day visit to Pakistan.
During his visit, he held talks with senior Pakistani government
officials on various issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Pakistan's largest trading partner which enjoyed 27.5
percent of Pakistan's international trade from July 1, 1995 to
June 30, 1996.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Means Ten Billion Kg More Wheat for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A new technique of using plastic
film for growing wheat, developed by the Gansu Provincial Academy
of Agricultural Sciences, is expected to increase the country's
wheat output by up to 10 billion kg at the turn of the century,
according to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
The technique of applying plastic film throughout the growing
period has been used on more than 40,000 ha of land in Gansu,
Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Shanxi. Experiments show
that the method increased output by more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, the technique means a breakthrough for
wheat output. China plans to apply it to more than six million ha
of land by the turn of the century, a move expected to increase
the country's wheat output by between 7.5 and 10 billion kg, a
figure which might account for up to half of China's planned wheat
increase during the Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
China grows nearly 30 million ha of wheat annually, on 28
percent of its total crop growing area, with an annual output of
ten billion kg, or 21 percent of the national grain output.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetic children in
China is increasing, with 350 cases reported in Shanghai in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, 150 were from Shanghai and 200 from other cities
and provinces, according to a survey conducted by professor Chen
Shuixian, at the Children's Hospital of Shanghai Medical
University.
</P>
<P>
The "China Women's News" quoted Chen as saying that the young
patients, aged usually from nine to 13 years old, mostly suffer
from insulin-dependent diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that almost no children suffered from
diabetes before the 1980s, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The major causes for the increase of diabetes among children
probably stem from environmental problems, viral infections,
unbalanced diets, weak immune systems and genetics, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists warned that parents should supervise their
children's diets to prevent them from becoming overweight.

<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (xinhua) -- Nigeria's University of Ibadan has
lost a multi-million-dollar World Bank-Japan graduate scholarship
program to Ghana's Legon University because of its declining
standards and dilapidating structures.
</P>
<P>
The graduate program in economics, jointly funded by the World
Bank and Japan, is to sponsor two African universities, one each
from east and west Africa, the Sunday Tribune newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries are selected in six candidates -- the
University of Ibadan and Legon University in west Africa and four
others in east Africa, including the University of Nairobi in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A selection committee set up by the sponsors started visiting
the six universities in 1992 and finished its work last December
when it submitted its report to the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
In the evaluation subdivided into various sections, the report
rated the admission requirements of both Ibadan and Legon
universities as satisfactory. But the library facilities of
Ibadan University are poorer than those in Legon University, and
so is the case in the area of computer facilities.
</P>
<P>
On physical infrastructure, the report said in Ibadan
''conditions are poor. Buildings are deteriorating for lack of
proper maintenance and management, while in Ghana conditions are
acceptable though facilities are not as comprehensive as in
Ibadan.''
</P>
<P>
The University of Ibadan is also rated low in areas of
accommodation availability and cost, security and health,
academic staff and foreign students taken in.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) today reaffirmed its commitment to working closely
with its dialogue partners and observers, according to a joint
communique by ASEAN foreign ministers at the end of their annual
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that ASEAN is playing an increasingly
important role in maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed China, India and Russia as new dialogue
partners of ASEAN and looked forward to broader cooperation with
them, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The admission of the three new partners has brought to 10 the
number of ASEAN's dialogue partners, which are Australia, Canada,
China, India, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, Russia,
South Korea, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The relative peace and stability (in the Asia Pacific region)
could be largely attributed to the endeavors of ASEAN to cultivate
the habits of dialogue, consensus and cooperation among the
countries in the region and to encourage the solution of disputes
through negotiations and other peaceful means," they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they acknowledged that tensions still exist in the
region as well as in other parts of the world, as long-standing
disputes, if not appropriately managed, could lead to major
conflicts and threaten the regional and international stability.
</P>
<P>
The ministers praised the development of the ASEAN Regional
Forum and the closer cooperative relations between ASEAN and non
governmental bodies.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking Rampant in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Drug trafficking is becoming
rampant in Jordan, which is usually used as a transit point for
narcotics smuggled from Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Department (PSD) announced in a statement
released Saturday that, in the second major round-up of alleged
drug trafficking rings in the kingdom in July, its Anti-Narcotics
Unit arrested a total of 35 suspects in three separate attempts at
drug trafficking through Jordanian territory in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that from July 10 to 20, the PSD has
seized 159 kilograms of hashish on the northern borders with Syria.
</P>
<P>
More than 31,000 drug tablets, 17 kilograms of hashish and 1
kilogram of hashish oil were seized in the same period in two
other operations in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The intensified anti-narcotics campaigns throughout the kingdom
were undertaken under the directives of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, the PSD said that it has arrested, during the
period from July 1 to 10 when the first major round-up was
launched, a group of traffickers and seized 67 kilograms of
hashish, 4.5 kilograms of heroin and a large quantity of other
drugs allegedly smuggled from a neighboring Arab country and
destined for another.
</P>
<P>
The two massive operations underlined what officials describe
as the most intensive trafficking activity in the Middle East
in two decades.
</P>
<P>
The PSD seized a record amount of more than three tons
of smuggled narcotics last year.

Kafr Tibnit, Lebanon, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the
Hezbollah's Political Council Mohammad Raad announced here this
morning that the remains of about 150 Hezbollah guerrillas Israel
is about to hand over to Lebanon have passed through the border
heading here for a transfer.
</P>
<P>
Raad said that 45 prisoners of Hezbollah guerrillas are also on
their way to this Moslem-inhabitated village, 81 kilometers south
of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over ceremony will be conducted in the presence of the
International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) at a square in the
village. IRCC officials said that the remains of the guerrillas
will be carried to the southern subburbs of Beirut and then buried
in a cemrtery there.
</P>
<P>
Kafr Tibnit is situated on the Israeli-Lebanese border in the
Israeli self-claimed "Security Zone" in south Lebanon. At 8:00
local time (0500 GMT), 50 ambulances of the Red Cross were seen
arriving at the village and scores of the Red Cross personnel
surrounded the square.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the soldiers to be handed over by Israel are
expected to be placed at the square to facilitate a check by the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The remains will be transferred from Israel to the IRCC, which

official said that the remains of the guerrillas will be ferried
to the village in two batches.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel will also hand over 45 prisoners to
Lebanon. The prisoners were jailed at Khiam deeply inside the

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese authorities are expected to hand over
the remains of two Israeli soldiers and two militia of the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) to a German delegation at the Beirut
international airport. The German delegation is responsible for
transporting the remains of Cyprus by air.
</P>
<P>
As Hezbollah called on the families of the dead soldiers to
converge in the village today, about 3,000 of them arrived by 9:00
a.m. (0600 GMT) and many more are expected to arrive later.
</P>
<P>
According to Red Cross officials, only nine of the 150 remains
have been identified.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the seven
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
have expressed their concern over some world issues during their
two-day annual meeting held here from July 20 to 21.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique published at the end of the 29th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting today said the ministers had a wide-ranging
exchange of views on the current regional and international
situation.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Korean Peninsula, the ministers
reiterated their belief that the resumption of dialogue between
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of
Korea is extremely important for peace and security on the Korean
Peninsula,
</P>
<P>
The ministers viewed with concern the current critical phase of
the Middle East peace process following the recent general
elections in Israel. In this regard, they stressed the importance
of continuing the peace process to restore the rights of the
Palestinians, the return of the occupied Arab territories, as well
as ensuring balanced and equal security in the region.
</P>
<P>
On peace in the Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ministers emphasized
the need for the parties and all states to cooperate with the
international Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and its organs in
the discharge of their mandate.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also reaffirmed their conviction that the
fundamental principles of the Non-Aligned Movement continue to be

 Standards With Trade

<P>
 JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) expressed here
today their serious concern about attempts to link International
Labor Standards with trade.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the 29th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the ministers said that linking
international labor standards with trade would undermine the
economic growth of developing countries which in turn would affect
the economy of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
 They reiterated the view that the issue of international
labor standards should be discussed in the International Labor
Organization (ILO) and not in non-labor related fora.
</P>
<P>
 The Ministers have expressed their supports for the decision
to urge the ILO to review the international labor conventions
including the so-called workers' fundamental rights conventions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Much progress has been made
towards the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),
said a joint communique issued at the end of the 29th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM) here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) urged member countries to make more related efforts to
promote trade and free movement of goods in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministers, ASEAN's Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme has made remarkable achievements
with intra-ASEAN exports of CEPT products rising by 21 percent to
59.3 billion US dollars in 1995 from 49.1 billion US dollars in
1994.
</P>
<P>
They said they expected the tariff range of CEPT products to be
reduced to between zero and five percent by the year 2000, thus
enabling ASEAN to establish AFTA ahead of the scheduled time of
2003.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to recommend to leaders of the ASEAM countries that
additional measures be considered to facilitate goods in transit.
</P>
<P>
The ministers praised the establishment of trade and investment
linkages between AFTA and the Australia-New Zealand Closer
Economic Relations Trade Agreement and called for similar linkages
with other regional groupings and trading arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Freezes Action of Easing Closure on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army today decided to
freeze the action of easing the closure on Palestinian
territories, in an effort to force the Palestinian police to
release an abducted Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
According to the measures announced by Israeli Army last week,
the easing of the closure was to go into effect today aimed at
allowing over 10,000 Palestinian workers to enter Israel to work
and increasing the inflow of the Palestinian goods.
</P>
<P>
The closure was imposed late February after the Islamic
militants launched the first of four suicide bombing attacks,
which killed 58 people and wounded nearly two hundred others
inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel backed off from the decision after reports
said an Israeli Arab citizen living in the Old City of
Jerusalem was abducted by Palestinian security forces over a
dispute over the ownership of a shop.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Arab resident, named Abed Salam Harbawi, was
taken Saturday by half a dozen of Palestinian agents who broke
into his home and fired twice into the floor before leading him
away by force.
</P>
<P>
The family of Harbawi claimed the incident arose from a
dispute over legal rights to their leather goods shop in the Old
City. The Harbawis, who are Moslem, alleged that Christian Copts,
aided by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat, were trying to seize from them control of a large
warehouse under their factory.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Israeli forces imposed a blockade of the
PNA controlled Ramallah area to pressure the Palestinian
security forces to release Harbawi as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office also issued a tough
statement demanding the immediate release of Harbawi. The
statement called the incident as a "serious matter".
</P>
<P>
By Saturday night, Palestinian security chief Jibri Rajoub
refused to free Harbawi, on grounds that he only took orders from
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources said the two sides were to meet
today to discuss the matter as well as a number of similar
violations by Palestinian security services and police.
</P>
<P>
The incident is expected to deepen the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute over the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new government led by the hardline Likud party has
declared Jerusalem as Israel's eternal and indivisible capital,
threatening to shut all PNA institutions in east Jerusalem,
especially the activities by Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, the status of Jerusalem
should be determined in the final status talks, which opened
in May but were delayed indefinitely due to the May 29
Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to
continue the final status talks, although refusing to fix any
date.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it remains doubtful if the talks will achieve any
progress as Israel has ruled out any compromise on the issue of
Jerusalem. The PNA insists that east Jerusalem be the capital of a
future independent Palestinian state, which is also strongly
denied by the Israeli new government.

<HEADLINE> 87,000 Laid-off Workers in Fujian Re-employed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's coastal Fujian
Province has managed to help 87,000 laid-off workers find new jobs
as part of its "re-employment project".
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to help local state-owned enterprises,
which are small but numerous and money-losing, get over
difficulties in production and find new jobs for workers to be
laid off soon.
</P>
<P>
Sanming City, which has many state-owned firms, has come up
with a series of measures to help enterprises in difficulty get
discount loans and other aid rather than unemployment relief fund
alone. The practice is conducive to helping enterprises that still
have good prospects, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In line with its principle of giving priority to helping
laid-off workers by using results of auctioned property rights of
bankrupt enterprises, the province has had satisfactory results in
getting many ailing enterprises back on their feet and
re-employing laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Awards Power Project to Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia awarded Saturday
the building of a 1.108 billion U.S. dollars power plant to
Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries following months of talks with
international firms, Kuwaiti newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The papers, citing a press release by the state-run Saudi
Consolidated Electric Company-East (Sceco-East), said that it
awarded the bidding to Mitsubishi to build and install the power
plant at a price of 4,155 million Riyals (1.108 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It said work on the project would start immediately.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a basket plan to raise power generation
in the oil-rich kingdom to 60,000 megawatts over 25 years from a
current 17,700 megawatt capacity which is expected to be at a cost
of 117 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts in the kingdom said Saudi Arabia is in urgent
need of increasing power capacity to help promote industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi was selected from several international bidders
including General Electric, Asea Brown Boveri and Westinghouse
Electric Corp and its selection was "based on objective and
professional analysis," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Sceco-East said it expected the first unit of the plant to be
operational in December 1999, while the second in February 2,000,
the Third and fourth in 2001 and 2002 respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the local reports did not give details on the generation
capacity of the units when their installation is completed.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer and exporter in
the world. It is expanding its power capabilities to cope
with a rapid increase in demand due to population and
industrial growth.

<HEADLINE> China's Ecological Agriculture Advances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- To fight the threat to
agriculture of a worsening environment and to prevent agriculture
from harming the environment, the Chinese government has had an
ecological agriculture campaign running since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
China has seen some economic improvements with its strategy of
sustained development and ecological agriculture, according to the
latest statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government places great importance on ecological
agriculture and lists it among the government's top ten topics on
the environment and development, according to Hong Bazeng,
vice-minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At present, an ecological agriculture management and technology
popularization network has taken shape at the national, provincial

</P>
<P>
In 1993, a joint leading group was set up by seven government
ministries and departments to monitor work in ecological
agricultural counties, where sustained development is the dominant
mode of agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven villages and townships in China have been awarded
the title of "Global 500" by the United Nations for their success
in sustained development.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The new Broad-Based Islamic
National Front for Peace in Afghanistan has announced its decision
to establish a "responsible and acceptable Shura" (working
council) for power transfer from President Burhanuddin Rabbani, a
local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Signatories of this six-party alliance, including head of the

warlord General Rashid Dostum, have stressed that the front is
formed not merely in opposition to Rabbani in Kabul nor is it in
support of the Taliban student militia.
</P>
<P>
They said the alliance, open to all Afghan parties, factions,
and individuals irrespective of nationality, language or sect,
aims to create the basis for the transfer of power to an
acceptable elected body, encourage national unity and ensure the
reconstruction of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They called upon all parties, groups, and individuals in the
country to join the alliance for national cooperation, unity and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued Saturday said that the new alliance
has agreed to adopt a joint defense policy in case of any
political or military intimidation.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to hold regular meetings of the working
council, comprising three representatives from each of the six

<HEADLINE> Energy Consumption Down In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The adjustment of the industrial
structure along with the rapid development of the tertiary, and
new and hi-tech industries has dramatically reduced unit energy
consumption in China's leading industrial city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the energy consumption for each 100
million yuan of GDP dropped by 59 percent from 1990 to 1995, and
rolled steel, copper and timber consumption for each 100 million
yuan of industrial output value fell by 52 percent, 64 percent and
57 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fast increasing value in the city's tertiary industry has
soared to 40.7 percent of GDP, a record high, and the proportion
of new and hi-tech industry has climbed from two percent to 10.6
percent in the city's gross industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Shanghai had saved 27.12 million tons of standard
coal, 2.59 million tons of steel and 2.25 million cubic meters of
timber during the past Five Years.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises have made an effort to promote energy-saving
projects, which have yielded not only direct economic results, but
indirect results in social benefits and environmental protection
as well.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Boost Large State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- To stimulate its state-owned
economy, Guangdong Province in south China has issued ten
favorable measures to boost the development of the major state
enterprises, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Large state firms will have more power and freedom in finance,
import and export, annexation of smaller firms, project approval
and property rights transfer.
</P>
<P>
The measures aim to build a considerable number of giant
state-owned firms into leaders of the local economy. Each of these
firms is expected to achieve annual sales of between three billion
yuan (361 million US dollars) and 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion Us
dollars) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bearing the province's hopes of restructuring the sluggish
state economic sector, these firms will appear as trans-regional
or trans-national group enterprises that combine industry,
technology, trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
To give them more financial power, the new measures encourage
the firms to set up their own financial clearing centers or even
financial companies. They will also have the support of the
provincial government to participate in the operation of such
financial organs as urban co-operative banks and trust and
investment companies.
</P>
<P>
They will take priority in approval and arrangement of projects
from the local government. Qualified firms will be chosen as the
main body to undertake the province's key projects. They will have
the local government's support in setting up their own offices and
distribution operations. They will also enjoy favorable terms in
import permits and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Annexation of smaller firms is also encouraged in order to
hasten the growth of these group companies.
</P>
<P>
To help them pay off their debts and raise capital, the
measures allow these firms to transfer part of the property rights
of some of their subsidiaries to foreign or local businesses.
</P>
<P>
And in the three years starting from this year, the local
government will return 15 percent of the profit tax payment by
these firms as state capital investment in them.
</P>
<P>
Seventy firms have just been chosen by the provincial
government as the first group of "key state firms."
</P>
<P>
These enterprises now make up 44.6 percent of the total assets
of the province's 18,162 state firms, 41.9 and 53.5 percent
respectively of the total sale and profit of all the industrial
enterprises in the province.

<HEADLINE> Report: France Adamant On Activity In East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette will reaffirm, during his visit to Israel this week,
his country's insistence that Orient House, the PLO's office in
East Jerusalem, be allowed its activities, reported The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a high-level French official as saying that
France also insists that free access to the building be assured.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud government has hardened the country's
position regarding Orient House, threatening to close it if any
foreign officials call at the building. There had been an
understanding between the European Union and the Labor government
that EU leaders refrain from a visit to the building, but
officials at foreign minister-level are not affected. The
European countries have so far refused to acknowledge Israel's
insistence that Jerusalem is its sole and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
The official told the paper, however, that he would not
confirm whether de Charette will visit the PLO's office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "You shall
have to wait and see. The minister will make his decision on
the spot, we'll do what we judge to be useful."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether de Charette would try to visit Orient House
even if the Israeli government decided to surround the
building with security personnel to prevent such a visit, the
spokesman replied: "We will not give in to pressures."
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Paris said, however, that the French
government will avoid a diplomatic crisis and de Charette will
not pay a visit to the controversial establishment, limiting
himself to a meeting with (PA President Yasser) Arafat in
Gaza only.
</P>
<P>
De Charette will arrive in Damascus Monday, his first stop
in the region. On Tuesday, he will visit Lebanon, Jordan and
Gaza, ending his Middle East tour on Wednesday with visits
to Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Since the new government took office, France has asserted its
traditional influence in the Middle East. It played a big role in
helping brought about a cease-fire agreement to end Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath in Lebanon in April. De Charette
conducted a diplomatic shuttle between Lebanon, Syria and Israel,
which was very much appreciated by the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
This time De Charette's tour is aimed primarily at expressing
France's and Europe's belief that the peace process must
continue on the basis of the right to self-determination and
the principle of land-for- peace, according to the French
Foreign Ministry spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Transfer Soldiers' Remains to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kafr Tibnit, Lebanon, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to hand
over the remains of about 150 Hezbollah guerrillas to the Lebanese
government through the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC)
today.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over will be conducted at a square in Kafr Tibnit
village on the Israeli-Lebanese border in the Israeli self-claimed
"Security Zone" in south Lebanon. At 8:00 local time (0500 GMT),
50 ambulances of the Red Cross were seen arriving at the village
and scores of the Red Cross personnel surrounded the square.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the soldiers to be handed over by Israel are
expected to be placed at the square to facilitate a check by the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The remains will be transferred from Israel to the IRCC, which
will in turn hand over them to the Lebanese government. An IRCC
official said that the remains of the guerrillas will be ferried
to the village in two batches, and the first of which will arrive
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel will also hand over 45 prisoners to
Lebanon. The prisoners were jailed at Khiam deeply inside the
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese authorities are expected to hand over
the remains of two Israeli soldiers and two militia of the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) to a German delegation at the Beirut
international airport. The German delegation is responsible for
transporting the remains of Cyprus by air.
</P>
<P>
As Hezbollah called on the families of the dead soldiers to
converge in the village today, about 3,000 of them arrived by 9:00
a.m. (0600 GMT) and many more are expected to arrive later.
</P>
<P>
According to Red Cross officials, only nine of the 150 remains
have been identified.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man told Xinhua that four of his sons died of the
military operations against Israel in south Lebanon in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Bernd Schmidbauer, German minister of state for security
affairs, is expected to fly to the Beirut airport today from
Damascus to pick up the remains and SLA prisoners.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the repatriation, the German official, who is
also a top intelligence adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, will
hold a press conference to talk on details of the operation,
reliable official sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Schmidbauer was sent by his government to broker the deal
among Lebanon, Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Philipe Gayar, IRCC's top representative in Lebanon, announced
in Beirut Saturday that the parties concerned in Lebanon, Israel
and Germany had contacted the international organization to seek
help in carrying out the operation, including providing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
After meeting the German mediator in Damascus, Hezbollah's
Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah announced that his
party had endorsed the swap deal which is to be executed today.
</P>
<P>
He described the German-brokered agreement as "an advancing
step on the road to a solution of the problem facing all the
prisoners held by Israel, the most prominent of whom are Sheikh
Abdel Karim Abeid and Mostafa Dirani."
</P>
<P>
Abeid and Dirani were abducted from their homes by Israeli
commandos in 1989 and 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that the two Hezbollah leaders would not be
released until it finds out what had happened to four other
Israeli military servicemen missing in southern Lebanon since
1986, including air force pilot Ron Arad. Israel believes Arad is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's government insists that the operation of swap be
conducted under its supervision.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange will be completed with the government's
knowledge and under its supervision and by the goodwill efforts
of the German government which sent Minister Schmidbauer to
contact with all the parties," said Interior Minister Michel
Al-Murr Friday.

</P>
<P>
The recent years have witnessed an all-round development in
terms of the relations between China and ASEAN, with frequent
exchange of visits by high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Chinese foreign minister has attended the annual ASEAN Foreign
Ministers Conference since 1991, conducting fruitful consultations
with his counterparts of the ASEAN countries, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, the Sino-ASEAN joint committees on economy
and trade, and on science and technology, were established in
1994. One year later, a high-official political consultation
system at the vice-ministerial level was set up. Exchanges of
visits at various levels between the two sides have been also on
the rise, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he continued, the two sides have consistently
strengthened coordination in international and regional
organizations, such as APEC, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the
Asia-Europe Meeting, in a bid to safeguard the common interests of
the developing countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tang noted, the trade volume between China and ASEAN
countries in recent years has seen an annual increase rate of 20
per cent. Last year, the two-way trade volume approached 20
billion US dollars, representing a rise of 41.8 per cent over 1994
and making ASEAN China's sixth largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have cooperated effectively in finance, project
contracting and labor service, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that as developing countries in Asia, China and
the ASEAN countries share a wide range of common understanding and
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will, as always, commit itself to the
long-term friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with
ASEAN countries," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that politically, China will maintain the momentum of
high-level exchange of visits to enhance mutual understanding and
trust. Economically, China will explore new ways and means of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Through the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, I
believe, a partnership of good-neighborliness and trust and
oriented to the 21st century will certainly be established," the
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Co. to Be Privatized in Stages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM), the government-monopolized conglomerate in the
copper industry, will be privatized in two stages by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a statement released by a ZCCM spokesman
in Ndola of Copperbelt Province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM board has approved and adopted recommendations for
the two-stage privatization plan of the company.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the program which is expected to
complete by June next year, substantial majority interest in all
of the ZCCM's major operating and development assets will be
offered in separate packages to mining companies and other trade
investors.
</P>
<P>
This will leave the ZCCM as the owner of the minority
interests in operations managed by in-coming investors.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, the government intends to dispose all, or
substantial part of its shareholding in the ZCCM with the shares
being distributed widely to the Zambian people and other
financial institutions in and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM Board Chairman Luke Mwananshiku was quoted today by the
local press as saying that the board is united in wanting the
company's operations to move into private control and ownership
quickly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM earns the country 80 percent of its foreign exchanges
yearly. However, it has faced liquidity problems in recent years
because of the low copper output resulted from the obsolete
equipment the company used in mining.
</P>
<P>
The company has said it has no financial ability for
improvement by itself.
</P>
<P>
To improve its management and production, the Zambian
government has been for some time formulating a policy such as
privatization along with economic reforms to promote copper
production in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the ASEAN will
continue to make valuable contributions to the regional and global
peace, stability and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the statement
in an interview with the "People's Daily" and Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 29 years since its establishment, ASEAN has made
remarkable achievements in reinforcing the organization's
political unity and strengthening economic co-operation, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In the current situation which sees the speeding up of
multi-polarization in the Asian-Pacific region, ASEAN is playing
an important role in maintaining regional peace and stability and
in accelerating regional economic cooperation for common
development, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN regional forum initiated by the association and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) with ASEAN as an
initiator, have both become major channels for security dialogues
and economic cooperation of the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The first Asia-Europe Meeting convened earlier this year and
sponsored by ASEAN is playing an important role in bridging and
strengthening links and expanding cooperation between the two
continents, he noted, adding all these efforts have aroused
world-wide attention.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the achievements ASEAN has made," Tang
said, expressing the hope that ASEAN will continue to make
valuable contributions to regional and world peace, stability and
economic prosperity.

government troops and Tamil rebels continued into its third day on
Saturday at Mullaitivu Army Base on the northeastern coast,
military sources said here today.

<HEADLINE> Claudia Poll Takes Olympics Naturally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- "I will try to stay cool and take
it (the Olympic competition) naturally," said Claudia Poll of
Costa Rica, who is probably South America's only hope of an
Olympic swimming medal at the Atlanta Games here.
</P>
<P>
"I want to have fun there (at Olympics). It'll be just another
swimming competition -- the most important one of the year," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"It sounds weird, but for me Atlanta is already over. We have
so many plans for the coming years. The Olympics are important
but not ther only thing," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, more striking than her somewhat nonchalant attitude
towards the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games is Poll's extremely
disciplined approach to the sport.
</P>
<P>
"I came here to compete," she said. "Im very meticulous with
what I do. I have fun doing it but I do it with discipline."
</P>
<P>
Although a first-time Olympian, Poll is already a seasoned
international performer. Career highlights include a bronze medal
in the 200 meters freestyle at the 1994 world championships, where
she clocked one minute 57.61, and more recently two gold medals at
the 1995 short-course world championships in Rio de Janeiro. In
winning the 200 meters freestyle event, she also established a
world record.
</P>
<P>
Poll's versatility is evident in the fact that she holds
virtually every national freestyle record, in addition to her
sport course world mark in the 200 meters freestyle. Though she
obviously would be pleased with a medal performance in Atlanta,
Poll's main goal is to imporve her times in the middle distance
freestyle events.
</P>
<P>
"I want to do better times, but my happiness doesn't depend on
winning a medal," Poll said. "I always swim my race. A world
record might change people's image of you, but the world record
doesn't swim the race for you," she said.

morning, they two clocked an identical times of one minute 49.05
seconds, which placed them eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
As only eight swimmers are allowed to qualified for the finals,
the tie warranted a swim-off between them to decide who would
advance to this evening's final.
</P>
<P>
In the swim-off shortly after, the two swimmers raced
head-to-head and again matched each other's performance at
1:48.85. Both the athletes were given the option of a third race.
</P>
<P>
But Sievinen declined due to his busy schedule while Palmer
thus advanced to the final.  The Finish will have 100 and 200
meters backstrokes, 200 and 400 meters individual medleys and the
4x100 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Palmer also is tightly scheduled, with races in 400 and 800
meters freestyle and 4x200 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Both of them competed in the Barcelona Olympic Games and have
never swum a swim-off.
</P>
<P>
"If I have to, I'll swim again," said Palmer, before learning
that Sievinen deffered the eighth position. "I havee never, ever
had a swim-off! You can't print what I thoughtt when I saw it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have never had a swim off in my life! I can't believe it,"
Sivinen said. "When I turned around and saw the board I though to
myself, "Oh no!'"

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Daily Raps Japan for Boosting Military Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's army newspaper, the
People's Army, today criticized Japan for its efforts in
strengthening its military power over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a signed commentary that the Japan-U.S.
security alliance and the gradual modernization of the Japanese
defence force have revealed Japan's intention to strengthen its
military power since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Japan is now reforming its armed
forces, with the purpose of not only building a purely defensive
force, but also a mighty army.
</P>
<P>
As an economic power, the commentary said, Japan's final
intention is to have a higher international status in conformity
with its political and military strength.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government's New Budget to Curb Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The union budget for 1996-97 to
be presented to parliament on July 22 is expected to cut fiscal
deficit and give more attention to social agenda, economists said
here today.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage more savings and foreign direct
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal challenge has been underlined in the updated
economic survey for 1995-96 tabled in the parliament by the
finance minister on last Friday. Given the target of the common
minimum program of the united front government announced on June 5
to contain fiscal deficit at 4 percent of the GDP, Finance
Minister P. Chidambaram is likely to adopt such a strategy in his
maiden budget which would move towards that objective. Reduction
in fiscal deficit would mean lower borrowings so that private
investments are not crowded out and deficit liabilities are not
further built up, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram is expected to enforce certain discipline through
greater expenditure control. He is helpless insofar as the
mounting subsidies and other inescapable expenditure, including
interest and defense, are concerned, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also expected to focus its attention on
alleviation of poverty and thus give more outlay for social agenda
such as improving drinking water, health and education for the
poor as they promised in the election campaign, they added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-ASEAN Dialogue Partnership Promises Closer Co-op: Vice-FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here today that China's full dialogue partnership
with the ASEAN has ushered in a new stage in its relations with
the organization.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning ASEAN's recent decision to
upgrade China as its full dialogue partner during an interview
with the "People's Daily" and Xinhua, Tang said that the move is
sure to promote overall co-operations between China and the ASEAN
in diversified fields.
</P>
<P>
Established on August 7, 1967, the ASEAN comprises Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei and Viet
Nam. The seven countries, Tang noted, are all important neighbors
of China and have sound diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN launched the full dialogue partnership with the U.S.,
Japan, Australia and the European Union with a view to expanding
economic co-operation, absorbing foreign investment and
technology, and exchanging views on regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
China began dialogue with ASEAN in 1991 as a consultative
partner. In his letter to Ali Atalas, Chairman of the ASEAN's
Standing Committee and Indonesian Foreign Minister, in March this
year, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
clearly expressed China's hope to become ASEAN's full dialogue
partner.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN made an active response on June 24 when Minister Atalas
notified Qian in a letter about the consensus of ASEAN foreign
ministers to upgrade China as a full dialogue partner and invited
Qian to attend the conference between ASEAN and its dialogue
partners scheduled in late July in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"China's full dialogue partnership with ASEAN symbolizes that
the relations between China and the ASEAN member countries, and
the organization as a whole, have embarked on a new stage," Tang
said. The move, he believed, would help stimulate the Sino-ASEAN
co-operation in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mindanao Peace Deal Provokes Stormy Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A month after the Philippine
government and a Muslim rebel group forged an agreement on peace
in Mindanao, no one now seems to know when the stormy debate on
the peace deal could end and when the peace deal would be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
At the June 21-23 talks in Davao city, the southern
Philippines, government negotiators and representatives of the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) reached the agreement to end
a 24-year old war in Mindanao, which claimed over 50,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, President Fidel Ramos will create a
MNLF-led Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development
that will lead to a new, broader autonomous region covering 14
provinces and 10 cities in the south.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held in three years to determine which of
the 14 provinces and 10 cities will join the new autonomous
region, which will replace the current autonomous region that
includes only four Muslim-dominated provinces.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that the agreement offers best hope
for peace in Mindanao, an traditional homeland of the country's
five million Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
However, ever since the peace deal came to light, it has
provoked an endless and heated debate between the government
peacemakers and those who saw it not a formula for peace but of
appeasement.
</P>
<P>
some congressmen claimed that they were not at all consulted
before the deal was forged and therefore the creation of the
MNLF-led council was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Critics, mostly from the majority Christian population in
Mindanao, said that the government is effectively imposing Muslim
rule on Christian regions without any consultations with the
affected communities.
</P>
<P>
Other opponents accused the government of favoring only MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari, who has been promised the chairmanship of
the council and will run for governor of the current autonomous
region in Mindanao in September as a candidate of Ramos' political
party--Lakas National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD).
</P>
<P>
The opponents also charged that the proposed new autonomous
region covered more than the one stipulated in the 1976 Tripoli
agreement, under which the MNLF abandoned its goal of complete
independence and instead accepted the idea of autonomy in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the strong opposition, President Ramos and other
government officials appealed to the nation to give peace a chance
in Mindanao and consistently defended the peace deal as the best
formula for peace in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, Ramos used all kinds of tactics to win
the opponents to the government side. He traveled to the south to
seek support for the agreement. He invited the governors and
mayors and representatives from the affected areas, including the
critics, to a dinner in the presidential palace to win their
confidence in the deal. He ordered the government negotiators to
reveal the major points of the agreements reached with the MNLF in
the past three years, in an attempt to ease suspicions of a secret
deal with the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
With the painstaking efforts by the government, some opponents
agreed to "give peace a chance in Mindanao," while maintaining
their positions. But others are still challenging the legality of
the proposed council.
</P>
<P>
As the stormy debate is continuing nationwide, the negotiations
between the government and the MNLF are going on and in fact still
deadlocked on two contentious issues-- the integration of the MNLF
into the government army and the national police, and the creation
of a special regional security force in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government army is prepared to take in 5,500 MNLF fighters
while the national police will take in 1,000, but the rebel group
insists that at least 7,500 fighters be integrated into the
government army and the police.
</P>
<P>
the MNLF also demand the formation of a 20,000 special regional
security force to be placed under Misuari's direct control and
command. however, the demand has been flatly rejected by the
government.
</P>
<P>
after the June 21-23 peace talks, the government and the MNLF
planned to start their final round of negotiations in Jakarta on
July 10-15. but now even president Ramos could not tell when the
negotiation can be wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
he said earlier this week that there is "a wish" that the final
peace accord will be ready for signing in Jakarta a month or two
from now.
</P>
<P>
so unsure is the outcome of the on-going peace talks that
neither side could guess when a final peace accord could be
forged.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Hail Myanmar's Status of ASEAN Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 21 (Xinhua) 21 -- ASEAN's acceptance of Myanmar as
an observer will contribute to the maintenance of regional peace
and stability, The Mirror and The New Light of Myanmar, two
official newspapers of the country, said in their editorials
today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was admitted as an observer of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Saturday at the 29th annual
ASEAN ministerial meeting in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, chairman of the ASEAN
Standing Committee, said that ASEAN looks forward to closer
cooperation with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw said that by accepting his
country as an observer, ASEAN has made a step closer to its
ultimate goal of one Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Myanmar's commitment to the ideals and objectives
of ASEAN, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
According to The New Light of Myanmar, some internal and
external "destructive elements" had tried to interfere with
ASEAN's acceptance of Myanmar and their schemes have now gone
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"With bilateral, multilateral and regional cooperation, there
will be greater chances for prosperity in the region," the paper
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Against Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(CPN-UML), the country's main opposition, will not support a
border river treaty with India in the ongoing parliament session,
UML-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the CPN-UML publicly voiced its
objection to the Mahakali Treaty signed by Nepali Prime Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba and the then Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao in February.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, hailed earlier as a landmark in the bilateral
cooperation on water resources development, provides that Nepal
has rights over any future water projects on the border river on
an equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government Friday registered the treaty in the
parliament secretariat for ratification.
</P>
<P>
"We want to further study all the aspects of the treaty, but
the government is in a hurry to ratify it," said Adhikari, whose
party holds 89 seats in the 205-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
The support of the CPN-UML is considered to be crucial to the
ratification of the treaty, which requires a two-third majority in
the house.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosion at Spanish Airport Injures 33 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded today at the Reus
Airport in northeastern Spain, injuring 33, most of them British
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Basque separatist group ETA called newspapers to warn of
four bombs just minutes before the explosion, the Efe news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Police had begun evacuating 1,000 people from the airport when
the bomb exploded in a trash can outside a restaurant in the
passenger lounge.
</P>
<P>
The group also planted bombs at two luxury hotels in the beach
towns of Salou and Cambrills. But police evacuated the hotels,
found the explosives and detonated them, causing only minor
damages, said Alex Marti, spokesman for the Tarragona municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
ETA has killed some 800 people since it began fighting in 1968
for independence of northern Spain's Basque region. Its most
recent attacks are apparently aimed at crippling Spain's lucrative
tourist industry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition MPs' Return to House Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
the BNP MPs led by its chief Begum Khaleda Zia staged its 2nd
walkout on the 2nd day of the house session Thursday, protesting
against the alleged violation of the parliament rules of procedure
by Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury and did not return to the
session that day. Khaleda stated that the opposition MPs would not
return to the parliament till the matter is settled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on July 14, the BNP MPs also staged a walkout just
minutes after the house's inaugural session opened but returned
the session later on.
</P>
<P>
Sources concerned disclosed that when asked whether the party
would return to the house today, the BNP Secretary General Adbul
Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday said that the party's parliamentary wing
would decide on the issue this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the ruling Awami League (AL) for "attempting" to make
the parliament ineffective and turn it into their "own forum",
Bhuiyan said: "Our party is keen to see the present parliament as
the center of all national activities and help it play an
effective role in resolving all problems facing the nation. But
the BNP alone can't do this unless the ruling party is sincere in
doing so."
</P>
<P>
"How can the parliament become effective if the speaker
violates the rules to protect the interests of the treasury bench
members and denies the rights of the opposition lawyers?" he
asked.

<HEADLINE> Le Wins First Olympic Swimming Title at Atlanta Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion Le Jingyi
again showed her stable superiority by winning the first gold
medal of the swimming competitions at the 26th Summer Olympic
Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Le, 21, world record holder and top qualifier this morning,
clocked a winning time of 54.50 for her first Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased, because for an athlete, the Olympic Games' gold
are the top honor. Today is the most important day in my life."
Le was quite excited at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The veteran of the Chinese squad, who is making her second
Olympic appearance after Barcelona, was behind American Angel
Matino, but was ahead of another American Amy van Dyken, at the 50
meters turn.
</P>
<P>
But Le found the steam in the latter half of the course and
beat Germany's Sandra Volker and Martino into the second and third
places, at 54.88 and 54.93 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Martino, pumped up by the partisan home fans, was satisfied
with the medal, the first medal ever for the hosts at the
Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Le's coach Zhou Ming said that he was satisfied with the
results Le scored.
</P>
<P>
"Le had already got Olympic experiences, that's why she could
win the gold this evening."
</P>
<P>
Zhou explained other Chinese swimmers' disappointing
performances in the morning's hear were due to lacking of
experiences.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have much international experiences and seemed
just too nervous," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese coaches would try to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can solve the problem and do well in the coming
days."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, Chinese hopefuls in the women's
400-meter individual medley, failed to make the final.
</P>
<P>
"We had mixed feeling in the pool today," Zhou said, "Le
performed well while Zeng Qiliang had gained the first final berth
for the Chinese male swimmers, while some of the young swimmers
didn't perform well."
</P>
<P>
Zeng finished seventh with 1:02.01 in the men's 100m
breaststroke, which was won by the Belgium's Fred Deburghgraeve,
who had set a new world mark in this morning's heat.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian clocked 1:00.65, just 0.05 seconds out of his fresh
new record.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Smith from Ireland chalked up the women's 400m
individual medley at 4:39.18.
</P>
<P>
Smith, runner-up at the 1995 European Championships, said that
she just tried her best.
</P>
<P>
The second-time Olympian said that her parents taught her
swimming just for safety reason.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the key for her victory, she said that was "hard
work and the smart training".
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Danyon Loader grabbed the men's 200m freestyle
title with a time of 1:47.63, edging Brazilian veteran Gustavo
Borges into the second, at 1:48.08.

<HEADLINE> Banks to Better Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Banks began to seek more
effective security measures from abroad, as the number of armed
robberies surged these years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A soldier raises a 54-style pistol and shoots at a clear
material inlaid on a metal stand some 10 meters away: it's clear
to all present that the three bullets were absorbed in the
material with nary a shard or spark in sight.
</P>
<P>
The scene was a demonstration of a bulletproof glazing material
produced by General Electric (GE) of the United States. Organized
by GE's structured products department and the Beijing
Clear-shield New Material Technology Development Center, the show
attracted dozens of officials from China's major banks and public
security authorities as well as leaders of some museums in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A 79-style light submachine gun and a high-powered 81-style
semiautomatic rifle were also pointed at the material -- yielding
similar results.
</P>
<P>
The show comes just as China's banks and financial institutions
are strengthening security in response to a series of armed
robberies in some cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Cash is still the primary means of payment in China and large
amounts of it are circulated between workplaces, financial
institutions and individuals, making banks and financial
institutions favorite targets for criminals.
</P>
<P>
Last December, several armed robbers struck an armored car in
South china's Guangdong Province, the biggest bank robbery since
the founding of the People Republic of china in 1949. A chain of
bank robberies and jewellery-shop hold-ups also hit Beijing this
year, the Legal Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out at a conference late last
month that the crackdown on financial crimes is a long-term task,
though major incidences of financial swindle, robbery and theft
have decreased year-on-year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that financial institutions should
strengthen administration and training of security personnel, as
well as boost electronic monitoring and alarm systems.
</P>
<P>
As a result, security facilities -- especially electronic
monitoring systems and armored cars and banks lobbies, have become
one of the banks' most urgent tasks.
</P>
<P>
Sources with GE said the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and the China Construction Bank have become the first users
of GE's bulletproof glazing materials.

<HEADLINE> Wang Blows Last Shot to Finish Second in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's defending Olympic champion
Wang Yifu blew a 3.8 points lead at the last shot to finish second
after Italian Roberto Di Donna in the men's air pistol final of
the Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Poland's Renata Mauer edged out Petra Horneber of Germany
earlier in the women's 10 meters air rifle event to win the Games'
first gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Wang, who have been troubled by ear
inflammation and hypoglycemia, an ailment which causes fatigue and
lack of concentration, scored 6.5 points in the last shot,
squandering a 3.8-points lead and conceding the title to Di Donna.
</P>
<P>
The Italian, who scored 10.0 points in the last shot for a
total of 684.2, just one tenth of a point better than Wang.
</P>
<P>
Tanu Kiriakov of Bulgaria finished third with 683.8.
</P>
<P>
Wang collapsed after the final shot and he was rushed into a
nearby clinic.
</P>
<P>
"Because of illness, Wang hasn't eaten anything before the
final and he has been inhaling oxygem minutes before picking up
his pistol," Chinese head coach Zhang Heng said.
</P>
<P>
"Wang told me later that he felt dizzy and then blackout after
the ninth round and he just pulled trigger blindly for the last
shot," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"I knew there must have been something wrong with Wang," said
Di Donna, "6.5 points is unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
The Italian, who have won the most of his encounters with Wang
in recent years, hailed Wang as "one of the greatest shooters in
history".
</P>
<P>
Mauer trailed all the way in the final until she scored 10.7
points against Horneber's 8.8 in the last shot to lift the Games'
first title.
</P>
<P>
Mauer totaled 497.6 points, followed by Horneber at 497.4 and
Yugoslav Aleksandra Ivosev's 497.2.
</P>
<P>
"I got too nervous in the last shot," said Hornber. "Pressure
was just too much."
</P>
<P>
Mauer, who finished runner-up three times in the 1995 World Cup
series, said she had gained experiences and toughened her
mentality from the international competitions she entered last
year.

ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Shahbaz Ahmed laid on three goals
as Pakistan eased past host United States 4-0 in their opening
group A match on Saturday at the Centennial Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, who arrived only on Friday after a late Olympic call up,
did not start the match but as soon as he was introduced as a
substitute, Pakistan came to life against a very defensive
American team.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th minute, he drew two defenders and his delicate
reverse stick center found the unmarked Mohammed Shahbaz who slid
the ball past Steve Wagner in the opponents' goal.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes later it was center forward Kamran Ashraf who
profitted from his precision pass to notch the second and Pakistan
went 3-0 ahead in the 25th minute as Muhammed Sarwar crossed for
Ashraf to score his second with a reverse stick deflection.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan completed their scoring in the 62nd minute when Tahir
Zaman turned in Shahbaz's free hit.
</P>
<P>
In Group A of the women's preliminary round, Germany outplayed
Argentina 2-0 after leading 1-0 at the halftime.
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Schmoranzer Van Kooperen opened the scoring at the 16th
minute while Heike Laetzsch added the second goal in the 38th

<HEADLINE> Chinese Airline To Purchase 11 MD90 Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China Aviation Supplies
Corp.(CASC), China Northern Airlines (CNA) have signed a contract
with McDonnell-Douglas of the United States to purchase eleven
MD90 passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed on July 17, makes CNA the first Chinese
carrier to use the new McDonnell-Douglas jetliner.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to 1998, each year will see the delivery of three
planes, and the last two will be brought to China in 1999. The
first of the eleven will be handed over to CNA at Long Beach of
California, where McDonnell-Douglas is based, and land in CNA's
base in the northeast China city of Shenyang on August 1.
</P>
<P>
MD90-30 jetliners, the newest type in McDonnell-Douglas's
150-seaters, are an improved model from the MD80 family. China and
the US aircraft manufacturer have co-produced 35 MD80 and MD82
passenger planes since 1985, and the two signed a contract last
year to co-produce 20 MD90-30 planes in a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, CASC, Air China signed a contract with
Boeing to purchase three Boeing747s, which will be delivered in
1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Drug Traffickers Threaten President Samper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of
"extraditable" drug traffickers on Friday issued a series of
threatening communiques after the Colombian government renew
discussions about their extradition.
</P>
<P>
National Police Director Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena said that
the communiques have been specially directed at President Ernesto
Samper and other high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
"It seems logical that after the proposals made by the
president to make the penalties more severe and reopen the debate
about the extradition, those threatening communiques would be
presented," Serrano Cadena said.
</P>
<P>
One of the communiques sent to the media began, "Today, the
20th of July, the date when we celebrate the independence of our
country, we reappear to demand the refusal to extradition."
</P>
<P>
The message seemed to purport that drug traffickers do not want
to be "the scapegoat" in the Samper administration's intention to
surmount its confrontation with the U.S. government and avoid
possible economic sanctions,
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be the only victims of the present crisis of
our nation. We will not either spoil what we won in the
Constitution of 1991. By no means will we permit being tried by
the U.S. government," added the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian police intelligence department has already been
ordered by the government to study the authenticity of the
communiques and get ready to react to any disturbance of the
public order.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recently criticized Colombia for falling
short of its goals in the war against drug trafficking, implying
impending U.S. economic sanctions against Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Takes Steps to Prevent Spread of Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican authorities have
ordered a more stringent border control after registering cases of
cholera in the recent days, which caused a death, in a town on the
border with Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican health officials expressed concern about the rapid
spread of the illness caused by massive and uncontrolled
immigration of undocumented Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
One of the seven persons affected by cholera, a woman called
Antonia Aleman, died Friday in San Isidro de Pocosol, 10
kilometers from the border with Nicaragua. The six children of
the deceased woman and 18 other people have shown cholera symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government has decided to create a commission
with personnel from the ministries of Health and Public Security,
the organization of judicial investigations, and the Immigration
secretariat to detect undocumented Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
Police and Immigration officials have effected a dragnet
operation in the border with Nicaragua to detain and deport
illegal Nicaraguans.

<HEADLINE> Mutlu--Goliath Crane from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- To his rivals, he is like a
mountain which could not be conquered, to his fans, he is like a
Goliath crane which could lift hundreds tons of weight.
</P>
<P>
Turk weightlifter Halil Mutlu, who has won four world gold
medals, claimed his first Olympic title here Saturday afternoon,
winning the men's 54-kg category at the Georgia World Congress
Center.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, who has three world records of the category in hands,
had 287.5 kilograms from two lifts, beating his archrival Chinese
Zhang Xiangsen to the second by 7.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"I am excited to take the Olympic gold today," he said at a
post-competition press, "It is not only a honour for me, but a
honour for five million people in my country."
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, who finished fifth in the last Olympic Games in
Barcelona four years ago, had his long-time dream come true. "The
Olympic title is very important to me. It means a lot to me," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After the International Weightlifting Federation made a change
of the ten categories in 1993, aiming to clean the name of the
sport, Mutlu began to dominate the 54-kg category since 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey, Mutlu had
three world record weights to make a sweep clean of the three
events in the category.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 World Championships in Guangzhou, China, he was
beaten by Zhang on bodyweight difference.
</P>
<P>
"I lost to him (Zhang Xiangsen) at the World Championships," he
said, "but I beat him today."
</P>
<P>
Responding on the world record lift in snatch, he said:"I did
not notice the world record, I just want lift more to win the
Olympic gold."
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, both physically and mentally strong, missed his first
attempt in jerk, but continued to make good lifts in the next two
tries. "After I failed my first lift, I just hoped to have that
weight," he said. "My first expectation here is to have an medal,
no matter gold or silver."
</P>
<P>
Chinese team manager Wang Jianwei praised Mutlu as "stable and
strong" in competition.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Wins Olympic Soccer Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two goals by Afonso Martins
enabled favorite Portugal to beat Tunisia 2-0 in a bruising
Olympic soccer opener Saturday in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
Martins scored both goals amid a flurry of yellow and red cards
that saw both sides reduced to 10 men. He opened the scoring for
Portugal just 12 minutes into the first half of the Group C match.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes into the second half, Tunisia had the chance to
equalise through a penalty but Adel Sellim crashed the ball
against the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
In the 78th minute, Martens collected his second goal after a
horrible mistake by the Tunisian keeper.
</P>
<P>
Looking to cross the ball from a seemingly harmless position on
the left of the Tunisian penalty area, Martens saw the goalkeeper
woefully out of position and simply stroked the ball inside the
near post.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's woes were compounded five minutes later when Riadh
Bouazizi, who had already been booked, was sent off for a clumsy
challenge on Dominguez, who had to be stretchered from the field.
</P>
<P>
Bouazizi was joined shortly in the dressing room by Portugal's
Andrade, who was shown the red card for a crunching tackle from
behind.

<HEADLINE> Mutlu Lifts World Record for Olympic Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turk hercules Halil Mutlu set a
world record in snatch en route to winning the first gold medal in
weightlifting at the Centennial Olympics here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, with three world records in hands in the men's 54-kg
category, had 132.5 kilograms in snatch, beating his own world
mark by 2.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion also jerked 155 kilos for a total of
287.5, edging world title holder Zhang Xiangsen of China for the
Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who beat Mutlu to second at the last world championships
in Guangzhou, China in November of 1995, ranked second at 280
kilos, with 130 from snatch and 150 from jerk.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Sevdalin Minchev of Bulgaria, who had
277.5 from two lifts.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu and Zhang had a tit-to-tat battle in the Olympic arena.
After Zhang Xiangsen iniated his weight at 122.5 kilograms, Mutlu
added the bar to 125 in his first attempt.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, with his personal best of 130 in training, asked 127.5
kilos, but only missed the weight.
</P>
<P>
After Mutlu finished 130 kilos in the second attempt, Zhang
took the risk for 130 in his last attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I have to ask the weight in my third attempt at that time,"
said Zhang afterwards. "If I succeeded, Mutlu would be forced to
ask more, as I have less bodyweight than him."
</P>
<P>
Mutlu was indeed forced to try 132.5 kilos and lifted the
weight in his last attempt for a new world record.
</P>
<P>
While in the clean and jerk, Zhang lagged far behind his Turk
rival who could jerk 165 kilograms in training.
</P>
<P>
"I could only lift 157.5 kilograms at my utmost in jerk in
training," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu almost had the Olympic gold slipped out of his hands when
he missed his first try at 152.5 kilos in jerk.
</P>
<P>
"At the time when he failed, I did think I may have a chance
for the title," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mutlu, recovering from the first fall, even lifted 155
kilos in his last try.
</P>
<P>
Failing for 155 in his second attempt, Zhang tried 157.5 in the
last, a bet he had to take in order to win the Olympic title on
bodyweight difference against Mutlu.
</P>
<P>
Zhang tried hard but could only lift the bar at his chest.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team manager Wang Jianwei said, "I am glad, for he has
done his best, and and I am also sad, for he does not win."
</P>
<P>
Zhang blamed his bad lift in jerk to right arm injury. "I
injured my right arm when I lifted 130 kilos in the snatch," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"After three months or so, my right arm would be completely
recovered," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Zhang to take part in the Olympics. "This
time I lose, next time I may win," said 24-year-old Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Defending Olympic champion Ivan Ivanov of Bulgaria, who won the
men's 52-kg category in Barcelona four years ago, slipped down to
the eighth in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
After the Barcelona Olympics, the International Weightlifting
Committee changed the ten categories in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The competition of 59-kg category will be held on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Debutant Judoka Wins China's First Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- To make her debut in the Olympics,
Sun Fuming became the heroine to award China its first Olympic
gold medal by winning the over 72-kg heavyweight class judo title
here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who started her judo career at 14, floored her Cuban peer
Estela Rodriguez, runner-up in the Barcelona Olympics, by Yuk/Isn.
</P>
<P>
German Johanna Hagn and French Christine Cicot shared the
bronze medal in the first event of the judo tournament in the
Games.
</P>
<P>
"I was very calm during the competitions because I know I am
stronger than any of my opponents," Sun, a native of Chinese
northeast province of Liaoning, told the reporter after the final.
</P>
<P>
Sun, 22, suffered a blow in the 1995 Fukuaka Universiade when
she made her first apperance in international arena, by home
judoka Noriko Anno in the semifinal due to lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
After the defeat, Sun started her intensive training in last
July with almost six hours in four periods daily at Tianjin to
gear up for the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese budding judoka even tested her prowess by competing
against her men compatriots in the camp, saying that strong mental
merits also play an important role in the competitions.
</P>
<P>
The first-day judo competitions also witnessed the fall of
Angelique Seriese of the Netherlands, champion in the 1995 world
championship, in the first round against German Johanna Hagn,
bronze medalist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
And Japanese Anno who won over Sun in the Universiade, also
suffered a first round defeat to Brazilian Edinanci Da Silva.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Legislation in Current Form Unacceptable: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Welfare reform legislation
being debated in the Senate is unacceptable to President Bill
Clinton in its current form, a White House official said today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who promised drastic welfare system reform, vetoed two
previous Republican bills, calling them either too harsh on the
poor or attached to other unacceptable legislation.
</P>
<P>
He had been more positive about the current legislation, but
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said later today, "The welfare
bill as it stands is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected a measure Friday that would have changed
the Republican welfare plan to allow children to continue
receiving some federal help after their parents are cut off after
five years on welfare.
</P>
<P>
The Senate vote came on the second day of debate on a
Republican overhaul plan that would replace the nation's various
welfare programs with a single block grant, giving states more say
over the ways to spend the money. The House of Representatives
approved its plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Republicans want to end the federal guarantee of aid to the
poor, which has been in place for six decades. Under the plans,
welfare recipients would be required to find jobs within 24 months
of joining the program, and most participants would be cut off
after time limits.
</P>
<P>
States would have the option of denying federal money to
mothers who have more children while on welfare, according to the
plan.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said their plans would free the needy from a cycle
of dependence, restore their dignity and save the country nearly
60 billion dollars over six years.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The first fencing gold medal was
grabbed by Russian Aleksandr Beketov here Saturday afternoon at
the Centennial Olympic Games which raised the curtains Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandr, 26, a warrant officer in the Russian Army, defeated
six opponents en route to his victory of 15-14 over Cuban Ivan
Trevejo Perez, winning the first gold medal for Russia in the
Games.
</P>
<P>
In the breath-taking finals, the two lefthanders chased up in a
tit-for-tat battles all the way to 6-all before the Cuban scored
four hits in a row for a temporary edge of 10-6.
</P>
<P>
By keeping deaf to the cheers of Cubans from the stands,
Beketov, who won the World Cup tournament in Tallin, Estonia early
this year, managed to tie 11-all, 13-all and 14-all before beating
his opponent with the last winning hit with three seconds remained
in the second bout.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal was won by Geza Imre of Hungary who defeated
compatriot Ivan Kovacs 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The first-day competitions were full of upsets with Eric Srecki
of France, reigning world and Olympic champion, being knocked out
of the top eight by the eventual champion in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Sandro Cuomo of Italy, who placed third at the 1995 worlds,
suffered his defeat to Hungarian Imre in the quarterfinals, with
Arnd Schmitt of Germany, the 1993 world runner-up, being pulled
down by Cuban Perez in the third round.
</P>
<P>
At the 1995 world championship at Hague, the Netherlands, the
Russian fencer only finished fifth in the same event.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Atlanta ACOG Concerned About Transportation, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Organizing Committee
of Olympic Games (ACOG) expressed great concerns about two issues
of transportation and technology as the 16-day competitions reeled
off today.
</P>
<P>
"We have great concerns on two issues of transportation and
technology" for the Games, said the ACOG spokesman here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, situations will be getting better and better as we're to
take account of the advice from the media," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We lack experiences because it's the first time for us to
organize such a great gathering with the participation of the all
the 197 IOC members," explained Ms. Michele Verdier, IOC director
of the Media and Special Projects.
</P>
<P>
One European reporter complained that the transportation
situation here for the Games "was even worse than getting out of
the hell of the Vietnam War".
</P>
<P>
By saying so, the reporter may only intend to raise the proper
attention of ACOG, but the issue of transportation has been
plaguing every participant in the highly-hailed sport gala.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have enough stock, but experienced train drivers
are badly needed here," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On the technology issue, he said staff members of the ACOG will
spare no efforts to put in data, starting lists, results as soon
as possible, saying "wWe will have them done by today."
</P>
<P>
Up till now, reporters were being trapped in a dire situation
when they couldn't retrieve even the starting lists of the sport
wherein the first gold medal has already been won by Renata Mauer
of Poland in the women's 10-meter air rifle.

<P>

the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has broadened
the base of cooperation among the member countries, the Indonesian
and Thai foreign ministers said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 29th ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas said aside

which common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) and ASEAN Free
Trade Area products (AFTA) accounted for some 60 billion US.
dollars.

The ASEAN member countries have phased in over 45,000 items,
including over 1,300 lines of unprocessed agricultural products,
into the CEPT tariff reduction scheme.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries are now in a favorable position to take
advantage of surge of globalization and the liberalization of
investment and trade that are the hallmarks of the global economy
today.
</P>
<P>
To further complement international efforts to liberalize
trade, "we should impress upon all APEC member economies to submit
their action plans for the implementation of trade and investment
liberalization in the region," said the Thai foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that by the APEC economic leaders
meeting in Manila in November this year, ASEAN will have credible
and feasible action plans.

<HEADLINE> UN Report: AIDS Affects World Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report published today in
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), warned
that the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
is affecting the human development worldwide, especially in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program pointed out in the report that it
is developing nations that suffer most from the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 6,000 new AIDS infections occur every
day in the world, that is one in every 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 90 percent of the new infections occur in
developing countries, describing this as a social, economic and
health tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Researches conducted by the program at the University of
Colombia and the Harvard Institute for Human Development showed
that the AIDS virus affects human development and man's essential
abilities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that human development in Asia,
particularly in India and Thailand, would suffer more as a result
of the spread of AIDS there.
</P>
<P>
The report called on governments to cope with the danger of
AIDS more seriously because of its harmful effects on
human development.

<HEADLINE> Record-breaking Belgian Swimmer Eyes Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Little-known Fred Deburghgraeve
from Belgium who created a new world record in the men's 100m
breaststroke heats here Saturday morning, said he was confident to
win the final this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old lanky boy from Roeselare shattered won his heat
race with a time of 1:00.60, shedding 0.35 seconds off the old
mark set by Karoly Guttler of Hungary in Sheffield on August 3,
1993.
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me too. I knew that I could enter tonight's final.
I knew I was able to do that. But a world mark is a surprise for
me," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian was previously a water polo player and he began to
learn swimming at the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he had no swimming coach. He trained with his
father Freddiy Deburghgraeve.
</P>
<P>
"Or I'd say my father is my coach and for the most of the time
I train lonely," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I always train at noon, though it's hard," he explained.
</P>
<P>
This is his second appearance in the Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
His experience in the Barcelona Games in 1992 was painful. He
slipped from the starting blocks and failed to qualify for the
final in the men's 100m breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
He pocketed a bronze medal at the Rome World Championships in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"I think he will do better in tonight's final," his father
said.
</P>
<P>
"If he could win a gold medal in the final, he will become the
first swimmer from Belgium to win an Olympic title," the older
Deburghgraeve added.

<HEADLINE> More AIDS Patients Found in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of AIDS patients
is rising in the northeast African country of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today, blood
tests made on 817 patients in three hospitals of Central Tigray
and East Wolega zones proved 509 HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
It means that 62 percent of the blood-tested patients will be
AIDS patients. In Axum and Adwa hospitals, the number of HIV
carriers increased by 30 percent than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report said, most of the patients are civil servants,
drivers, prostitutes and ex-servicemen, adding that the minimal
use of condoms and failure to change one's sexual behaviors have
exposed civil servants and youngsters aged between 15 and 35 to
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian National AIDS Control Department disclosed
recently that there are about 350,000 actual AIDS cases in the
country presently.
</P>
<P>
A result is that 16-17 percent of the national hospital beds
are occupied by AIDS patients while in the capital, 30-40 percent
of the hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients and HIV
related victims.

<HEADLINE> France Aims to Take Over NATO's Southern Command: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- France is aiming to take over the
Naples-based Southern Command of the NATO, one year after its
re-entry into NATO's integrated commanding structure, said a
report by the local daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by the daily's military correspondent
Jacques Isnard, said that France's participation in U.N. and NATO
peace-keeping forces in former Yugoslavia has "precipitated" the
re-integration of French troops with their allies.
</P>
<P>
In the past 30 years, France has chosen to stay out of the
decision-making structure of NATO since General Charles de Gaulle
withdrew from the NATO caucus dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Today, in the military circle, people no longer conceal their
willingness to take up actual responsibilities, on condition that
NATO revises its doctrines and missions, and reorganize its
organization and its means to take into account the new strategic
context in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
By radically reforming its armed forces, France is also
readjusting to the need of NATO to meet crises and take rapid
actions by streamlining the army into an entity made up of four
groups of forces -- an armored force, a motorized force, an
armored rapid intervention force and an assault infantry force,
with each force manned by 15,000 officers and men.
</P>
<P>
France has declared that a new commanding center for its ground
force will be set up in Lille. The center, called Commandement
Operationnel des Forces Terrestres (COFT), will be equipped with
600-800 cadres and is authorized to command the four groups of
forces, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The COFT will be headed by General Jean Heinrich, a 56-year-old
four-star general who was once head of special operation forces
under the General Direction of Exterior Security and the founder
of the Direction of Military Intelligence, and is number two of
the multinational force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's Northern Command is based in High Wycombe, Britain, and
its Central Command in Brunssum, the Netherlands. Its Southern
Command has been headed by U.S. generals for years.

<HEADLINE> New Riot Erupts in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- New riot erupted in Northern
Ireland today after nationalist and loyalist parades went ahead,
according to reports from Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 people attacked police with stones and bottles in
the town of Omagh, which lies west of Belfast. They smashed
property and set fire to buildings.
</P>
<P>
The nationalists who want a united Ireland and Protestants who
want the province to stay British held rival parades in the town
Friday night and the rioting began early this morning.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the riot out of control, police fired plastic
bullets and made several arrests. Police said they were not aware
of any more parades planned today, but a nationalist protest over
last week's Protestant march is expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the first serious clash since last week's
widespread street violence in Belfast and Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
Police in England made several arrests this week, seizing
enough equipment to make 36 bombs and documents in what they said
was part of their fight against the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland called Thursday for a big push in next
week's peace talks between the various parties in Northern
Ireland, to reestablish what the governments called "the primacy of
politics" over violence.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the key players, Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, has been excluded because the IRA broke a 17-month
cease-fire in February and has launched bomb attacks in mainland
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the peace talks can hardly
achieve any result without Sinn Fein's taking part in.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence in the ability of the talks process to deliver
meaningful change has already disappeared," Sinn Fein President
Gerry Adams said Friday.

<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah are
to carry out a deal of swapping the remains of two Israeli
soldiers for Lebanese prisoners and bodies of guerrillas on
Sunday morning, well-informed Hezbollah sources said here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Israel will release 45 prisoners from a jail at Khiam deeply
inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern
Lebanon,
</P>
<P>
The prisoners will be transferred by the International Red
Cross Committee (IRCC) through the Fart Mnita crossing point northward
to the southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh, according to
Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 14 Red Cross vehicles will transport 123 bodies of
Shiite Moslem guerrillas from inside Israel, and 18 bodies from
the Israeli-occupied border strip, to Nabatiyeh, then to a mosque
on Beirut's southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m. (04:30 GMT), a helicopter is to take off from the
Beirut International Airport, lifting the remains of two Israeli
soldiers and two elements of Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen SLA militiamen to be set free by the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, will be repatriated by the same
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Bernd Schmidbauer, German minister of state for security
affairs, will fly to the Beirut airport early Sunday morning
from Damascus to pick up the remains and SLA prisoners.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the repatriation, the German official, who is
also a top intelligence adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, will
hold a press conference to talk on details of the operation,
reliable official sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Schmidbauer was sent by his government to broker the deal
among Lebanon, Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah sources said that the Red Cross convoy carrying
the guerrillas bodies and the prisoners will stop around 9:30
a.m. (06:30 GMT) in front of the office of a Hezbollah
parliamentary member, Mohammed Raad, in Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
Philipe Gayar, IRCC's top representative in Lebanon, announced
in Beirut today that the parties concerned in Lebanon, Israel and
Germany had contacted the international organization to seek help
in carrying out the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the committee had prepared vehicles for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
After meeting the German mediator in Damascus, Hezbollah's
Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah announced that his
party had endorsed the swap deal which is to be executed on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He described the German-brokered agreement as "an advancing
step on the road to a solution of the problem facing all the
prisoners held by Israel, the most prominent of whom are Sheikh
Abdel Karim Abeid and Mostafa Dirani."
</P>
<P>
Abeid and Dirani were abducted from their homes by Israeli
commandos in 1989 and 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that the two Hezbollah leaders would not be
released until it finds out what had happened to four other
Israeli military servicemen missing in southern Lebanon since
1986, including air force pilot Ron Arad. Israel believes Arad is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah stressed that the fate of Arad and other missing
Israeli soldiers "constitutes a big obstacle to a full solution."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Syrian capital today, Schmidbauer
thanked Syria and Iran for contributions that crowned his mission
with success.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's government insists that the operation of swap should
be conducted under its supervision.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange will be completed with the government's
knowledge and under its supervision and by the goodwill efforts
of the German government which sent Minister Schmidbauer to
contact with all the parties," said Interior Minister Michel
Al-Murr Friday.

<HEADLINE> No More Obstacles to Elections on Bosnian Serb Side: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb state Republika
Srpska Acting President Biljana Plavsic said today there were no
more obstacles to elections after Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
withdrew from the political scene.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic told the local radio in the central Serbian town of
Jagodina that she had said this to head of the Bosnia mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
Robert Frowick, to which he had agreed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the OSCE is charged with organizing
and monitoring the first post-war elections in Bosnia in
September.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said that Karadzic's handing over of the state and
political offices was a "rational move, which was not difficult to
implement."
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from the West, Karadzic agreed Friday to
relinquish the offices of Republika Srpska president and president
of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). Plavsic, who is Republika
Srpska vice president, temporarily took over the first office and
Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha took over the second.
</P>
<P>
Frowick has postponed the election campaign in Bosnia from July
15 till 19 because Karadzic still hang on the presidency of the
SDS. Bosnian Muslim leaders also threatened to boycott the voting
if Karadzic did not step down and disappear from the public life.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said she believed that Frowick was a "determined man,
who knows what he wants" and that he would allow no "manipulations
by the Muslim-Croat federation," which had serious problems and
wished to blame them on Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
"Our people who contact Frowick's associates are very satisfied
with their cooperation and I heard that his people were satisfied
with our cooperation and I really expect a fair way to the
elections," Plavsic said.

<HEADLINE> 300 Kenyan Opposition Members Defect To Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred members of main
opposition parties in Kenya today defected to the ruling Party,
KANU.
</P>
<P>
The defectors of opposition FORD-Kenya, FORD-Asili and
Democratic Party of Kenya said they decided to take the step
after realizing that the opposition parties have nothing to offer
Kenyans and that their leaders are only interested in power.
</P>
<P>
They were received by the Nakuru District KANU branch chairman
councillor Raphael Korir.
</P>
<P>
When receiving the defectors, councillor Korir said the KANU
has continued to unite all Kenyans irrespective of their tribal
background while all the other political parties are tribal
based.
</P>
<P>
Adopting multi-partyism in 1991, Kenya held its first
multi-party elections in 1992. The country's second general
elections are due next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police clashed here
Saturday with ultra-orthodox demonstrators who tried to block a
downtown street to traffic on the Jewish sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of angry black-clad demonstrators threw stones at
police and passing cars on the Ban-Ilan Street in an
ultra-orthodox neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of policemen used water-cannon to disperse the big
crowd, while mounted police tried time and again to push the
demonstrators back.
</P>
<P>
Hundred yards away, a counter-demonstration was held by secular
groups led by the left-wing Meretz party, which have been
campaigning for free passing on the arterial road even on the
Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
They asserted that the road also serves thousands of secular
residents in surrounding districts as well as a major city hospital.
</P>
<P>
The police said that three of the ultra-orthodox demonstrators
were arrested for throwing stones. No injury was reported during
the clash.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Confirms Commitment to "Artery of Life" Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Foreign Ministry today
confirmed in a statement that the Sudanese government will commit
to the "artery of life" deal signed between Sudan and the U.N. in
1989.
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced the government's willingness to cooperate
with the U.N. and the international community for enabling the
residents of southern Sudan to obtain relief goods.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also expressed astonishment and regret at a
U.N. report indicating that the Sudanese government was hindering
the delivery of relief supplies to the war-torn south.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Sudan barred the U.N. World Food Program from
using C-130 transport planes to deliver food to the south, where
Christian and animist rebels have been battling the northern
Moslem-dominated Khartoum government since 1983.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, World Food Program officials told reporters in New
York that the Sudanese government's restrictions on international
food aid have put 700,000 people at risk of starvation in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government was reportedly to have claimed that
humanitarian groups have used planes to smuggle weapons to
southern rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations and other organizations have
strongly denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> ANC to Step Up Cooperation With PAC, Mandela Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today steps are being taken towards more
cooperation between the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 1000 anti-apartheid veterans celebrating his
birthday in Pretoria, Mandela said those who fought in the
liberation movements should enjoy together the "fruits of the
liberation".
</P>
<P>
Mandela said PAC leader Clarence Makwetu has declined four
offers to join the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
PAC, established in April 1954, is one of the major political
organizations fighting against the anti-apartheid system.
</P>
<P>
"We must let the smaller parties feel that they are part and
parcel of decision making," said the president, adding minority
parties should not be allowed to become rubber stamps for the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also warned of the danger of government officials
promoting their own interests and forgetting those of the people
who had elected them.
</P>
<P>
Referring to criticism of the government, Mandela said
although the ANC-led government wants to better the lives of all
South Africans, this is not something that could be done
overnight.

<HEADLINE> Perot, Lamm Speak to Reform Party Faithfuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party founder Ross Perot
and former Governor Richard Lamm of Colorado of the United States,
both seeking the Reform Party's presidential nomination, spoke to
the party faithfuls today.
</P>
<P>
Perot, taking the state party convention stage in
Charlottesville, Virginia, after Lamm in their first shared public
appearance, promised to "do better" than Republican and Democratic
leaders if he were president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"If you make me your candidate, I will dedicate myself as a
servant to the American people -- bought, paid for and owned by
the American people," media reports quoted Perot as saying.
</P>
<P>
Perot, who for months had said he no longer coveted the
presidency, announced his candidacy on July 10 -- one day after
Lamm, a lifelong Democrat, said he would run.
</P>
<P>
Lamm said, "America desperately needed a new political party,
desperately needed a new political movement that was dedicated to
reform and renewal of America."
</P>
<P>
Perot said the Reform Party had "a game plan." "We've got
strategy and tactics and we've got 62 percent of the voters who
want a new political party and with all of that if we do our job
right we can win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lamm said the party would not take money from political action
committees, but would support itself on mall contributions.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the budget battles last year and the government
shutdowns, Perot said, "We don't need any more government
shutdowns."
</P>
<P>
"We don't need fights in the House of Representatives. We don't
need stunts and train wrecks.... We need careful, thoughtful,
rational action to get the job done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perot also sent a message to congressional candidates, saying,
"We must win the presidency and this is just as important or even
more important, we're going to endorse the candidates in every
House and Senate race across this country who are committed to
reform and we can provide the swing vote to put about 100 percent
of them in office."

<HEADLINE> Zeng, First Chinese Male Swimmer into the Olympic Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Qiliang from South China's
Guangdong Province finally fulfilled the dream for all his fellow
Chinese male swimmers: to book a berth in the Olympic finals.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Chinese clocked a time of one minute 2.26
seconds to finish eighth after the preliminaries, which ensured
him a berth in tonight's final.
</P>
<P>
Born on May 10, 1975, the 1.73-meter high Zeng had no advantage
physically, but he struggled to cross the finish-line with strong
strokes.
</P>
<P>
Before the Olympic Games, China had set a modest goal for their
male swimmers: just to make the final. In fact, Zeng had done it
well and no matter win or lose tonight in the final, he will
surely be written into the Chinese swimming almanac.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, 16, who clocked a year's best time of 4:40.85 in the
400m individual medley, clocked a slow time of 4:53.87 and was
eliminated from the final.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed a total of four golds and one bronze out of five
events she entered at the Chinese Olympic trials in Tianjing last
April.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese teenager Wu Yanyan, from south China's Guangxi
Province, who clocked the year's best time in the 200m individual
medley, was also edged out from the final.

<HEADLINE> World Court Nominates Arbitrator for Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice has nominated U.S. lawyer Roberts Owen as the third
arbitrator in a territorial dispute over Brcko in northeastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Colum Murphy, spokesman for the
international High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt at a news
conference in Sarajevo today, reports from the Bosnian capital
said.
</P>
<P>
Owen, one Bosnian Serb and one Bosnian Muslim arbitrator should
decide in the dispute over a corridor which links the eastern and
western parts of the Bosnian Serb state of Republika Srpska. Both
the Serbs and the Muslims claim that Brcko, a strategic town,
belong to them.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect a speedy solution, because the issue is very
sensitive and complex," Murphy said. He expressed the hope that
the first meeting of the three arbitrators would take place
Monday, if a venue could be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the international court had intervened after
Republika Srpska and the Muslim government failed to agree on the
third arbitrator within a deadline set under the Dayton peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, a still controversial place in Bosnia, will be decided
by international arbitration within a year after the Dayton
agreement was signed last December.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Accuse NATO Planes of Dropping Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Defense Department in
Doboj, a Serb town in northern Bosnia, accused today NATO planes
of dropping large quantities of chemicals hazardous for the
population and environment.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Defense Department said in a statement that by
dropping suffocating chemicals, NATO planes and helicopters were
"spreading panic among local population" for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether the chemicals were dropped
accidentally or for other reasons. But a previous report on
unknown and health hazardous agents dropped by NATO planes Monday
was denied by the command of the Nordic-Polish Brigade of the
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Doboj.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Tanjug news agency quoted the statement as saying
that the latest cases were registered when two NATO planes
overflew Doboj and its surroundings Monday and NATO helicopters
flew over the region of Mt. Ozren Friday.
</P>
<P>
After several NATO plane overflights, "citizens sought help in
Doboj emergency medical institutions, complaining about heavy
breathing, throat tickling, headaches, vomiting, cough and
fatigue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that after the chemicals were dropped, many pigs,
calves and other domestic animals died and other negative effects
were registered on fruit trees, crops and in forests.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug also reported that a 230-kg bomb accidentally fell off a
U.S. NATO plane this afternoon and exploded in the southeast of
the northern Bosnian town of Brcko.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the explosion, which took place in an
open area on the edge of a U.S. base, just inside the Muslim-Croat
federation, NATO spokesman Col. Max Marriner said in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
According to initial reports, there was no damage and an
investigation is under way, Marriner added.
