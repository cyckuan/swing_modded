<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Lodges Protest With France for Joining NATO Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav ambassador to France
Bogdan Trifunovic has lodged a protest with France against its
participation in NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Trifunovic said on Thursday that Yugoslavia has historically
been cooperative and friendly towards France.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia was aimed
at breaking up Serbia and creating a "greater Albania".
</P>
<P>
He said that up to the midday Thursday, 10 people were killed
and 38 injured in the bombings by NATO which began Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Kosovo Albanian force, the KLA, began an
offensive against Yugoslav forces simultaneously with the NATO
bombings.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reaffirmed Yugoslavia's readiness to resume the
political process aimed at granting Kosovo an enlarged autonomy on
the basis of equality among all ethnic groups of the province.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the vital interests of Yugoslavia to solve the
problem of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Yugoslavia was ready to accept an
international presence "of fullness and quality" in Kosovo, but
rejected the presence of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of foreign troops in Kosovo is an occupation
and a change of the frontier, despite different explanations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the Yugoslav government will do next after the
bombings, the ambassador said that it was up to NATO to stop the
bombing first.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said here on Thursday that NATO would probably mount
ground attacks against Yugoslavia, but the emergency meeting held
during the day by the Russian government did not make any "
military decision" in response to NATO's "aggression" against
Yugoslavia, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would take counter measures which have been
prepared according to developments in the situation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the meeting held by the Council of Defense
Ministers of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) only
dealt with issues related to the strengthening of CIS in the
military field and the collective security of CIS nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Fall Below Pre-1998 Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States' steel
imports declined for a fourth consecutive month in February and
dipped below pre-1998 levels, the Commerce Department said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Overall imports to the country were at 2 million tons, 15
percent below the 1997 monthly average of 2.4 million tons,
according to the preliminary statistics released by the Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Japan, one of the leading sources of foreign
steel, were cut in half. However, Russia and Brazil, the other two
countries accused by U.S. steel producers of dumping hot-rolled
steel in the United States, posted slight increases in shipments,
potentially giving ammunition to supporters of legislative quotas.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports from Russia went up 17 percent in February, and
shipments from Brazil increased 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports surged last year largely due to the Asian
economic crisis that lowered demand for steel abroad and forced
foreign producers to turn to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The shipments have been declining since November, when the
domestic steel industry won a favorable Commerce Department ruling
that could subject imports from the three countries to tariffs
retroactive to that month.
</P>
<P>
But the new trend didn't cool down the increasing protectionism
in the Congress. The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly
passed last week a bill imposing quotas on steel imports despite
the threat of a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry contends that thousands of layoffs and
three U.S. company bankruptcies have resulted from the surge in
imports, which reached record highs last year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic producers and two unions complained to the federal
government in September, accusing Japan, Russia and Brazil of
illegally dumping hot-rolled carbon steel, a widely used product,
in U.S. markets at prices below production costs.
</P>
<P>
The cases, awaiting final rulings this Summer, appear to have
reduced shipments of that product from those countries because of
the threat of retroactive tariffs. In the meantime, some U.S.
producers have announced price hikes and have begun to rehire
workers.

<HEADLINE> UN's Effort to Improve People's Living conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Acting executive director of
United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat), Klaus
Toepfer, said here Thursday that his agency is developing the
World Charter of Local Self- government in a bid to improve
people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in the United Nations Office in
Nairobi, Toepfer said the first world compact on local
governments, whose aim is to clearly specify the role of
responsibilities of local authorities and provide for effective
decentralization, will be progressively finalized over the next
two years and formally submitted to the United Nations General
Assembly in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer told reporters that Habitat and its partners, the local
 authorities from different countries, discussed the draft
charter during March 21 to 24 in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The prominent Habitat leader emphasized that the charter is the
only way to ensure that local authorities can effectively
contribute to improving residents's living conditions in cities
in all continents and regions.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities play a key role in today's world, he said,
citing that the world's urban area, home to nearly half the human
race, faces major problems like unemployment, crime and crumbling
infrastructures, which prevent people from rising out of poverty
and may lead to riots and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The World Charter, representing an important partnership
between Habitat and local authorities, was initiated by mayors and
representatives of local authorities at the World Assembly of
Cities during the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul, Turkey, in
1996.

aggression".

The raids, he said, had killed dozens of civilians and wounded
many others.

The ambassador called on the international community to condemn

<HEADLINE> Commentary: NATO Has Gone too Far by Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
 by Gu Zhenqiu
</P>
<P>
United Nations, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The forces of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launched an assault on Yugoslavia,
a sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family, with cruise
missiles and bombs on Wednesday. Waves of NATO air strikes touched off
grave concerns from the international community, which has called for
an immediate end to such an illegal action.
</P>
<P>
The NATO move violates the principles of the U.N. Charter and
the norms of the international relations. Under the Charter,
only two instances of the use of force are justifiable: one is
self-defense, the other is the authorization of the U.N. Security
Council, which has primary responsibility for the maintenance of
peace and security worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the NATO action is not the case. Under the U.N.
Charter, NATO should ask for permission from the 185-member United
Nations for whatever military actions it takes.
</P>
<P>
Watching the bomb explosion on television, people would have to
ask: Is NATO an organization safeguarding or sabotaging stability?
Is it a defensive body or an offensive one?
</P>
<P>
Of course, a regional organization can play a role in maintaining
peace and security, but it has to honor some universally accepted
principles.
</P>
<P>
First, a regional organization should play a peacekeeping role
on the basis of the respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of a country.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after NATO launched the military action, Vladislav
Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations, told an urgent Security Council session that the on-going
NATO move amounts to a flagrant aggression of his country.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a regional organization should play a peacekeeping
role in order to promote the momentum for peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
NATO kicked off air strikes as parties concerned are working
actively to seek a political solution to the Kosovo issue through
dialogue. NATO bombs exploded near Belgrade after the Yugoslav
Government's repeated statement that it is ready to enter into peace
talks "anywhere, at any time."
</P>
<P>
That's why some ambassadors, who took the floor at the Security
Council in response to NATO attacks on Wednesday afternoon, voiced
their fear the NATO strikes will bring about serious concerns of
instability in the Balkans, long regarded as "the powder kettle"
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, a regional organization should first request for
agreement from a country concerned before it takes military action
within its territory and territorial air space.
</P>
<P>
In the case of NATO strikes on Yugoslavia, the Atlantic alliance,
without even a symbolic gesture to solicit opinions from Belgrade, went
ahead with actions against the will of the government and people of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which favors peaceful settlement, but
rejects any imposed idea of a solution.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade said that there is no peace agreement out of the talks
in Rambouillet, France, and the accord signed by Kosovar Albanians
was simply crafted by Western countries and had never been discussed at
Rambouillet and even among six members of the Contact Group, in
charge of Balkan diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Kosovo, a Serbian province is an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, and it should be solved on the basis of the respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan country and
equality to all ethnic groups in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's population
of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
The NATO move culminated in the long Western attempts to impose
biased pressure on Belgrade, which, to a large extent, amounts to an
encouragement to armed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who have long
been engaged in terrorist and separatist actions for independence.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, NATO, by waging strikes on Yugoslavia, does not do
what the alliance claims to safeguard peace and security in the
region, it just serves as the air force of the rebel Albanian
fighters.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Says Air Raids Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, March 25 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said on Thursday that NATO's first two rounds of air
raids against Yugoslavia were successful, indicating air strikes
would go on.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of air strike that began on Wednesday
evening, in which German Tornado fighters took part for electronic
harassment, three Yugoslav Mig29 fighters were shot down by NATO,
Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
No NATO warplane had been shot down by Yugoslav forces,
Scharping said, adding that a plane was forced to land in Salajevo
" because of technical problems" and late to return.
</P>
<P>
Totally NATO had deployed more than 400 warplanes for air
strikes against Yugoslavia, the minister confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Scharping indicated that NATO would stop military actions if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic "gave out a signal".
</P>
<P>
But, "Even after the first round of air strikes, there is no
sign of Belgrade to change a little," Scharping said, "then the
military steps must be decided to go on."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army had strengthened its deployment in Kosovo,
where the conflicts were continuing with "undiminished intensity",
Scharping said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Opposes NATO Strikes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece, member of both North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU),
opposes the alliance's ongoing air strikes on Yugoslavia, Greek
Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Military operations will not bring any solution," Simitis told
a news briefing at a special EU summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Attending the summit with the other 14 heads of government of
EU member states, Simitis also said that his country is a neighbor
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Because of the NATO bombing in Kosovo, the EU leaders have
postponed their planned summit timetable. They are striving for
making last compromises for the bloc's reforms of financial
package, known as Agenda 2000 in EU jargon. The package includes
EU's total budget, farm subsidy and regional aid reforms.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said Greece is the least developed of the 15 EU
countries and would therefore not accept any reduction of its
regional development aid from Brussels, where the EU headquarters
is located.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders are expected to sign a deal on the Agenda
2000 at late night Thursday or early Friday morning since each EU
member may need to give up something more or less for final
agreement on financial reforms which are designed to embrace up to
12 new member countries from central and eastern Europe plus
Cyprus in early next century.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes Security Council Will Go on Discussing Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday that he hoped the Security Council will
continue discussing the situation following NATO military attacks
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions from the press, he said the Security
Council "is actively seized of the matter" and he hoped that the
15-member council will continue to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led by the United
States began air strikes on FRY targets on Wednesday as it
rejected West-imposed settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
At an urgent Security Council meeting following the attacks,
NATO was denounced for violating the U.N. Charter and worsening
the situation in the Balkan region as its military action was not
authorized by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan said on Thursday that he did not see his personal role in
the matter at this stage, rather leaving it to the six-member
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"The Contact Group is in the lead and at this stage I have no
plans of getting immediately involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had heard of any casualties from the bombing-hit
areas, the U.N. chief said he would soon speak to NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana "to get a direct assessment".
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia said more than 10 civilians were killed and over 60
people injured in the first day of NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday that NATO
would "intensify" air strikes on Serb targets in FRY.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade: NATO Attacks Hit Over 50 Military Targets, 10 Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Thursday that
NATO airstrikes overnight hit more than 50 military targets in the
country, killing 10 soldiers and injuring 38 others.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency said the raids conducted by fighter
planes of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy,
Germany and Spain, targeted military units, structures and
installations all over the country in the aggression.
</P>
<P>
Among the targets hit were dual-purpose plants, such as the
Utva factory in Pancevo, the aircraft works Moma Stanojlovic, and
the Milan Blagojevic company in Lucani, Tanjug said, quoting the
Yugoslav Army General Staff information service.
</P>
<P>
In an extremely unequal air battle, Yugoslav forces shot down
NATO fighter planes and several cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO said in Brussels that all its planes returned
safely after the raids.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army said that staff morale, unity of commands and
units, and efficiency of command were maintained.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday called
the NATO attacks an "unprecedented criminal act" that support
ethnic Albanian "terrorists".

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Scores of new flights and the
award of eight new retail licenses reflected growing business
confidence in Hong Kong International Airport, according to senior
Airport Authority (AA) officials.
</P>
<P>
AA Finance and Commercial Director Raymond Lai said here on
Friday that more airlines and retailers are making lone-term
commitments to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Since the airport opening in July last year, 54 scheduled
services have been dropped, but 120 have been added, resulting in
a net gain of 66 flights.
</P>
<P>
"Some airlines have cut back flights and one or two have pulled
out for the time being, " said Lai.
</P>
<P>
"This happens even in the best times and for a host of reasons.
However, the fact that we are seeing far more new flights than
those being dropped is again a sign of growing confidence in the
airport and Hong Kong," added Lai.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Committee Condemns NATO Attack on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Peace Committee
strongly condemned NATO's military attack against Yugoslavia,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The committee said in a statement issued on Thursday that it
vehemently condemns NATO's military attack against Yugoslavia,
beginning on March 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO's armed intervention has caused serious
consequences to innocent people, trampled on the independence,
sovereignty and the right to self-determination of the Yugoslavian
people, violated the U.N. Charter and brazenly challenged peace-
and justice-loving public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The military attack," the statement said, "has rendered the
situation in Kosovo more complicated, caused tension in the
Balkans, and created a dangerous precedent in international
relations."
</P>
<P>
It expressed the committee's full support for the World Peace
Council's resolution passed in Hanoi on Thursday and the
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's statement issued on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Peace Committee demanded "an immediate halt to all
military acts against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a long-term peaceful solution must be sought
for the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Appeal WTO panel ruling on Dairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday that it
intends to appeal the World Trade Organization (WTO) report that
suggests Canada's dairy pricing system could be considered an
export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
"Governments and industry have worked closely together in a
Team Canada approach to defend the Canadian dairy industry's
interests in this challenge by the United States and New Zealand,"
said International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi in a release.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Canada shares the industry's serious
concerns about the panel report," said Agriculture and Agri-Food
Minister Lyle Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
"The sector adopted its classified pricing system in 1996 to
comply with the new WTO rules, and we do not think it should be
considered an export subsidy. We stand with our industry on this,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian dairy farmers price their milk according to its end
use through a classified pricing system. The U.S. and New Zealand
argued that parts of the classified pricing system constitute an
export subsidy. Canada said they are not an export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, it will probably be late May before Canada can
officially announce any formal appeal.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- American and allied warplanes launched fresh waves of bombs
and missiles against Yugoslavia on Thursday, concentrating again
on air defenses to clear the skies for manned strikes yet to come
against the government's military forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
-- Crowds of angry pro-Serbian demonstrators threw rocks,
burned cars and attacked the U.S. Embassy in Skopje, Macedonia, on
Thursday to protest the NATO airstrikes against Serb-controlled
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration vowed on Thursday prolonged and
severe attacks against Yugoslavia as it said that President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was defiantly stepping up his
military campaign around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Congress passed the Republican budget for 2000
Thursday night, driving toward a big tax cut and a showdown with
the Clinton Administration over the nation's priorities in an
emerging era of fiscal plenty.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. economists said oil's price rise will not pose a big
inflation threat to the U.S. economy, as the cuts of oil output by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are likely to
produce only modest increases in oil prices and petroleum has lost
some of its power over the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. regulators approved on Thursday Canadian National
Railway Co.'s 2.4-billion-U.S.-dollar takeover of Illinois Central
Corp., creating an ambitious rail network linking Canada, Mexico

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania will not send troops
into Yugoslavia nor will it participate in any military action
against that country, Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu reiterated on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the Kosovo crisis, Plesu said
Romania, as Yugoslavia's neighbor, was willing to enter Yugoslavia
to help it with post-war construction and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Romania had always championed a
settlement of the Kosovo crisis through political means and had
made unremitting efforts for that purpose together with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He regretted with the development of the situation in
Yugoslavia. But he said that Romania had to adopt the same stance
as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because it shares with
NATO a partnership for peace and is also aspiring for NATO
membership.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the major newspapers in Romania, which
used to have different views on the Kosovo issue, have gradually
united to express their indignation at NATO's launch of an
unprecedented war against the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also criticized their country for standing on NATO's side
on the Kosovo issue in disregard of their good-neighborly
relations with Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> French Prime Minister Justifies NATO Action Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
on Friday tried to justify NATO's "Operation Deliberate Force"
against Yugoslavia by blaming Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for the impasse over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the National Assembly, which began a debate on
France's participation in the NATO operation Friday morning,
Jospin said that Milosevic "has chosen to carry all the
responsibility for the present political impasse".
</P>
<P>
The debate was launched as more French politicians, from both
the right and left, expressed doubt over the legitimacy of the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Jospin accused the Yugoslav president of "demilitarizing
intensively Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years already, the authorities of Belgrade refused
Albanians of Kosovo, who make up 90 percent of the population of
this province, the exercise of their legitimate rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that after repeated diplomatic efforts by France
and others, the use of force became "unavoidable".
</P>
<P>
"Our country, you know, has done all it can in order to find a
political exit for the crisis in Kosovo", he said, adding that
since all the efforts were in vain, "the use of force became
unavoidable".
</P>
<P>
France had helped to postpone the military operation several
times in order for the talks in Rambouillet and Paris to succeed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With Britain, France was the co-chair of the peace talks on
Kosovo in Rambouillet in February and in Paris in March.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain also initiated the idea of deploying NATO
troops in Kosovo to guarantee the implementation of an agreement
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister reaffirmed that France's objective in
participating in the NATO action was to make Yugoslavia accept the
establishment of "an interim statute of substantial autonomy" in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Our political objective, defined for one year by the Contact
Group, has not changed: the establishment of an interim statute of
substantial autonomy in Kosovo, within the frontiers of Yugoslavia,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
On NATO lack of approval from the United Nations Security
Council over the issue of military intervention in a sovereign
country, Jospin said, "While there was an emergency, it was up to
us to take responsibility, notably within the Atlantic Alliance (
NATO)."
</P>
<P>
Forty French warplanes were participating in the NATO bombing
missions against anti-air defense systems of the Yugoslav army,
and 2,400 French ground troops were deployed in Macedonia for a
future peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, according to Jospin.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Share Placement of Listed Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) today issued new regulations on the share
placement of listed companies, in a bid to further rectify the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations stressed that listed firms must be fully
independent of their control firms in personnel, properties and
finance.
</P>
<P>
It revised the profit requirement for listed firms to place new
shares, giving more flexibility to companies.
</P>
<P>
While the old regulations provided that a listed firm must have
an annual profit rate of 10 percent for three consecutive years to
place new shares, the new rules said 10 percent can be an average
profit for the last three years, while adding that the annual
profit rate must be higher than six percent.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations tightened the supervision over the usage of
funds raised through placement of new shares.
</P>
<P>
For example, it provided that the boards of directors must tell
the shareholders' general meeting of any planned investment
projects with the newly-raised funds as well as about feasibility
study related to such projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, listed firms may not provide
guarantee for debts of shareholders and any individuals with their
properties.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will take immediate effect.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Invests $700 Million in Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Manager of the exploration
department of the The National Hydrocarbon Corporation of
Mozambique, Guilhernimo Fortes, confirmed to Xinhua Friday that to
date, the country has invested a total of 700 million U.S. dollars
in petroleum and natural gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
This includes expenditure on both seismic survey and
well-drilling. So far 60 test wells have been completed besides
three natural gas fields in central and southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Fortes revealed that the British BP petrol company will invest
15 million dollars next year in one more test well near the mouth
of the Zambeze River in central Mozambique. He believed that the
prospects are great for discovering petroleum in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, the manager said companies tapping oil in Mozambique
have expressed their worries over the risks they are taking, given
the plummeting oil price on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration started in 1948 in Mozambique, with many world
renowned oil companies exploring the resources in the southern
African country.

<HEADLINE> India, Russia Discuss NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh had a conversation with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov over telephone Friday evening on the NATO
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Singh told the press here that he had conveyed India's stand on
the issue, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
India was in close and constant touch with members of the
Non-Aligned Movement and all the other nations that have expressed
concern over the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday, the External Affairs
Ministry urged NATO to stop the air strikes immediately, saying,
"This demonstration of its extra territorial engagement is a
development that can only cause anxiety."
</P>
<P>
The statement said such unilateral moves seriously undermine
the authority of the entire U.N. system, are in violation of the
U.N. Charter and amount to interfering in the internal affairs of
a country.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government reiterated that the Kosovo crisis could
only be resolved through peaceful means and a solution found
within the framework of the national sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.

BONN March 26 (Xinhua) -- After the European Union's compromise
on the Agenda 2000 reform package, the next urgent task facing the
bloc is to expand eastward, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After an all-night summit session in Berlin, Schroeder told the
parliament in Bonn that Germany would serve as an honest broker
for new candidates for EU membership, stressing that without
eastward expansion, the process of European integration would
remain unfinished.
</P>
<P>
"The (European) Union should not stop at Germany's eastern
borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also praised the EU members states' solidarity
regarding the NATO air attacks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the difficult situation in Kosovo, Europe is
speaking with one voice," he told the Bonn parliamentarians.

<HEADLINE> China Reaches Bilateral Agreement With More WTO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China has completed negotiations
with dozens of World Trade Organization (WTO) members and it will
make new efforts to reach bilateral agreement with more others at
an early date, according to Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Long made the remarks here today when meeting with a
negotiation delegation from the Japanese Shipping Service Trade.
</P>
<P>
"China has consistently maintained that the negotiation
process for its access into the WTO is a multi-lateral one," Long
said, adding that China places importance on its close cooperation
with all the WTO members and has done its best to push forward the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese government respects the
major principle of the WTO, namely the principle of unconditional
most-favored-nation treatment, according to which any agreement
reached between China and a WTO member should be applicable to
other members of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have now finished bilateral negotiation on
trading and both expressed their satisfaction on the fresh
development in their talks today on WTO service trade.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to speed up the negotiation process for China's entry,
Chinese trade officials have conducted a series of bilateral
consultations with Australia, Canada, the EU, Uruguay, India and
Costa Rica since March 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the WTO China
Working Party, presided over an informal meeting in Geneva to
assess the current situation for China's entry and set the agenda
for coming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the delegations present at the meeting recognized
the new momentum in the negotiations concerning China's access
into the WTO over the past few months. They expressed the hope
that China would obtain the WTO membership before the
organization's new round of multi-lateral talks early next year.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Chief Warns of Attacks Night After Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Friday that NATO would bomb Yugoslavia "night
after night" unless President Slobodan Milosevic's forces stop
their attacks against the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We never said there was going to be some overnight knock-out
blow," Robertson told BBC Radio 4.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said NATO, which pounded Yugoslavia with missiles and
bombs for a second night, had never promised its air strikes
against Yugoslavia would be a one-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted the strikes were already damaging Milosevic's
ability to carry out what he charged were genocidal assaults on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also played down suggestions that cracks
were beginning to appear in NATO's united front.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO's resolve was solid despite doubts
expressed by the Italian and Greek governments.
</P>
<P>
Italy said on Thursday that the air strikes on Yugoslavia
should end soon.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Yugoslavia should take the first step to stop
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for President Milosevic ... to start the talking
again, and at any point he can do it," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
"The next step is up to him," he said.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Split Over NATO Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Deep divisions, cutting across
party lines, opened up in the British House of Commons during an
emergency debate on NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the debate, Labor backbenchers even tried to
force a technical vote on the adjournment of the House in protest
at the government's actions.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members from both the Labor Party and the
Conservative Party expressed their deep concern at the potential
consequences of the military action and made clear their strong
opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
Tony Benn, a veteran Labor member of the Labor Party who is
also a former cabinet minister, condemned NATO's air strikes as a
"war of aggression" and mocked British government claims that it
was being done for "humanitarian purposes".
</P>
<P>
A number of Tories also had deep misgivings about NATO's use of
force.
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Minister Alan Clark said much of the
government's reasoning in justifying the air strikes had been "
faulty".
</P>
<P>
"Many British servicemen regard the KLA (the Kosovo Liberation
Army) as a bunch of thugs deeply involved in the drug trade who
are also operating various refugee operations into this country,"
Clark told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Another Conservative ex-minister, Edward Leigh, also attacked
NATO's action, saying, "We may be unleashing a tiger that we
cannot control."
</P>
<P>
Leigh said he had never known a more grave moment in his 16
years as a parliament member and never known the House so "
disunited on the day after we have declared war".
</P>
<P>
Tory backbencher Bowen Wells also declared the NATO action "
illegal" and insisted the United Nations was the proper place to
negotiate a resolution to the crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
With just two minutes to go in the debate, Benn tried to force
a vote on the adjournment of the House in order that he and others
could register their protest.
</P>
<P>
But his efforts failed when some other parliament members
insisted that time was limited and the debate must be ended.

<HEADLINE> Aung San Suu Kyi Refuses to Leave Myanmar for Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Aung San Suu Kyi, general
secretary of the National League for Democracy (NLD) of Myanmar,
has rejected the government's offer to allow her to leave the
country and join her dying husband, Michael Aris, in England.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Than Tun, a government officer despatched to meet and
persuade Aung San Suu Kyi at her residence here on Friday morning
to accept the government offer, was asked to leave the residence
in the midst of discussion, according to a government Information
Sheet Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Aris family in England has publicly pleaded that Aris'
illness be treated as a family matter, with compassion, and not
used for political purpose," it said. "The Myanmar government
totally agrees with this statement and continues its offer to
assist Suu Kyi with all possible humanitarian assistance during
the critical stage of Aris' illness."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Myanmar sees no difficulty for Suu Kyi in
returning to Myanmar after her visit to see her husband believing
that the trip be of a purely humanitarian and family concern," the
Information Sheet stated.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Myanmar government remains sympathetic to the
request by Aris for a visa to Myanmar to see his wife Aung San Suu
Kyi.
</P>
<P>
However, no permission has yet been granted at this critical
period to Aris who has been seriously ill and hospitalized in
England with prostate cancer spreading to his spine and lungs.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government wants the family to take an alternative
that Aung San Suu Kyi be traveling to England to respond to her
husband's dying wish.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Aris, a British citizen, in
January 1972 in England and they have two sons. She returned to
Myanmar to see her then dying mother, Daw Khin Kyi, former Myanmar
ambassador to India, in 1988 when the country was in a political
crisis and has since then resided in the country.
</P>
<P>
She was put under house arrest by the Myanmar authorities from
July 20, 1989, to July 10, 1995 for allegedly endangering the
state.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A heavy water leak at the
Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) in the southeastern Indian
state of Tamil Nadu was detected Friday morning and plugged in the
afternoon, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The leak was confined to a portion of the reactor building and
a plant emergency was declared, PTI said, quoting a press release
by the Nuclear Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Heavy water escaped inside the reactor building due to
degradation of sealing arrangement in one of the coolant channels
in the MAPS second unit, which was shut down earlier for annual
maintenance and inspection, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The leak had since been rectified and the heavy water recovered
for recycling and plant emergency terminated, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
MAPS station director K. Hariharan told the press in Chennai,
formerly Madras, that heavy water released to the environment was
maintained well within the limits specified by the Indian Atomic
Energy Regulation Board.
</P>
<P>
MAPS is a twin unit of pressurized heavy water reactor using
heavy water as primary coolant and moderator.

PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While the NATO continued to bomb the Serbs for a second day
on Thursday, in Pristina, the Serbs seemed to be in the process of
executing their threats of reprisals against ethnic Albanian
civilians. Before being expelled by the Yugoslav authorities, the
correspondent of Liberation collected the testimonies of fear by
the inhabitants of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
-- Deputies of the French parliament are more and more
skeptical about the result of the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia. The National Assembly is due to start a debate
belatedly on France's participation in the NATO operation. French
Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue, who opposes the
NATO action, and former French President Giscard d'Estaing will
make their declarations after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin made an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO is determined to make Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic bend by escalating the war against Yugoslavia. NATO
Supreme Commander in Europe General Wesley Clark said that the
NATO missiles will destroy ``all the Serb forces'' when announcing
a second wave of bombings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union summit in Berlin continued on Thursday
without achieving a consensus among European leaders on the
financing of the union's budget from the year 2000 to 2006.

Howard.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said Friday that the visit aims to
affirm Vietnam's policy of attaching importance to promoting
all-round cooperative relations with Australia, particularly in
economy, investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
This visit also aims to speed up implementation of official
development assistance (ODA) projects and to make use of
Australia's support for Vietnam to join the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and integrate into the regional community, according to VNA.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade value between the two countries increased from
32.3 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to more than 600 million dollars
in 1998 with Vietnam's export surplus reaching nearly 120 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam mainly exports crude oil, coffee, sea products, textile
products, garments and footwear to Australia and imports refined
oil, machinery and equipment, metal and food.
</P>
<P>
Australia is now the 13th largest foreign investor in Vietnam
with 59 projects involving 758 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Australia has provided Vietnam with ODA worth 536
million Australian dollars. The Australian government pledged a
156 million U.S. dollar ODA grant to Vietnam for the 1998-2000
period, to be spent on infrastructure construction and rural
development, particularly in areas of special difficulty.

<HEADLINE> Parliament of Russia-Belarus Union Urges End to NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the
Russia-Belarus Union Friday urged parliaments of all countries to
help end NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a message to parliaments of all countries, the assembly
urged them to persuade their respective governments to actively
seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
All countries should realize that the crisis will not only
threaten peace in Europe, but also peace throughout the world, the
assembly said.
</P>
<P>
The assembly believed the Kosovo crisis had entered a critical
point.
</P>
<P>
If measures were not taken to seek a political settlement,
Europe would plunge into an ever-lasting large-scale conflict
which may develop into a new world war, it said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strikes and other military interventions against
Yugoslavia, all of which were taken without approval from the
United Nations, were "blatant aggression" against a sovereign
country, the assembly said.
</P>
<P>
It believed there was still room for a political settlement and
called on parliaments of all countries to make efforts towards
this end.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Friday his commitment to the country's peace
process but warned that the armed forces will hit hard against any
acts of terrorism by rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that while his government is willing to negotiate
peace, it would "never allow criminal and terroristic acts to
prevail during the process."
</P>
<P>
"We will strive for peace, but we will protect our people from
rebel attacks and threats," he said in a speech during the 102nd
anniversary celebration of the Philippine Army in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that while peace talks between the government and
the National Democratic Front (NDF) remain suspended, the
government would still continue implementing the other components
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to address the root causes of insurgency
through social reforms, the anti-poverty program, the amnesty
program and other development initiatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the NDF guerrillas kidnapped army general Victor
Obillo, his aide and police inspector Roberto Bernal. They
abducted army sergeant Alipio Lozada earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The NDF agreed to release the hostages this month and the
government, in response, agreed to suspend offensive military
operations in areas where the hostages are likely to be released.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Feature: Why Here? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A skinny
black cat with patches of white on its back and under its neck was
sitting on a porcelain washing basin designed for hotel rooms,
licking its front paw and washing its face.
</P>
<P>
It was one of its morning rituals.
</P>
<P>
But on Friday morning, this became the cat's only ritual for
the building where it used to sneak in to grab some breakfast had
become a blazing inferno right in front of it.
</P>
<P>
The burning building, only 20 meters away from the cat, used to
be a storehouse for printing paper, plastic pipes, porcelain
washing basins, food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The storehouses, six rows side by side, were hit by several
NATO bombs overnight and were still burning on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Red flames and black smoke were spewing from the charred
printing paper and plastic materials while bottled pickles made in
Yugoslavia were cracking in the scorching temperature inside the
storehouse.
</P>
<P>
The shock waves from the overnight bombing rocked the trucks
parked just outside the storehouse and cardboard boxes full of
used but clean clothes and shoes were strewn on the dirt ground
nearby.
</P>
<P>
Two of the trucks bore the colors of an international
humanitarian aid organization and two large posters with the image
of Mother Teresa and the motto of "Humanitarian Aid" dangling on
the windshield.
</P>
<P>
One of the trucks was damaged by the bricks hurled out by the
explosion and engine oil had tarnished the ground immediately
underneath and around.
</P>
<P>
Two helpless old ladies tentatively walked up after daybreak
toward the burning storehouse to have a look at what on earth
happened to the building adjacent to theirs.
</P>
<P>
A tall man with heavy mustache murmured every now and then "Why
here, why here?" when he joined the ladies to look at the bombed
site. He ransacked his sailor's vocabulary for whatever English
words he could bring to mind to explain that displaced ethnic
Albanians and Croatians had been surviving on supplies from this
burning storehouse.
</P>
<P>
He himself was an ethnic Albanian from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
When the refugees walked back with heavy feet toward their
storehouse administration turned refugee compound, the cat
followed, in the hope of getting a morsel of leftover porridge
from the dwellers of the compound, where the windows were almost
all broken and a huge piece of the ceiling had collapsed in the
shock wave of the explosions.

YINCHUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Corban Festival, one of the
most important Islamic holidays, is just two days away. Today,
leading government officials in northwest China's Hui Autonomous
Region met here with over 300 Muslim representatives of a number
of ethnic groups to mark the festival.
</P>
<P>
Han Maohua, deputy secretary of the Ningxia Regional Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), extended festival greetings
to the ethnic groups in the region on behalf of the Regional CPC
Committee and the local government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the region has made great achievements during the
past year with a combined effort made by people of different
ethnic groups. The average farmers' annual income reached 1,756
yuan last year, up 16 percent, and more than 240,000 people rose
above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
China has 10 Islamic ethnic groups, including the Hui and Uygur.
Ningxia is China's only autonomous region of Hui ethic group.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Seek 2 Billion Dollars' Aid Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will seek from donor
countries and agencies an aid commitment of about 2 billion U.S.
dollars for the coming 1999-2000 fiscal year, the weekly newspaper
Holiday reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the country has prepared documents for a meeting
in Paris of the Bangladesh Development Forum, known previously as
the Paris Aid Consortium, scheduled for April 20 and 21 April.
</P>
<P>
But the donors would not make any pledge at the meeting this
year, which is expected to be attended by representatives from 35
countries and international organizations, including the World
Bank, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning this year, there will be no pledging of aid in the
Development Forum meeting," World Bank country director Frederick
T. Temple was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But that "is not... to indicate dissatisfaction with the
country's economic performance," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Performance of the country will be the main issue of
discussion of the meeting" and the donors would like to raise
questions about the "pace of reform and the implementation of
commitments made by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sessions of the meeting would also focus on improving
governance, reforming the financial system, food security, public
administration, health and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter sent separately to the president, the prime
minister and the leader of the opposition earlier this year,
members of the donor community expressed their concern about the
country's state of affairs and how confrontational politics had
been affecting the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
At a previous meeting held here in November 1997, the donors
pledged about 1.9 billion dollars in aid to Bangladesh.

<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua)-- Wine is gradually getting popular
with Chinese citizens, according to Gao Shouqing, vice secretary-
general of the Winemaking Industry Association of China.
</P>
<P>
Gao said at a reception today that the sector offers great
potential and the Chinese government is encouraging development of
the wine industry while scaling down the production of spirits in
order to save grain and reduce health risks.
</P>
<P>
Per capita wine consumption in China currently stands at close
to 20 liters, compared with the worldwide average of over 30
liters, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that China's expanding wine market has attracted a
number of overseas investors and more than 100 brands of wines.

consumer finance is a critical factor in stimulating domestic
consumption," said Williamson at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Credit plays an essential role in economic development as it
brings about an increase in consumer spending power, which leads
to greater demand for goods and services."
</P>
<P>
In China, this would result in a more mature and diversified
economy based on strong domestic demand and supply, which is less
vulnerable to external pressures, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the
nation's central bank, allowed all Chinese commercial banks access
to the consumer credit business in an effort to expand domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said he regarded this measure as a strategic move to
make China's national economy more independent on export and
foreign investment and to sharpen the nation's competitive edge
through diversification of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Visa International has worked with the Shanghai Golden Card
Project to connect Shanghai's ATM (automatic telling machine)
network to Visa's global ATM network. Over 2,000 ATMs nationwide
now enable Visa cardholders visiting China to withdraw renminbi as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
Visa has been chosen by the PBOC to help establish a national
bankcard processing center, which will be at the core of China's
consumer payment system.
</P>
<P>
Leehun Lee, chief representative and vice chairman of Visa's
Greater China region branch, added that Visa is also helping China
develop a common standard for different bankcards which are
incompatible to each other at present.
</P>
<P>
Lee anticipated that the task will be finished within two years,
and by then cardholders may use one card for all sorts of payments
in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, Visa International has 16 member banks in China and
the number of Visacards issued by these banks is expected to grow
from 117 million today to 200 million by the year 2000, according
to Williamson.

<HEADLINE> Spring Snowfall Brings Welcome Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An overnight snowfall in
northwest China province of Gansu has brought welcome moisture to
the drought-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
The snow reached a depth of 6 mm in the central and eastern
parts of the province and a light fall of 0.6 mm was recorded in
the provincial capital of Lanzhou, according to the municipal
meteorological station.
</P>
<P>
Snow on all city roads had melted away by this morning but is
still covering roofs, lawns and trees.
</P>
<P>
This small snowfall will not completely relieve the drought,
but will nonetheless bring life and vigor to the arid land and
clean the air, said meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
As a result there were less floating dirt particles in the
city's air today, which will help control the spread of a flu
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A cold front traveling eastwards from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has brought the snow and another fall is
forecast for later today in Hedong area of the province.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has been suffering a heavy drought since last October and
no effective precipitation has occurred to alleviate the dry spell.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Returning to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has begun to
send its international staff back to the war-ravaged Afghanistan
in a phased way with the placement of five of its foreign
employees each in Kabul and Kandahar, a U.N. official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to send back its international staff to Herat,
Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharif, Erick de Mul, the U.N. coordinator
for Afghanistan told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban administration has taken "adequate security
measures" and appointed security liaison officers who will alert
the U.N. staff "if something happens so that we take action on
time."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations withdrew its foreign staff from Afghanistan
following the killing of an Italian U.N. officer and two of its
Afghan employees last August.
</P>
<P>
It started reassessment of the Afghan situation for the
possible return of its international staff in February.
</P>
<P>
Erick confirmed the reports that the United States and Britain
have prevented their nationals employed by the United Nations from
returning to Afghanistan for "security reasons."
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed the hope that "it will be a temporary
thing," adding that the U.S. and British decision did not greatly
affect the return of U.N. staff to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the progress of investigation into
the killing of U.N. staff members, Erick said Taliban authorities
"indeed have made serious efforts to investigate these incidents."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the final findings are yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the humanitarian activities undertaken by the
United Nations in the war-battered country, he said the United
Nations has received only 14 million dollars out of a 150 million
dollars appeal it launched.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Decreases in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's re-
exports, domestic exports and imports in February registered year-
on-year drops, according to the government figures released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figures given by the Census and Statistics Department show
that the value of total exports in the month decreased by 10
percent from a year earlier to 79.1 billion HK dollars (10.14
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports was down by 10.1 percent to 68.7
billion HK dollars (8.8 billion U.S. dollars) and that of domestic
exports by 9.9 percent to 10.4 billion HK dollars (1.33 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports in February fell significantly by 24.9
percent from a year earlier to 80.2 billion HK dollars (10.28
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 1.1 billion HK dollars (141 million
U.S. dollars) was recorded in February, significantly lower than
that of 18.8 billion HK dollars (2.41 billion U.S. dollars) in the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman pointed out that the year-on-
year rate of decline in the trade figures for February was
magnified to some extent by the difference in timing of the Lunar
New Year holidays, which fell in mid-February this year but in end
of January last year, thus giving less working days in February
this year than in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Export performance for the first two months of 1999 taken
together was still weak, affected mostly by continued slack import
demand in a number of markets in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the visible trade deficit in the
first two months of 1999 continued to narrow distinctly from a
year earlier, mainly on account of the reduced intake of goods
retained for local use amidst the ongoing adjustment in the local
economy.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank's New Financial Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China today urged its banking
system to strictly follow the new "Procedures for Punishing
Illegal Financial Practices" which were issued recently.
</P>
<P>
At a tele-conference today, Dai Xianglong, governor of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, asked all financial
institutions across the country to take a close look at themselves
and to deal with illegal practices and improve their supervision
so as to promote the reform and development of China's financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the procedures further demonstrate China's
decision to enforce financial laws and regulations and that they
will play a significant role in maintaining stable financial order
and preventing risks.
</P>
<P>
The procedures were issued February 22 by the State Council,
the country's highest governing body, to standardize penalties for
illegal financial practices that seriously affect financial order.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that thanks to various measures adopted by the central
bank over the past few years, China's financial sector has
developed steadily and its financial reforms have gone as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the problems in financial operation need to
be clearly identified, and one serious reason for these problems
is that financial laws and regulations are not carried out
strictly. He added that "an earnest implementation of the
procedures will help solve these problems and ensure the healthy
development of the financial sector."
</P>
<P>
He asked all financial institutions to learn a lesson from
cases of illegal financial practices and to improve internal
control and supervision to prevent such illegal financial
practices.

<HEADLINE> HK Exchange Fund Assets at 118 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Friday that the Exchange Fund had 921.4
billion HK dollars (118.1 billion U.S. dollars) of assets at the
end of 1998, representing an increase of 44.7 percent over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
While this substantial increase partly reflects the placement
of the Land Fund with the Exchange Fund in November 1998, there
was a high profitability for Exchange Fund investments in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the operating results of the Exchange Fund
announced by the HKMA, the accumulated surplus of the Exchange
Fund grew by 27.5 percent from 190.1 billion HK dollars (24.4
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1997 to 242.3 billion
HK dollars (31.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest growth rate for the accumulated surplus of
the Exchange Fund since the establishment of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Total investment income of the Exchange Fund was 94.2 billion
HK dollars (12.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, which is 2.65
times that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary performance reflects in part the book
profits of 35.1 billion HK dollars (4.5 billion U.S. dollars) made
on the Hong Kong equity portfolio acquired in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for
1998, Chief Executive of the HKMA Joseph Yam said that he was "
pleased with such impressive investment performance in the
management of the Exchange Fund, particularly when conditions in
international financial markets in 1998 have been very volatile."
</P>
<P>
Yam said at a press conference that, after consultation with
the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, a major review on the
investment strategy of the Exchange Fund had earlier been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Yam anticipated a much more difficult investment environment in
1999.
</P>
<P>
"With the U.S. equity market at an unprecedented high level,
with limited scope for further cuts in U.S. interest rates, with
the Japanese economy still struggling for a revival and moderating
economic growth in Europe, and with volatile currencies and
greatly reduced market liquidity, it is inevitable that the
investment performance of the Exchange Fund in 1999 will be
affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the HKMA will "continue to be prudent in the
management of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the new
investment strategy."

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Continue to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices in Australia
increased further with continuing strong demand for finer wool at
sales in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) said in its
weekly report that the eastern market indicator gained four cents,
closing at 534 Australian cents (340 U.S. cents) per kilogram
clean.
</P>
<P>
North market indicator finished the week at 546 cents (347.8
U.S. cents), a rise of one cent, while the south market indicator
rose by four cents to 523 cents (333 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The western region indicator increased five cents to 482 cents
(307 U.S. cents) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11,236 bales were offered for sale with 15.7 percent
passed in, comprising 12.9 percent in Sydney, 12.4 percent in
Melbourne and 19.7 percent in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
AWIS said the market performed better than expected with the
large quantity of wool on offer.
</P>
<P>
However, it was strong demand for 19.5 micron and finer wool,
which remain in short supply, that drove up market indicators.
</P>
<P>
AWIS said orders from China were relatively quiet as Chinese
customers were apparently not yet prepared to operate at the
higher price levels of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Sales will resume after Easter on April 12 in Sydney, Melbourne
and Fremantle with 115,000 bales offered for sale.

"That's true for Japan, and that's true for all the crisis
countries including Indonesia," he was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"However, that does not mean we will see high growth rates over
this year - on average growth will still be very low, around ...
minus," he added.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Vice President Jean Michel Severino agreed that
growth would turn around in Asia, "but with a lot of risks and
uncertainties".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a meeting of finance officials and
central bankers, Neiss also conceded that the IMF did not predict
the severity of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed a speech by Japan's Minister of Finance
for International Trade Eisuke Sakakibara, criticizing the IMF's
response to the crisis and suggesting the group's actions may have
exacerbated the situation.
</P>
<P>
"It (the IMF) drew some lessons that were necessary," Neiss
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 26 (Xinhua)-- Share prices gyrated from
positive to negative territory on Singapore Stock Market Friday
depressed by profit-taking ahead of a holiday-shortened week.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index lost 2.87 points to 1,497.50
points, failing to remain above the psychological 1,500-point
level after rising to the mark Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total volume contracted to 259.41 million units worth
335.08 million Singapore dollars (193.69 million U.S. dollars).
Decliners outnumbered advancers by 181 to 92 with 154 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
GES was the larger block parcel which had a volume of 27.12
million shares traded. TChongInt was the second most active stock
which had 26.91 million units done. Jaya w99 was next with 17.38
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
GE Life and SPH headed the ascent of the day, moving up 40
cents to close at 9.90 and 19.90 Singapore dollars respectively.
SPH 100 climbed up 30 cents to finish at 19.70 Singapore dollars.
UOI picked up 27 cents to end at 1.68 Singapore dollars.

F sank 20 cents to finish at 9.60 and 10.30 Singapore dollars
respectively. Jar Mat retreated 18 cents to end at 3.28 Singapore
dollars
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices moved up at open on gains by
electronics in early trade as market sentiment remained supported
by resumption of optimism of investors after contract manufacturer
Venture Manufacturing announced a solid 1998 earning last week.
</P>
<P>
But early gains were offset by later losses as people thought
share prices could not stay above the 1,500 mark for long and
tended to take profit at present levels.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also noted that blue-chip property shares ended higher
spurred by drops in domestic mortgage rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim Friday
handed over grants of 750, 000 and 300,000 U.S. dollars to
Ethiopia and Sierra Leone respectively to help overcome natural
calamities in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a brief ceremony held at his office in Addis Ababa,
Salim said that he was aware of the problems of drought in
Ethiopia and those of natural disasters in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The policy committee of the Special Emergency Assistance Fund
of the OAU decided to grant the donations to the two countries in
its September 1998 session.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the grants were symbolic, they will
assist those countries in their efforts to combat natural
calamities, said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
It is a practical symbol in Africa of expressing concern and
solidarity for fellow Africans in times of need, Salim said,
adding that he felt happy the donations from the OAU contribute to
the alleviating of the suffering of affected populations.
</P>
<P>
Berhane Gizaw, Deputy Commissioner of Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness of Ethiopia, expressed thanks for the grant which he
described as significant gesture and contribution to achieve the
project of supplying table-water to areas affected by drought in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador of Sierra Leone to Ethiopia and Permanent
Representative to the OAU, Ibrahim B. Kamara expressed profound
gratitude and thanks to the OAU on behalf of his government for
the grant aimed at providing water supply and sanitation in rural
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Project Happy, a program to help
impoverished Chinese women with children, was given a one-million-
HK-dollar donation by a Hong Kong entrepreneur, who gave the same
amount of money to the project before.
</P>
<P>
The project was set up by the China Population Welfare
Foundation (CPWF), the Family Planning Association of China, and
China Population News in February, 1995 to help women in poor
areas get out of poverty by providing them with credit and other
forms of aid to start small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Jun-chi Chan, a member of the board of a large Hong Kong
company, was born in east China's Fujian province but has lived in
Hong Kong for more than 50 years and has donated more than 14
million Hong Kong dollars to various causes on the mainland in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Chan's donation shows that Project Happy has got support
from various social groups and especially from the people of Hong
Kong," says He Luli, the vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress and chairwoman of CPWF.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Project Happy had spent more than 60
million yuan helping at least 40,000 impoverished women in various
parts of China. It has also provided treatment for some 30,000
women suffering from gynecological diseases and provided them with
2.3 million yuan worth of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Government Vows to Improve Social Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
Friday resolved to improve the country's public security by waging
a war against kidnapping and other crimes to attract more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's special Cabinet meeting presided over by Prime
Minister Hun Sen, some measures were taken to crack down on
kidnapping and other crimes and all related authorities were asked
to fully cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of interior, defense and justice and the National
Police director general were all present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The measures included enhancing the management of police,
military and military police, drafting the law on social order,
strengthening the control of firearms and ammunition as well as
the production and sale of military and police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that any import of arms, from now on,
must be first presented by the ministry of defense or interior,
then to be approved by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will also work out a law on radio and communication
to enhance supervision and management.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet meeting also ordered the immediate closure of all
the shooting clubs in Phnom Penh and stopping showing pornographic
and violent TV programs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government urged the media, mainly radio
and television stations, to strengthen the propaganda and
education on social morals among the people to spread the nation's
fine traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
Public order was still very poor in Cambodia in recent months.
Robberies, kidnapping, murders and other serious crimes were
rampant, not only severely affecting people's normal life, but
also blocking foreign investment and the development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Most of the kidnapping victims in the past years were prominent
business figures or family members, particularly ethnic Chinese.
Western aid workers and high-ranking government officials have not
been immune.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Postpones VAT Date to June 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
decided to replace business tax and exercise tax with value-added
tax (VAT) on June 1 this year instead of the previously scheduled
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Minister of Planning and Finance Tomaz Salomao made
the decision known to Parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Friday quoted the minister as saying
that the implementation of the VAT has been postponed for two
months so that the personnel from medium- and small-scale
enterprises can be trained in crash courses.
</P>
<P>
Salomao said that both the government and the large enterprises
 had agreed to implement the VAT starting from April 1 while most
of the tax payers, the medium- and small-scale firms in
particular, opposed the idea on the ground that they had not been
prepared technically.
</P>
<P>
These medium- and small-scale enterprises across the southern
African countries have been suffering from the financial and staff
problems. With two months ahead, they can prepare themselves
better.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that his government will widely publicize
the VAT law and specific measures across the country through media
and various kinds of programs. Priority will be given to the
training of the personnel in such sectors as tourism, agriculture,
industry and trade, and the tax collections branches in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has promised to introduce the VAT under great
pressure from the international financial institutions including
the World Bank. It was one of the preconditions for Mozambique's
candidacy of the Highly- Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) whose
external debt could be relieved accordingly. Currently, the
external debt of the southern African country amounts to some 5.6
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
One senior official of the World Bank who paid a visit to
Mozambique recently said that Maputo has done quite well in its
economic structural adjustment, but pointed out that there is more
to be done for the candidacy of the HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by the end of June, the leading organs of
the international financial institutions will hold meeting to
assess whether Mozambique could become a HIPC candidate.

<HEADLINE> ADB 1998 Lending Totals 6 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved a total of 66 loans amounting to 6 billion U.S. dollars
for 57 projects in 1998, the largest share of which went to the
financial sector, the bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ADB was responsible for about 77 percent of the total
project cost through its lending, co-financing and guarantee
operations, the bank said in a new release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB directly provided loans and equity investments of about
6 billion U.S. dollars and mobilized about 3 billion U.S. dollars
through co-financing from official, export credit and commercial
sources, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
By sector, the financial sector received 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars, the highest share of loans with 28 percent of the total
lending in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This sector was followed by transport and communications,
multisector, social infrastructure, energy and agriculture and
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Through its loans, the ADB helped restore investor confidence
and stabilize the economies of its developing member countries
affected by the Asia financial crisis, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's total lending in 1998 was lower than the
exceptionally high lending level of 9.4 billion U.S. dollars in
1997, the bank said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan have agreed to
conduct six pilot projects in information technology before March
2002, Chinese and Japanese officials said at a seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Planning Commission, Japan's Ministry
of International Trade and Industry, and companies from both
countries will cooperate in using advanced multi-media systems to
study the movement of goods, long-distance education and medical
diagnosis, agricultural production and distribution, flood
monitoring and prevention, and forest fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
The information technology project is one of 34 projects agreed
upon during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan last November.
The two countries then signed a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in February in Beijing stating that, between April
1998 and March 2002, they will spend between 2.5 billion to 3.0
billion Japanese yen (21.15 million US dollars to 25.38 million US
dollars) on the 6 pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
Ma Dexiu, director of the State Development Planning
Commission's Department of High Technology Industries, said at
today's seminar that combining self-reliance and foreign
cooperation in developing the information industry is China's
policy.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that the Sino-Japanese cooperation will provide
new development but that China is still ready to cooperate with
other friendly nations in the information sector.
</P>
<P>
Yuji Miyamoto, a minister at Japan's Embassy in Beijing, and
some 70 Japanese delegates were present at the seminar today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Friday voiced
support for the "unqualified Palestinian right" to an independent
state, calling for negotiations on the Palestinian statehood to be
concluded within one year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released at the EU summit here, the EU "declares
its readiness to consider the recognition of a Palestinian state
in due course."
</P>
<P>
The EU countries "reaffirm the continuing and unqualified
Palestinian right to self-determination including the option of a
state; look forward to the early fulfillment of this right; appeal
to the parties to strive in good faith for a negotiated solution
on the basis of this right, which is not subject to any veto," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the EU believes "it should be possible to conclude the
negotiations by a target period of one year."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat welcomed the
EU declaration while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
denounced it as endangering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has shown willingness to postpone an announced plan to
unilaterally declare the Palestinian statehood in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on May 4, the end of the five-year period of
Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
May 4 is also the deadline for negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Devalues Currency to Increase Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of Nigerian
currency naira is to absorb excess liquidity in circulation and to
make the Nigerian economy more competitive, the Central Bank of
Nigeria has said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Assistant Director for Corporate Affairs Tony Ede
said that the deficit financing of about 125 billion nairas (about
1.39 billion U.S. Dollars) last year resulted in liquidity
overhang, according to This Day newpaper Friday's report.
</P>
<P>
Ede said that much money came into circulation during the
general elections, which concluded at the end of last month, which
did not come out from the banking system and are still in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
The source said this has caused the hiking inflation and
disturbances in the exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"This is a round-about way of saying there is excess liquidity
in the system," said the official, adding real exchange rates has
gone up and the depreciation of naira is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank devalued the Naira by 4.34 percent on
Wednesday as its exchange rate plunged from 86.25 to 90 Nairas to
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the devaluation of the naira, demand for
foreign exchange at the weekly exchange market still peaked at
100.050 million Dollars, 3.577 million Dollars lower than last
week's 104.137 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the huge market demand was a confirmation
of liquidity overhang in the banking system.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Bids Farewell to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Friday bid farewell to a joint sitting of the
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.
</P>
<P>
Friday marks the end of the first democratically elected
parliament of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a speech televised live nationwide, Mandela praised the
national legislature for its work.
</P>
<P>
"Because the people of South Africa finally chose a profoundly
legal path to their revolution, those who frame and enact
constitution and law are in the vanguard of the fight for change."
</P>
<P>
"In brief, we have laid the foundation for a better life.
Things that were unimaginable a few years ago have become every
day reality. And of this we must be proud."
</P>
<P>
Mandela identified as one of the highlights the work of the
Constitutional Assembly, its breadth of consultation and public
participation and unprecedented consensus-seeking in drafting the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also focused on the 100 laws a year on average, that were
passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"These have been no trivial laws nor mere adjustments to an
existing body of statutes. They have created a framework for the
revolutionary transformation of society and of government itself,
so that the legacy of our past can be undone and put right."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had been able to score certain achievements
because he was the product of South Africa, Africa and the world.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that I have been able to take our country
forward to this new era, it is because I am the product of the
people of the world who have cherished the vision of a better life
for all people everywhere," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"They gave us hope because we knew by their solidarity that our
ideas could not be silenced since they were the ideas of all
humanity."
</P>
<P>
Mandela pledged that after his retirement he would continue to
contribute to national unity, reconciliation and a better life for
all.
</P>
<P>
He called upon people from all political parties to support his
heir- apparent, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"His (Mbeki's) and other voices are those of a new generation
of leaders that are emerging in answer to new historical
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"They are the voices of the good men and women who exist in all
 communities and all parties, and who define themselves as leaders
by their capacity to identify the issues that united us as a
nation."

<HEADLINE> China's Chain-Store Businesses Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Last year, China's chain-store
businesses had sales of 60 billion yuan, an unprecedented figure.
</P>
<P>
This is a 43 percent increase over 1997, and if sales at
franchises and department stores were added in it could amount to
100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There were 71 chain stores with annual sales of more than 100
million yuan, 27 percent more than for the previous year. Their
sales added up to 34.4 billion yuan, a 115 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in the chain-store business includes a rise in
the number of large supermarkets, according to a recent issue of
Business Daily. China has 300 to 400 supermarkets that have more
than 5,000 square meters of floor space, most of which opened in
1998 and have lured shoppers with a large number of choices and
relatively low prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the quick growth brought profits of supermarkets down
overall. In 1997, profits of supermarkets with annual sales of
more than 50 million yuan were running around 1.1 percent, but
that figure dropped to 0.4 percent in 1998 and the number of
businesses losing money is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Guo Geping, the chairman of the Chain-Store Business
Association of China, has asked the government to increase macro-
economic controls on chain-store businesses to prevent irrational
competition and to ensure orderly development.

</P>
<P>
An Egyptian diplomat, requesting anonymity, said the World Bank
has allocated 240 million U.S. dollars to set up a new export
security mechanism under the name of "African export guarantee
facilities."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has decided to provide 300 million pounds (about 88

inter-COMESA exports and help solve the problems facing Egyptian
exporters willing to deal with the African market.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:

<HEADLINE> WB Approves 600-Million-Dollar Loan to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
600-million-U.S.-dolar loan to Thailand to help stimulate economic
recovery in the country, the bank said in a statement received
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loan would help lessen the overall impact of the crisis and
provide the Thai government with some "breathing space" in
continuing the economic reforms, J. Shivakumar, World Bank country
manager for Thailand, said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the loan would be helpful in boosting
competitiveness, tracking financial and corporate sector reform
and supporting fiscal stimulus programs.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan was also planning to provide
Thailand with 600 million dollars in parallel financing, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Shivakumar as saying the Thai economy had
shown encouraging signs of improvement recently. But he pointed
out that there were also big problems that obstructed the reform
process like non-performing loans which accounted for more than 45
percent of total lending.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Thailand's economic leaders were aware of the
problems and were taking measures to facilitate corporate debt
restructuring so as to alleviate the credit crunch, stimulate
economic activity and reduce non-performing loans, Shivakumar
said.

readings on updated health news, purchasing healthcare products
and gaining access to other interesting health-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The TM Health Online was developed on the premise that the
public would be able to retrieve medical information anywhere and
at anytime, Telekom Malaysia Chief Executive Datuk Wira Mohamed
Said Mohamed Ali told reporters after the launching of the website
by Deputy Health Minister Wira Mohd Ali Rustam in Petaling Jaya
near here.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Said, commonly sought-after health
information is on heart, cancer and women's health, and in
addition, interactive segments such as "Ask Doctor" and "Forum"
are also available.
</P>
<P>
He said the TM Health Online would also allow visitors to go
through the virtual healthcare center and health shop at their own
leisure.
</P>
<P>
Initially a group of four doctors - three medical doctors and
one dental surgeon -- would handle the website and answer queries
from the public through e-mail, he said, adding the number of
panel doctors would be increased in future with the addition of
specialists in various health sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said a web chat is also provided to allow users to
communicate and exchange ideas with one another.

<HEADLINE> Laos Condemns NATO Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Laos condemned NATO's air strikes
on Yugoslavia and urged NATO to immediately end the blatant
military action on Yugoslavia, Lao official news agency KPL
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lao Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad
said that the Lao People's Democratic Republic considered the NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslavia as a flagrant violation of the
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Lao vice premier gave an interview to Lao media Thursday on
the airstrikes of NATO on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack was also a violation of the charter of the
United Nations and international law, and a menace to peace and
security in the Balkan region as well as Europe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Somsavat Lengsavad stressed the Lao PDR voiced
strong opposition to the use of force by NATO against Yugoslavia,
calling for an immediate end to the blatant actions and a
resumption of talks to resolve all conflicts by peaceful means,
thus meeting the aspirations of mankind for peaceful coexistence.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Paper Criticizes NATO Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia have jeopardized peace and stability in the Balkan
region and in Europe as a whole, harming existing international
relations and are likely to cause unpredictable consequences to
world peace and security, said Vietnam's leading newspaper Nhan
Dan Friday.
</P>
<P>
The national daily said in a commentary that the attack was a
move by the United States and its NATO allies to play the role of
international gendarme in using military power to force an
independent and sovereign nation to submit to the "security
umbrella" provided by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out, "This is an extremely dangerous act
by the U.S. and NATO in the course of interfering in the internal
affairs of Yugoslavia over recent months to force the Yugoslav
government to accept the NATO-imposed solution for the Kosovo
crisis."
</P>
<P>
the newspaper said by launching the military attack, the U.S.
and its NATO allies have violated the UN Charter as well as
international law creating a dangerous precedent in international
relations, which has been strongly condemned and criticized by the
world public.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam demands an immediate end to all military acts against
Yugoslavia and firmly supports all efforts towards a peaceful
solution of any conflict, the commentary stressed.

<HEADLINE> WHO Seeks Attention For Indonesia's Ageing Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia should start giving
priority to the health of its aged people, whose population is
fast increasing, World Health Organization (WHO) representative to
Indonesia Robert Kim Farley said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among developing countries, Indonesia will soon have the third
largest number of aged people with 29 million, after China and
India, Farley told a press briefing in observance of the 1999
World Health Day, which carries the theme "Active Ageing Makes a
Difference".
</P>
<P>
The world's Ageing population is one of the biggest challenges
in the next century, he said, noting that this has potentials as
older people have a lot to contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
The soaring population of aged people will raise major social,
economic and ethical issues and may strain to the limit health
service as well as socio-economic and political infrastructures,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the burden on the elderly borne by
industrialized countries is lighter than that borne by developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries have overcome such chronic diseases as
pneumonia, diarrhea and tuberculosis and could thus tackle cancer,
stroke, hypertension and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Third world countries like Indonesia meanwhile continue to
battle chronic diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farley warned that unless the country gives priority to health
issues concerning the aged, it will be burdened with high costs of
health care for its elderly in the future.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that life expectancy in Indonesia was 65
years for women and 62.9 years for men in 1995, he said, adding
that life expectancy across the world has risen sharply this
century and is expected to continue to rise in virtually all
countries.
</P>
<P>
There are 580 million people in the world who are aged 60 years
and older and the figure is expected to rise 75 percent to 1,000
million by 2020, Farley added.

PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Moscow, Youri Lujkov,
said on Friday that NATO risks to transform Yugoslavia into a
second Vietnam, in reference to the quagmire the United States
experienced during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
"Are they going to transform Yugoslavia into a second Vietnam?
If this is what is happening, it will be a problem which is
impossible to solve. One cannot solve the problem by bombing with
many deaths among civilians who have nothing to do with the
problem of Kosovo," said Lujkov in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Lujkov, who is on a visit in France, also said that it is not
the right time now to lift arms embargo on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment, we should not lift the arms embargo.
This is not the moment to aid the Yugoslavs with arms which could
aggravate the military situation and cause still more deaths," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian politicians have called for the sending of arms to
Yugoslavia and even "volunteers" to help fight the NATO forces.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Move Helps Restore Market Integrity: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Joseph Yam said here Friday that
instead of a violation of free market motto, the government
intervention last Summer helped restore stability and confidence
in this world's freest market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Credit Suisse First Boston Asian Investment
Conference, Yam pointed out that the results of the market
operation last August and follow-up measures were "stable interest
rates and financial markets that have been free of the
manipulation that posed such a threat to stability and confidence
over the summer".
</P>
<P>
He refuted criticism that the government's move was "a gross
violation of free-market principles in a city that had been held
up as one of the world's great models of free-market economics".
</P>
<P>
"We did not, and do not, see it in this way," said Yam, six
months after the market operation, in which the Hong Kong
government drew upon its foreign exchange reserves to fight back
international speculators, who attempted to reap profits by
manipulating both currency and stock and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA chief noted that even in a free market, the
government is prepared to intervene in isolated, clearly
identified cases where markets appear to be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the summer of 1998, there was clear evidence
that the free market in Hong Kong was in danger of failing to
fulfill its functions. "The invisible hand of the market had been
replaced by a very visible club being wielded by a concentrated
group of speculators," said Yam, who added that in the
circumstances, the government had the responsibility of restoring
the stability on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "International Capital Flows and Free
Markets", Yam summed up the characteristics of international
capital flows with six Vs -- Virtue, Volume, Variety, Velocity,
Volatility and Viciousness.
</P>
<P>
He said that when huge volume of international capital flows
rapidly around the world, small and open markets with few or no
controls on capital movements and with transparent financial
system, like Hong Kong, are the most vulnerable to speculative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yam called for the building of a global financial architecture
that can cope with volatile fund flows more effectively than can
individual jurisdictions on their own.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges Turkey to Change Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has sent Turkey a
note, urging it to "change its position" and not to support the
air strikes launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The local Daily News reported Friday the note was delivered to
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem Thursday by Slavko Kruljevic,
Charge d'Affairs of the Yugoslav Embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Kruljevic said at a press conference Thursday that "Turkey
should change its position that it has maintained so far."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the bilateral relations between Turkey and
Yugoslavia have been severely hurt with Turkey's commitment to
the NATO's military intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's attacks were aimed at forcing Belgrade to sign "a
so-called peace deal" which, he said, is opening the way for
Kosovo independence in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Yugoslavia cannot accept this so-called
peace agreement for one main reason: it will lead to Yugoslavia's
loss of a part of its territory very shortly," Kruljevic said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo intensified in February last year when
ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province sought independence from
the serb-led government.
</P>
<P>
The NATO launched air raids against serb targets over the past
two consecutive nights after what the U.S. said diplomatic efforts
were exhausted.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details EU Leaders Reach "Good Compromise" on Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
reached an agreement on part of the bloc's financial reform
package Friday morning after three-day intensive negotiations at a
special EU summit in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Current rotating European Union (EU) president, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said this is not an ideal solution, "
but it is a good compromise." "Despite the difficult work, we can
be satisfied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the compromises among leaders of the bloc's 15
member countries, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
said: "Some gave in more and some less."
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said: "It is a reasonable
agreement ... I am happy and satisfied but then everyone is
satisfied for one reason or another."
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said the leaders have
created a very solid financial foundation with which "we can work
seven years."
</P>
<P>
The compromise was finally reached by delaying cereal and dairy
price reforms, both key elements of the so-called Agenda 2000
financial package, which aimed to prepare the EU for accepting up
to 12 countries in central and eastern Europe early next century.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders also dropped plans to reduce income
support for farmers in order to avoid possible summit failure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ceiling on annual farm spending was set at 40.5
billion euros (44 billion U.S. dollars), plus 14 billion euros (15.
26 billion dollars) over the coming seven years for rural
development. Currently, the farm spending covers nearly half of
the EU's total annul budget of 94 billion dollars through 2006.
</P>
<P>
The final agreement limits regional development aid spending to
a strict limit of 213 billion euros (232.1 billion dollars)
through the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
The deal also sets so-called cohesion funds expenditure at 18
billion euros (19.62 billion dollars) for the period from 2000 to
2006. Spain, Portugal and Ireland will thus continue to benefit
from cohesion fund despite having joined the area of single
European currency, the euro. During the talks, some EU member
countries argued that this meant they no longer need cohesion fund
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"We achieved a positive outcome and that is not a euro more,
nor a euro less," British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, adding
that London would have preferred a more radical agricultural
reform under the Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said: "Reason has won out.
Europe can be satisfied with the result. We have proven we are
capable of taking action."
</P>
<P>
The European leaders at their first-day meeting on Wednesday
nominated former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi as the next
European Commission president, to replace Jacques Santer who
resigned on March 16 with his 19 colleagues of the EU executive
body.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders would meet Prodi on April 14 "to start necessary
reform of the commission," Chirac said. "We need to modernize the
commission," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Company to Explore for Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Ndovu Resources
will invest 10 million U.S. dollars in exploring oil in the Indian
Ocean off the coast of Tanzanian mainland.
</P>
<P>
The company will acquire rights to conduct oil exploration for
11 years over 31 blocks with an area of 2,606.79 square
kilometers, newspaper reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The area covers the east of the Songo Songo Island, including
the Nyuni Island, and stretch to the Rufiji Delta in the Coast
Region, according to an agreement signed between the two countries
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Tanzanian Minister of Energy and
Minerals Abdallah Kigoda, Tanzania Petroleum Development
Corporation (TPDC), and Ndovu's managing director Robert Young.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of oil exploration with TPDC told Xinhua
Friday that the prospect for offshore oil exploration in Tanzania
is "optimistic" because of the favorable geological structure,
attracting more foreign oil companies to come.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, if oil is discovered in any parts of the
blocks in commercial quantities, Ndovu will have the right to
apply for a development licence for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Nyuni block is highly prospective and the
potential exists for a significant petroleum discovery," Young
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government will take various measures to
encourage foreign investment in the country, Kigoda said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government, TPDC and foreign oil exploration
companies have signed several production sharing agreements over
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Irish company Dublin International signed a Production
Sharing Agreement over Mandawa and Rufiji where two deep
exploration wells were drilled in 1996. Preliminary results are
said to be very encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Two Canadian companies, Antrom Resources and Canop Worldwide
Corporation, signed in 1997 separate production sharing agreements
over Pemba/Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam/Mafia, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year Gulf Western Mining signed an agreement covering some
parts of the Tanga Region, Coast Region and Indian Ocean offshore.
</P>
<P>
Western Geophysical Company of Britain signed earlier this year
an agreement to carry out deep-sea speculative geophysical
surveys.

<HEADLINE> French President Makes New Appeal to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
made a new appeal on Friday in Berlin, Germany, to his Yugoslav
counterpart Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace plan on Kosovo,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic can at any moment interrupt the coming
military action (of NATO), all simply, by sitting at the
negotiation table to conclude the peace agreement," Chirac told
the press in Berlin, where he was attending a European Union
summit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Milosevic had "in a way already done it in the
affairs of Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic signed a peace agreement with Bosnia and Croatia in
Dayton, the United States, in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly will begin a debate without vote
on the French participation in NATO's "Deliberate Force Operation",
as more and more French political personalities and unions have
expressed opposition to the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac again tried to justify the French participation in the
NATO action against Yugoslavia, saying that it served "peace,
human rights and stability" in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Or the worse would be feared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the appeal after Yugoslavia asked France to stop
joining the NATO bombings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was necessary to act to break ... the military potential of
attack of the Serbs," said the French president.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, France and its allies have said no to killings, no to
ethnic cleansing, no to oppression, to all that seriously
undermine the values on which rest our humanism, our republic, our
common European values," he added.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Predict Consumer Market Will Pick Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales are expected to hit
763.5 billion yuan (92 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter
of this year, an increase of about 7 percent, according to the
State Internal Trade Bureau (SITB).
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in urban areas will reach 472.7 billion yuan, up 7.
94 percent, and in markets below the township level they are
expected to hit 290.8 yuan, up 5.74 percent. Retail sales in March
are expected to amount to 443.3 billion yuan, up 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Market observers attribute the growth mainly to the buying
spree during the Spring Festival in February and say that consumer
spending will be much slower in March because of the lack of that
stimulus.
</P>
<P>
However, the cut in telecommunications fees from this month
will give a boost to the telecommunications business and will to
some extent increase demand.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhong, the director of SITB's Information Center, says
that to stimulate consumer spending, consumer credit needs to be
increased. China has measures to increase consumer spending in the
first three months by allowing automobiles to be purchased by
installment and establishing pilot areas for purchasing consumer
good and farm machinery in the same way, he says.
</P>
<P>
But, because of the effect of housing and medical care reforms
and incomes that remain low, people are saving money more and that
stands in the way of further consumer spending.

"subversion of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
In an open letter addressed to United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday, which was available here Friday, the group
said that NATO's war planes "hammered military targets in
Yugoslavia... plunging Kosovo's capital Pristina into darkness and
inflicting untold damages and sufferings to the people of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"Not only yesterday's (Thursday) attack but also the other
attacks made earlier (on Iraq) were unjustified and vengeful,
these are against the charter of the U.N., because the U.S.A. and
its ally Britain acted without consulting all the members of the
Security Council," said the group, which consists of over 20
well-known scholars in the country, including Professor Kabir
Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that while the "barbaric missile attacks are
still continuing on Iraq, the area of attack is extended to other
part of the world."
</P>
<P>
The group called on Annan to "preserve the integrity of the
U.N. against the arrogance of the aggressive nations, one of which
dropped the first nuclear bomb on Japan and used biological
weapons in Vietnam and laying landmines in Laos, Vietnam and
Cambodia," by taking "the initiative to show the way to a peaceful
settlement in Yugoslavia and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"We as a citizens' group in Bangladesh committed to the U.N.
ideal of the rule of law and human rights in international
affairs... demand in the name of humanity an immediate end of
missile attack on Yugoslavia and Iraq," it said.
</P>
<P>
The group concluded, "We strongly feel that the world community
should rise to end the Yugoslavia and Iraq crisis in a way
consistent with the ideals of the United Nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven towns in and
around Kosovo were hit by NATO cruise missiles and bombs overnight,
Serbian radio said early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The towns were identified as Pristina, Nis, Leskovac, Pacovica,
Prizren, Urosevac and Krasevec. But no details on casualties were
given yet.
</P>
<P>
A storehouse of humanitarian aid materials in Pristina was hit
by several bombs and was still burning on Friday morning. Right by
the side of the storehouse was a refugee camp sheltering some 30
displaced people from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
One refugee told Xinhua that no one was hurt when the bombs
fell. But glasses and a huge chip of the ceiling in the housing
compound for refugees were broken by the shock waves from bombing.
</P>
<P>
Most shops in Pristina remained closed on Friday, the third day
since NATO Secretary General Javier Solana gave the go-ahead to
air strikes which were defined as to coerce Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to sign the West-brokered Rambouillet deal.
</P>
<P>
Radio also reported that three school buildings were demolished
overnight but did not specify where these buildings were located.

ABH DHABI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO air strikes against
Serbian military targets are the only option left to end the

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Yugoslavia Says Two NATO Planes Downed on Second Day of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO airplanes and cruise
missiles continued bombing raids on military barracks, airports
and other military installations around Yugoslavia Thursday night
amid reports that two aircraft of the alliance were shot down.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of major casualties in Thursday night's
attacks, but the Tanjug news agency said a woman sustained
abdominal injuries in raids on the Montenegrin town of Danilovgrad
when one of the missiles hit the nearby village of Grlic.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug, quoting the Sremska Mitrovica Radio M station, said the
two NATO planes were downed by Yugoslav air defense over Mt.
Fruska Gora, but the origin of the country of the aircraft was not
identified.
</P>
<P>
Apprehension is running high in many civilian communities near
military installations following reports that some NATO missiles
went astray and exploded in civilian quarters.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said ethnic Albanian separatists stepped up their
attacks on Serb police following the NATO raids and one policeman
was slightly wounded in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, Thursday night was largely quiet except rumbling
explosions coming from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
As panic sets in, stores around the city are expected to face
the onslaught of more crowds Friday as residents try to stock
anything from staple foods to other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
There were no price hikes but many goods were vanishing from
the shop shelves.
</P>
<P>
Fewer cars will be seen on the streets as gas stations have
stopped providing fuel to civilian vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Talks Break Down In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Constitutional reform
talks between the government and the opposition National
Constitutional Assembly broke down on Wednesday in Harare after
the two sides clashed on procedures of the drafting of the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper reported Friday that secretary for legal
affairs of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic
Front) and Minister without Portfolio Eddison Zvobgo confirmed
that President Robert Mugabe would soon appoint a commission,
excluding the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
While the government had allayed the assembly's fears by
promising with a written undertaking that the provision of the
Commissions of Inquiries Act, which empowers the president to
interfere with the constitutional commission, would be set aside.
</P>
<P>
The Act authorizes the president to change a commission's terms
of reference, disband it, or set aside its findings.
</P>
<P>
The opposition insisted that the undertaking be made law.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly Morgan
Tsvangirai argued that progress on the issue could only be made if
a "broad-based conference" was convened to chart the way forward
in drafting the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
He added that as long as there were no legal guarantees on how
to proceed in drafting the new constitution, the constitutional
assembly would not participate in the commission.
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo, who did not mince his words said, "This is as far as
this government is prepared to go... those of you who wish to
participate or not participate on that basis are free to do so."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende, reiterated that the government would proceed to
appoint a commission without the input of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Emmerson
Mnangagwa told the Parliament that the government would move ahead
in drafting a new constitution.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Australians Protest Against NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Serbian Australians
protested Friday in Melbourne against NATO bombing in Yugoslavia,
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered in front of the United States Consulate
in Melbourne, the second biggest city in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The protest is not violent ... but some threw rubbish at the
consulate", ABC reported.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000-strong Serbian community in Australia are scheduled
to hold peaceful demonstration in central Sydney and in front of
the U.S. Consulate in Melbourne Sunday against the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Serbian Orthodox Church Community President Michael Zarich said
he expected up to 10,000 members of the community to turn out
Sunday at a demonstration in central Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"(The NATO attack) is shocking. Everybody is very, very
distressed and shocked. Justice is not being done," he told the
Australian Associated Press (AAP).
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of relatives back home. Most of the cities have
been bombed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything different to the Nazi Germany of 1941,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very upset this has happened. I have two or three hundred
relatives over there. Their water has been turned off, food
shortages are starting to occur and people are starting to panic,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Toma Banjanin, 72, who is a coordinator of the Serbian Cultural
Club in Melbourne, said it was a very sorrowful day and the
Serbian community was "out of its mind with grief".

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NATO Strikes Undermine Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces launched massive
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Wednesday despite strong
international calls for a political solution to the Kosovo
conflict. The move dealt a heavy blow to Russia's ties with the U.
S.-led Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the bombing, Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued
a statement strongly condemning the NATO actions as blatant
aggression against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia and flagrant
violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The move has also
undermined the basic documents governing the bilateral relations
between Russia and NATO, he added.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the possibility that Russia may take military
measures in response to the NATO move, Yeltsin decided to recall
Russia's military envoy to NATO and suspend Moscow's
implementation of the program for Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
Russia also halted its partnership cooperation with NATO and
postponed the talks on the establishment of a NATO military
liaison office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's strong-worded statement sent such a message to the
world: the NATO-Russian relations have suffered a serious setback
and the two sides are on the brink of a tense confrontation. The
immediate cancellation of Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's visit to the United States also indicated that the
Russian-U.S. relations are facing a new crisis. As NATO's military
intervention in Yugoslavia escalates, there are growing
possibilities of a further deterioration in Russia's relations
with the U.S. and NATO.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that, after the disintegration of the former
Soviet Union, Russian-U.S. relations had experienced a period of "
honey moon". However, since major differences between Yeltsin and
Clinton emerged over NATO's eastward expansion at the Budapest
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
conflicts between the two countries have been expanding and
deepening, which have become an unavoidable reality in their
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
These conflicts, with the issues of NATO's eastward enlargement
and Kosovo at the core, almost involve all issues in the current
international politics. NATO's admission of Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as new members and its military actions in
Yugoslavia in disregard of Russia's interests have turned the
issue into the core of relations between Russia and the U.S.-led
Western military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement between Russia on the one hand and NATO and the U.
S. on the other over the NATO eastward enlargement and Kosovo are
actually part of their struggles of containment and anti-
containment in Europe. The U.S.-led NATO enlargement is aimed at
reinforcing the U.S. leadership in Europe and eroding Russia's
influence on European security with the eastward expansion of the
war machine of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has always stuck to the policy of not yielding to
the West on the issues of sovereignty and national interests, and
is therefore regarded as an obstacle in the way of the NATO
enlargement. For this very reason, NATO defied the universally
accepted norms in international law to intervene in Yugoslavia's
internal affairs for the purpose of removing the thorn in its
flesh.
</P>
<P>
Russia, naturally, will not stand by with folded arms. While
repeatedly voicing objection to NATO's enlargement, backing
Yugoslavia represents a last chance for Russia to safeguard its
traditional interests in Europe and its dignity as a world power.
</P>
<P>
The rapid, strong-worded and united reaction from Russia's
political circle after the launch of the NATO bombings has fully
demonstrated Russia's tit-for-tat position on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the core of the issue is far from being limited to
European affairs. The U.S.-led NATO military actions against
Yugoslavia and its defiance of Russian stance indicated that the
alliance has turned a blind eye to the former superpower. The
move also ran counter to Russia's call for the establishment of a
multi-polar world with the United Nations playing a leading role
in global affairs.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, NATO's actions were certainly unacceptable to
Russia. As President Yeltsin put in his statement, Russia will not
tolerate NATO's playing as a world gendarme well into the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Stalagmites Shed Lights on Climate Changes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are reading
the book-page-like annual growth layers of stalagmites for
information on climate changes over the past 100,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"Since the growth of stalagmites has close connections with
temperature and rainfall, annual layers differ greatly in years of
floods or drought," said Dr. Tan Ming, a geologist with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"We are most concerned with the record of sudden change of
climate in the last several thousand years, and want to discover
the law of change and offer a scientific basis for forecasting
floods and drought in the future," Tan told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the latest issue of Science Bulletin, China's most
authoritative science journal, geologists with the Laboratory of
Speleology and Paleoclimatology of the Institute of Geology under
the CAS discussed their new study of the annual growth layers of
stalagmites.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ming, who directs the research, said they have studied
stalagmite samples from limestone caves in Benxi in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, Beijing, Nanjing in east China's
Jiangsu Province, and many other caves in east China.
</P>
<P>
The thickness of each stalagmite layer varies from one
millimeter to less than 0.01 millimeter in southern and northern
China, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
"So we must first determine what kind of 'book page' represents
one year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that light can pass through the micro-layers of
stalagmites, and when the stalagmite is irradiated with
ultraviolet rays, these micro-layers become luminous. But
sometimes the light-transmitting layers and luminous layers do not
coincide.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to determine which kind of layer is the
annual growth layer by using radioisotope dating measurement," Tan
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the thickness of the growth layers of different samples
from the same cave should show the same trend in their changes,
and by comparing these samples, geologists may overcome the
interference from false annual growth layers and loss of annual
layers, which are like "noises" affecting accurate dating.

<TEXT>
<P>
Geologists say that during the growth of stalagmites, they
recorded climate information including rainfall, vegetation growth,
and soil conditions. After determining the annual layers,
geologists can then count the layers and obtain information about
climatic changes over the past several thousand years through the
use of precision instruments.
</P>
<P>
"We can make a climate and environmental chronology, through
which we can know whether the rains of a certain time came from
the ocean or the hinterland, and whether the vegetation was forest
or grass, as well as other environmental changes both natural and
man-made," said Tan.
</P>
<P>
Geologists say stalagmites, tree rings, ice cores, and coral
reefs can all give indications of climatic and environmental
changes, and these indicators are known as "natural clocks".
</P>
<P>
Research on tree rings, ice cores and coral reefs has been
going on for many years, but the study on stalagmites as a "
natural clock" has just begun, according to Tan.
</P>
<P>
He said ice cores can only be found in polar regions and in
high and cold areas, coral reefs only in tropical oceans, and tree
ring samples dating back more than 1,000 years are very rare.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, stalagmites are found from coastal to inland
areas, from tropical to frigid zones, and can be dated back more
than 100,000 years, so this research is very promising, Tan added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Adds 1 Billion Dollars To Jakarta's Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on Thursday increased its loan assistance to Indonesia
by one billion dollars and approved release of the next 460
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The organization's executive board also approved the completion
of the fourth review of the Indonesian government's economic
program under the Extended Fund Facility, IMF first deputy
managing director Stanley Fischer announced.
</P>
<P>
"Including this release, total purchases by Indonesia since the
onset of the Asian crisis will amount to 9.3 billion dollars, with
a further 3 billion dollars available in the period to November
2000," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
The organization said in a statement that policy implementation
by the Indonesian government has continued to be satisfactory
since the last review was completed in December 1998, and major
macroeconomic targets under the program for 1998-99 have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Current monetary policy has served to stimulate the economy,
primarily through increasing spending. Also progress has been made
in bank restructuring, which is crucial to the eventual recovery
of the economy, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF said market sentiment in the country remains
fragile, partly reflecting political uncertainties and social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also emphasized that considerable risks still lie ahead
for the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
He expected that an upturn in economic activities could
commence in the second half of this year through the
implementation of key structural reforms, further consolidation of
macroeconomic stability, and additional overseas financial aid
that has been committed by the international community.

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite being sharply split
along party lines, the House Thursday ratified a Republican "
budget for the new millennium", a blueprint designed to showcase
support for Social Security, defense and a new round of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
After a full day of debate centering on priorities for the
budget surpluses forecast for the next several years, the vote on
passage was 221-208. All but two Republicans voted for the plan,
with only four Democrats supporting it.
</P>
<P>
Democrats believe the Republican-backed tax cuts will favor the
wealthy at the expense of the long-term health of Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The vote marked a triumph for the new speaker, Republican
Dennis Hastert, who had made passage of the plan the top priority
in his early months as leader of the slender Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, President Bill Clinton issued a statement
describing the measure as a "series of missed opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The tax and spending plan does not "do enough to pay down the
debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Capitol, Senate Republicans were driving toward passing
a similar budget for the 2000 fiscal year beginning on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which sets guidelines for tax and spending bills
later in the year, will be the first to be written by Congress
since the government entered a new era of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
While House and Senate plans differ in detail, they have common
priorities and serve as the focus for a fierce partisan debate
over Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the plans presented for debate provide specific
changes in Medicare or Social Security. Instead, they earmark
hundreds of billions of newly available surplus funds for debt
reduction, a step designed to strengthen the economy and make it
easier for the government to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
The House plan calls for 1.74 trillion dollars in spending for
the fiscal year of 2000 and forecast a surplus of 141 billion
dollars. The Senate proposal would spend 1.74 trillion dollars and
produce a 135 billion-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
Republicans would cut taxes by up to 15 billion dollars next
year and by 778 billion dollars over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, President Clinton's budget, submitted to Congress
earlier in the year, called for spending of 1.79 trillion dollars
and would leave an 80 billion-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for tax cuts totaling 81 billion dollars through
2009, but he recommended increasing tobacco and other taxes by 178
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, Clinton would spend 281 billion dollars next
year for defense, compared with 289 billion dollars by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and
job training, exceeding the House total by 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress,
so much so that the House buried it, 426-2. The Senate rejected it
Wednesday night.

<P>
The government is also extending 30-year land grants to
growers, which are extendable with land lease free of charge.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9.1 million hectares of cultivable lands have been
reclaimed, leaving 8.9 million hectares unreclaimed.

past few years, falling from 19 million tons in 1995-96 to 17.66
million tons in 1996-97 and again to 17.3 million tons in 1997-98.
In the meantime, rice export dropped from 354,000 tons to 93,100
tons and then to 28,300 tons correspondingly.

<P>
On the other hand, the country's population is estimated to
have reached 46.4 million in 1997-98, growing by 1.84 percent
annually.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Market Prices Set For Further Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua)-- Market price indexes will further
decline slightly in the first quarter due to stagnant domestic
demand, high stockpiles, and a weak international market abroad,
the China Securities News said today.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and consumer price index dropped in the
first quarter by 2.6 percent and 1 percent on a year-on-year basis
respectively, the newspaper, quoting a report from the State
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's retail price index and consumer price index
decreased by 2.6 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report estimates that China will have a
retail sales volume of about 769 billion yuan during the first
quarter, up 7.8 percent over the same quarter last year, and a
rate higher than the annual growth rate of retail sales volume,
which stands at 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the government demanded that all local
governments pay retirement benefits to retired workers in a timely
manner, and provide subsidies for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, commercial banks have been offering
credit for cars, houses and durable goods purchases, which, the
report says, will help activate the market.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Turns Shells into Lucrative Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai scientists have developed
means to turn shrimp and crab shells into lucrative products,
Friday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The shells, currently discarded as waste, contain a substance
which has a wide range of beneficial applications ranging from
skin-care products such as soap and cosmetics to industrial uses
in the production of fungicide, fertilizer and recycled paper, as
well as treatment of waste-water from seafood factories.
</P>
<P>
The substance is best known in Thailand as an ingredient in
weight-loss tablets because of its ability to absorb cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
But its full potential has not been realized, according to the
National Metal and Materials Technology Center, which aims to
encourage Thai industries to use the extract in making medical and
agricultural products for export.
</P>
<P>
Associate Professor Suwalee Chandrkrachang, a marine
biotechnologist at the Asian Institute of Technology, said Thai
manufacturers would need to focus on exports while trying to
develop the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A few Thai companies were already using the substance in
anti-bacterial facial soap and cosmetics shipped to other
countries and regions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The products could not be sold directly on the local market
because Thais tended to prefer imported items, Suwalee said. To
overcome the problem, some products were exported for repackaging
and certification as meeting overseas quality standards before
being shipped back to Thailand for sale.
</P>
<P>
Scientists were looking at how the private and state sectors
could cooperate in promoting industrial uses of the extract.
</P>
<P>
S.K. Kim, founder of the Bangkok-based Health Development
Foundation, said the extract had huge potential as a fertilizer
ingredient that would increase agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Thailand could become a major low-cost producer of shrimp and
crab shell products because it could rely entirely on shells
discarded by the local seafood industry, Suwalee said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Diplomacy to End Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said on Thursday that following the first wave of NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia on Wednesday, it was time for diplomacy
to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the European Union summit in Berlin, D'Alema said
the bombings had an "important" effect because they provided an
opportunity for dialogue, which should now be exploited.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time has come for politics and diplomacy to return
to the fore and we want to work to make this happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's call, the first crack to appear in the European
consensus for its action, reflects reservations about the attacks
in the Italian parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The military action produced important results," he continued,
"it weakened Serbia's military potential and it appears to have
induced the Serbs to suspend their offensive against the civilian
population of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
His comments appeared to contradict what NATO's supreme
commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, said at a press
conference in Brussels on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general said the Serbian forces were continuing their
offensive in Kosovo and, as a result, the NATO action would carry
on.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema added his appreciation of Russia's move to meet with
the Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia as soon as the bombing
ended.
</P>
<P>
Russia has demonstrated that it does not intend to jeopardize
its relationship with the West or to duck its responsibilities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Also in Berlin, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said it
was important to establish how long the first wave of attacks
would last and their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Then we and other Contact Group countries can put our heads
together to decide how long they will last and then get back to
the diplomatic initiative mentioned by D'Alema."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO reassured Italy Thursday that it would suffer
no Serbian military reprisal in the wake of the air attacks
launched by the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
"I can guarantee the Italian public that nothing will happen to
Italy from a military point of view," NATO Director General Javier
Solana said in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Solana warned however that there was a real risk of a tide of
refugees hitting Italy as thousands fled the fighting and bombing
in the Kosovo war zone.
</P>
<P>
"We can guarantee protection against attacks on Italy from the
air," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO's warplanes based in Italy took part in the air
strike against Yugoslavia Wednesday night, and now all NATO's
bases in north and central Italy are in a state of yellow alert,
the second highest level.
</P>
<P>
Except for the closure of the airports in the Italian southern
cities of Bari and Brindisi, NATO's military operation in Kosovo
has had little effect on civilian flights within, to and from
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Condemns NATO Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry today
condemned NATO's air attacks against Yugoslavia as "a brutal act."
</P>
<P>
It said the air strikes against Yugoslavia by NATO troops with
the U.S. at the lead are a barbarous act, and the bombing of a
sovereign state without the authorization of the United Nations
has seriously violated the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military operations, which started Wednesday night,
are "ridiculous" and run against the basic principles of
international law.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that "the war ... naturally aroused people's
fears of a unipolar world ruled by a bellicose country".
</P>
<P>
Cuba expressed deep concern about the situation in Yugoslavia
and about the spreading of the conflict to other nations in the
region

<HEADLINE> China to Put Fifth Largest Lake Under Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province is
preparing to set up a state-level nature reserve in the basin of
Chaohu Lake, the country's fifth largest freshwater lake.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, intended mainly to protect the habitat of rare
birds, will cover a total area of about 1,000 square kilometers,
including the 760-square-kilometer lake and part of the five
surrounding cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu Lake is on a major migrating route between Australia and
China for many wading birds and a wintering place for some 200
species of migratory birds, of which 63 are under the protection
of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in recent years, the lake has been threatened by
increasing discharges of pollutants and the dwindling of wetlands,
and local experts have called for its immediate protection.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuiyuan, a senior engineer in charge of the overall
planning of the project, said the reserve will focus on the
protection and study of migratory and wintering birds.
</P>
<P>
The reserve will also make efforts to raise and breed
endangered birds through artificial methods.

<HEADLINE> Chinese TV Manufacturer Fighting EU Dumping Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Xiahua Electronics Co. Ltd.,
one of China's leading color television manufacturers, has sent
senior management personnel to EU Headquarters in Brussels to
prepare to answer to dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Province company is the first Chinese company to
take legal action against dumping charges by the European Union,
which started accusing China of it in 1988 and used taxes to block
Chinese access to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission decided to further increase tariffs on
Chinese color TVs by 44.6 percent as an anti-dumping measure in
October 1998, causing serious losses for Xiahua, according to Guo
Zeli, general manager of the company. It sold 300,000 TVs to the
EU every year prior to 1993, but couldn't increase sales because
of the dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
Not allowing Chinese TV manufacturers to enter the EU market
simply because they sell their products at lower prices is
unreasonable, he says, explaining that Chinese TVs are priced
lower because the country has a complete component supply system
and cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
"Our prices are reasonable, and as a commercial entity, we have
to consider our profit and would never sell them below their real
cost," he adds, pointing to the fact that Chinese TVs exported to
the EU are priced higher than those going to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"All we want is justice," Guo concludes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Peace Council, gathered
in Vietnam's capital city of Hanoi for its Asia-Pacific Conference
and Executive Board Meeting, Thursday called for the immediate
cessation of bombing by NATO of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A resolution released here by the World Peace Council said it
repudiates the use of force with the attendant destruction and
suffering, or the threat of force as an alternative to
negotiations based upon the sacred principles of respect for
independence, sovereignty and the right of self-determination of
all nations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that NATO takes action without a
decision of the United Nations, the resolution said, adding that
it is the implementation of the new "Strategic Concept" of NATO,
creating an extremely dangerous precedent in international
relations.
</P>
<P>
The World Peace Council insists on the resumption of political
negotiations leading to a just and peaceful solution taking into
account the concerns of ethnic minorities of Kosovo and further.
</P>
<P>
The World Peace Council urged all organizations throughout the
world to mobilize and raise their voices in protest against the
gross violation of international law and norms by the NATO
bombing.

<P>
WARSAW, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Some Polish parliament members on
Thursday criticized NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia and urged
the Polish government not to join the operations.
</P>
<P>
A group of seven right-wing parliament members said in a
statement that "NATO has set a dangerous precedent by conducting
military intervention in a sovereign country, which has not posed
a threat to any NATO member. NATO should not become a world
gendarme."
</P>
<P>
"Poland should not participate in NATO's anabasis (to Kosovo),
for it is a war neither for Poland nor for its ally", said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Maliusz Olszewski, secretary of the 7-member group, said
Thursday the fighting in the Balkan region had proved their right
positions against Poland's joining of NATO.

<HEADLINE> Trial IP Phone Service Set for Authorization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for operating an
Internet Protocol (IP) phone service on a trial basis are in full
swing in China, as the information industry watchdog promised a
permit-issue system would be implemented if the trial goes
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Ministry of the information Industry (
MIT) announced that it had selected three telecom operators to
provide pilot IP services as the first step towards standardizing
this fledgling, but controversial, business.
</P>
<P>
However, "the ministry has not yet issued a notice to formally
implement a plan that allows China Telecom, China Unicom and China
Jitong Telecommunications Co. to operate pilot IP services for six
months," Xu Mutu, director of market administration at the
ministry's Telecom Bureau, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The notice will be soon delivered to the companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
In January, a court ruled in favor of two business people
running private IP services in Fuzhou in southeast China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
In response to the ruling, Xu said the ministry would ban any "
illegal establishment of an international telephone service on the
Internet." It was still setting up and improving facilities for
the new business, and studying how to run it, he added.
</P>
<P>
MII has had to take into consideration the financial settlement
between the Chinese and foreign companies involved, and the
provision of the hardware needed to operate an IP phone system, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
IP calls can be made via conventional telephone when the time
is ripe, he said.
</P>
<P>
A strict permit-issue system will be instituted after any
problems emerging in the trial period have been resolved, and
relevant standards formulated, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three pilot companies will be charged a fixed rate during
the trial period, according to Yi Difei, another MII official.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Willing to Mediate NATO-Belgrade Talks If Bombing Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov condemned NATO's massive air strikes against Yugoslavia
on Thursday, but said Moscow would be willing to mediate talks
between NATO and Belgrade if the bombardment stops.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, in an interview with an independent television
station, said that Russia is ready to mediate negotiations between
NATO and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but the
precondition is the immediate cessation of NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that NATO's airstrikes should be halted
immediately so that the Kosovo issue could be settled through
political means.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a big mistake for the Western military alliance
to bomb a sovereign country because such action can only escalate
the situation in Yugoslavia rather than stabilize it.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military action not only constitutes an invasion of a
country but also damages the world structure established after
World War II and the credit and status of the United Nations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia is not militarily backward compared to any
country, but it "would not take military measures" against NATO's
military action in Yugoslavia because Russia does not want to
impair its economic relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The premier warned, however, that if the military action
continues, the NATO-Russia relationship would witness an
irreversible trend.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Russian State Duma (the lower house of
the parliament) will not ratify the SALT II treaty on the
limitation of strategic offensive arms as a result of NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Primakov talked with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, during which Primakov reiterated his call for an
immediate cessation of the NATO military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's press secretary Tatyana Aristarkhova quoted Primakov
as saying the NATO bombardment would make the political settlement
of the Kosovo issue more difficult.
</P>
<P>
According to Aristarkhova, Blair justified NATO's air strikes
and said he hoped NATO's military action would not have a negative
impact on Russia's relations with the military bloc.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Urges Immediate Halt to NATO Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov called NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia a sheer
aggression, saying it is a top priority for Russia to put an
immediate halt to the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told a press conference that shortly after its
enlargement, the military alliance unveiled its "aggressive nature
" by resorting to force against a sovereign state in Europe, for
the reason of neither self-defense nor anti-aggression.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since World War Two an act of aggression
against a sovereign state took place in Europe," Ivanov noted.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever reasons U.S. strategists offer to justify their
actions, their true aims are clear -- to impose the political,
military and economic dictatorship of the United States, to
establish a kind of unipolar world in which the destinies of
peoples would be decided in Washington," Ivanov said, voicing
regrets over the participation of the alliance's European members.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the military attacks against Yugoslavia had
unveiled the true nature of the Western alliance. "We are being
told that NATO bombs Yugoslavia to defend democratic ideals and
uphold the creation of a united and stable Europe. What kind of
ideals and values need to be imposed by missiles and bombs?" he
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister vowed that Russia will not just stand
looking on, instead it will take all necessary measures to
safeguard the security and interests of the country and the peace
of Europe. But he noted that Russia doesn't intend to resort to
force.
</P>
<P>
He had suggested that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the
six-nation Contact Group be held immediately to discuss the Kosovo
problem.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference was Chief of General
Staff Anatoly Kvashnin, who said that the Yugoslav people will not
yield in the face of the air strikes as their army is a highly
professional one. Should NATO send ground troops to a country
with a complicated terrain unfavorable to aggressors, they would
surely be encountered with a strong and tenacious resistance.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Reiterates Rejection of Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Brazil expressed its commitment
to reject a possible "dollarization " of its currency to overcome
the country's current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said on Thursday the
proposal made by Argentine President Carlos Menem to eliminate
national money in all of South America and adopt the dollar
wouldn't be appropriate for Brazil or for Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is a union formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay, with Chile and Bolivia serving as associates.
</P>
<P>
According to Malan, the possibility of "dolllarization" is
contrary to the plans of these countries to adopt a unique
currency of their own in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mercosur's currency must define itself in relation
to the dollar and the euro, but not be either the US currency nor
the EU's.
</P>
<P>
Talking about a recession and unemployment in the coming months
in Brazil, the finance minister said the crisis will be transitory,
emphasizing the importance of the Real Plan for the stabilization
of Brazil's economy. That plan was promoted in 1994 by the then
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is currently
serving as the Brazilian president.
</P>
<P>
Before the plan, according to the minister, Brazil was seen "as
a country drugged and drunken by inflation." And now, in spite of
its difficulties, it maintains a prominent place in a globalized
world.

<HEADLINE> Maritime Disaster Prevention Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China should strengthen
construction of its monitoring,forecasting and prevention system
to reduce economic losses from maritime disasters, said a top
marine official.
</P>
<P>
Song Xuejia, deputy director of the National Marine
Environmental Forecasting Center, was quoted by today's China
Daily as saying that China's coastal areas have suffered economic
losses of 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) a year in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the main reasons for this include that many
coastal storm defenses are not up to standard, and there are too
few large defenses with the ability to withstand a 1-in-50-year
tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of resources and economic development in
coastal areas were often carried out in an unplanned manner, based
solely on monetary returns, and ignoring the local ecology, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments in coastal areas to improve
management and allocate special funds to construct and renovate
dams to resist tidal waves. And an effective emergency-handling
system should be set up before a tidal wave hits the coast.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, Chinese government has arranged for the
construction of 12,000 kilometers of tidal protection dams and
defenses along the coasts, effectively protecting important
coastal cities, and industrial and energy bases.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Braces for Second Night of NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Wailing sirens at 19:25 (18:25
GMT) heralded the second night of NATO bombings in Belgrade
Thursday. Residents of the Yugoslav capital turned off their
lights or pulled down window shades in compliance with a blackout
ordered by the government.
</P>
<P>
Only one neon sign and several signal lights atop water towers
could be seen blinking from the balcony of a townhouse where
Xinhua correspondent resided.
</P>
<P>
Despite the blackout, visibility remained good; numerous stars
shined brightly alongside a crescent moon in the clear night sky.
</P>
<P>
After the sounds of a few distant explosions died away,
Belgrade sank into a deadly silence. On a few occasions, one or
two cars would shoot along the deserted streets.
</P>
<P>
Night came after a day of calm amid rising apprehensions among
the city's one million residents.
</P>
<P>
There were no long queues of cars at gas stations. The
government has ordered filling stations to stop dispensing
petroleum to civilian vehicles. Foreign residents, who used to
enjoy special treatment, are also barred from purchasing gas.
</P>
<P>
During the day, grocery stores were crowded with customers
stocking up on everything from cooking oil to packaged milk.
</P>
<P>
Bread, which becomes stale after a short period of time, was
disappearing rapidly from the shelves. People freeze the loaves in
refrigerators in preparation for possible food shortages and power
cuts.
</P>
<P>
Many stores were closed and business was light for the few that
remained open.
</P>
<P>
Tania, 26, runs a hairdressing salon in downtown Slavia Plaza.
She served two customers Wednesday but none on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A nearby food stall, where 38-year-old Zhao sells Chinese
snacks, fared better. Within 10 minutes, many Yugoslavians had
bought all her food, ranging from stir-fried rice to steamed buns.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid (of bombings). I only miss my son in China,"
she said. "He turned four years and five months yesterday."
</P>
<P>
But she won't be able to make a trip to China any time soon.
All international flights have been canceled following the
commencement Wednesday night of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization bombings.
</P>
<P>
For Svetlana, an employee with the Tanjug news agency's
technical department, her son was much nearer, only 30 minutes by
car from her office in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The boy and his grandmother, however, were only one kilometer
away from the Batajnica Military Airport, which was bombarded for
the second time at 09:15 (08:15 GMT). It was the first target hit
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Svetlana tried in vain to call her mother.
</P>
<P>
For Djuracin Zivjin, a World War II veteran in his seventies,
the attacks aroused more outrage than worry.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are even worse than Hitler. When Hitler did
terrible things, he took it as terrible things. But the Americans
are committing the most inhumane atrocities under the guise of
protecting human rights and democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They must be stopped. If nobody intervenes, even Russia and
China may fall victim one day."

BUDAPEST, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government insists
on a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis and demands an
immediate halt to air strikes by NATO against Yugoslavia,
Yugoslav ambassador to Hungary Balsa Spadijer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spadijer told reporters that The air strikes against Yugoslavia
are the first aggression NATO has ever unleashed against a
sovereign and independent country since its establishment in 1949,
which not only violates the U.N. Charter and relevant principles
of international law, but also goes against its own Charter.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Charter does not allow any military action outside the
territories of its member states.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that the NATO's military action
against Yugoslavia shows it puts the U.N. in second place and has
replaced the role of the U.N. Security Council, which under the U.
N. Charter has primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace
and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the Yugoslav people will "unswervingly" fight for
the interests and security of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia beginning from March 24 have already killed 10
people and injured more than 60, said Spadijer.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the air strikes are mainly military, police and
public installations.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also expressed regrets over Hungary's support
for NATO's military action against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China Looks At Developing Uninhabited Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Zhejiang Province is
considering developing thousands of uninhabited islands in the
East China Sea and its Ocean Administration Bureau has just
completed a study on them.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has more than 3,000 islands, with a combined area of 1,
700 sq. km More than 94 percent of them have no inhabitants but
they are not without advantages because some border on fishing
grounds, some are close to international sea-routes, and others
have scenic beauty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some plans have been made to turn several
islands close to the mainland into tourist resorts and a number of
infrastructure projects are being built on "Lovers Island", "Peach
Blossom Island," and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has listed the marine economy as a
major development target for the next 5 years, with focus on ocean
shipping, deep-sea fishing, aquatic breeding, maritime tourism,
and oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's maritime output grew at an average annual rate of 30
percent before 1996 and in 1997 was worth 33 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> India Announces Visa Relaxation to Prominent Pakistanis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indian High Commission to
Pakistan Thursday announced here that the Indian government has
decided to ease visa and travel restrictions to some prominent
Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
The visa relaxation will be adopted from April 12, 1999 in
eight categories including, among others, parliamentarians, judges
of the higher courts, editors of newspapers and members of
national cricket and hockey teams.
</P>
<P>
Visa-holders in these categories will be exempt from police
reporting and from the restrictions of city-specific visas.
</P>
<P>
They will be entitled to multiple entry visas of up to one year
duration and travel anywhere in India except certain specified
areas for which prior permission will be required.
</P>
<P>
A news release of the Indian High Commission said the decision
is "consistent with its policy to promote contacts between the
people of India and Pakistan at all levels" and "in keeping with
the understandings reached with Pakistan" during the visit of
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Pakistan on February
20-21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The visa relaxation was also in the light of the agreement
reached in the meeting between Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh and Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz in Sri
Lanka at the sidelines of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation foreign ministers meeting on March 19, 1999, said the
news release.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission said that provisions are also being
made for the visits of Pakistani tourist groups to India and will
be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
"These visits would be organized by registered tour operators
in India and tourists would not have to report to police
personally at each destination," said the news release.

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Retains Men's Title at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Alexei Yagudin displayed
an amazingly cool performance under pressure to retain his world
men's title on a night of spectacular jumping on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old executed a perfect quadruple toe loop and eight
equally fine triple jumps to beat younger compatriot Evgeny
Plushenko into second.
</P>
<P>
It was the second world title for Yagudin to go with the second
successive European crown he won in January.
</P>
<P>
Plushenko, 16, overcame a sloppy start to complete eight
triples, but had to settle for the second place after he two-
footed his attempted quad and touched one hand down in his bid for
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Weiss battled up one position to take the
bronze medal for third, though a quad first thought to be fine was
later declared flawed because he touched down his trailing foot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France set up
an exciting finale to the ice dance event by edging out
titleholders Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov in the original
dance.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA ruled on Thursday to call off a Euro 2000 qualifying match
between Scotland and Bosnia which was previously scheduled for
Glasgow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said that Bosnia had closed its airspace to all civil
flights because of the political situation in the Balkans and the
Bosnian squad, who were due to fly to Glasgow on Friday, could not
leave.
</P>
<P>
UEFA have provisionally rescheduled the group nine match for
August 18 but a Scottish Football Association (SFA) spokesman said
there would be further discussions.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few dates available because of the fixture list.
It's so busy and we will need to decide with UEFA and Bosnia which
other date is feasible," said Andy Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth match to be called off as a result of NATO
air strikes on Serbia. The others are Yugoslavia vs Croatia in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia vs Macedonia and Macedonia vs Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the Scots sympathized with Bosnia. "They are just
as disappointed as we are.
</P>
<P>
"They have been making concerted efforts through their
president to come to some accommodation with NATO to allow the
flight to take off from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wanted the game to be played," added the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Korda Loses Latest Round in Doping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Czech tennis player Petr Korda
lost the latest round in his long-running doping case on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal in London ruled today that the
International Tennis Federation (ITF) could appeal to the Court of
Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
The unanimous decision was the latest in a lengthy legal
struggle between the two sides and overturned an earlier ruling by
the High Court in favor of the Czech.
</P>
<P>
Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion, was tested at
Wimbledon in July 1998 after a quarter-final defeat and found to
have traces of Nandrolone metabolites in his urine.
</P>
<P>
An ITF Independent Appeals Panel ruled in December 1998 that
Korda had committed a doping offence and his Wimbledon prize money
and ranking points should be forfeited.
</P>
<P>
But the panel later decided there were exceptional
circumstances where the player did not know he had taken, or been
given, the banned substance and waived the one-year ban laid down
by ITF rules.
</P>
<P>
The ITF then appealed to the Swiss Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS), prompting Korda to appeal to the High Court which
ruled the ITF could not lodge a suit with CAS.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling overturned Korda's High Court victory and
gave the ITF the green light to appeal to the arbitration court.
</P>
<P>
"We have always maintained that the Court of Arbitration for
Sport is the appropriate forum to resolve this case," said ITF
president Brian Tobin.
</P>
<P>
"The ITF believes that the Independent Appeals Panel mis-
applied the tennis anti-doping rules when reaching its initial
decision," he said.

spending to be kept within a strict limit of 210 billion euros
(229 billion U.S. dollars) through 2006 although Spain wants at
least 219 billion euros (238 billion dollars) for regional aid
during the period 2000 to 2006. However, France is pressing for a
lower limit of 200 billion euros (218 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Spending on aid for poorer members, known as cohesion fund in
EU jargon, would be limited to 15 billion euros (16.35 billion
dollars), Germany suggested. But Spain has asked for the level of
21 billion euros (22.9 billion dollars). Currently, the relatively
poorer countries among EU members are Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ceiling on farm spending would be set at 40.5
billion euros (44.1 billion dollars) annually. But the German
proposals sidestepped the thorny problem of how to achieve this
and merely requested governments "to pursue additional savings."
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes told reporters that "the
accord is not yet ripe" and that the bilateral talks among 15
members Thursday had not brought any progress.
</P>
<P>
Finland, Austria and a number of smaller EU states had swiftly
rejected the fund cuts in the German proposals which they said
would hurt their farmers. As a whole, the German recommendation is
not acceptable, said Finland's EU Ambassador Rijo Kemppinen.
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima would also oppose the plan,
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis has rejected any
reduction in regional aid and said that, if anything, Greece
needed more help as the least developed of all EU nations.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato said earlier that his
country was willing to make compromises but that he saw no
solution at present.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 2000 is a vital precondition for the EU to prepare
the bloc to take in up to 12 new member states from central and
eastern Europe early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Danish Prime Minister Paul Nyrup Rasmussen has hinted the
possible negative impact on the euro in financial markets if the
15 leaders failed to strik a deal. "Every argument points to
`let's make a deal in Berlin,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson also said he was "not
especially optimistic" that an accord could be hammered out. It
might be necessary to hold another EU summit in April, he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Deputy PM: I Think We Must Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Thursday seemed to have
offered to halt its military operations in Kosovo if NATO agreed
to stop bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Stop bombing us and we will stop all operations against the
people, the terrorists who provoked NATO strikes against Serbia,"
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic told Britain's Sky
television in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia used to say that the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"I think we must compromise," Draskovic said when asked if it
was time for diplomacy and compromise.
</P>
<P>
He said Serbia was not the only party to blame for the NATO
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Attacks by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army had
triggered Serbian military action and were therefore responsible
for the NATO strikes, Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to talk under the bombing," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Kosovo Albanians must also stop their
military actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Stop the bombing and all the military operations and we will
stop our operations, but the Albanians must also stop their
operations against our civilians," he said.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government decided
Thursday to cut diplomatic relations with Britain, France, Germany
and the United States following the NATO's airstrikes against the
Yugoslav defense targets.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a government session chaired by Prime
Minister Momir Bulatovic due to the crime they have perpetrated
against the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the
federal information secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
With their aggression on Yugoslavia using tremendous military
and lethal potentials, the governments of the U.S., Britain, and
France have humiliated and embarrassed a historic friendship and
alliance between the Yugoslav people and the peoples of the
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
It singled out the government of Germany as having reopened
unhealed wounds from World War Two by going along with this
aggression, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has decided to reconsider its diplomatic
and other relations with the rest of countries which have directly
or indirectly taken part in the airstrikes against Yugoslavia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government expresses its appreciation to the
governments and peoples of all friendly countries which have been
demonstrating friendship, support and solidarity with Yugoslavia,
its government and its people in the defense of its vital
interests from the NATO aggression, the statement said.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Senate Thursday
condemned the air attacks of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by the whole of the Mexican
Senate, the legislators said that the attacks have not only
violated international rights but also brought about tension which
puts world peace at risk.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also highlighted the Mexican legislators' worries
regarding the use of force above the peace negotiations and
regretted the failure of a dialog in the region of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The document, read by Senator Jorge Calderon, indicated that
the Mexican legislators are asking the U.N. Security Council to
apply immediate measures interrupting the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
They also requested measures to allow the parties in conflict
to find a peaceful solution with full respect for the human rights
of various ethnic groups and the territorial integrity of the
states.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Senate said that the destructive violation is
straying from a just solution to the Kosovo problem.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cautions Russia on Arms Embargo Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Thursday cautioned Russia not to lift the U.N. arms embargo
against Yugoslavia while his aides were busy repairing a major
rift with Moscow over NATO's bombing of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be a terrible mistake," Clinton told
reporters in the White House Oval Office as he met with his
foreign policy team on the bombing of the defiant nation and the
potential fallout.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, having failed to persuade
Clinton not to go through with the assault on Yugoslavia,
suspended Russian cooperation with NATO Wednesday and recalled his
chief military representative to the alliance in protest.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov hinted that his government
may try to break the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Serbs "have quite a lot of arms on their own.
They made a lot of arms in the former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of lifting any of the arms embargo on
Serbia. I think that would be a terrible mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is checking reports the Russians
were already providing Belgrade with weapons to resist the NATO
cruise missile and bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said that if Russia lifts arms embargo,
the United States will probably take up the issue at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Facing the drastic cooling down of relationship with Russia,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged that "Russia
does not agree with our decision to launch military strikes."
</P>
<P>
But she said in a conciliatory tone that Russian leaders
deserve credit for the efforts they made to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"We are and will remain in close touch," Albright said. "Both
sides recognize the importance of our relationship and the need to
continue to work together on many shared concerns."

<HEADLINE> Chile Asks for Halt to Bombings in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chile Thursday expressed its
worry about the crisis in Kosovo and asked for "an immediate
interruption in the bombings over Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
In an official communique published Thursday afternoon by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chile's government said that "the
events that happened in the last hours in the Republic of
Yugoslavia have deeply worried Chile's government."
</P>
<P>
The document indicated that Chile's government "regrets that
the lack of an agreement between the involved parties in this
conflict has made the international efforts unfolded for a
solution fail." It also deplored that the authorization of the
U.N. Security Council -- a level responsible for international
peace and security -- was left out, for the use of force in the
Balkan region was overlooked."
</P>
<P>
In this sense, added the document, Chile expresses its worry
regarding the decision to utilize force as a means of solution to
the crisis in Kosovo and emphasizes the urgent necessity of
fulfilling Resolution 1160 (1988) of the Security Council about
this conflict."
</P>
<P>
Chile's government, "respectful of the principle of a peaceful
solution to the controversies, requests an immediate interruption
of the bombings over Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, "it makes a calling to the authorities of
that country and the Albanian leaders of Kosovo to reinitiate as
soon as possible the dialog helping the quick reestablishment of
the parties involved and the legitimate rights of the ethnic
minorities," said the communique in conclusion.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav embassy in London
said Thursday its staff would be leaving as soon as possible after
Belgrade decided to cut diplomatic ties with Britain and other
countries over NATO military attacks.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm diplomatic relations have been ended. Our
diplomats will be leaving as soon as possible," the BBC quoted a
spokesman from the Yugoslav embassy in London as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain said earlier that it had not received any official
notification that Yugoslavia had broken off diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said they were "aware of the report"
and were checking it.
</P>
<P>
But there had been no official word from Yugoslav authorities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain closed its embassy in Belgrade and pulled back all the
staff earlier this week, ahead of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A statement read out earlier Thursday in Belgrade on Serbian
state television said Yugoslavia had decided to break off
diplomatic relations with Britain, the United States, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as NATO warplanes took off for a second
night of strikes against Yugoslav military targets to force
Belgrade to accept the West-initiated peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government decided at today's session... to break
off diplomatic relations with the governments of the United
States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
With their attacks on Yugoslavia, these governments had
"humiliated and embarrassed" a historic friendship and alliance
between the Yugoslav people and the people of the four countries
concerned, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the Yugoslav government had decided to reassess its
diplomatic relations with other countries that had directly or

<HEADLINE> NATO Forces Launch 2nd Day of Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) forces have launched a second day of
airstrikes over Yugoslavia and "they are ongoing as we speak,"
U.S. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It will be another substantive strike. It will be severe. We
are satisfied with the results of yesterday's strikes," Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were focusing on Serb air defense assets and the
forces arrayed against the ethnic Albanian minority in the Kosovo
province of Yugoslavia, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Ships in the Adriatic Sea launched cruise missiles at targets
in Yugoslavia, and NATO war planes were headed for targets as part
of the second day of strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly intend to continue this operation," said Sandy
Berger, the U.S. national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the White House, Berger said the Serb offensive
"has increased somewhat" and includes some shelling by Serb forces
into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some further burnings of (Kosovo) villages,
further sweep operations, some shelling into Albania," Berger
said. "I would not speculate as to what (Milosevic's) intent is."
There is no indication that Milosevic has changed his position.
</P>
<P>
"There will be more to follow, unless Milosevic chooses peace,"
Defense Secretary William Cohen told Associated Press Radio in an
interview. "This is going to be a long effort."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that
although "diplomatic channels remain open," there is no indication
that Milosevic has changed his position.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Corporate Finance Officers See Profit Rise in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Even as investors fret about
corporate profits, a surprisingly large majority of U.S.
corporate financial executives expect their companies' earnings to
grow substantially this year, according to a new survey published
in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 371 chief financial officers showed that 68 percent
predict earnings in 1999 will surpass last year's level -- by an
average of 15 percent. In a similar survey conducted just three
months ago, 58 percent predicted earnings growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, companies with annual sales of less than 100
million dollars predicted greater gains than did the biggest
companies.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted last week by Duke and the Financial
Executives Institute, a professional organization of chief
financial officers, treasurers and controllers at 8,000 U.S. and
Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profitability is considered a major factor in U.S.
economic health these days, because rising profits push up stock
prices, which in turn help give consumers and businesses the
confidence to spend freely. That spending boosts profits further,
extending the good times.
</P>
<P>
Even the CFOs in the survey complained of rising costs and a
tough pricing environment. The executives expect to be able to
raise prices by just 0.8 percent this year, evidence of how much
competition there is among U.S. and foreign producers. Yet the
finance officers also see wage costs rising 4.2 percent and
health-care costs 6.6 percent, as their companies increase
employment by 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite that squeeze, however, there may be good reason for the
CFOs' optimism. Economists suggest that the executives may sense a
recovery of their export markets in Asia, and expect to streamline
their operations through investments in new technology that make
each worker more efficient.

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday a loan of 35 million U.S. dollars to support a Health
Sector Reform Project aiming to increase the efficiency, quality,
and long-term financial sustainability of health services in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The project will reap such benefits as increased hospital
occupancy rates, upgraded hospital infrastructure, and a reduction
in spending on pharmaceuticals as a share of total expenditures,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the first phase of the Jordanian
government's health reform program will be supported through this
project and will focus on three key areas: containing growth in
health expenditures; assuring the efficient utilization of
physical facilities; and improving the delivery and quality of
health care services.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the project are 48.9 million dollars. Aside
from the World Bank's loan, the government of Jordan will also
provide 13.9 million dollars.

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Delegates participating the
first-ever International Policy Conference on Children and
Tobacco, agreed last Friday to work both internationally and at
home to reduce tobacco use and exposure among youth, says a press
release issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Law makers, health ministers and other politicians from 30
countries,including China, India, Russia, France, Egypt, Brazil
and Australia that represent about 75 percent of the world
population, took part in the conference.
</P>
<P>
In her opening address to the participants, Dr. Gro Brundtland,
director general of the World Health Organization, urged them to
"legislate and educate" so as to reduce smoking among kids.
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco epidemic is a communicated disease", she said, "It
is communicated through advertising, through the example of
smokers and through the smoke to which non-smokers-especially
children- are exposed. Our job is to immunize people against this
epidemic."
</P>
<P>
The participants of the two-day conference called on ending
tobacco advertising, promotion, sponsorship and other tobacco
marketing activities; Strengthen and enforce laws preventing the
sale of tobacco products to minors and place strong, prominent
health warning labels on all tobacco products; Hold the tobacco
industry accountable for past and future wrongdoing through
litigation and other actions; Raise the price of tobacco products
to discourage their use by children; and protect children from
second-hand smoke.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Milosevic Must Serve Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must "choose
peace" or NATO will continue its air campaign against Serb
targets.
</P>
<P>
"He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to
make war," Clinton told reporters as he met his senior foreign
policy aides for an update on the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
The key goals of the NATO strikes were to prevent a
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and a wider war in the Balkans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned that the American people still had
questions about the operation, Clinton said he believed many
Americans had not thought about the situation in Kosovo until the
last two days and believed a majority would ultimately support
him.
</P>
<P>
"I also believe very strongly that it is my responsibility to
make this judgment based on what I think is the long-term
interests of the American people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he believed airstrikes alone would be
sufficient to reach his goals, and NATO ground troops would not be
needed to protect the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can create a situation in which we have limited
their ability to make war and thereby increase the prospects that
they can protect themselves better," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, somber and weary-looking, met his senior foreign
policy aides at the White House for an update and to lay further
plans as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) prepared a
second wave of bomb and missile assaults on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly intend to continue this operation," said Sandy
Berger, the U.S. national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the Serb offensive "has increased somewhat" and
included some shelling by Serb forces into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some further burnings of (Kosovo) villages,
further sweep operations, some shelling into Albania," Berger
said. "I would not speculate as to what (Milosevic's) intent is."
There is no indication that Milosevic has changed his position.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that although
"diplomatic channels remain open," there was no indication that
Milosevic had changed his position.
</P>
<P>
"There will be more to follow, unless Milosevic chooses peace,"
Defense Secretary William Cohen told Associated Press Radio in an
interview. "This is going to be a long effort."
</P>
<P>
Following the White House meeting, U.S. Defense Department
spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced that NATO had launched a second
day of airstrikes over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It will be another substantive strike. It will be severe. We
are satisfied with the results of yesterday's strikes," Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were focusing on Serb air defense assets and the
forces arrayed against the ethnic Albanian minority in the Kosovo
province of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ships in the Adriatic Sea launched cruise missiles at targets
in Yugoslavia, and NATO war planes were headed for targets as part
of the second day of strikes, Bacon added.

<HEADLINE> Protests Against Bombing on Yugoslavia Keeps On in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of demonstrators gathered
near the Downing Street, where British Prime Minister Tony Blair's
office is located, on Thursday night to protest against NATO's
airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Bombing solves nothing," one of the placard among the
demonstrators read.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they were trying to "defense international
law and defense Yugoslavia".
</P>
<P>
The military attack now on Yugoslavia is no different than the
invasion to Poland by Hitler in 1939, one of the protesters said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing are "clearly a violation of international law and a
violation to the sovereignty of Yugoslavia," a woman protester
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesters said the bombing destroyed any hope of
peace and is no way of solving the problems in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing can achieve nothing, absolutely nothing," Dragisa
Simovic, a young man who said Serbs would never bend down to
pressure, said.
</P>
<P>
A four-year-old girl is trying to put up a placard seems too
heavy for her. Helped by her mother, the placard was finally held
up.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blair, Please stop bombing my grandma in Belgrade," the
placard read.
</P>
<P>
A policeman at the site said there were about "more than two
hundred people" attending the demonstration and the number "are
growing".
</P>
<P>
The demonstration has been on since NATO began to airstrike
Yugoslavia Wednesday night, one of the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
They would keep on the demonstration until the end of the
bombing, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Face Summit Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
continued their marathon talks late Thursday night as their
two-day special summit here faces a possible failure after German
budget proposals for the Agenda 2000 reform package ran into
strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
The EU reform package is being hotly debated despite two days
of intense talks at the Intercontinental Hotel in Berlin. "These
Agenda negotiations are very, very tough," German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fisher said earlier. "I do not dare to predict if we are
going to be successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Danish Prime Minister Paul Nyrup Rasmussen hinted the possible
negative impact on the euro in financial markets after the leaders
fail to strike a deal. "Every argument points to `let's make a
deal in Berlin,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
But Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson earlier told
reporters that he was "not especially optimistic" that an accord
could be hammered out at the summit which had been due to end
Thursday. Persson said it might be neccessary to hold another EU
summit in April.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes was also pessimistic.
"The accord is not yet ripe," he told reporters, adding that the
bilateral talks between EU members had not brought any progress.
</P>
<P>
However, France took a neutral position. "We want an agreement
tonight, but it has to be a good one that stabilizes expenditure,"
said French European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
Summit host German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder recommended a
compromised farm spending plan which would save between 4.1
billion and 6.8 billion euros (4.5-7.4 billion U.S. dollars) for
the period 2000-2006, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
But Finland, Austria and a number of smaller EU states had
rejected the cuts which they said would hurt their farmers. "As a
whole the recommendation is not acceptable," said Finland's EU
Ambassador Rijo Kemppinen.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato said his country was
willing to make compromises but that he saw no solution at
present. EU leaders need to agree to financial arrangements for
the bloc -- who pays what and who gets what -- for the coming
seven years. Current arrangements expire at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany wants a cut to its net annual 12 billion-U.S.-dollar EU
contribution while southern EU states want to maintain current
levels of development aid from Brussels-based EU headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 2000 is aimed to prepare the EU to take in up to 12
new member states from central and eastern Europe early next
century.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Asks for Stop to NATO Attacks on Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The member countries of the
Rio Group Thursday asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to end the air attacks on Serbia and to reinitiate peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Through a communique available to Xinhua, the Rio Group
expressed its preoccupation due to the start of air attacks
against Serbian military objectives on NATO's behalf.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the member countries of the Rio Group
regret that ways for a peaceful solution have not been found,
according to international law, to the dispute existing between
the different parties involved in the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group exhorts all the parties to reinitiate as soon as
possible talks tending to reach a complete and definite settlement
that manages to reestablish a firm and lasting peace, based upon
respect for human rights of all the ethnic groups and minorities
in that region, as well as the territorial integrity of these
nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the Rio Group also regrets the use
of force in the Balkan region without observing that prepared in
the articles relevant to the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group emphasizes the need to maintain the U.N. Security
Council fully informed of the activities carried forth or intended
according to the regional agreements with the purpose of
maintaining international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group is composed by 14 Latin American countries
including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,
Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, and one
representative from Central America and one from the Caribbean
Community.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturers Fighting Back A Bit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic conditions for UK
manufacturers remain weak but are improving, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's latest industrial trends survey showed overall demand
for manufactured goods remains well down but is now at its highest
for seven months.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the 894 manufacturers surveyed said their order
books were below normal while just 13 percent reported orders
above normal.
</P>
<P>
This leaves a negative balance of minus 34 percent, compared to
minus 35 percent last month and minus 43 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that the UK economy is no
longer pointing to an absolute catastrophe for manufacturing. It's
now pointing to just a recession.
</P>
<P>
"There is a ray of hope as the downturn in manufacturing may be
less severe this year than manufacturers had earlier feared," said
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Urges to Stop Air Strike Against Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERN, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin urged again here Thursday afternoon to stop air strike
against Kosovo when he delivered a speech at the Federal Palace of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peaceful negotiation should be insisted to and
political solution be sought for the Kosovo issue, which will,
otherwise, only be made more complicated, and situation of the
Balkan region more turbulent.
</P>
<P>
"I have held from the very beginning that politicians of every
country should comply with the tendency of the times, live up to
the expectations of people in the world, and make efforts to
safeguard world peace," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fuss that took place outside of the palace by
some people in the afternoon and Swiss government didn't take
immediate measures to deal with it, which affected holding of the
welcoming ceremony, Jiang quoted Confucius as saying that "Is it a
happy thing to have friends come from afar?"
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that it is hard for people to understand what has
happened today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang also recalled the smooth development of
the Sino-Swiss relationship and the achievements China has scored
over the 20 years of reforms and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Dreifuss admitted that nobody could deny the drastic social,
economic, scientific and technological progress China has achieved
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
As for the bilateral relationship, Dreifuss said that it has
been built on the basis of friendship and mutual respect although
the two countries are very much different.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's robust start and

<P>
London's FTSE 100 made steady gains throughout the session, to
end up 1.14 percent at 6,085.0, a rise of almost 68 points.

<P>
The biggest gainer was nuclear generator British Energy (BGY).
The shares soared a massive 12 percent to end at 595 pence, after
a raft of analyst recommendations upgrades.

<P>
Investors are also anticipating a share buyback if a key deal
to buy a number of conventional UK power stations is blocked.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Serbian-Americans in Chicago
were deeply shocked and hurt by U.S.-led NATO bombing raids
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
William Rupich, a Serbian-American World War two veteran, stood
in a Serbian-American hall in Chicago and fought back tears as he
listened to U.S. President Bill Clinton's declaration of bombing
against Yugoslavia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It hurts" he said, unable to speak for a moment as his once
motherland became the enemy of the United States. "The Serbs are
only fighting for their own land."
</P>
<P>
Chicago has one of the largest centers of Serbian
immigration, and people there expressed their anger and shock
over U.S. bombings.
</P>
<P>
Michael Stankovich, a 74-year-old retired accountant who came
to the United States in 1959, said the United States had no
right to meddle in affairs halfway around the world.
</P>
<P>
"What if Ohio or Indiana revolted against the union?" he
asked, saying Serbian leaders were simply trying to keep order
in their land.
</P>
<P>
Maja Lausevic, 38, who came to Chicago from Yugoslavia just
four months ago, said bitterly that Clinton's action would harm
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo is the land that was sacred to our country," she
said.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- One fifth of adults in England
have severe problems with basic literacy and numeracy, according
to an official report issued on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Basic Skills Agency, urges the government to
introduce new national tests to assess adults' basic reading,
writing and arithmetic skills.
</P>
<P>
It reviews evidence that adults in England have poorer literacy
and numeracy skills than those in any other European country apart
from Poland and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The report was produced by a working group of experts in
education, employment and the community sector.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that it reflected decades of poor
schooling and past government policies."
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this are "devastating for society, for the
economy and above all for the individuals concerned," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends a national strategy to provide targeted
study schemes involving the government, employers and colleges.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Security Under Threat: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The national security of Zimbabwe
is being threatened by bogus human rights activists operating in
cahoots with the foreign media, State Security Minister Sydney
Sekeramayi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was unfortunate that some local media had
also joined in the campaign to tarnish the image of law
enforcement agencies and the government.
</P>
<P>
He said this in a speech at a police pass-out parade in the
capital Harare, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the security and defense forces
should be fully aware of the hostile mechanisms perpetrated by
protagonists who flee the country when their reckless utterances
and actions engulf the country.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are literally praying for a day when Zimbabwe will
be plunged into racial and ethnic strife, frequent anti-government
 demonstrations and riots that have become the unfortunate curse
of some African countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to the recent arrest of suspected American
 saboteurs, Sekeramayi said law enforcement agencies were still
viewed as enemies of human rights when they apprehended those who
sought to destabilize and sabotage the country.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans were caught with a large assortment of arms
of war at the Harare International Airport which they claimed was
for hunting purposes.
</P>
<P>
They are in police custody and scheduled to appear in court
Friday to be charged with illegal possession of fire arms and
suspected of engaging in acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Zimbabwe are law-abiding and do not want to be
associated with anything that is unlawful or illegal," said the
minister, adding "They will not allow international criminals and

CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Thursday called on the United Nations to address the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
Moussa said it is the business of the U.N. and the Security
Council to address "the grave human rights violations in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the airstrikes on Yugoslavia launched by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) "resulted from Serbia's
rejection of proposals to settle disputes diplomatically."
</P>
<P>
NATO launched military attacks on Yugoslavia Wednesday night,
the first military action against a sovereign state since its
founding in 1949, due to Yugoslavia's rejection of allowing NATO
troops to station in Kosovo, a province where majority ethnic
Albanians have been fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt continues to follow the latest developments and
sincerely wish for an end to the Kosovo problem," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Belgrade to accept the peace plan, which was
imposed on Yugoslavia by Western powers and has been accepted by
Albanian separatists in Kosovo.

UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The leading role and
authority of the United Nations Security Council in the
peacekeeping field are irreplaceable, China stressed here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual session of the United Nations Special

Shen said every member state of the United Nations has the

to ensure that peacekeeping operations were carried out with the
authorization of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Any act taken in circumvention of the Security Council and
aimed at supplanting U.N. peacekeeping operations with unilateral
actions ran counter to the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter, Shen said.
</P>

Shen said China supports regional organizations in
strengthening their cooperation with the United Nations and playing

BERLIN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
endorse an independent Palestine state, which all the 15 EU
leaders agreed is the best guarantee for Israel's security and
peace in the Middle East, diplomatic sources here said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers attending a special summit meeting in
Berlin will issue a statement recognizing palestinians' right to
self-determination "including the option of a state", the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
But the diplomats said the statement is also expected to urge
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to unilaterally declare such
an state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The EU will confirm the lasting and inalienable right to
self-determination of the Palestinian people, including the option
of a state, said diplomats, adding that it is looking forward to
the exercise of this right.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the European Union has expressed fears that an
early unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood could
complicated internal Israeli politics ahead of the May 17
elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU was at odds with Israel after
European Governments refused to recognize Israeli sovereignty over
Jerusalem. The bloc strongly objected to Israeli stand that
foreign delegations must not visit Orient House, the Palestinians'
headquarters in Jerusalem, saying the city was not part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the EU governments have spent several days
thrashing out the correct wording of the statement on recognition
of an independent Palestine, which will be a "landmark" European
declaration on Palestine's future.

ALGIERS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government on

North Atlantic Treaty Organization against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Only diplomatic option can provide a basis for lasting peace in
Kosovo, an Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by the
Algerian News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is following closely the grave developments of the
situation in Yugoslavia that bear destabilizing factors for the
Balkan region as a whole due to the NATO military action against
that country, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Out of its principled position on the use of force to settle
international disputes, Algeria opposes the military option
especially when it is taken without U.N. mandate.

The U.N. Security Council is the only one that is qualified to

NATO staged air strikes against Yugoslavia Wednesday evening,
the first such attack against a sovereign country in 50 years

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Thursday that NATO leaders were united in believing their
offensive against Yugoslavia must continue until Belgrade "comes

</P>
<P>
"The action has to continue in order to fulfil the military

The British Prime Minister made the remarks while commenting on
a call by Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema for a return to

Asked if D'Alema's calling implied a split within NATO or the

"I can assure you the Italian prime minister is fully behind

</P>
<P>
Blair said NATO's military offensive would stop only when

UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia, which is firmly
against the use of force against Yugoslavia, on Thursday presented
a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council, saying that
NATO's "unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation
of the United Nations Charter," U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is doubted whether the draft resolution can be
adopted in all by the 15-member Council. The United States, which
championed the military action against Yugoslavia, and its allies
Britain are two permanent members who have veto power on the
Council.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposed that the Security Council affirm "such
unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the
United Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution voiced the recognition of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
saying that "the use of force by NATO against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia constitutes a threat to international peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution asked the Security Council to demand "an
immediate cessation of the use of force against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and urgent resumption of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Russia, together with Belarus and Yugoslavia, has requested the
Security Council to convene an urgent meeting on the latest
development on the issue of Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from some countries, such as China, Russia, India
and Namibia, took the floor at the Security Council on Wednesday
afternoon to say that the NATO move violates the U.N. Charter

Addressing the annual session of the United Nations Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, Chinese Deputy Permanent
representative to the United Nations, Shen Guofang, said that in
recent years, the United Nations was grappling with payment crisis
and repeatedly reducing both the number and the scale of
peacekeeping operations, but the use of double standard and
practice of preference treatment were still no rare or individual
cases.
</P>
<P>
Shen said in some regions, the mandate of the peacekeeping
operations, for one reason or another, is being extended time and
again though the expected tasks had already been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, however, when some other regions,
especially the African continent, were in dire need of the
attention and assistance of the international community, and the
United Nations are found, more often than not, wavering and
dithering, unable to take timely and meaningful actions, Shen
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Shen said there were times when financial difficulties were
used as the fig leaf for "double standard," and such unhealthy
phenomenon must be corrected.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China maintains that U.N. peacekeeping operations
should be carried out in view of the financial capacity of the
Organization and should not be open-ended.

ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit on Thursday confirmed that Turkish warplanes had joined in
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that 11 Turkish F-16 fighter jets, which are
stationed at the NATO bases in Italy, joined the NATO air raids
against the Yugoslav Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the military operation launched by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia will
be successful, while avoiding inflicting civilian damages.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched its attack against Yugoslavia due to the fact
that the Serbian administration "closed the channels of compromise
and peace," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told a press
conference Thursday that Turkey would fulfill its obligations
within the NATO and conform to its joint decisions.
</P>

Turkey will continue its initiatives for a "peaceful solution"
for the Kosovo crisis, Cem said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkey shares common historical and cultural ties
with Kosovo as ethnic Turks are living in the region.
</P>
<P>
Also on the same day, Turkish Defense Minister Hikmet Sami Turk
said that Turkey supports NATO's move in Kosovo, adding that "the
aim of the NATO is not to wage war against Yugoslavia but to

The Association said people purchased existing homes at a

just 0.4 percent from a record 5.04 million pace in January and
the third consecutive month above the 5 million mark.

factors supporting home sales, along with low mortgage rates and
high stock prices. On Thursday morning, the Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks had risen again to 9,797.
</P>
<P>
In February, home resales were strongest in the South, up 4.1
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.05 million. Sales
rose 2.8 percent in the Northeast to a rate of 730,000. They fell
0.9 percent in the West to 1.07 million and 7.8 percent in the
Midwest to 1.18 million because inclement weather temporarily
depressed sales in parts of this areas.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Accused of Replanting Mines in N. Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A government source Thursday
accused the rebel National Union for the Independence of Angola
(UNITA) of replanting land mines along the major highways in Uige
Province in northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The source from the headquarters of national police in Uige
Province revealed that a Catholic missionary named Mariano Menequi
touched off a UNITA-planted anti-tank mine Sunday when driving
along the road near Alto-causale city.
</P>
<P>
Hiscar was completely damaged and the priest seriously wounded,
the official Angola News Agency Angog reported.
</P>
<P>
UNITA men have destroyed the major bridges on the Cuilo River,
thus cutting off the link between provincial town Uige and other
Cities in the northeast, the source said, adding that a bridge
near Damba City about 110 kms north of Uige was also destroyed by
UNITA military forces.
</P>
<P>
UNITA is building up its ammunition and personnel, including
Hutu Banyanmulange mercenaries around Damba, poised to mount fresh
 offensive on this important strategic place, he charged.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, about 11 million mines have
been planted over the past 30 years in Angola, surpassing the
total population of the southern African country, and about
150,000 people have been disabled by the mines so far.
</P>
<P>
This happened although the Angolan government has signed the
convention on banning anti-personnel mines in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Opposition to Dismembering Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa reiterated on Thursday his country's opposition to
dismembering Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with a delegation of the
Sudanese opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Moussa
said Sudan's possible disintegration would lead to more problems
not only for Sudan but the entire region as well.
</P>
<P>
Egypt seeks to help the parties concerned to reach a solution
to Sudan's problems, including the civil war, he said, adding that
he has felt "a genuine desire" nurtured by the Sudanese government
and the opposition to realize reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is bogged down in a 16-year-old civil war, in which rebel
groups have been fighting against the government for greater
autonomy in the south, which is mostly of Christian and animist.
</P>
<P>
NDA is an umbrella group including Sudan's northern opposition
factions and southern rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
NDA spokesman Farouk Abu Issa said that if the Sudanese
government is serious about solving problems, it should
demonstrate its care for the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
Sudan needs a fresh beginning based on cultural, ethnic,
religious and partisan plurality, Abu Issa maintained, demanding
that the country embrace the principle of the rule of law and
respect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Osman el-Merghani, leader of the opposition Unionist Democratic
Party, said the alliance appreciates the Egyptian viewpoint on how
to resolve the Sudanese problem.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is totally opposed to separating the north from
the south of Sudan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on helping maintain Sudan's integrity for fear
that a possible disintegration of Sudan would endanger the Nile,
its main source of water.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Stops Short of Condemning NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Thursday stopped short of condemning or endorsing
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia although the Foreign Affairs
Department condemned the military action.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declined to comment until he could study the matter
further, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his official residence in Cape Town, Mandela said
he knew efforts had been made to settle the issue peacefully. "I
understood the desperation of all the powers involved in the
matter."
</P>
<P>
However, he stopped short of condemning or endorsing NATO's
action.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement Thursday
that it had noted with grave concern the military action against a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"This is in violation of the United Nations Charter and
accepted norms of international law, and it has exacerbated the
situation in the Balkans," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The erosion of the United Nations Charter and the authority of
the United Nations Security Council cannot be tolerated by the
international community."
</P>
<P>
It said the primary responsibility of the U.N. Security Council
was the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
It called on all parties to actively explore a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
South African Communist Party, which also condemned the air
strikes, indicated that NATO's excuse for the attack was
hypocritic.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and its NATO allies are trying to present
this latest action as being inspired by a concern for minority
rights.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it has nothing to do with minority rights and
everything to do with big power politics," the party said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"It stands in marked contrast to the indifference of NATO to
other minority rights issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The plight of the Kurds, who have been subjected to decades of
genocide by a NATO member, Turkey, are not attended to in a
similar way."
</P>
<P>
The party said foreign intervention, through fanning ethnic
issues, had a lot to do with the problems in Yugoslavia and the
former East European countries.
</P>
<P>
It said the bombings must be halted immediately and the Kosovo
issue must be dealt with by the U.N. Security Council, and within
the framework of international law and the U.N. Charter.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Information and Culture Wolde-Michael Chemu said Thursday that
concerted efforts are needed to enable the nation to utilize its
information potential.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here entitled "development and public
access to information in Ethiopia", the minister said information
agencies and pertinent government offices should work together to
help Ethiopia harness its information resources.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to create an enabling environment for the
generation, dissemination and usage of information.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, in cooperation with the Office of the Prime
Minister and the Science and Technology Commission, is engaged in
the formulation of a new information policy with a view to
providing information services to the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Desalegn Rahmeto, manager of Forum for
Social Studies which organized the meeting, said many countries in
the developing world are investing heavily in the information
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Ethiopia is lagging far behind in many
respects, adding that Ethiopia has the lowest number of computer
owners and least number of internet users in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said, Ethiopia has only 2500-3000 internet users whereas
South Africa has more than half a million.
</P>
<P>
"If Ethiopia does not try to catch up rapidly with the rest of
the developing world, we will be missing out on a golden
opportunity," he added.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Able to produce 6M Tons of Fish: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- With improved quality assurance of
fish and fish products, eastern and southern African region can
produce over six million tons of fish, Secretary General of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Erastus
Mwencha, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement when he received more than 340,000 U.S.
dollars from FAO representative George Mburathi for upgrading
quality and safety of fishery products in the COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to train personnel in quality assurance
in order to enable the member countries to comply with overseas
and COMESA market requirements in fish products, according to him.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the project is to increase export earning of the
region because fish and fishery products are important commodities
in the region both as a source of high quality protein, employment
and income, he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual fish production in the region is estimated at 1.8
million tons but it has a potential of six million tons, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the region is now the world's most important catching
area for Nile perch with a total annual export earnings amounting
to 30 million dollars for Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Current value of fish export of the region is estimated at
about 133 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti, Eritrea and Seychelles are getting good returns from
fresh fish export while a significant amount of canned and cured
pelagic fish is exported by Angola and Namibia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Slams EU Over Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel assailed the European
Union Thursday over its support for the Palestinian right to
statehood, saying this position would endanger the existence of
the Jewish state, the national television reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejects any attempt by the EU to dictate the results of
the final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his
office.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an expected EU declaration later Thursday
recognizing the right of Palestinian statehood and stating that
Israel cannot veto that right.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the EU of trying to "force a dangerous
solution upon Israel that jeopardizes its interests."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued before EU leaders are expected to
approve the declaration at the end of a two-day summit in Berlin
later on the day.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was a coordinated efforts by the EU and the
United States to dissuade Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat from unilaterally declaring a Palestinian
state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that he will declare statehood on May 4, the
deadline set by the 1993 Oslo agreement with Israel on the final
status of the Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
But he has been under mounting pressure recently from Arab, EU
countries and the U.S. to put off such a move which they said
would rupture the fragile peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also, many believe that a unilateral declaration of statehood
by Arafat would enhance hard-line Netanyahu's chances of winning
in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's government, which staunchly opposes a Palestinian
state, has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank still under
its control in response to a Palestinian declaration.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, Arafat has traveled to Arab, European
and American nations to rally support for the Palestinian right to
statehood.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Gaza Thursday after concluding his visit to
Canada, the last stop of the latest trip.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that Arafat is seeking a commitment by the
world community to recognize a Palestinian state if he agrees to
defer a declaration to a later date.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. President Bill Clinton refused to make such a
commitment during his talks with Arafat in Washington Tuesday,
only pledging that the U.S. will push for accelerated permanent
status negotiations after the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The war of words between Israel and the EU over the
Palestinian statehood is the second between the two sides which
erupted in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, the Israeli government strongly rejected a EU
letter saying the EU does not recognize Israel's sovereignty over
all Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Hours after European Union
officials expressed their support for the Palestinian statehood on
Thursday, Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement denouncing
the EU's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Israeli government has made it clear to
the European countries and the United States that Israel would not
agree to a unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state and
would react strongly to such a move.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that although the EU officials stressed any
declaration of Palestinian statehood should be negotiated on the
basis of existing agreements, the position of the Israeli
government over the issue will not be changed.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has insisted that it resists the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In response to the EU's comment on the security issue, the
statement stressed that Israel would make decision on the
security of the country only by itself.
</P>
<P>
During a special meeting in Berlin, the EU officials said that
the EU is convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and
peaceful sovereign Palestinian state through negotiations would
best guarantee Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that the Palestinians have an
unqualified right to self-determination including the option of a
state. They noted that the EU is ready to consider recognition of
a Palestinian state in due course.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on More Transparent Manner in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The issue of the United
Nations peacekeeping procurement should be made more transparent
so as to gradually relieve the shared concern of developing
countries, China stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual session of the United Nations Special
Committee on Peacekeeping operations, Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, Shen Guofang, said in recent
years, the vast number of Member States had been urging strongly
that UN procurement should be conducted in a more transparent
manner, channels and sources of such procurement be further
diversified and policy preferences be made in this regard in favor
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have noted with regrets that still the reform
process of UN procurement is going on rather slowly, and the fact
that UN procurement is unfairly over concentrated to a small
number of countries has been little change and procurement at
developing countries is still a tiny little portion of the overall
amount of UN procurement." Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"China has the tenth largest trade volume in the world and is
the biggest developing country, but UN procurement at China in
1998 accounted for only 0.24 percent of its total. We can see from
the above fact that on the issue of procurement, developing
countries as the overwhelming majority of the UN are being
marginalized, " Shen continued.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that as a set practice, the U.N.
Secretariat should submit a detailed report on peacekeeping
procurement to this Special Committee before its annual session
convenes.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Urges World Support for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) called Thursday on the United States
and the European countries to support the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency in Tunis,
Tunisia, Director of the PLO Political Department Farouk Qaddoumi
urged the world community, the U.S. and European countries in
particular, to declare recognition for the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced to declare an
independent state on May 4 as the five-year interim self-rule
period under the 1993 Oslo Accord expires. He has been trying to
win international support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
But many countries have reportedly advised Arafat to reconsider
the timing of the declaration of statehood to avoid complicating
the fragile peace process in the light of Israel's opposition to
the Palestinian plan.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi said that Arafat will brief PLO Executive Committee on
the outcome of his visits to the U.S., France and some other
countries for the organization to adopt "an appropriate decision"
on the declaration of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official, meanwhile, demanded the U.S., the major
mediator in the Middle East peace process, pressure Israel into
reversing its intransigence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between the Palestinians and Israel has been
stalled since last December when Israel shelved the Wye peace
accord after carrying out the first of the three-phased withdrawal
from another 13 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba promises to Narrow Wage Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
Thursday dismissed as scandalous the wage disparity in the civil
service of Zambia between those in management and the ordinary
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
When he was swearing in here two government ministers, two
deputy ministers and four civil servants, he said there are people
in the civil service with families getting as low per month as
150,000 Kwacha (about 65 U.S. dollars) which is not enough to
sustain them.
</P>
<P>
He said his government should from next year bring into line
the salary difference so that those in low income are well
renumerated.
</P>
<P>
He said that starting from this year those in management will
have to sacrifice a salary increment in order to reduce the gap
with those in low income.
</P>
<P>
The government will restrain those in high income from getting
any salary increase while next year the government will look at
how it can motivate those in income who are paid peanuts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also called for decentralization of government to meet
the aspiration of the people who put it into power.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Human Rights And "Tibet Issue" When </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERN, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
elaborated on views of Chinese government on human rights and the
so-called "Tibet issue" in his talks with President of the Federal
Council of Switzerland Ruth Dreifuss here Thursday afternoon local
time.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Chinese government has always put the issue of
human rights at an important position and has made unremitting
efforts for it.
</P>
<P>
"China has scored great achievements in promoting and
protecting the rights of living and development of Chinese people
and in the aspects of democratic and legal construction as well.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese President promised that China respects the
general principle of the international society about human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang said, the world is full of varieties and
historic traditions, level of economic development, political and
social systems of each country are all different from each other.
</P>
<P>
Promoting and protecting human rights must go along with the
national realities of respective country, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to follow one norm," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China insists that countries undertake
dialogues and cooperation about human rights based on equality and
mutual respect so that to reduce conflicts and expand common
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang listed the efforts China has made in recent years
concerning dialogues and exchange with Western countries including
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On the so-called "Tibet issue", Jiang said that it is not a
religious but a political issue concerning Dalai Lama. He is by no
means a religious figure, but a person in exile who has been
engaged in activities of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai clique is a political group of separatism with
organization and guiding principle, Jiang said. And Dalai is not
sincere in his contacts with central government.
</P>
<P>
"The true purpose of what Dalai has done is intended to deceive
people who are unaware of the facts, so that to gain international
support by cheating," Jiang said.

</P>
<P>
Switzerland is one of the first Western countries which
recognized the People's Republic of China and it will be the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Switzerland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Sino-Swiss relations have enjoyed fast
development, Jiang recalled. The two countries have had fruitful
achievements in exchanges in politics, trade, economy, science and
technology, culture, and education, he added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the growing activities at the non-official level
between the two peoples, which have played an important role in
deepening mutual understanding and promoting the friendly and
cooperative relationship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> "Exceptionally Complete" Skeleton of Earliest Mammal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A spectacularly well-preserved
skeleton of a mammal, found in China and dating back some 140
million years, offers scientists the closest look yet at the last
common ancestor of modern mammals.
</P>
<P>
The mammal, named Jeholodens, was about ten centimeters long in
life and belonged to a group of the earliest mammals called
triconodonts, Dr Luo Zhexi of the Carnegie Museum of Natural
History in Pittsburgh, the United States, told Xinhua Thursday in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton, discovered in 1997 in China's Liaoning Province by
Luo's collaborator, Professor Ji Qiang of the National Geological
Museum of China in Beijing, was by far the most well-preserved
remains of fossil triconodonts, said Dr Luo Zhexi.
</P>
<P>
Their research, published in the latest issue of the British
science journal Nature, showed that the new triconodont skeleton
has a mosaic of characters, in which a primitive pelvis and
hindlimb make a stark contrast with a much more modern-looking
shoulder and forelimb.
</P>
<P>
The mosaic characters of the skeleton will help scientists
better understand the evolutionary relationships of early,
primitive mammals, Dr Luo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that their research also showed the earliest mammals
were more likely to be "ground-living" rather than "tree-living".
</P>
<P>
In a commentary in the same issue of Nature, Timothy Rowe of
the University of Texas in Austin, the United States, described
the skeleton as "one of the most complete and exquisitely
preserved specimens ever found".
</P>
<P>
"The latest discovery helps to fill a wide gap in the fossil
record, and brings new information to classic problems on the
origin and interrelationships of early mammals," he wroted.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Farmers Urged to Increase Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
Thursday urged farmers to use improved seeds and breeding stock to
ensure high yields in production.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a public rally in Kumi Town
in eastern Uganda, a press release from the President's Office
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that use of high-yield seeds is a sure way
of eradicating poverty in the region, urging people to adopt
high-yield seeds alongside the improvement of soils and appealing
to agricultural experts to guide the population in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Museveni announced that the government will provide more
revolving funds in the next financial year, adding that those who
received the previous quarter of the funds should repay the loans
so that the money can be a real revolving fund for the
communities.
</P>
<P>
On the restocking exercise in the area, the president said he
was satisfied with it and promised more support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
This is Museveni's third day of his tour of eastern Uganda.
Previously, he had addressed security in the Karamoja region,
primary education and other issues.
</P>
<P>
This tour, together with his January tour of Luwero area where
he fought years of guerrilla war, has been widely regarded as the
beginning of his formal campaign for the next general election in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was elected President of Uganda in 1996. In 2000, the
country will have its first referendum to decide on the country's
political system in the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Train Crash not to Affect Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan senior official said
here Thursday that the train crash on the major Nairobi-Mombasa
route will not scare foreign tourists since "so few tourists"
travel on the train.
</P>
<P>
``The speed at which the accident was dealt with, the
efficiency with which people were evacuated... the general sense
of urgency and clarity of thought, was very encouraging,'' said
Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).
</P>
<P>
Leakey said KWS incomes this year rose by 25 percent over the
same period of last year, but still 35 percent below the peaks
achieved four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, some Kenyan observers are concerned that accidents
where tourists are killed will have an adverse impact on Kenya's
tourism sector because the accidents inevitably arouse
international worries over the country's security.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan tourism has been depressed since the mid-1997
multi-party election, when at least 80 people were killed in a
much-publicized series of ethnic and political clashes in Coast
Province of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
So far, 34 people were killed in the March 24 train accident,
with more than 200 people injured. One foreigner, identified as a
French women, was among those killed.

PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad
Jovanovic appealed to France Thursday evening to stop joining the
raids against Yugoslavia by the U.S-led NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest aid that you can bring to us is that France
ceases to collaborate in this aggression. The attitude of France
is against the friendship between the two countries and the
historical alliance between our two peoples," he said in an
interview in Belgrade with French television channel TF1.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has cut diplomatic relations with France because of
its participation in the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that there are a great number of deaths among
the civilians during NATO bombings, which he said had hit a dozen
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
"Several schools have been destroyed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia was attacked because it refused to
accept an agreement aimed at cutting off a part of the Yugoslav
territory and supporting "separatism and terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this document presented by Western countries on
Kosovo was not negotiated with the Yugoslav side, he said.

<P>
BERN, Switzerland, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China has always held
that the internal affairs like the Kosovo issue should be resolved
through peaceful negotiations, said Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
began military action against Kosovo Wednesday night after peace
talks broke down, Qian said in his talks with Swiss officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's action had worsened the situation in the
Balkan region, threatened the peace and stability in Europe, and
would lead to anxious consequencies.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese official called on NATO to stop the military
strikes against Yugoslavia and to return to the track towards the
political settlement through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said that Switzerland was
concerned with the situation in Kosovo and that his country would
not take part in any military action there.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Swiss Defense Minister Adolf Ogi briefed Qian
on Switzerland's defense policy. He praised the efforts made by
the Chinese government in preventing nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Ogi also expressed the hope that Switzerland was willing to
strengthen the dialogue on security issues with China.

Qian accompanied Chinese President Jiang Zemin on a three-day

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must "choose
peace" or NATO will continue its air campaign against Serb
targets.
</P>
<P>
"He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to

</P>
<P>
The key goals of the NATO strikes were to prevent
a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and a wider war in the
Balkans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Amid concerns among Republicans in the U.S. Congress that
Clinton lacked a strategy for getting the United States out of the
operation, Clinton brushed aside an exit strategy question. "The
exit strategy is what is always is in a military operation. It's
when the mission is completed," he said.

HAVANA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuba Thursday condemned NATO's

At the same time, Cuba said the United States is the main

The Cuban government qualified as "ridiculous" and

"The war launched by NATO reawakens the legitimate fears of
humanity for the shaping of an insulting unipolarism ruled by a
bellicose empire", said the communique.

in Yugoslavia, and NATO war planes were headed for targets as part
of the second day of strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly intend to continue this operation," said Sandy
Berger, the U.S. national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Berger said at the White House, the Serb
offensive "has increased somewhat" and includes some shelling by
Serb forces into neighboring Albania. For now, at least, the NATO
strikes do not appear to have achieved one key objective -- ending
Serb attacks on the ethnic Albanian minority in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some further burnings of (Kosovo) villages,
further sweep operations, some shelling into Albania," Berger
said. "I would not speculate as to what (Milosevic's) intent is."

the air strikes, which were launched by NATO without consent from

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Calls for Peaceful Solution  to Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERN, Switzerland, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China has always held
that the internal affairs like the Kosovo issue should be resolved
through peaceful negotiations, said Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks when he was with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin who was holding talks with President of the Federal
Council of Switzerland Ruth Dreisuss.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
began military action against Kosovo Wednesday night after peace
talks broke down, Qian said in his talks with Swiss officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's action had worsened the situation in the
Balkan region, threatened the peace and stability in Europe, and
would lead to anxious consequencies.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese official called on NATO to stop the military
strikes against Yugoslavia and to return to the track towards the
political settlement through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said that Switzerland was
concerned with the situation in Kosovo and that his country would
not take part in any military action there.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Swiss Defense Minister Adolf Ogi briefed Qian
on Switzerland's defense policy. He praised the efforts made by
the Chinese government in preventing nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Ogi also expressed the hope that Switzerland was willing to
strengthen the dialogue on security issues with China.
</P>
<P>
Qian accompanied Chinese President Jiang Zemin on a three-day
visit to Switzerland, which began Thursday.

<HEADLINE> French FM Says France Has ``Taken Responsibility'' in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Thursday that France and other NATO countries have
``taken their responsibilities'' by bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with France 2 television, Vedrine claimed that
the bombings were aimed at ``preventing the continuation of
tensions in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
``We cannot allow passively the tension and killings to
aggravate," he said. ``At a given moment, we should take our
responsibilities and break this machine of repression.''
</P>
<P>
He said that all these were for a return to the negotiating
table and that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can
``hasten'' a return to political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
``Milosevic can at any moment interrupt this process, return to
the political field which is always our preference and which
remains our objective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the request by Western countries on Kosovo is not
``excessive''.
</P>
<P>
Besides an agreement on substantial autonomy, the Western
countries have asked Yugoslavia to allow the deployment of up to
30,000 NATO troops in Kosovo to guarantee the security of Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia considers a deployment of NATO force as an
occupation which is aimed at cutting Kosovo off from Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Youth Crime Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's youth courts have heard
fewer cases in recent years compared with the early 1990s,
Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98, youth courts handled 110,883 cases, basically
unchanged from the previous year and 4 percent lower than in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
The overall caseload rate of 453 cases for every 10,000 youths
recorded in 1997-98 was 9 percent lower than the rate five years
earlier. The rate of property crime cases, which make up about
half of all youth cases, dropped 25 percent between 1992-93 and
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The violent crime case rate was up 4 percent over the six
years, with much of the growth occurring from 1992-93 to 1993-94.
Violent crime cases have accounted for one-fifth of the total
caseload since 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
While drug crime cases have doubled from 2,331 cases in 1992-93
to 4,549 cases in 1997-98, although the rate of drug crime
continued to be a low 19 cases per 10,000 youths in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The most common crimes brought to youth court were theft under
5,000 Canadian dollars (3,300 U.S. dollars) and breaking and
entering.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must "choose
peace" or NATO will continue its air campaign against Serb
targets.
</P>
<P>
"He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to
make war," Clinton told reporters as he met his senior foreign
policy aides for an update on the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
The key goals of the NATO strikes were to prevent a
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and a wider war in the Balkans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Amid concerns among Republicans in the U.S. Congress that
Clinton lacked a strategy for getting the United States out of the
operation, Clinton brushed aside an exit strategy question. "The
exit strategy is what is always is in a military operation. It's
when the mission is completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned that the American people still had
questions about the operation, Clinton said he believed many
Americans had not thought about the situation in Kosovo until the
last two days and believed a majority will ultimately support him.
</P>
<P>
"I also believe very strongly that it is my responsibility to
make this judgment based on what I think is the long-term
interests of the American people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he believed airstrikes alone would be
sufficient to reach his goals, and NATO ground troops would not be
needed to protect the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can create a situation in which we have limited
their ability to make war and thereby increase the prospects that
they can protect themselves better," he added.

PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- France's national trade union
Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT) Thursday
called for a rapid stop of NATO bombings against Yugoslavia and a
resumption of negotiations on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The national secretary of CFDT in charge of international

causing great concern over their consequences on civilians of
Yugoslavia, who have already undergone years of economic sanctions
and a state of war.
</P>

The branch of transport workers of CFDT, FGTE-CFDT, has also
condemned the military action by NATO and expressed ``brotherly

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Flirts with 14 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices were firmer
Thursday as markets continued to study an accord by the OPEC
producer club to cut output and drain a global glut.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark Brent crude oil ended 24 cents higher at 13.92
dollars per barrel, within sight of a peak of 14.02 dollars
touched after the cartel reached its accord Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, prices remain depressed in historical terms. So far
this year Brent has averaged 11.30 dollars, down from the 13.34
dollar average seen last year, the lowest average price for 22
years.
</P>
<P>
Volatile trading on London and New York futures markets saw
prices for much of the session in negative territory as dealers
took profits from a near-month-long rally built in anticipation of
the OPEC agreement.
</P>
<P>
But in the latest evidence of compliance with the OPEC accord,
Kuwait announced it would cut output by 144,000 barrels per day
(bpd) from 1.98 million bpd in line with the OPEC accord.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to
cut 1.7 million bpd for one year from April 1, taking the group's
overall output cuts in the past year to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Four non-OPEC producers will also contribute cuts, taking the
total reduction to 2.1 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which says the new deal is aimed at lifting
prices back to 18 dollars a barrel, was the first to announce
export cuts. It announced it was making further reductions in
supplies to April term customers even before the accord was
signed.
</P>
<P>
The market also drew support from news that Iraq had sliced
scheduled April loadings of its Kirkuk crude grade well below
recent levels, even though it will fall still further behind
pledged sales through Turkey, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
A 768,000 barrel per day April schedule from Turkey'
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan was well down from 950,000 bpd Kirkuk
loadings planned for March, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Crude sentiment also drew strength from political jitters about
a second wave of NATO air strikes on Serbia that got under way
Thursday evening, dealers said.
