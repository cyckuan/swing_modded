ETHICS PANEL GIVES RARE REBUKE TO HOUSE REPUBLICAN WHIP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House ethics committee has given a rare private
rebuke to Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, for
badgering a lobbying organization over its hiring of a Democrat as
its president, House aides said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said DeLay was chastised for complaining to the
Electronic Industries Alliance last October about its hiring of
Dave McCurdy, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma. At the
time, DeLay complained to Speaker Newt Gingrich, and later, at a
meeting of the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to DeLay said on Thursday night: ``We got a letter, yes.
We're pleased the matter has been disposed of.'' The aide declined
to comment further on the matter, which was reported on Friday in
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that the letter sent to DeLay was essentially
the same as a memorandum the committee gave House members, officers
and staff this week warning them about linking their official
actions to partisan considerations.
</P>
<P>
   That memorandum was said to have been prompted by DeLay's
pressuring of the electronics trade association last autumn, and
the fallout. Soon after DeLay complained of McCurdy's hiring, and
to show their displeasure at the association's failure to hire
retiring Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y.,, the House leaders postponed
votes on an international treaty the association wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The private rebuke of DeLay was a rare instance in which the
ethics committee, officially the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, acted without receiving a formal complaint. Long at the
center of embarrassing episodes involving lawmakers' ethical
lapses, the committee is known to be trying to keep a lower
profile.

SHAQ PUTS NUMBERS WHERE HIS MOUTH IS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Give this much to Shaquille O'Neal. He backs up his
boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, he was declaring himself an ``all-purpose big
man.'' And through the first two games of the Los Angeles Lakers'
playoff series with Houston, he has indeed done it all.
</P>
<P>
   The 27.5 points and 10.0 rebounds per game were predictable. But
it's the 5.5 assists and 4.5 blocked shots that have made O'Neal a
baseline-to-baseline wrecking ball. He averaged only 2.3 assists
and 1.67 blocks in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   His passing in particular has impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's just a testament to who he is and what he is and
what he wants to be,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``He wants to be a
champion, he wants to be a team ballplayer. He understands that in
order to make his game easier, to make us better as a team, to give
us the best chance to win, he has to be able to do that and he has
to be able to do that effectively, and he does that. . . . If they
come and trap him, then you see that he's passing the basketball
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's assist totals don't reflect the true number of
scoring chances he's creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when the ball comes out, it comes to a guy
who then swings it to another guy who gets a shot,'' Rambis said,
``so Shaq never really gets anything out of it. But if it was
hockey, he'd end up with a lot of (assists) out of that. Even
though numbers-wise he may not get the assist, he is completing the
great offensive play by getting that first pass out when they
double-team him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry said O'Neal's point-guard-like assist totals are an
outgrowth of the Lakers' offensive improvements, particularly
better spacing among players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spread out in a way that he can find us now,'' Horry
said. ``It's not all clogged up with people in the middle that he
can't see what's going on. Right now he can see cutters, he can see
guys spotting up. It's a lot easier situation for him. . . . He was
looking to pass all along, but the floor looked so congested he
couldn't get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Return to sender: The NBA's all-defensive teams were
announced Thursday and Horry was shocked to see Utah forward Karl
Malone on the first team _ especially in the wake of the Sacramento
Kings' two straight victories over the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to recount them damn votes for that all-defensive
team, and take his butt off that team,'' Horry said. ``I would put
(Philadelphia's) Theo Ratliff in there before I put him in there. I
think he's a lot overrated on the `D' because he's Karl Malone.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Jazz's struggles, the Lakers will admit no joy at
seeing their postseason nemesis falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do anything for me right now,'' Horry said. ``I
don't even watch other series. The only one I will watch is San
Antonio, because that's our next opponent.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the face of it, the seven-year battle over a mining
company's petition to blow a 900-foot hole in a mountain in
northern Washington state and extract the gold inside would seem to
have nothing to do with an emergency bill in Congress to aid war
refugees in Kosovo and victims of the recent Midwest tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only on the face of it. In fact, before House and
Senate conferees reached agreement Thursday night on the emergency
spending bill, negotiations were bogged down by the efforts of
lawmakers to cut deals, trade favors and insert pet projects. The
agreement they reached Thursday evening more than doubled the
amount President Clinton had sought for war and disaster relief, to
a total of $14.7 billion, and included a host of non-budget
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Buckhorn Mountain, in the Okanogan Highlands of
north-central Washington, comes in. So far, Washington's senior
senator, Slade Gorton, a Republican who is running for re-election
next year, has succeeded in attaching language to the spending bill
that effectively overturns a Clinton administration decision to
deny a permit for the mine. The administration has said that mining
would leave far too much waste rock and cyanide-treated ore on
federal land at the mountain, near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-mining measure, or rider, is just one that members of
Congress from all over the nation are attaching to to the spending
bill. Also included are hundreds of millions of dollars in farm
aid, loan programs for the steel, oil and gas industries, and a
host of other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., fought unsuccessfully for language
to force the White House to keep the Alabama sturgeon off the
endangered species amendment. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala., did succeed
in adding $3 million for commercial reindeer herders.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation, of course, is often made in ways that are not
pretty, and riders have been around almost since the dawn of the
Republic. But many involved in the fight in the Capitol say they
find something particularly distasteful about the way that this
bill, also intended to provide help for victims of last year's
Central American hurricanes, has been delayed by matters affecting
so many other people whose interests are, to say the least, less
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is about as low as it goes,'' said Marty Hayden,
director of policy and legislation for the Earthjustice Legal
Defense Fund, an environmental group that opposes the Buckhorn
Mountain mining project. ``The supporters of these efforts are
cynically taking advantage of a very real human tragedy, by
including this provision and others like it in a bill meant to aid
victims of natural disaster and war.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the provisions are equally resentful. Gorton,
for instance, who huddled with a mining lobbyist late Wednesday
night outside a Capitol basement conference room, reviewing
proposed language, said that including the rider in a bill that is
unlikely to be vetoed was a perfectly acceptable way of overturning
the administration's decision to block the mine.
</P>
<P>
   The mining company, Battle Mountain Gold of Houston, and a
partner, Crown Resources Corp. of Denver, have spent years and an
estimated $80 million on the permit process, and have obtained
permits from lower agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton criticized the decision by the Interior Department to
block the mining project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just immoral,'' he said. ``This is not how an honest
government deals with its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is part of the administration's effort to overturn
a century-old mining law that has allowed companies to extract
billions of dollars of minerals from federal land and pay no
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the president is pressing for speedy passage of any
package that will allow the United States and its NATO allies to
fight the war in Yugoslavia and aid refugees, a White House
spokeswoman held out the possibility of a veto and blamed Congress
for ``trying to take advantage of emergency needs in Kosovo and
Central America by loading up this bill with everybody's pet
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has strongly defended the project as an economic boon for
a depressed area of Washington, Okanogan County, which has an
unemployment rate of about 11 percent, more than twice the state
average.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the area are enthusiastic about Gorton's
support of the mine project, which could employ 140 people for
about 10 years and yield as much as half a billion dollars of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several bad years in a row in the apples market; the
timber industry is down,'' said Jimmie Dale Walker, the mayor of
Oroville, a town of 1,500 people near Buckhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian
Reservation, whose members live near five streams with headwaters
on Buckhorn Mountain, are bitterly opposed. Many of the critics say
the mine threatens the spectacular qualities that have made tourism
an important part of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have this kind of star in their eyes that they're
going to get rich on the gold mine, instead of looking at the
natural beauty all around them and working with that,'' said Dave
Kliegman, executive director of the Okanogan Highlands Alliance, a
local environment group.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   For Gorton, the legislative maneuver is consistent with his
strong support for mining and logging companies in his 17-year
career in the Senate. Such moves have earned him the enmity of
environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, whose Northwest
regional director, Bill Arthur, said Thursday that the senator's
``latest back-room deal continued a long line of shameless acts on
behalf of corporate interests to run roughshod over America's
environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's actions on behalf of Battle Mountain Gold have
also inspired ire in his home state, including that of one Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reader who recently wrote to the paper: ``Three
senators from Texas and only one from Washington is surely
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conference committee, Gorton has so far succeeded in
obtaining language that overturns the Clinton administration's
decision on the mining project, which hinges on a reading of the
1872 law.
</P>
<P>
   That law, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant to encourage
Western development in the pickaxe-and-mule era of mining, still
allows mining companies broad access to federal land for just a few
dollars an acre. Critics, including the Interior secretary, Bruce
Babbitt, say it amounts to a huge giveaway of public resources and
has left a dangerous legacy of 500,000 abandoned mines across the
West.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the debate over the 1872 law is the question of whether a
measure blocking the administration's decision belongs in an
emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's Senate colleague from Washington, Patty Murray, a
Democrat, said late Wednesday that his rider was ``the wrong
manner'' to debate the mining law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To address this in the middle of the night in an emergency
bill that seeks to address the Kosovo issue is wrong,'' Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly two dozen House Republicans, led by Rep. Sherwood
Boehlert of upstate New York, signed a letter earlier this week
urging that the spending bill be kept free of ``extraneous
provisions'' and riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supplemental bills address serious and urgent matters,
including emergency aid for farmers and money for our troops in
Kosovo,'' the letter said. ``Controversial policy decisions ought
to have a full airing on the House floor, and should not be added
into must-pass bills during conference negotiations. This is
particularly true in the case of these supplemental bills, which
address genuine emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of Congress seemed prepared to stretch the
definition of what belonged in the bill. ``The question of whether
it's an emergency or not,'' said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., ``is in
the eye of the beholder.''

COMING OUT OF COMA, CRASH VICTIM HEADED HOME TO HEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Keith Mullins shuffled around the halls of the
acute rehabilitation unit at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in the
Van Nuys community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley and looked
forward to going home.
</P>
<P>
   To his family, his small steps are nothing short of a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   To Mullins, they are a gift from God _ a second chance at life
after doctors held out little hope he would ever awaken from a
coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I wanted to go with him. I said I wanted to
stay,'' Mullins said of his encounter with the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old president-elect of the Mid Valley Chamber of
Commerce suffered massive injuries Jan. 15 when a pickup truck
veered after being cut off and smashed into his Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks he lay in a coma, family members all but giving up
on prayers that they would ever talk with Mullins again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this 20 years. I've seen people wake up out of
comas after a week or two. He was six weeks,'' said Dr. Mark
Romoff, an internist who treated Mullins.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of February, with his wife, Marilyn, at his bedside,
Mullins suddenly came out of the coma and grabbed a photo of the
couple out of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he kissed it. And the family's hope of recovery was
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started off with `There's a glimmer of hope here.' And
it just builds and builds,'' said Marilyn Mullins, 53, who works in
the gift shop four floors below the ward where her husband is
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said, `Just sit back and watch the miracle,' and it is
a miracle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins is preparing to go home Saturday, exactly four months
after the crash that nearly cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   He will take a wheelchair to the hospital front door and plans
to walk the rest of the way with help.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins' family had all but given up hope he would emerge from
the coma, approving a recommendation by the hospital not to
resuscitate him if he should fall into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even imagine putting him in that state. You're
being told every day, `It doesn't look good. It doesn't look good.'
At that point we really didn't know,'' said his daughter Theresa
Mullins, a Studio City resident.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Mullins sustained what's called ``brain shearing'' in
which a whiplash action ruptures blood vessels in the brain. That
triggered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins has recovered a great deal since the day he grabbed the
photo from his wife. But he still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Directions like ``shave'' and ``brush teeth'' hang on signs at
the foot of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins' speech remains somewhat clipped and often ends in
emotional stammers.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkest period during the coma, Mullins said he believes
he saw God, who gave him a choice to live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mullins and the couple's three adult children prayed, as
did his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Romoff, who oversaw Mullins' treatment, recommended
do-not-resuscitate status to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about if we needed to do something else to keep him
alive, that we shouldn't do that because I thought there was going
to be no meaningful quality of life,'' Romoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members visited Mullins every day, first at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center, where he was in intensive care for six
days, then at Valley Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   The kiss led to other milestones. Keith Mullins' hand took a
brush to his hair. One day, he yelled his first word: ``nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   The firsts have continued since. He was moved from custodial
care to the acute rehabilitation unit and relearned more movements,
more words.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn gives credit for her husband's recovery to the faith of
hundreds of well-wishers, prayers and a special Mass said for him
at St. Elisabeth's Church.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Manager Jamie Terrence credits the constant stimulation
his family gave him for pulling him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another family, this wouldn't have happened, no way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins will continue to receive physical therapy on an
outpatient basis. And the chamber is holding open the seat to which
he was elected before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went through this, we just wanted to support him,''
said chamber Executive Vice President Nancy Hoffman. ``We didn't
want to throw in the towel.''

CLARK STILL DISAPPOINTED ABOUT DEPARTURE FROM RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The once-anticipated return of first baseman
Will Clark went largely unnoticed last night at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-day disabled list _ no stranger to Clark _ will do that.
</P>
<P>
   Clark remains sidelined with a fracture to his left thumb
suffered April 18, yet another injury stings Baltimore's
35-year-old infielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hurt his pride.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who spent the previous five seasons with the Rangers,
never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no secret at all,'' Clark said yesterday afternoon
while sitting in the unfamiliar surroundings of the visitors'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Clark became expendable once the Rangers signed Rafael Palmeiro
on Dec. 1, and that still gnaws at the productive-when-healthy
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I got,'' said Clark, who later signed a two-year
contract with the Orioles worth $11 million. ``I was trying to get
a deal done pretty much from the start. I kept getting, `Wait.
Wait. Wait.' I waited to file for free agency until the very last
day, pretty much the last hour for that matter. Then, I was told to
wait until Randy Johnson signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers failed in their pursuit of the left-hander for their
rotation, and Palmeiro made his bid to return the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy signed on Monday,'' Clark recalled. ``Rafael signed on
Tuesday, and I have yet to meet with Doug Melvin after all that
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers general manager acknowledged regret about how the
events unfolded, but Melvin and then club president Tom Schieffer
called and explained their reasoning to Clark, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real tough phone call, and I told him why,'' Melvin
said. ``I think he was obviously hurt, and he had a reason to be
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin planned to meet with Clark's representative, Jeff Moorad,
the day after signing Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he owed me the courtesy to sit down with me,'' Clark
said. ``All that does is just illustrate that this is not a game.
Baseball is a business. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed? Yes, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter,'' Clark said. ``I understand that this is a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was hitting .370 before being placed on the disabled
list, expected a warm reception upon his return to The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they not? I laid my blood and guts out there for
them,'' Clark said. ``They don't make 'em like this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical injury robbed him of even that.

JOGGERS NEED COURT TO SETTLE RUNNING FEUD

<P>
   GILBERT, Ariz. _ It sounds like a Dr. Seuss book, which told of
a north-going Zax and a south-going Zax bumping into each other and
both refusing to budge.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a children's story. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Meet the plaintiff: Brenda James. The 42-year-old loves to run
in the Islands community in Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the defendants: the husband-and-wife team of Rhett and
Barbara Muller. They also run in the Islands, in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   When James and the Mullers have met on the street, all have
refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   So one got a court order against the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Mullers have to stay 10 feet away while James runs, or they
can be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   James told the court that the couple runs side by side and
refuses to move over, or to run single-file, to allow her to pass.
She said they force her into the street.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some elbows exchanged, and some words. She says
she's been spit on.
</P>
<P>
   James went to Gilbert Municipal Court and was granted an
injunction against harassment. The Mullers can't contact her by
phone or in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Or when she's running.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants ``shall not come within 10 feet of plaintiff
while she is running,'' according to the April court order, which
is good anywhere in the United States for one year.
</P>
<P>
   The runners also were ordered to run against the flow of
traffic, which could keep them on opposite sides of the street or
running in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mullers violate the order, they could be arrested and
prosecuted for interfering with judicial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Phares granted the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I'd like them to sit down on the lawn, drink their
Gatorade and work out a solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't possible, he prefers they come to court for
mediation or a ruling by a judge ``rather than having people handle
these kind of debates physically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our courtroom is not THAT crowded,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The tiff seems out of place in the Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilbert community near McQueen and Warner roads is built
around man-made lakes, where ducks strut along the water near fancy
homes with perfect lawns and nice cars.
</P>
<P>
   The streets and sidewalks are wide. Bike paths are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous calls seeking comment were not returned. Notes left at
the Muller and James homes went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   While the court order is recent, the feud has been running for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   In court records, James said that on March 22, James said
Barbara Muller was ``running towards me forcing me into traffic''
and James says she accidentally hit Muller.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the couple were running toward her and wouldn't
move, ``forcing me into traffic and Rhett and I hit each other in
passing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Another injunction had been issued in September and served to
the Mullers by Gilbert police. James told the court at the time
that on two different days she was screamed at. Once, she said, one
of them spat in her face.
</P>
<P>
   The court had asked what harm could occur if the injunction was
not granted.
</P>
<P>
   James wrote: ``more yelling and screaming and spitting, maybe
physical hitting or tripping.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An October hearing was set; the judge sent the three to
mediation. Terms were worked out where James would essentially be
left alone, but she says those terms were violated, so she went
back to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction is now in effect for a year.
</P>
<P>
   And jogging is supposed to be relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   John Crawford is an associate professor specializing in conflict
resolution in Arizona State University's Department of
Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pointless, relatively childish act,'' he said of the
dueling joggers. ``Absolutely childish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also calls the case ``absolutely fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened the dispute in some ways to road rage, where a minor
act can erupt into a case of ``I'll teach you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like two little boys pushing each other in the shoulder .
. . pretty soon there's blood on the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Crawford, the case also reflects a problem with society:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're running to the law and running to outsiders
increasingly rapidly. `I'm going to tell the cops on you.' `I'm
going to tell the courts on you.' It's another very bad sign of
things we're doing badly'' as a society.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Appleton of Tempe runs every day. He sometimes comes across
teens walking on the sidewalk who won't make room for him, or cars
whose drivers don't give him the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the dispute is with fellow joggers, he said,
is a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, you go by, you lift up your hand, you say `hi,' you
do something,'' he said, and the natural thing would be for the
couple to fall into single file. ``It's really kind of that
runners' code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runners aren't hockey players,'' he adds. ``They're nice,
gentle people.'' &QL;

X'S AND O'S IMPORTANT, BUT GALAXY SHOULD FOCUSON W'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; If some Galaxy players think new coach Sigi Schmid's X's and
O's are better than former coach Octavio Zambrano's, they had
better start showing it soon. Dominating games and creating more
scoring chances are nice, but unless you win, game plans and
strategies mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 2-1 loss to Kansas City wasn't embarrassing in
itself, but the situation made it so. The Wizards were 0-7 and had
scored only two goals while giving up 12 before their victory over
the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy players, who have scored a mere four goals going into the
Kansas City game, talked all week how they were on board with the
game plan. Ever since Zambrano was fired, the players have praised
Schmid for his communication skills, his adjustments and his
game-simulated practices.
</P>
<P>
   But what is hard to fathom about this 4-4 team is why the
players would praise Schmid in a way as to suggest that Zambrano
wasn't worthy of such compliments.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear after speaking with players and front-office
people: Zambrano wasn't a communicator. Not all the players thought
that, but several did. The knock on Zambrano is that he didn't have
a game plan, didn't adjust well and didn't get along with the
foreign players.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the record, those were some of the reasons Galaxy
president Tim Leiweke gave for Zambrano's firing three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Respect? Adjustments? If those are the reasons, then the players
need to answer a few questions:
</P>
<P>
   __ If Zambrano's preparation and strategy were so poor, how did
the team manage to win 24 games and score 68 points _ a MLS record
_ last season? And just how did the Galaxy score a league-record 85
goals?
</P>
<P>
   __ And if his halftime adjustments were so bad, how did the
Galaxy finish with the league's top-rated defense last year?
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to downgrade Schmid, because enough credible people
believe if anybody can turn this team around, it is him. But it has
to make you wonder why the players suddenly feel better coached
now, or better prepared now. It seems the players should be more
concerned with before than now.
</P>
<P>
   As in: Why don't they score more goals as before or win games as
they did before?
</P>
<P>
   __ Cup talk: As part of the MLS's qualifying for the 1999 U.S.
Open Cup, the final two ``play-in'' games are scheduled for
Saturday, when New York/New Jersey faces Miami and the Galaxy hosts
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was the first team to play its way into the tournament
by defeating Kansas City on April 17. The loser of the three
``play-in'' games with the most MLS points as of June will also
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gotta be the stadium: The only chance soccer has to rival
other pro sports in this country is to build soccer-specific
stadiums similar to the one Columbus will introduce Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew, which previously played at Ohio Stadium, built the
first soccer-only venue in the U.S., fittingly named ``Columbus
Crew Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22,500-seat venue is built so fans will feel on top of the
field, similar to many stadiums in Europe. There will not be much
space between the touchline and the fans, which should make for
good television, especially when the stadium is filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The first game at Columbus Crew Stadium will be televised by
ESPN2 at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday. The Crew hosts the New England
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking for help: Galaxy public relations coordinator Luis
Garcia confirmed that the team is inviting strikers Alejandro
Sequiera and Mickey Trotman to training camp next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sequiera, formerly of Tampa Bay and a Costa Rica native, could
replace seldom-used El Salvadoran Jaime Caicedo as the Galaxy's
fourth foreign player. Trotman, released by Dallas, has shown signs
of becoming a talented scorer in MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he likes Caicedo, but carrying him is more of a
burden than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talented player, but he's only 18,'' said Schmid.
``When you're only allowed four foreign players, it's important
that all those foreign players are making an impact on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough times: It was easy to attribute the Galaxy's success
last season to Welton and Cobi Jones. Jones led the team in scoring
with 19 goals and 13 assists. Welton finished second with 17 goals
and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   One can just as easily attribute the team's slow start to the
same duo. Welton is scoreless and Jones has just one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're more disappointed than anybody,'' Schmid said.
``I'm sure Cobi and Welton would like to have more goals at this
point. Welton had two good chances and Cobi had one very good
chance last week against Kansas City.''

POLICE RESUME SEARCH FOR MISSING TEEN AFTER TIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police resumed their search Thursday for a
missing girl after receiving an anonymous tip that her body was at
a Kansas City area lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star received written information indicating
that Crystal Kipper's body was under high water near a bridge. The
information was given to police.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City detectives and officers from the Clinton County
Sheriff's Department, the Missouri Water Patrol, Missouri
Department of Conservation and Clay County Park Rangers were
involved in a five-hour search Thursday that yielded nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is take our best guess and get it
narrowed down to two or three areas and then start looking,'' said
Kansas City Police Sgt. Tim Witcig.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Thursday said the tipster's description fit at least
five areas at Smithville Lake including some dry spots flooded
recently by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Witcig said that without more details police will have to wait
for the lake to recede to resume the search.
</P>
<P>
   Witcig said it was unclear whether the tip meant Kipper's body
was in the lake or buried on a flooded area that once was shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be out here for nothing,'' he said. ``Just as soon as
we don't check this out, that will be where she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have received countless tips on Kipper. They have
conducted several searches. They had never searched Smithville
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper, 18, vanished Feb. 24, 1997, after her car broke down on
Interstate 29. Platte County authorities have classified the case
as a homicide, though no body has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The only suspect in the case, John E. Williams, was found hanged
in his Jackson County, Mo., jail cell on April 24. Prosecutors said
they were days away from charging Williams with Kipper's murder.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Byron Nelson had grown to love his annual meetings with
Gene Sarazen on the first tee at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the first round of the Masters, Nelson and
Sarazen would act as ceremonial starters, hitting the first swats
off the tee. It had become tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the year when Gene turned 90 and he told me that
was the last time he was going to do it,'' Nelson said Thursday.
``Then this year, he's 97 and still doing it. He was like an old
fire horse. He was always ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One of golf's original thoroughbreds in spite of his slight
build, Sarazen died Thursday from complications of pneumonia. The
man who hit the most famous shot in Masters history _ a double
eagle on No. 15 in 1935 _ had been talking with friends in the golf
business as recently as last week before suddenly falling ill.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen died peacefully in Naples, Fla., members of his family
said in a statement released through the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen, who is credited with the invention of the sand wedge,
won 38 tour titles and seven major championships. He was the first
player to complete the career Grand Slam _ winning all four of
golf's major championships over the course of 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to meet him a couple of times at the Masters and sat
next to him for a delightful lunch one day this year,'' said Tiger
Woods. ``It's a sad day because he was such a great man and a great
ambassador of golf. To have two great men of golf leave us in a
two-year stretch (Ben Hogan died in July 1997) is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen was one of the last remaining links to golf's early
roots in America. Nelson, 10 years Sarazen's junior, said he will
never forget the times when he was considered the young pup on the
golf scene during the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were four players of history in golf back in the early
days,'' Nelson said. ``You had (Walter) Hagen, (Francis) Ouimet,
Sarazen and (Bobby) Jones. So that's an end of that era. And that's
a nostalgic thing to think that Gene has had good enough health to
be here this long. He almost made it for one whole century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first became interested in golf and was hacking it
around, his name was very prominent. When I learned to play, I kind
of started the new, modern type of playing where you use the feet
and legs, like they do today. And Sarazen played the old school of
hitting against a stiff, straight left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I ever met him, Gene said, `Nelson is never going to
make a good player because he uses his feet and legs too much.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, some people might say I played all right. But years
later, we met and became good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen is a charter member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and
was the first winner of the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen will be remembered as a golfer. But he also was a
straight shooter who never left it unknown where he stood on any
subject. Nelson remembered a vignette from the 1945 PGA
Championship at Moraine Country Club in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, you kind of got paired according to the gallery
and so forth,'' Nelson said of what was then a match-play
tournament. ``And Gene said he wanted to play Nelson in the first
round because he either wanted to stay all week or go home on the
first day. So unfortunately for Gene, he went home on the first
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen's wife, Mary, died in 1986 after the couple had been
married 62 years. They are survived by two children, Mary Ann, of
Marco Island, Fla., and Gene Jr., of Delray Beach, Fla., seven
grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island. A
funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic Church on
Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comforting thing about it, as far as I'm concerned, is
that Gene went on and on and then he was gone,'' Nelson said. ``I'd
like to think that my life could be like that _ not having to go
through any illness or long seizure of cancer or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think a lot of people should feel happy that it happened
this way.''

JOHNSON: TEAM NEEDS 12TH PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When asked about the ideal roster, Los Angeles
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he erred at the beginning of the
season and should have carried 12 pitchers instead of 11. He also
said five outfielders and six infielders is the way to go now.
</P>
<P>
   The need for another outfielder _ the Dodgers carry four _ comes
from center fielder Devon White's slowly progressing hamstring. He
injured it Sunday but said he won't be able to play until Saturday
in St. Louis at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers with three healthy outfielders and Johnson
feeling vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Johnson wants a fifth outfielder, he might have to
cut back on his wish for 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd like to have the fifth outfielder, but there
doesn't seem to be a way to accomplish that with the 12th
pitcher,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``You can't
have 12 and then five.''
</P>
<P>
   It's because the Dodgers lack flexibility on the roster,
particularly in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen is too valuable to be traded. Jose
Vizcaino provides versatility by playing three infield positions
and hitting from both sides of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson has liked Tripp Cromer since the utility infielder
was with the Cardinals and Johnson was in Cincinnati. Plus, Cromer
is out of options, and the Dodgers are fearful he'll be claimed off
waivers, which is what happened with Jacob Brumfield, and they'll
lose him if they send him to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Seeing the ball: The longer it takes White to return from his
strained hamstring, the more it should benefit backup outfielder
Todd Hollandsworth, who could use the work.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming off the disabled list April 23, Hollandsworth is
hitting .174 with a double and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   White left Sunday's game against the Marlins, which put
Hollandsworth in center field for the three-game series with the
Chicago Cubs, in which he didn't fair well. Hollandsworth was 1 for
9 against the Cubs with two walks and seven strikeouts. In 23
at-bats, Hollandsworth has 12 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to try to get myself a good pitch and drive it,'' said
Hollandsworth, who is expected to start again in center field
tonight in St. Louis. ``I feel great at the plate. I'm fooled by
the speed of pitches right now. (Monday), all I saw were
change-ups. I had trouble recognizing what was a fastball and a
change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lineup talk: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson used the same
lineup one through eight in the three games against the Cubs, but
he said that might change even before White's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have to tinker around,'' Johnson said. ``We'll see
during the off day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers averaged four runs in the three games against the
Cubs. They had 25 hits but no more than nine hits in a game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Noticing a trend? Johnson was quick to yank starter Darren
Dreifort on Wednesday, partly because the Cubs' lineup was set up
for lefty Pedro Borbon. But Johnson said another reason was
something he's noticed in Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fifth, sixth inning, around 80 pitches, his ball comes
up a little bit,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who pitched 52/3 innings, allowed two runs. One came
in the fifth inning and the other in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It's also been the way Dreifort (4-2) has pitched this season.
The first time through the batting order, teams are hitting .160
against the right-hander. Also, his ERA through the first four
innings in 3.53, compared to 10.32 in the fifth inning and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   __ Off-day chatter: At the rate Dave Hansen is going, he might
become the Dodgers' all-time pinch-hit leader by the end of the
season. He's 7 for 12 this season and has 80 pinch hits for the
Dodgers, 26 behind Manny Mota.

PROGRAM HELPS POLICE SERVE SENIORS, OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Police Officer Everett Babcock
knocked gently on Ruby Franks' door on East Sixth Street, just
below the sign: ``Do not pet my dog. If you pet her I will give you
paper towels to clean her puddles off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have your sticker,'' Babcock said when Franks answered the
door in her wheelchair. He rubbed a sticker marked ``SENIOR WATCH''
on a pane of glass near the doorknob, stepping carefully around a
dachshund sniffing his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a 68-year-old multiple sclerosis patient, was one of
several people Babcock visited recently as part of the Senior Watch
program sponsored by the Police Department's East Patrol Division.
</P>
<P>
   Program members such as Franks provide police with their phone
numbers, medical histories, family contacts and the names of people
nearby who can let police into their homes in emergencies. The
information, entered into a computer, is accessible only to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to join,'' Franks said. ``I'm in this chair. I'm by
myself. There may come a time I'll need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the program is not limited to seniors. People
of all ages with serious medical problems may participate.
</P>
<P>
   Members are given small stickers for front doors. The stickers
have identification numbers that correspond to the members' names
in the database. Police can get immediate medical and contact
information by calling the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of calls to do resident checks on the elderly,''
said Babcock, who started the program in January. ``A neighbor
calls and says they haven't seen Mrs. So-and-So and sends for us.
We knock on the door and no one answers. Or we kick it in, which
causes one more problem for the occupant. Or we leave and if they
need help they could die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be so frustrating to be there and you can't get in
and you don't know the first thing about them. All you needed was
information. This gives us the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, 280 persons have joined the program, and the
Police Department is considering implementing the program citywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been really good,'' Babcock said. ``It's been
talked about on Internet chat rooms, and we've gotten calls from
out of state. We've had to turn people away who don't live in East
Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan and South Patrol divisions recently picked up
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two days we had 200 people verbally commit to the
program,'' said Officer Lindy Belton of South Patrol. ``I can't
find anybody who is not interested. One man called for himself, his
wife and three neighbors. Now we can protect people who are really
alone with just a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, police have used the program a few times in nonemergency
situations.
</P>
<P>
   One concern the department had when starting the program was
whether the stickers would alert criminals to vulnerable people.

why we kept it (the sticker) small.''

   The ages of those in the East Patrol program vary widely. The

   ``It's a good idea,'' said Marla Moore, administrative
coordinator for Minute Circle Friendly House, an agency that works
with the elderly on the city's east side. ``This is a very
drug-infested area. Most of the seniors we work with don't have
family. It's just them. With the police working with them, it can
only make things better.''

EXPERIENCE COUNTS FOR HUBER

<P>
   If there appears to be a maturity in Ditta Huber's game and
confidence in her step, it's because USC's top singles player has
been there.
</P>
<P>
   She's 23, which is almost ancient by tennis standards. She will
be among the elderly when the Trojans step onto their home court
for Saturday's NCAA Regional at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The women's regionals begin Saturday at various national sites,
including USC, UCLA and Pepperdine. (UCLA also is hosting a men's
regionalthat began Friday and continues Saturday.) Huber is one of
the area players to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago (or a lifetime ago, as she says), Huber won a
Junior National doubles tournament with partner Lindsay Davenport
and beat Davenport to win the Southern California sectionals. She
also won the prestigious Easter Bowl by defeating Annie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is ranked in the world's top 10. Miller was ranked as
high as 41st before quitting the tour to attend college at
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Huber's teen-age success prompted her to attempt her dream of
playing on the women's professional tour (as an amateur). She
played mostly qualifying and satellite events in places like
Midland, Texas, and Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was enjoyable. I had a good time,'' she said. ``But it's a
struggle. It's a very different lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is ranked 10th. If the Trojans defeat Drake on Saturday,
they move to Sunday's final, possibly against San Diego, whose top
singles player, Zuzana Lesenarova, is the ITA's top-ranked singles
player.
</P>
<P>
   Each regional champion advances to the NCAA Championships in
Gainesville, Fla. Here are other area players who could lead their
teams to Gator country:
</P>
<P>
   __ Amanda Basica and Annica Cooper, UCLA:For three years the
Bruins wanted Basica to be their top singles player, but a severe
shoulder injury has prevented her from taking that role. Cooper has
stepped forward, but the two remain the top doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a junior, has been only too happy to take over the No. 1
spot, saying the better competition has made her a better player
since coming to UCLA from Chicago and starting her career at No. 3
singles.
</P>
<P>
   This season has been rocky for Cooper. Working on a new
one-handed backhand cost her some early-season victories. Now,
``I'm catching up with the other girls.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, ranked seventh, opens against Western Michigan on Saturday
at 9 a.m. A victory sends the Bruins into Sunday's final with
either South Alabama or Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   __ Angela Lawrence, Pepperdine: The senior, the No. 8-ranked
Waves' top singles player the past two years and top doubles player
her entire career, is trying to become the school's second
four-year All-American, following Janna Kovacevich (1988-91).
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lawrence is ranked 31st in singles and seventh in
doubles with Ipek Senoglu. She defeated Lesenarova on April 25 in
the West Coast Conference championships.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine opens Saturday against Boston University at 11 a.m.
The final is Sunday at noon against either Louisiana State or Ohio
State.

COUPLES DEPART CHINA DEMONSTRATIONS WITH NEWLY ADOPTED CHILDREN

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Leawood, Kan., residents Scott and Kim Tucker
could interpret only one of the slogans being shouted by the mob
demonstrating on the streets below their 14th floor hotel room
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``American killers. American killers. American killers.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had traveled halfway around the world to Guangzhou,
in southern China, on a mission of love _ to meet and experience
the culture of their first child, Lillie Gwynne Tucker, before
returning with her to America.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, the Tuckers and 12 other adoptive families,
including Damon and Joyce Sickel of Kearney, found themselves
temporary prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Outside their hotel, tens of thousands of demonstrators filled
the streets and surrounded the adjacent U.S. Consulate to protest
the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
NATO called last week's bombing which killed three Chinese
officials accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Tucker at times videotaped the demonstrators, many of whom
arrived in buses. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that
the demonstrations in Guangzhou involved tens of thousands of
students from more than 10 universities who converged on the U.S.,
British, French, Italian and Dutch consulates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tense,'' said Scott Tucker, who was eventually
warned by hotel staff to stay away from the windows. ``We really
didn't know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting information was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The couple watched Chinese news reports on television but found
the language barrier insurmountable. The hotel staff couldn't
provide many answers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the adoption agency also were in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, someone saw a CNN report about the bombing. They also
saw video of Chinese protesters attacking the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing and setting fire to a building in the U.S. consulate
compound in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we were pretty nervous,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Confined to the hotel, the Tuckers whiled away the hours talking
by telephone to relatives back home and enjoying Lillie.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until someone with the adoption agency contacted
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that things began to move.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the consulate came to the hotel to give the
families visas.
</P>
<P>
   The group eventually fled the hotel in a bus with covered
windows and drove to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit unnerving to say the least,'' Scott Tucker
recalled Thursday afternoon, moments after arriving at Kansas City
International Airport. The Sickels arrived at KCI on a later flight
with their new daughter, Jasmine.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tuckers appeared at the airport, Kim Tucker held
1-year-old Lillie close to her chest while relatives and friends
reached out to touch the latest addition to the family. Lillie,
dressed in a silky red robe and pants, seemed unaffected by the
cheers, balloons and television lights.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly warmed to her 4-year-old cousin Kylie Burfeind who
grabbed Lillie's hand and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be home,'' Scott Tucker said. &QL;

MINOR EARTHQUAKE RATTLES KANSAS CITY, KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An earthquake briefly shook parts of Kansas
City, Kan., at 9:18 a.m. Thursday, jangling some nerves, damaging
one structure, forcing the evacuation of several buildings, but
injuring no one.
</P>
<P>
   By California standards, it was a small earthquake. But in this
area, where earthquakes are rare, the tremor triggered dozens of
phone calls to police, news agencies and Wyandotte County's Unified
Government.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, the first earthquake in many years that
caused noticeable tremors in the Kansas City area, according to Don
Steeples, a geophysics professor at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's quake might not have been felt outside of Kansas
City, Kan. Dispatchers at the Johnson County Emergency
Communications Center and the Kansas City Police Department
communications unit didn't receive any reports of tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Steeples said area residents had little reason to worry about
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's going to happen,'' Steeples said. ``But
statistically, I have a great deal of confidence that there are
going to be a hundred times more earthquakes in Los Angeles than in
Kansas City over thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Steeples said a 1961 earthquake measured nearly 4.0 in
magnitude. Its epicenter was about 20 miles northeast of Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, seismographs recorded two earthquakes near Kansas
City International Airport in the mid-1980s, he said, but no one
felt those.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., notes
that in 1968, an earthquake centered in southern Illinois
registered a magnitude 5.3 and was felt in this area.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, people across the central and south-central parts
of Kansas City, Kan., reported feeling tremors. Desks shook at the
Board of Public Utilities at Seventh Street and Minnesota Avenue.
Books fell off of a shelf at the main branch of the Kansas City
Kansas Public Library a block from the BPU.
</P>
<P>
   All in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, hmm, an earthquake,'' said Claudia Baker, director
of development at Heart of America Family Services, 626 Minnesota
Ave. ``I just kept working. So did everyone else. If it had
continued, everybody would have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Dan Schenkein, president of the Kansas City Kansas
Area Chamber of Commerce, also on Minnesota Avenue, felt nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Within a minute or two, seismographs in several states started
to record the initial shaking, which was followed by an aftershock
about 90 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   A geophysicist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey said that
three seismographs in that state indicated the earthquake had
reached a magnitude of 2.8. An official with the U.S. Geological
Survey in Golden reported that eight seismographs in eight states
recorded average readings of 3.0 in magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Steeples said Thursday's tremors were probably the result of
movement along a small fault _ a fracture in underground rock _
somewhere in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Steeples said seismograms _ charts generated by the seismograph
_ indicated that the tremors could have been compounded by the
possible collapse of a closed limestone mine. However, he did not
rule out the possibility that the collapse precipitated the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The mine lies beneath two medical buildings at 46th Street and
Orville Avenue, just south of Indian Springs Marketplace,
Interstate 635 and State Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after feeling the tremors, about 100 medical staff and
patients in the west medical building were evacuated. They were not
allowed to re-enter because the building had moved and developed
cracks, and the earth had pulled away from part of the foundation,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an 8-foot-deep fissure opened in the parking lot of
the two-story building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like someone hit the building with a truck,'' said
Sandy Storms, a medical assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were yelling, `Get out, get out!' '' Storms said, and
they ran out of the building as fast as they could.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bond, the Unified Government's chief building inspector, and
Bill Blackwell, the structural engineer, surveyed the area and
declared it unsafe. Mayor Carol Marinovich arrived at the scene
about 11 a.m. and was briefed.
</P>
<P>
   City building inspectors examined a handful of other buildings,
but did not find any with structural damage, said Assistant Fire
Chief Bill Hollander.
</P>
<P>
   At least four buildings were evacuated, including Kaw Valley
Children's Center, 759 Vermont Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are a children's organization, we felt that anytime
something like this happens, you err on the side of caution,'' said
Marilyn Alstrom, vice president of human resources and development
for the center, which is responsible for foster care in eastern
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Steeples said the seismogram indicated that the tremors came on
suddenly, possibly indicating that Kansas City, Kan., had
experienced a tectonic earthquake, caused by a slip on a fault.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of a mine could cause an earthquake, he said, but
had that happened, the seismogram probably would have shown the
tremors coming on gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Because reports of tremors came in a relatively limited area,
the earthquake's epicenter had to be somewhere in Kansas City,
Kan., Steeples said. However, geologists will probably have a hard
time pinpointing exactly where the epicenter was because the
nearest seismograph station is more than 250 miles away. At best,
he said, geologists probably will come only within two to three
miles of the exact site.
</P>
<P>
   The tremors were not, he stressed, the product of a larger
earthquake that occurred elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are scores of faults in this area,'' Steeples said.
``Most of them are small and harmless in the sense that the
earthquakes that occur on them are small. Nevertheless, they're
there....Occasionally they just slip a bit.''

IN ABRUPT REVERSAL, REPUBLICANS CALL FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 5th graf for clarification; subs 18th-23rd grafs for new
material, quotes and rewriting)  (See also: CONGRESS-GUNS-ASSESS)  
(rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Senate Republicans defeated a
Democratic proposal to require background checks on buyers at gun
shows, they turned around Thursday and advocated a measure of their
own to do precisely that, a startling reversal that reflected their
skittishness about being portrayed as soft on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative fate of the Republicans' surprise proposal was
undecided Thursday evening _ a vote was expected on Friday _ but
the very fact that it had been introduced demonstrated the potency
of the gun-control issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a sizeable majority of senators voted Thursday
night not only for a Republican gun control measure to prohibit the
sale of semi-automatic assault weapons to children under 18, but
also for a Democratic proposal to ban the importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips for those weapons. That Democratic
proposal had been defeated in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, a stark contrast to the Senate action on
Wednesday, showed that Republicans were indeed concerned that the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo., last month had altered public
opinion and created fresh outrage among many Americans about gun
violence and the availability of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Democrats and Clinton administration officials
said late Thursday that the new Republican gun show amendment was
so ambiguously worded that it appeared, in fact, to create a whole
new class of vendor, neither dealer nor private collector, who
would be exempt from conducting background checks. Republicans
disputed that interpretation in an argument on the Senate floor
that went late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to stand on the floor of the United States Senate
and proclaim myself a defender of the Second Amendment,'' said Sen.
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., referring to the right to bear arms, which
Republicans frequently invoke to explain their opposition to more
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But, Smith added, ``I think it's possible to defend this
constitutional right and also defend the kids in the school
cafeteria.'' He said he would support tighter restrictions on gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of about a half dozen Republicans who, after
voting with the Republican majority on Wednesday to oppose such
restrictions, later expressed concern to Republican leaders about a
measure advocating voluntary background checks at guns shows that
they had helped to pass.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, created
and financed a system that would allow _ but not oblige _
unlicensed sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks on
buyers. Under current law, only licensed dealers, who represent
about 60 percent of vendors at gun shows, have the ability and
obligation to perform that task.
</P>
<P>
   Unlicensed dealers are people, for example, who do not operate
out of established businesses or who sell guns as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising turn of events, Craig Thursday introduced a
measure to make those backgrounds checks mandatory, as the
Democratic proposal would have. He said it had been his intention
all along, and that his first measure was merely a necessary
prelude to the second.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that after Wednesday's votes, some of his
Republican colleagues had received angry calls from constituents
and had indicated some alarm about that. Democrats said that
Republicans realized they had misjudged the political climate, an
assessment that some Republicans privately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, there was some reflection taking part in the
Republican conference last night, some second thoughts induced by
an inner conscience or perhaps even newspaper comments and
editorials,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who had sponsored
the Democratic measure on gun shows that was narrowly defeated
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's measure included a provision for the keeping of
records of sales at gun shows that Republicans said they had found
to be an unnecessary infringement on the privacy of law-abiding gun
buyers. The National Rifle Association had the same complaint.
Craig's new proposal did not include such a provision.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the second day in a row that a debate over gun
control took center stage in the Senate's consideration of a
broader juvenile justice bill whose fate has yet to be decided. The
House has not yet taken up a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control measures were being offered as amendments to
that bill, which would create $1 billion in federal grants to
toughen prosecution and punishment of juvenile crime and, to a
lesser extent, enhance programs to help troubled and violent
children.
</P>
<P>
   None of the measures represented monumental changes in public
policy. But the full airing they were getting, and the Senate's
approval of a few of them, would probably not have occurred a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats asserted that Republicans were in large part
posturing and that Craig's new gun show amendment was filled with
flaws, blind spots and even some relaxing of gun restrictions, like
an elimination of obligatory background checks for some gun
transactions at pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most Swiss-cheesy amendment I've ever seen,'' said
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted, for example, that it did not require unlicensed
dealers to maintain any record of their sales, and he said that
would make it impossible for dealers to verify that they were
conducting the requisite checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loophole you could drive a Mack truck through,''
Schmuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's new proposal corrected a provision of his initial gun
show proposal that had made it easier to transport firearms across
state lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a typo,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that most, if not all, Republicans would vote
for Craig's new gun show amendment, even though all but six
Republicans had voted against Lautenberg's similar measure.

 WASHINGTON: gun shows. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Senators, in addition to Smith of Oregon, who
expressed concern to Craig about Wednesday's votes included John
McCain of Arizona, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Susan Collins of
Maine. McCain and Collins both rose to speak on the Senate floor
Thursday in favor of background checks.
</P>
<P>
   In comments Thursday morning, President Clinton urged lawmakers
to amend what he saw as Wednesday's mistake. ``For the life of
me,'' Clinton said, ``I can't figure out how they did it or why
they passed up this chance to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are watching this debate,'' the President
added. ``They care very much about the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the result was that the Senate passed, by an
overwhelming majority, 96 to 2, the amendment on semiautomatic
assault weapons, which was sponsored by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   It not only made sales of those weapons to those under 18
illegal, but also make possession of such weapons by children
without parental consent a crime. That merely brings the federal
law on assault weapons into line with the law on handguns, which,
curiously, was more severe.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's amendment included exemptions for assault weapons
used by hunters, ranchers or sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, senators also approved, 59-39, an amendment by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to ban the import of ammunition
clips that enabled assault weapons to fire more than 10 rounds at
once. The manufacture of such clips in America is already illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Republicans joined 39 Democrats in favor of the
amendment, while only four Democrats joined 35 Republicans in
opposition. Two Democrats were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein attributed the outcome to ``a realization that the
American people want some regulation.''

Cubs' revered infield of long ago and much better than the
Baltimore Orioles' shoddy glovework.
</P>
<P>
   The stark difference in defense, on a night when pitchers on
both teams needed all the help they could get, made the ultimate
difference in allowing the Rangers to hold off the Orioles, 15-7,
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our infield defense did an outstanding job tonight,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``We haven't played well defensively. Tonight is
more indicative of how we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense stood out by tying a season high for runs
scored on a night when Juan Gonzalez was sidelined with a strained
right hamstring muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan's been there for us all year,'' outfielder Rusty Greer
said. ``We realize his big bat is out of the lineup but we still
have to take the same approach, day-in and day-out.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense came through early when shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt,
second baseman Mark McLemore and first baseman Lee Stevens turned
four double plays in the first four innings, keeping pitcher Mike
Morgan from total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big,'' Rangers coach Bucky Dent said. ``Double plays
are a pitcher's life-saver, it shuts the inning right down. Those
were big.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates praised the work of Dransfeldt, a rookie called up to
replace the injured Royce Clayton. Oates went as far as to compare
him to Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Junior,'' Oates said. ``He never rushes.
Catch the ball. Throw the ball. He's either going to be out or
safe. He doesn't even bobble a ground ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' defensive collapse soon followed, starting in the
fourth when Roberto Kelly's grand slam, a three-run homer by Rusty
Greer and Rafael Palmeiro's solo shot brought home eight runs and
gave the Rangers a 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Rangers' muscle, the inning might have turned out
differently if second baseman Delino DeShields, with runners at
first and second, had been able to handle a one-hop potential
double play grounder hit by Lee Stevens. Instead he fumbled it for
an error and left the bases loaded for Kelly's blast off losing
pitcher Scott Kamieniecki.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles then killed their chances for a dramatic rally with
four more errors in the sixth. They had cut the Rangers lead to 9-7
by finally getting to Morgan before giving away three runs that
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored three more in the eighth, allowing them to
tie their season high in runs scored. Another footnote: Kelly's
grand slam and the one Rusty Greer hit Tuesday in Chicago marked
the first time in club history the Rangers have hit grand slams in
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was an embarrassing pitching performance for both
teams,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' failure to put the Orioles away after taking a 9-1
lead forced Oates to use reliever Jeff Zimmerman for two more
innings. He retired six straight hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan got his sixth victory, second only in the American League
to Boston's Pedro Martinez, despite allowing 12 of 23 batters to
reach base. He allowed nine hits and three walks and might have
been showering even earlier than usual if it weren't for the double
plays.

ANTLEY TAKES AIM AT TRIPLE CROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A CNN camera crew waits patiently to speak
to Chris Antley. But the jockey who won the Kentucky Derby earlier
this month aboard Charismatic isn't ready. He wants to dispense
investment advice first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on a sec,'' he says to a member of the crew. ``I'll be
right with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the hot stock tip:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my Triple Crown,'' Antley says. ``AOL, Yahoo, CMGI. Buy
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley, in high demand for both his riding abilities on the race
track and his investment advice on the Internet, hopes to win the
Preakness aboard Charismatic on Saturday. A victory there would put
him within one of achieving something only a handful of jockeys
have ever done _ win horse racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he's a guy who takes his investment advice as seriously as
any ride he might get at the track. Perhaps it foreshadows
something momentous; his stock market tips were winners earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Antley got his first ride and discovered the love of his
life _ horse racing. By age 17, he was riding at Pimlico. There, he
had his first taste of victory aboard Vaya Condonero. That year,
1983, Antley was a sensation on the racing circuit. During a 30-day
meet at Monmouth Park, he rode 172 winners.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1987, Antley was the first jockey to win nine races
in one day. He did it at Belmont and it's an accomplishment of
which he is still proud.
</P>
<P>
   Riding came naturally; life was a bit tougher. Antley tested
positive for marijuana and cocaine in 1988 and surrendered his
riding license in '89 because of substance abuse. He won his
license back in 1990 and rode Strike the Gold to victory in the '91
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But a new substance problem arose _ food. Keeping the weight off
became a daily battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep myself together,'' Antley said. ``I tried to
challenge the body, but you always end up in the same spot and it's
not a good place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley was burned out by 1997. He was tired of the diets that
didn't work and the daily trips to the box, a sauna jockeys use
daily to sweat off excess weight. So he packed his bags, returned
home to Columbia, S.C., and moved in with his father, who was
selling propane.
</P>
<P>
   He was out of racing and rumors of his demise circulated at race
tracks and in Internet discussion groups devoted to horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was on the Internet that Antley began building another
following with his timely investment advice. Every morning at 2
a.m., he would rise to compile ``The Antman Report'' and e-mail it
to anyone interested.
</P>
<P>
   Deep inside, he yearned to return to racing. Being out of work
was no picnic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually weighed 147,'' Antley said. ``I got on the scale
and it hit me. So that's when I started running.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran miles every day, watched his diet and half-jokingly
promised his father he would win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it started out with sarcasm,'' Antley said. ``We
started to make it like a routine, where I was getting near getting
back. We were making jokes about it, but I kept thinking, the
Derby's in May and I sure would like to be a part of it and
wouldn't it be neat to win it?''
</P>
<P>
   A slim, trim Antley resurfaced in Southern California during
Santa Anita's winter/spring meet. At 118 pounds, he's getting the
most out of every horse he rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's riding better than I've ever seen him,'' said veteran
handicapper Jack Karlik. ``It's really something.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the spring with Chris and saw an intensity in him I'd
never seen before,'' Lukas said on Derby Day. ``I just thought he
was a great fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley's drive to be a success on the race track again appealed
to Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hungry and has a passion to get back into the upper
echelon of this sport,'' Lukas said. ``He's also won the Derby
before, he finishes well and he's very confident. I loved the way
he looked right at me and said, `We'll get it done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Derby, Antley had never seen Charismatic in the flesh.
And perhaps he didn't have to actually meet the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our day,'' he said. ``You know how it is when you are
in that kind of situation? You can't try to figure out how lucky
you were or how it happened. You just take it all in and let it
soak in.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley recognizes that while his riding career has had many ups
and downs, nothing compares to the experience of coming back to win
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had ever really been proud of
myself,'' he said in his soft Southern drawl. ``Not just proud of
an accomplishment because I happened to be in the right place at
the right time, or because it was the best horse or this and that.
This was something that was a feeling. . . . I knew I got back.''

`SEXUAL PREDATOR' LAW IS UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ An Arizona law that allows the indefinite
hospitalization of `'sexual predators'' like Harold Vroman Ray _
who hogties, tortures and sodomizes his victims _ was upheld
Thursday by the Arizona Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the court said that the law not only is
constitutional but goes above and beyond other states' because it
guarantees treatment for predators.
</P>
<P>
   In affirming the law, the judges said the law serves two
purposes: protection of the public from sexually violent persons
and treatment of those persons so that they may return to society.
</P>
<P>
   They said the law is not punitive even though defendants are
committed to the state hospital after having completed their prison
terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a civil, not a criminal matter, similar to an individual
being committed to the state hospital for a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any confinement . . . is to allow treatment and to protect the
public, not to punish for past crimes,'' wrote Judge Rebecca White
Berch. Judge Sheldon Weisberg concurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the sole dissenting opinion, Judge Thomas Kleinschmidt argued
that the law is unfair because most defendants were not told they
could be detained for life when they signed plea agreements. The
law did not go into effect until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited Arizona's dismal record for treating the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to trust the state on this point,'' he wrote.
``The state's record in caring for and treating the mentally ill is
not a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the defense attorneys representing 13 clients who filed
the special action, called the ruling ``disappointing'' but
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the judges think this is an unattractive
population,'' attorney Barbara Spencer said. ``They're certainly
not going to take any political risks to try and uphold the
constitutional rights of these defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their civil rights and constitutional rights are violated and
will continue to be violated as long as this statute is in
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law allows prosecutors to seek confinement in the state
hospital for sexual predators who are about to be released from
prison. In order to be labeled a predator, a defendant must be
convicted at least once for a sexual crime and be diagnosed as
having a mental disorder that makes him likely to engage in sexual
violence in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws in other states have been upheld, and the U.S.
Supreme Court has even upheld laws that do not provide for any
treatment, said Cindi Nannetti, bureau chief of the sex crimes unit
for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say there is a certain group of sex offenders that
treatment is not going to do any good,'' Nannetti said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 men have been confined as predators, she said. Some
are contesting their confinement. Others, like Derick Martin, are
requesting confinement and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Nannetti said Arizona's law provides added
protections for sexual predators, including annual reviews to
determine whether they are still a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also has ``least restrictive alternatives'' that allow
some predators in treatment to work during the day with electronic
monitoring bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyer Spencer said she and others likely will appeal the
ruling to the state Supreme Court because their clients are being
treated like prisoners, not patients.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients have been subjected to searches with dogs, must wear
special clothes that identify them from other patients, and are
placed in handcuffs and shackles when taken to court, she said. &QL;

RANGERS NEED TO RESIST PULL OF JULY 31 CURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis could easily be playing for the National League
All-Star team this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that on July 31 when the Rangers are in contention,
their starting rotation still has serious problems and general
manager Doug Melvin is under severe pressure _ again _ to come
riding to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is very plausible, especially considering it comes
around every summer. A prolonged winning streak could change that,
but a killer June schedule could easily raise the panic level and
push Melvin toward the annual quick fix at the farm system's
everlasting expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we don't have to do that,'' Melvin said. ``It gets
expensive for your farm system. I'm hoping we do play well enough
where we can get a big lead and all we have to do is fine-tune the
club. Maybe this is the year where we try to win without making a
trade that hurts our farm system.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin knows the Rangers' farm system is close to being
productive again. The problem is resisting the pressure both he and
former general manager Tom Grieve have had to face every summer
when the team is in contention and the public starts screaming for
pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin succumbed last year on July 31, when the Rangers were one
game behind the Anaheim Angels. Melvin sent third baseman Tatis,
pitcher Darren Oliver and minor-league outfielder Mark Little to
the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop
Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, to fill the hole created at third base, he
traded minor-league pitcher Daniel DeYoung and infielder Jose Santo
_ two quality Class-A prospects _ to the Marlins for Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   The deals were lauded for giving the Rangers a much better
chance to win the division and compete with the Yankees in the
playoffs. Turns out the Rangers did win the division _ a dubious
proposition without the trade _ but got swept in the playoffs by
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rangers may end up in the same position again. They
clearly have a good chance of winning the division. It is also
clear they have no better than the third-best team in the American
League, a distant third at that behind the Yankees and the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to swing a deal mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they don't trade Ruben Mateo. How about Mike Zywica?
Kelly Dransfeldt? Ryan Glynn? He's 3-0 with a league-leading 1.64
earned-run average at Triple-A Oklahoma. There is also the Double-A
Tulsa staff of Derrick Cook, Doug Davis, Corey Lee, Ted Silva and
Danny Kolb. Tulsa has the lowest team ERA in the Texas League.
</P>
<P>
   For who?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious choice is Curt Schilling, if he is available. But
it's still questionable if adding Schilling could pull the Rangers
even with the Yankees or the Indians. Kenny Rogers? He left his
last start with the Athletics with a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   One long-held view is that when a team has a chance to win, it
should go all out to do so, because the chance might not come again
for a long time. But the Rangers have been in competition almost
every year without clearing the final hurdle. It's time to try
something different.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers should try leaving the farm system alone for just
one summer and see if what they sow reaps greater benefits then
what they've been getting. What they've been getting hasn't been
all that much.

MEG GREENFIELD REMEMBERED WARMLY IN BOTH WASHINGTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Meg Greenfield, 68, editorial page editor of The
Washington Post and a part-time resident of Bainbridge Island,
Wash., died Thursday in Washington, D.C., after a lengthy bout with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield was a Seattle native who attained an insider's perch
in Washington, D.C., but brought to it independence and detachment.
</P>
<P>
   She moved late in life to reestablish ties with the place where
she grew up, buying a home on Bainbridge that became a meeting
place for business, political and journalistic figures from both
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt this is where her roots were. She wanted to get back
here,'' said William Ruckelshaus, former U.S. Environmental
Protection Administration director and another Seattle-area
returnee.
</P>
<P>
   Retired University of Washington President William Gerberding on
Thursday summed up a quality that drew people to Greenfield, and
gave force to her writing. ``She was witty and wise and deeply
immersed in big-time politics,'' he said. ``She managed to have a
wry, detached perspective on power while being right in the middle
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bainbridge, Greenfield was renowned for her July Fourth
parties and the people who would get to know each other. She
introduced billionaire investor Warren Buffett, a house guest on
Bainbridge, to Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very proud of bringing people from the East Coast out
to Bainbridge Island so they could see the other Washington. She
introduced a lot of people to this state,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield wrote a biweekly Newsweek column for the past 25
years, and was The Post's editorial page editor since 1979. A Post
editorial writer since 1968, she won the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for
editorial writing with editorials on civil rights, international
relations and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she wanted to retire out here, but she had a terrible
time retiring,'' said Ruckelshaus.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield was renowned for her entertaining, whether it was
Washington D.C., guests like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New
York Democrat, discoursing around the circular dinner table of her
Georgetown home, or lifelong Seattle friends enjoying her garden on
Bainbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield was born in Seattle on Dec. 27, 1930. She was the
daughter of Lewis James Greenfield, an antique furniture dealer,
and Lorraine Nathan Greenfield. She graduated from the Bush School,
went on to graduate summa cum laude from Smith College, and earned
a Fulbright scholarship which she spent at Cambridge University
studying the poetry of William Blake.
</P>
<P>
   She was identified early with liberal politics, working for
Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson in 1956, and moving
on to The Reporter. She stayed with the magazine until it stopped
publication in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   At The Reporter, she gained renown for such articles as one
titled ``Richard Nixon's Prose Style,'' which schooled readers on
how to interpret language used by the future president. Whenever
Nixon claimed to be taking a daring stand or going against his
advisers, Greenfield wrote, an untruth was sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a fairly traditional liberal at the outset,'' said
Gerberding, ``but she underwent a period of change as she grew
older, and liberal verities came into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of her onetime associates became neo-conservatives. A
lot of those people joined the Republican Party and became fans of
Ronald Reagan. It didn't happen to Meg. Her political trajectory
was more confined. She ceased being a party line liberal _ whatever
that means _ but she didn't become a neo-conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield sounded fairly conservative themes during a 1992
Seattle talk. She questioned the wisdom of broadly written hate
crime laws. She urged members of the audience to ``fight like
tigers against government attempts to substitute its judgment for
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield was also a critic of attack TV, sound-bite politics,
and the increasingly confrontational atmosphere of life in the
nation's capital. A 1989 column wondered about the blizzard of
petty accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long around here, we... go around implying that the
other fellow is lying, trimming, gouging, feathering his nest,
murdering the innocent and otherwise violating everything that
upright people hold dear,'' she wrote. ``The effect of this
constant play is that we lose the ability to recognize a genuine
moral dereliction when we see one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Greenfield was appreciated by friends in both
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   Gerberding recalled her generosity to the University of
Washington, where she set up a scholarship in classics to honor her
late brother. She ``cared deeply about this state,'' Dicks added.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield once lamented that she was ``a passionate, failed
gardner'' but the self-description was disputed Thursday by the
University of Washington's longtime lobbyist, Dr. Jack Lein. ``The
garden (on Bainbridge) was a masterpiece,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Milius, an editorial board colleague at The Post, described
Greenfield as the best editor he ever encountered. Her
craftsmanship with words was ``a little like being at the eye
doctor, where he drops lens after lens until the right focus
appears in front of your eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield was ``incorrigibly funny,'' Milius added. ``She loved
nothing more than to deflate. It is a useful impulse to have in
this town.''
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle memorial service for Greenfield will be held at 11:30
a.m. Monday at Temple De Hirsch Sinai in Seattle.

   Out front, center stage, Kansas State suffered as public a
pratfall as any team in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Wildcats were 15 minutes of football from
playing for a national championship before Texas A&AMP;M rallied for a
shocking 36-33 overtime victory in the Big 12 Conference
championship game. Instead of playing in the Fiesta Bowl, Kansas
State wound up in the Alamo Bowl, where it suffered a desultory
37-34 loss to Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Kansas State football also has been torn
asunder. When former Wildcats assistant Bob Stoops was hired at
Oklahoma, he quickly hired Kansas State assistants Mike Stoops (his
brother) and Brent Venables.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those hirings came after the A&AMP;M loss and further
depressed a program that had watched its dream season turn
nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything, isn't it?'' Kansas State coach Bill
Snyder said. ``It was not an easy task to work our way through
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few days after the Purdue loss, assistant Mark Mangino
left the Wildcats' staff to join the exodus to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. It gets worse. Snyder hired Rex Ryan, who was Oklahoma's
defensive coordinator last season. But in February, Ryan left to
take an NFL assistant coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's decision came close to signing day and presaged another
body blow. Mostly because of the hiring of Mike Stoops and
Venables, running back James Mozee of Blue Springs, Mo., changed
his mind and signed with Oklahoma instead of Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always concerns when things like that happen,''
Snyder said. ``But stuff happens. It's part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff turnover can be expected, especially at a program that has
been successful. But replacing four assistants _ that's typical of
a program mired in losing that's trying to find the right
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, though, says that the coaching staff transition has been
eased in that his four new assistants are all coaching veterans.
Defensive coordinator Phil Bennett, for instance, has coached at
TCU, Texas A&AMP;M, Iowa State, Purdue, LSU and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his assistants must replace eight offensive starters,
including do-it-all quarterback Michael Bishop. But while Snyder
wasn't pleased with his team's spring progress, he didn't sense any
hangover from his team's last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last December was a difficult time, particularly the first
loss,'' Snyder said. ``Getting ready for the Alamo Bowl was a
tremendously difficult task. Hindsight would tell you we probably
should have packed our bags and waited for a better day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all put that behind us. Youngsters are pretty
resilient. It's us old guys that sometimes don't bounce back as
quickly.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series has had preliminary discussions
about adding a fifth bowl to its lineup. The idea would be to
create two more at-large bids for deserving teams that wind up
losing late-season games (see: Kansas State, 1998). The earliest a
fifth bowl could be added would be after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Chryst, who was named Mid-American Conference commissioner
this week, is a former Southwest Conference assistant commissioner.
He's leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference, where he's assistant
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma
staged a benefit baseball game to raise money for tornado victims.
An estimated $55,000 was raised as 10,172 showed up to watch the
Sooners beat the Cowboys, 10-9.

BOEING TO CUT UP TO 7,000 JOBS IN ST. LOUIS JET FIGHTER PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Having lost out on a key contract to defense rival
Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. announced Thursday that it will
eliminate as many as 7,000 jobs at its St. Louis fighter aircraft
plant between now and mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   That's about 35 percent of Boeing's work force in St. Louis,
headquarters of its Military Aircraft and Missiles group.
</P>
<P>
   With those cuts, the Seattle-based aerospace giant could end
next year with about 53,000 fewer workers companywide than it had
at the peak of employment in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing previously announced it would eliminate 43,000 to 53,000
jobs by the end of the 2000. That would reduce employment
companywide to between 185,000 and 195,000, from a peak of 238,000
last July.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts in St. Louis fall within Boeing's earlier
forecasts, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not change our projection,'' he said. ``But we will
definitely be at the lower end (185,000) by the end of 2000. Beyond
that, it's unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   As of May 1, Boeing's employment companywide was 217,000, of
which 88,600 jobs were in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the job cuts in St. Louis, Boeing said it will
halt production, at least temporarily, of its F-15 fighter line
once the last plane now on order is delivered to the U.S. Air Force
in early 2000. The company previously said it would halt production
in mid-2000 of its F-18C/D line.
</P>
<P>
   The two fighter programs were acquired by Boeing in the 1997
merger with McDonnell Douglas. Both have been highly profitable,
but Boeing has been unable to win news orders. The F-15 and F-18
are being widely used in the air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis announcement was not entirely unexpected in the
wake of last month's decision by Greece to buy F-16s from Lockheed
Martin rather than F-15s from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders there said they were shocked by the size of
the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there would be layoffs, but not of this magnitude,''
said Rick Smith, president of District 837 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lost the sales, we all expected something to happen,
but not this quickly and not this big. These are all good,
relatively high-paying jobs. It's not going to be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 workers in St. Louis are involved in the F-15
program.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, more than 1,500 F-15s have been built for the air
forces of the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had been counting on Greece to order up to 35 F-15s,
which could have extended production of the fighter for another two
years. Instead, Greece chose the new Eurofighter and the F-16 built
by Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   At about $60 million, the more advanced F-15 cost twice as much
as the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing still hopes to win new F-15 orders from Israel, though
published reports say Israel has decided to buy fighters from
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's air force reportedly recommended in a closed-door
meeting Thursday that the government award the $2.5 billion
fighter-plane contract to Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who chaired the Tel Aviv
meeting of top defense officials, put off choosing between Lockheed
and Boeing at least until next week, making a decision unlikely
before Israel's general election Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense experts say the air force wants the F-16 because Israel
can get twice as many planes at the same price.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a remote possibility Israel could split the
order, those experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel ordered 25 of the most advanced version of the
Boeing fighter, the F-15I. The last of those planes recently was
delivered. The only F-15s still in the production line are
replacement planes for the U.S. Air Force and the last of a
72-plane order for Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Boeing won new orders from Israel, deliveries would not
begin until 2001, and that means a break in the F-15 line when the
last plane now on order is delivered early next year, Boeing
spokeswoman JoAnne Davis in St. Louis said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's decision will not affect Boeing's plans to eliminate
6,200 to 7,000 jobs in St. Louis by mid-2001, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we completed an assessment of our business environment
based on the April 30 decision by the government of Greece, we
decided to let our team and the community know as soon as possible
what to expect for the foreseeable future,'' Jerry Daniels,
Boeing's vice president and general manager for its St. Louis
operations, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   As of May 1, Boeing employment in Missouri was 20,150.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15 line has been an important source of revenue for
Boeing. The company will deliver 38 of the fighters this year.
Costing an estimated $60 million each, the 39 deliveries mean about
$2.3 billion for Boeing in 1999. And that is nearly 20 percent of
Boeing's projected 1999 revenue of $12 billion for its entire
Military Aircraft and Missiles unit.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing might have to take a one-time charge to pay for parts it
ordered, expecting to win the Greek order. Because of the long lead
time in getting parts, Boeing had no choice but to order parts so
it could be ready to continue F-15 production.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the new F-18E/F Super Hornet that Boeing has just
started building for the Navy will more than make up for lost F-15
revenue, but it will take time for the program to become as
profitable as the F-15, which has been in production since the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 5,000 or so St. Louis employees working on
the F-15 program, some 6,000 to 7,000 build the F-18C/D Hornet and
the new F-18-E/F Super Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   Production on the Hornet line will stop in mid-2000. Just like
with the F-15, production of the Hornet could be restarted if
Boeing gets additional orders. But potential Hornet orders from
countries in Latin America
</P>
<P>
   and Central Europe have been de-
</P>
<P>
   layed.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15 line was shut down once before, then was restarted with
the order from Saudi Arabia.

AGENCIES READY TO DO WHAT THEY CAN FOR KOSOVO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Puget Sound-area rescue agencies say they expect and
can accommodate an estimated 250 to 500 Kosovo refugees as the
region's share of about 20,000 who have been promised shelter in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They could be arriving at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to help these people become as fully independent
and self-sufficient as they can be,'' said Cindy Koser, director of
refugee resettlement for Catholic Community Services in Seattle.
``But we will offer only what they will be able and willing to
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Koser said the ethnic-Albanian Kosovars are expected to arrive
with little more than the clothes on their backs. But because of
their war experiences, they will be packing plenty of emotional
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the fears of these people will go away
easily,'' Koser said. ``But with the help of mental-health
professionals, we'll try to alleviate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic needs will come first. Housing, food, furniture and
medical care top the list. Refugee children will be integrated into
local schools. English-language lessons will be available for
adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, programs are available to aquaint the newcomers
with community assets and culture. Employment assistance and/or
welfare benefits also are offered.
</P>
<P>
   Koser's agency is among a handful locally given federal money to
help resettle refugees who arrive without private support. Included
are the Episcopal Migration Ministries, the Lutheran Refugee
Project, World Relief and the International Rescue Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue Committee Director Bob Johnson said Thursday word of the
refugees' arrival remains ``up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first groups are now being processed at Fort Dix, N.J.,''
he said. ``Beyond that, we've only been asked how many can we take,
and we've provided that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Holter, the World Relief spokesman in Spokane, said his
organization will be able to place between six and 10 families
through churches there. Holter said he was told to expect the
newcomers within the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, however, those who eventually arrive in the
Northwest will be a fraction of Kosovo's refugees. According to the
United Nations High Command for Refugees in Geneva, Switzerland,
more than 750,000 ethnic Albanians have been chased from their
homes to seek shelter in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   By the United Nation's reckoning, nearly 4,000 have been
accepted by countries beyond the Balkans, including the 1,861 who
have arrived in the United States so far, including 482 who arrived
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most spent months in ill-equipped refugee camps in Albania and
Macedonia where there has been little clean water, virtually no
sanitation and few services.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations organization, another
million-plus refugees are thought to be homeless and hiding inside
Kosovo under even worse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dinh Kuno, director of Snohomish County's Refugee and
Immigrant Forum at Everett Community College, said the United
States, again, will be a willing host, especially at the local
level, where offers of help are pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals as well as groups such as Our Savior's Lutheran
Church in Everett, Wash., have responded, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Our Savior's pastor, the Rev. David Parks, said helping refugees
is part of his congregation's 100-year-old history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already raised $2,000 and we've formed a committee,'' he
said. ``But right now we can only wait to see what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuno was among the so-called ``boat people'' who fled Vietnam a
quarter-century ago. In her case, she sailed with 300 others in a
boat jammed so tightly there was barely room to sit. Her passage
took her to the Philippines, but her journey extended from there to
Guam and on to a military base in Arkansas. Eventually she was sent
to Minnesota where two churches came to her aid.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, she has made the best of it, earning a
degree in biochemistry at the University of Minnesota, and, after
determining that refugee work was more to her liking, got a
bachelor's degree in human services from the University of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kuno said education was her leg up over the barriers she faced
as a refugee. The same will prove true for this latest wave, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first year or two everything will be overwhelming,
like it or not,'' she said. ``They'll have to do what it takes to
survive. But we hope to be ready to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Depression is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I work with suffer from it,'' she said.
``There is guilt over leaving loved ones. Here they'll have plenty
of food and a roof over their heads. Eventually, they will begin
losing hope that they'll ever see home again, and from there,
mental-health issues will surface _ lost sleep, no appetite, some
may even hear voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will all want to go home. All refugees do,'' Kuno said.
Unlike immigrants, she said, refugees don't plan to come here and
never had a chance to say goodbye to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   For Hungarian-American Paul Juhasz of Seattle, more than 54
years have failed to dim memories of refugee life in Europe and
America following World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With the certainty of his 85 years, Paul Juhasz can see the
future for this latest group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who come will be lost to Kosovo, that is for sure,'' he
said. ``But what Kosovo drains, the U.S. gains, especially with the
young people. This is a rich country. They will find a better
future here.''

ANGELS SHUT OUT YANKEES, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sheen of invincibility the Yankees donned last
season is gone, the last of it peeled away on Thursday night by the
Anaheim Angels, who completed a three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium
with a 2-0 shutout, the first visiting team sweep since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, told his players in spring
training that they should forget about trying to live up to the
great expectations created last year, that 1998 was an incredible
season that would be virtually impossible to re-create. The '99
Yankees are 20-13 _ they didn't suffer their 13th loss last year
until June 21 _ and now they can fully understand what Torre meant.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about '98. Focus on what they are in '99, which is a
well-above-average team that is capable of losing streaks, mental
mistakes and erratic fielding. The Yankees are a slumping team
starved for hits and runs, and stuffed with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu pitched superbly for seven innings, as David Cone
did Wednesday in a 1-0 loss. Irabu held the Angels scoreless until
Mo Vaughn homered in the sixth inning, but the Yankees could not
push across any runs. They have gone scoreless for 19 consecutive
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense right now is sputtering,'' said Don Zimmer, the
Yankees' interim manager. ``Who knows, we might score nine runs
tomorrow. But we've watched this for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels arrived four days ago devastated by injuries, their
active roster stacked with journeymen and burdened by a four-game
losing streak. But Chuck Finley shut New York out for eight innings
Wednesday, and Omar Olivares did the same for six and two-thirds
innings on Thursday night, as the Yankee hitters began swinging
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill's current plight is a microcosm of the team slump.
He goes through an evolution when he is struggling: at the outset
of any string of poor at-bats, he talks to himself after passing
first base, his head sometimes turning with each syllable. When the
slump deepens, he can explode with anger, throwing helmets and bats
and batting gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in the third stage of his evolution _ despair, which
was on full display Thursday night. When the game began, O'Neill
was without a hit in his last 14 at-bats with runners in scoring
position, a streak dating to May 1. With runners at first and third
and two out in the third inning, O'Neill grounded out. After
crossing the base, O'Neill's head dropped, his shoulders shrunk,
and he quietly pulled off his batting gloves and placed them in his
helmet resignedly.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, O'Neill had a significant opportunity to end
his despair. Bases loaded and one out, the game scoreless. Olivares
appeared to be wilting, ripe for O'Neill to pounce, as he had done
in previous meetings. Going into the game, O'Neill had 7 hits in 17
at-bats (.412) in his career against Olivares. But O'Neill weakly
slapped a grounder to second baseman Randy Velarde, who initiated a
rally-killing double play, and O'Neill's body language emanated
pure self-loathing as he crossed first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try and make it all happen at once, on one pitch,''
O'Neill said. ``I'm speaking for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been speaking for everybody. Chuck Knoblauch is 0
for 12 since he was roll-blocked last week in Minnesota. Tino
Martinez went 0 for 4. Bernie Williams is averaging 3.11 pitches
for each plate appearance, the fourth-lowest figure in the American
League, and he is on a pace to draw 35 walks, after drawing 74 last
year. He is hitting about 20 percent more grounders than in 1998,
at least partly accounting for his decrease in extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, the catcher, cannot remember slumping worse than
he has this year. Going into the game, the switch-hitter was
batting .182 over all, but while batting left-handed, his average
was .146 with 21 strikeouts in 48 at-bats. He often appeared lost
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Posada showed signs of breaking out,
hammering a double off the top of the fence in left-center field in
the fifth and hitting the ball hard in his other at-bats. Posada
was stranded, however, when O'Neill hit into the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five Yankees to bat in the sixth inning reached
base, and they could not score. Williams was caught stealing with
one out, and after Chili Davis walked and Shane Spencer ripped a
single, Scott Brosius grounded into a forceout to close the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Yankees had runners at first and second and
one out, and Spencer and Brosius could not deliver, prompting most
in the crowd of 40,619 to leave Yankee Stadium. The Yankees are
without a hit in their last 17 at-bats with runners in scoring
position, dating to the third inning of Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to keep playing hard,'' Williams said. ``Good
things are going to happen, sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Good things always happened in 1998. But it's not 1998. The
Yankees know that, now.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How does John Elway, NFL team president and
part-owner sound?
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who retired after a legendary career with the Denver
Broncos less than two weeks ago, has suddenly become the golden boy
in the battle between the two competing groups bidding to earn the
NFL's Los Angeles franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In separate meetings Thursday, Elway listened to both groups,
and each discussion included not only an minority ownership
possibility, but that of running the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't Los Angeles, and professional football, and the
opportunity of management at a very high level _ possibly the
president _ this wouldn't be a consideration,'' said Marvin Demoff,
his agent. ``It is a unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, his wife, Jan, and Demoff met first with Ovitz for
approximately an hour, and then later for about the same time with
Eli Broad and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the most exciting news I could have ever heard,
that John Elway would be interested in being the president of a
team in Los Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``I think it's a magical way
to make all this work very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, however, decided to keep his thoughts on the meetings
private. Not wanting to show favoritism between the two groups, and
being careful not to offend Denver, he opted out of the scheduled
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Demoff said Elway, a former Granada Hills High School star,
still had much to digest before making a decision whether to join
one of the Los Angeles groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the level of interest in Los Angeles, while
flattering, caught John off-guard,'' Demoff said. ``We were looking
at broadcasting opportunities, Denver Bronco opportunity, some
business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the last 10 days, Los Angeles presented itself and it's
exciting to him. He truly doesn't know enough to even start to make
an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has a standing offer to become a minority owner with Pat
Bowlen with the Broncos. But Bowlen plans to continue to run the
team for an additional 10 or more years, and if Elway wants to
direct his own team, he will have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be a great member of the Coliseum partners
team,'' Broad said. ``We need someone of his caliber to run the
franchise if it's awarded to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't discuss percentages, but we prefer whoever is in
management to also be an owner. We like linking ownership and
management.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners are next scheduled to meet May 25-26 in Atlanta.
Broad said he and partner Ed Roski Jr. plan to present financial
and parking plans at that meeting, and are hopeful a Los Angeles
owner will be chosen to meet their September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But Demoff said he doesn't expect Elway to align himself with
either group by the May meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a unique opportunity, it's important for him to
explore it fully and this is really just the very beginning of
that,'' Demoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday did allow Elway to make it clear to both Ovitz and
Broad that he wanted to actively run the team. And it allowed both
potential owners to embrace the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made it clear he doesn't want to be just a celebrity,''
Broad said. ``He wants to start a new career and he said in my new
career I want to be as successful as I was in my last career. And I
believe he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made an offer. We did not say, John, we want you
to become president at these terms. We said, We want you. We think
you'd be a great asset to this franchise. It would help us create a
type of excitement we need here and hopefully help us create a team
that in the not-too-distant future will be looking at some Super
Bowl rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad also used Thursday's press conference to take a page out
of Ovitz's book. Broad said he would be broadening his ownership
group in the next few weeks to include members of the entertainment
industry. &QL;

AVALANCHE CRUSH RED WINGS, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Stanley Cup reign of the Detroit Red Wings is in
jeopardy because of injury and ineffectiveness in goal. The injured
goalie is Chris Osgood, who has not played since the first round of
the playoffs because of a sprained right knee. The ineffective
goalie is Bill Ranford, who played so well in the first two games
of this second-round series, both won by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Ranford was pulled for the second consecutive
game, this one a 6-2 Colorado Avalanche victory before a grumbling
crowd at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rocks your confidence; no doubt about that,'' Ranford said.
``But it's still 2-2; we'll have to go back to Colorado and steal
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   The result evened the four-of-seven-game Western Conference
semifinal series at two victories apiece. All four games have been
won by the visiting team. The round will resume on Sunday with Game
5 in Denver. Game 6 will be in Detroit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Osgood has resumed practice and seemed more agile in
recent days, it was not known on Thursday if he would be able to
play on Sunday. Even if he plays, it is difficult to predict how
sharp he will be after missing more than two weeks. And even if
Osgood is at his best, it is no sure thing that he can pull the Red
Wings out of their nose dive. Last spring, Detroit won its second
consecutive Stanley Cup championship despite Osgood's tendency to
allow the occasional soft goal on long shots.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman, the Detroit coach, said Osgood ``wasn't 100
percent'' when he worked out on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's close,'' Bowman said. ``He hasn't had a full workout. A
lot will depend on how he does in the workouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's opponent at the other end of the ice will again be
Patrick Roy, who stopped 31 of 33 shots on Thursday night and
showed the old confidence and cockiness that helped his teams win
the cup in Montreal in 1986 and in Colorado in 1996. After stopping
pucks, Roy would sometimes swat them away with his big paddle or
flick his wrist while securing them in the big glove on his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford gave up a goal just 88 seconds into the game, on a
rebound by Chris Drury. Then he was replaced by Norm Maracle at 14
minutes 4 seconds of the second period after Milan Hejduk scored on
a power play to give Colorado a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said he replaced Ranford not because of that goal in
particular but because his team was behind by three. ``I thought we
needed to get some kind of boost,'' he said. ``Tonight did not look
too even.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is well done; it's finished. Next game we will try
to put the pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many goalies might have stopped the low shot between
the skates, Ranford was not the only Wing to blame on this one.
Chris Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson, two veteran defensemen obtained
at the trading deadline on March 23, were skating pirouettes behind
their goal line as the Colorado attackers eluded them and worked
the puck toward the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Like them, Ranford was obtained at the deadline to bolster a
championship team that had slipped to mediocrity during the regular
season. The fourth veteran obtained that day was Wendel Clark, also
ineffective on Thursday night as the teamwide slump spread through
the home team like a virus. The Wings had swept Anaheim in four
games in the first round. Colorado needed six games to eliminate
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an embarrassment,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Deadmarsh scored twice for Colorado. Valery Kamensky and
Peter Forsberg got the others. Slava Kozlov ended Roy's shutout
with two goals late in the third period as the game took on the
sloppy character of an exhibition. The Avalanche played a
disciplined style with tight checking and avoided the unprovoked
penalties that had marred its style in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   One factor bolstering the Avalanche in the last two games has
been the return of Kamensky from a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Kamensky, Roy said: ``I think Kamensky coming
back is huge. It let us put Deadmarsh on the third line and gave us
a solid third line.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he could explain his team's pattern in this
series, Roy replied: ``Nope. Now, the question is if we can build
confidence in our own building.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings have been hurt by the loss of Igor Larionov, who has
missed the last two games with a cast on his left hand to cover
what the Wings say is a dislocated finger.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said of Larionov: ``He's a good setup player. You miss a
solid playmaking type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hartley, the Colorado coach, said of Roy: ``Patrick gave us
the big saves at the right time. Every time we're forced to face
adversity, we've responded well.'' &QL;

</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   It is probably too much to expect from Russia's Communist
legislators, but they ought to drop their misguided impeachment
drive against Boris Yeltsin before it further destabilizes the
Kremlin. No good can come of this needless confrontation, and it
could produce a protracted crisis that leaves Russia even more
wounded than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   The case has simmered for months, periodically used by the
Communists as a club against Yeltsin, but it is now moving rapidly
toward a vote by the Duma, possibly before the week is out.
Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has
galvanized his opponents, and they may now be within reach of the
simple majority they need in the lower house of Parliament.
Fortunately, additional steps are required before Yeltsin can be
removed, including approval by two high courts and by two-thirds of
the upper house. Those hurdles are probably insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   But even a Duma vote to impeach will compound Moscow's political
problems. Though the Russian Constitution forbids a sitting
president from dissolving Parliament after the lower house has
approved impeachment charges, Yeltsin is quite capable of trying to
shut down the legislature anyway. The same Constitution empowers
the president to disband Parliament and call new elections if the
Duma votes three times to reject his choice for prime minister.
These clauses could soon be in conflict, for Sergei Stepashin, the
newly designated prime minister, may be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   This impasse might be unavoidable if the case against Yeltsin
were legitimate. Certainly, he has been an erratic and increasingly
ineffective leader, partly because of declining health. But that is
not grounds for impeachment. The Communists, looking for any excuse
to remove him, have assembled an outlandish case. It charges
Yeltsin with responsibility for the dismantling of the Soviet Union
and the impoverishment of the Russian military. He is also
implausibly accused of waging a campaign of genocide against the
Russian people with his economic policies. The only remotely
tenable charge involves the war in Chechnya, which Yeltsin
conducted without seeking the approval of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Russia desperately needs steady, democratic leadership.
Stepashin may be unproven, but he should be allowed to form a
government and get on with the hard business of reforming and
reviving the economy. Impeachment is a senseless and potentially
damaging distraction. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A SHIFTING FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians in Washington have squabbled endlessly
about how to regulate financial services companies, the financial
architecture of the country has changed even as the laws have not.
It is now entirely possible that the restructuring will be
completed while Congress argues _ and in a way that seriously
compromises the ability of the most important federal regulators to
supervise major financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A significant new element in the debate was injected last week
by Gov. George Pataki of New York, who proposed state legislation
that would allow financial institutions to offer a full range of
financial services including banking and insurance. In the
byzantine structure of financial regulation in America, that
proposal, if enacted, would allow any New York bank to restructure
in a way that would leave it regulated by a variety of regulators
but not by the Federal Reserve Board or the Comptroller of the
Currency.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 years ago, Congress separated banking and brokerage
firms via the Glass-Steagall Act. But after a series of regulatory
and court decisions, the only meaningful barrier left is one that
keeps insurance underwriters from engaging in banking. That is
important to many companies, among them Chase Manhattan and Merrill
Lynch. Citigroup has only a temporary exemption allowing it to own
Travelers Insurance, and needs a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed New York legislation would provide a way around
that by letting Citigroup set up a New York bank that would engage
in everything except retail banking. It would then set up a thrift
to provide its retail banking services. The difference would be
invisible to consumers, but not to regulators, and that could be
important in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fights that has prevented congressional action has
been a turf war between the Comptroller and the Fed over who will
regulate new large financial entities. The Fed has tried to keep
all of that for itself, freezing out the comptroller. The Pataki
proposal should serve as a warning to the Fed to back off and let
the comptroller continue to share in such regulation, out of the
fear that both will lose if major banks go the New York route.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week passed a bill in this area that is not
adequate. Besides siding with the Fed in the turf war, it also
unreasonably reduces the obligations of banks under the Community
Reinvestment Act, which mandates that banks serve poor communities.
In addition, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, has warned that the bill would leave bank
customers with significantly less protection than is enjoyed by
customers of brokerage firms not part of banks. That is clearly
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to the House to come up with a better bill. It and the
Senate should find a way to pass an acceptable measure quickly, or
they will risk seeing the act become meaningless as New York, and
other states, pass their own legislation.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   There are many people who deserve praise for saving 112
community gardens that were due to be auctioned by New York City
for other purposes. The gardeners themselves have earned a nod for
weeding and cleaning and watering these odd-sized plots for years.
The Trust for Public Land began earnestly negotiating a few months
ago to try to buy some of the gardens. Activists planted lawsuits
in recent days, stalling the date of the auction long enough to
allow for a deal. Protesters converted themselves into ladybugs or
sunflowers and marched off to jail for a good green cause. Even
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administrators, the very ones readying
these patches for auction to the highest and perhaps unsympathetic
bidder, deserve thanks for agreeing to sell the land to those who
wanted to develop little more than grassy triangles, bordered by
nasturtiums or tomato plants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the clincher was a last-minute Saturday-matinee-style
rescue by Bette Midler. The organization that she founded in 1994,
the New York Restoration Project, agreed Wednesday to put up about
$1 million to buy the less desirable gardens not covered in the
Trust for Public Land's offer of $3 million for the better plots.
The combined package saved the 112 gardens and may make it more
difficult for the city to bulldoze other gardens in the future. The
self-proclaimed Queen of Trash, known for her exuberant music,
movies and costumery, this week adds another title _ the Queen of
Green.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How does John Elway, NFL team president and
part-owner sound?
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who retired after a legendary career with the Denver
Broncos less than two weeks ago, has suddenly become the golden boy
in the battle between the two competing groups bidding to earn the
NFL's Los Angeles franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In separate meetings Thursday, Elway listened to both groups,
and each discussion included not only a minority ownership
possibility, but that of running the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't Los Angeles, and professional football, and the
opportunity of management at a very high level _ possibly the
president _ this wouldn't be a consideration,'' said Marvin Demoff,
his agent. ``It is a unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, his wife, Jan, and Demoff met first with Ovitz for
approximately an hour, and then later for about the same time with
Eli Broad and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the most exciting news I could have ever heard,
that John Elway would be interested in being the president of a
team in Los Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``I think it's a magical way
to make all this work very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, however, decided to keep his thoughts on the meetings
private. Not wanting to show favoritism between the two groups, and
being careful not to offend Denver, he opted out of the scheduled
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Demoff said Elway, a former star at Granada Hills High School in
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, still had much to digest before
making a decision whether to join one of the Los Angeles groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the level of interest in Los Angeles, while
flattering, caught John off-guard,'' Demoff said. ``We were looking
at broadcasting opportunities, Denver Bronco opportunity, some
business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the last 10 days, Los Angeles presented itself, and
it's exciting to him. He truly doesn't know enough to even start to
make an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has a standing offer to become a minority owner with Pat
Bowlen with the Broncos. But Bowlen plans to continue to run the
team for an additional 10 or more years, and if Elway wants to
direct his own team, he will have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be a great member of the Coliseum partners

franchise if it's awarded to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't discuss percentages, but we prefer whoever is in

THE PAYTON EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Reflecting upon the season, Paul Westphal knew it was
the superstar that was his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion on him was that he is exactly as advertised,'' he
said. ``He had a great upside with a certain amount of baggage. To
hold that against him is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the Phoenix Suns from firing Westphal, and
trading Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Were you thinking the Sonics and Gary Payton?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the misunderstanding. The situations tend to look alike.
</P>
<P>
   The turbulence around Payton is a major element in the Sonics'
unpleasant early obituary. But in 1996, Westphal as Suns coach had
in Barkley a similar dilemma. There, it cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Phoenix, management and I had a different opinion of
Charles's value and the appropriateness of his role with
teammates,'' Westphal said. ``Here, I'm on the same page with
management about Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that page say about superstars and their teammates?
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that (teammates) tolerate the idiosyncrasies as
much as they embrace the stars' strengths, there will be peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent they can't, there will be problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kinda highfalutin. Whaddyamean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' he said, smiling. ``Gary and Charles
... they ain't changin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crux of the Sonics' millennium remake. Payton
is going to be his usual caustic, belligerent, demanding self.
Anyone who thinks that lipstick will help this pig of a situation
hasn't been around Payton and the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   With four years left on his $87 million contract, the Sonics are
not about to deal him, if for no other reason than superstar trades
rarely work out for the team surrendering them.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, look at what happened when Phoenix in '96
traded Barkley to Houston for Robert Horry, Chucky Brown, Mark
Bryant and Sam Cassell. The Suns haven't advanced beyond the
playoffs' first round since, including Portland's 3-0 sweep this
week.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are rare talents, however infuriating they can be
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sat Gary down, he probably would tell you himself he's
difficult to get along with,'' Westphal said. ``That difficulty
also makes me a big fan, because it's part of his supercompetitive
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can curb it, but you can't instill it. When you
find someone who has it, you build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the parts to fit around Payton is a major trick, one
that will determine the future of club president Wally Walker. It
was plain this year that Payton and Detlef Schrempf were nearing
the end of their tolerance for one another. Same for Payton and
Dale Ellis. Sam Perkins wasn't sorry to leave Payton's company, and
even good pal Vin Baker was stung deeply by Payton's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the word for years on Barkley around the league is
that he eventually wears out everybody he's around. Then again, in
the four years Barkley and Westphal were together in Phoenix, the
Chuckster averaged 23.4 points and 11.5 rebounds in the regular
season, and 26 points and 12 rebounds in the playoffs. He also
helped make Westphal in 1992-93 the winningest rookie head coach in
NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   So wear me out, Westphal is saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest similarity is that Gary and Charles are
strong-willed, unique individuals,'' he said. ``You must be very
confident and mature to flourish with them as teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Egad. A player has to be mature? In the NBA? Good luck, Wally.
</P>
<P>
   When asked this week about potential roster changes, Walker
would confirm only that he wanted his core back. When pressed as to
the identity of the core, Walker mentioned only Payton and Baker,
with some approving nods thrown to the three rookies, Rashard
Lewis, Jelani McCoy and Vladimir Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   It must be presumed that everyone else is in play, either via
trades or free agency. But whoever is brought in has to get along
with Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal doesn't believe that is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you don't rise to people's expectations, the
microscopes come out,'' Westphal said. ``Some of the same problems
are there when you win, but when you lose, they're magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever recall a team that always had smooth sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Westphal also doesn't want another repetition of his last
year in Phoenix, where his previous seasons of 62, 56 and 59 wins
were forgotten in a 14-19 start tainted by perceptions that Barkley
had run him over. He wants Payton to give some, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Gary has to shoot as much as he did, especially
as many threes,'' he said. ``His best role is to play a little
less, distribute the ball a little more and have more scoring
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Payton's messianic tendencies, is that likely?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a summer to plan and piece things together that will
give us a much better chance to succeed,'' he said. ``I think Gary
and I came a long way. We have a chance this summer to go
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like the optimism of the coach who has lived again after
being killed by a coach-killing player. Dying that way once
inspires the victim to avoid repetition.

SWEEPLESS IN HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two straight wins and one devastating rout had the
Lakers poised to sweep a Hall of Fame trio out of the first round
of the playoffs. And then an obvious truth set in: Old legends
don't go down that easily.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, all but left for dead after two ineffective
games, morphed back into the multitalented, end-to-end weapon that
won six rings in Chicago. And he left a stunned Lakers team in his
wake, scoring a career playoff-high 37 points to lead the Houston
Rockets to a 102-88 victory Thursday at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen wasn't dunking and driving and hitting open
3-pointers, Charles Barkley was backing into the basket, scoring 30
points and grabbing 26 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' victory cut the Lakers' series lead to 2-1, with a
chance to tie it Saturday at Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers could do afterward was tip their hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's disappointing,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They're a talented ballclub, they've got great players on their
team. At the beginning of the series, if we thought we were gonna
waltz through this thing and just win three straight, we were only
kidding ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won two _ we were very fortunate to come away with a win in
Game 1, we did what we had to do in Game 2. They're back home, they
played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Really well. The Rockets showed all of the energy, hustle and
poise the Lakers had in Game 2, while the Lakers showed only
glimpses of it.
</P>
<P>
   Houston owned the boards, outrebounding the Lakers 54-42. The
Rockets took 19 offensive rebounds, converting them into 20
second-chance points. They had three times as many steals (9 to 3)
and forced 14 turnovers, leading to 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers kept misfiring under the frenzied pace. They hit
just 37.8 percent of their field goals, and Shaquille O'Neal (26
points, 10 rebounds) was the only Laker who made an impact _ and
even then, he missed 13 of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant got in early foul trouble guarding Pippen and
finished with 13 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Glen Rice had a
seven-point first quarter, then faded, finishing with 13 points on
5-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their effort was a little better tonight, their energy was
better,'' Derek Harper conceded.
</P>
<P>
   And for Pippen, who slumped through the first two games and was
immediately torched by the local media, there was redemption. In
addition to his career-high in points, Pippen got 13 rebounds, four
assists, a steal and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. I knew I had to lay it all on the line,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went to work early, turning to his post-up game to get in
the flow. Bryant, so effective against him in the first two games,
suddenly seemed overmatched. Rice and Rick Fox fared no better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some quick and early fouls on (Bryant), and he was just
at my mercy at that point,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who had never led by more than seven points in this
series _ and had never led at halftime _ took a 10-point lead into
the intermission behind the suddenly rejuvenated tandem of Pippen
and Barkley. They scored 15 each in the half and combined for 17
rebounds, while the Lakers, after a fast start, struggled mightily.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 12 points by halftime, but Rice scored just seven _
none in the second quarter, and Bryant had six. More irritating,
however, was the Lakers' sudden onslaught of the drops _ they
turned the ball over nine times, leading to 13 points for the
Rockets. Houston scored 10 off of fast breaks, while the Lakers'
defense created few running opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held an eight-point lead three minutes into the
second quarter, but the Rockets went on a 10-2 run to tie the game
for the first time, 36-36, with 5:30 to go, and a minute later took
their first lead at 40-38. Othella Harrington sparked the run,
scoring seven points in three and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen then shredded the Lakers singlehandedly, scoring 10
points in a 12-2 run to close out the half.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the opening tip that the Rockets would do
everything possible to ignite Pippen, their dormant superstar who
was averaging just 8.5 points in the series. They fed Pippen on
their second possession, letting him post up against Bryant. Pippen
missed the shot, but the agenda had been set.

ANGELS SWEEP YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Anaheim Angels arrived in New York earlier this
week for their three-game series against the defending World Series
champion Yankees looking like a 98-pound weakling about to confront
the neighborhood bully on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels returned home Thursday night after completing a
three-game sweep, including their second consecutive shutout, 2-0,
before 26,702 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't something anybody could have expected, particularly
with the Angels bruised, battered and beaten going into the series.
They were coming off a three-game sweep at the hands of the Red Sox
and had lost six of seven. They learned Wednesday that Tim Salmon
will be lost for five weeks with a wrist injury. And they found
themselves facing a team that won 125 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Angels responded in the first game with a boost
from the offense (nine runs), then turned it over to the pitchers.
Chuck Finley did the job Wednesday with eight scoreless innings,
but Finley routinely beats the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday it was Omar Olivares' turn.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (4-3) pitched 62/3 innings, got relief help from Scott
Schoeneweis, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy Percival (eighth save)
and the Angels got their first three-game sweep of the Yankees at
Yankee Stadium since May 18-20, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares did not strike out a batter and walked six _ ``sounds
kind of unreal, huh?'' Olivares said _ but got big outs when he
needed them, the biggest coming in the fifth when he got Paul
O'Neill to hit into a 4-6-3 double play with the bases loaded and
one out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had not been shut out in 56 consecutive games,
including the last 12 games of the 1998 season and 13 postseason
games. But the Angels did it twice in a row, throwing 19
consecutive scoreless innings going back to the eighth inning of
the first game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't shut the Yankees out two times in a season, let
alone two times in a series,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``We've got to enjoy this. One thing we can get out of this right
now is we know if we do the little things and pitch, we can beat
anybody. Even if we don't have our best players out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's seventh homer of the season off Yankees starter
Hideki Irabu (1-1) gave the Angels a 1-0 lead in the sixth, and
Andy Sheets drove in the only other run of the game with a
sacrifice fly in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse after the game, though, there was no
celebration. Vaughn made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to Yankee Stadium, a place with tremendous
tradition, you've got to rise,'' Vaughn said. ``There are hostile
crowds, a hostile environment. But we have do the same thing we did
here all the time. We play the Yankees well and everybody else like
(junk). That's what's got to stop. I don't understand letdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels open up a three-game series against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays tonight and Vaughn said he wants to see the same
intensity he saw the past three nights in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is something to look back on and remember how
things should be,'' Vaughn said. ``We played great here, but how we
come out (tonight) is what's important. I'll stress that on the
plane ride and in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival recorded saves in all three games, allowing only one
baserunner (hit batsman) and getting six strikeouts in the three
games. He set the Yankees down in order in the ninth Thursday even
though he was not at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get tired, sometimes you make bad adjustments,''
Percival said. ``Today I made good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got a big series out of center fielder Garret
Anderson, who went 8 for 13 and Thursday made a diving catch of a
liner by Jorge Posada in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a lot of teams and I don't think I've ever
been around a team I've been more proud of,'' Collins said. ``They
were playing bad and we have guys out, but they rose to the
occasion.''

ELWAYS CENTER OF ATTENTION IN MEETINGS ABOUT L.A. FRANCHISE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 SAN BERNARDINO SUN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How does John Elway, NFL team president and
part-owner sound?
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who retired after a legendary career with the Denver
Broncos less than two weeks ago, has suddenly become the golden boy
in the battle between the two competing groups bidding to earn the
NFL's Los Angeles franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In separate meetings Thursday, Elway listened to both groups,
and each discussion included not only a minority ownership
possibility, but that of running the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't Los Angeles, and professional football, and the
opportunity of management at a very high level _ possibly the
president _ this wouldn't be a consideration,'' said Marvin Demoff,
his agent. ``It is a unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, his wife, Jan, and Demoff met first with Ovitz for
approximately an hour, and then later for about the same time with
Eli Broad and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the most exciting news I could have ever heard,
that John Elway would be interested in being the president of a
team in Los Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``I think it's a magical way
to make all this work very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, however, decided to keep his thoughts on the meetings
private. Not wanting to show favoritism between the two groups, and
being careful not to offend Denver, he opted out of the scheduled
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Demoff said Elway, a former star at Granada Hills High School in
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, still had much to digest before
making a decision whether to join one of the Los Angeles groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the level of interest in Los Angeles, while
flattering, caught John off-guard,'' Demoff said. ``We were looking
at broadcasting opportunities, Denver Bronco opportunity, some
business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the last 10 days, Los Angeles presented itself, and
it's exciting to him. He truly doesn't know enough to even start to
make an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has a standing offer to become a minority owner with Pat
Bowlen with the Broncos. But Bowlen plans to continue to run the
team for an additional 10 or more years, and if Elway wants to
direct his own team, he will have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be a great member of the Coliseum partners
team,'' Broad said. ``We need someone of his caliber to run the
franchise if it's awarded to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't discuss percentages, but we prefer whoever is in
management to also be an owner. We like linking ownership and
management.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners are next scheduled to meet May 25-26 in Atlanta.
Broad said he and partner Ed Roski Jr. plan to present financial
and parking plans at that meeting, and are hopeful a Los Angeles
owner will be chosen to meet their September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But Demoff said he doesn't expect Elway to align himself with
either group by the May meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a unique opportunity, it's important for him to
explore it fully and this is really just the very beginning of
that,'' Demoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday did allow Elway to make it clear to both Ovitz and
Broad that he wanted to actively run the team. And it allowed both
potential owners to embrace the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made it clear he doesn't want to be just a celebrity,''
Broad said. ``He wants to start a new career and he said in my new
career, I want to be as successful as I was in my last career. And
I believe he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made an offer. We did not say, John, we want you
to become president at these terms. We said, We want you. We think
you'd be a great asset to this franchise. It would help us create a
type of excitement we need here and hopefully help us create a team
that in the not-too-distant future will be looking at some Super
Bowl rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad also used Thursday's press conference to take a page out
of Ovitz's book. Broad said he would be broadening his ownership
group in the next few weeks to include members of the entertainment
industry.

to aid war refugees in Kosovo and victims of the recent Midwest
tornadoes. But that's only on the face of it. In fact, the spending
bill has become bogged down by a numbing series of attempts by

   SALEM-TRAVEL (Salem, Mass.) _ Stand by the second-story window
of the nearly two-century-old Custom House here and you will find
yourself gazing over a waterfront that once linked the young United
States with the world's farthest corners. All's quiet now. But the
place once saw ships in such numbers _ en route to or from China,
Europe, the West Indies, the South Seas _ as to rank Salem among
the nation's most cosmopolitan and wealthy cities. Salem is
probably most closely linked in the public imagination with the
1692 witchcraft trials, but it contains much more of interest. By
Gustav Niebuhr.

THE PAYTON EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Reflecting upon the season, Paul Westphal knew it was
the superstar that was his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion on him was that he is exactly as advertised,'' he
said. ``He had a great upside with a certain amount of baggage. To
hold that against him is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the Phoenix Suns from firing Westphal, and
trading Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Were you thinking the Sonics and Gary Payton?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the misunderstanding. The situations tend to look alike.
</P>
<P>
   The turbulence around Payton is a major element in the Sonics'
unpleasant early obituary. But in 1996, Westphal as Suns coach had
in Barkley a similar dilemma. There, it cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Phoenix, management and I had a different opinion of
Charles's value and the appropriateness of his role with
teammates,'' Westphal said. ``Here, I'm on the same page with
management about Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that page say about superstars and their teammates?
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that (teammates) tolerate the idiosyncrasies as
much as they embrace the stars' strengths, there will be peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent they can't, there will be problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kinda highfalutin. Whaddyamean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' he said, smiling. ``Gary and Charles
... they ain't changin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crux of the Sonics' millennium remake. Payton
is going to be his usual caustic, belligerent, demanding self.
Anyone who thinks that lipstick will help this pig of a situation
hasn't been around Payton and the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   With four years left on his $87 million contract, the Sonics are
not about to deal him, if for no other reason than superstar trades
rarely work out for the team surrendering them.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, look at what happened when Phoenix in '96
traded Barkley to Houston for Robert Horry, Chucky Brown, Mark
Bryant and Sam Cassell. The Suns haven't advanced beyond the
playoffs' first round since, including Portland's 3-0 sweep this
week.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are rare talents, however infuriating they can be
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sat Gary down, he probably would tell you himself he's
difficult to get along with,'' Westphal said. ``That difficulty
also makes me a big fan, because it's part of his supercompetitive
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can curb it, but you can't instill it. When you
find someone who has it, you build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the parts to fit around Payton is a major trick, one
that will determine the future of club president Wally Walker. It
was plain this year that Payton and Detlef Schrempf were nearing
the end of their tolerance for one another. Same for Payton and
Dale Ellis. Sam Perkins wasn't sorry to leave Payton's company, and
even good pal Vin Baker was stung deeply by Payton's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the word for years on Barkley around the league is
that he eventually wears out everybody he's around. Then again, in
the four years Barkley and Westphal were together in Phoenix, the
Chuckster averaged 23.4 points and 11.5 rebounds in the regular
season, and 26 points and 12 rebounds in the playoffs. He also
helped make Westphal in 1992-93 the winningest rookie head coach in
NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   So wear me out, Westphal is saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest similarity is that Gary and Charles are
strong-willed, unique individuals,'' he said. ``You must be very
confident and mature to flourish with them as teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Egad. A player has to be mature? In the NBA? Good luck, Wally.
</P>
<P>
   When asked this week about potential roster changes, Walker
would confirm only that he wanted his core back. When pressed as to
the identity of the core, Walker mentioned only Payton and Baker,
with some approving nods thrown to the three rookies, Rashard
Lewis, Jelani McCoy and Vladimir Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   It must be presumed that everyone else is in play, either via
trades or free agency. But whoever is brought in has to get along
with Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal doesn't believe that is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you don't rise to people's expectations, the
microscopes come out,'' Westphal said. ``Some of the same problems
are there when you win, but when you lose, they're magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever recall a team that always had smooth sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Westphal also doesn't want another repetition of his last
year in Phoenix, where his previous seasons of 62, 56 and 59 wins
were forgotten in a 14-19 start tainted by perceptions that Barkley
had run him over. He wants Payton to give some, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Gary has to shoot as much as he did, especially
as many threes,'' he said. ``His best role is to play a little
less, distribute the ball a little more and have more scoring
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Payton's messianic tendencies, is that likely?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a summer to plan and piece things together that will
give us a much better chance to succeed,'' he said. ``I think Gary
and I came a long way. We have a chance this summer to go
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like the optimism of the coach who has lived again after
being killed by a coach-killing player. Dying that way once
inspires the victim to avoid repetition.

SWEEPLESS IN HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Drunk on two straight wins and energized by a
devastating rout, the Lakers were poised to sweep a Hall of Fame
trio right out of the playoffs. And then an obvious truth set in:
Old legends don't go down that easily.
</P>
<P>
   A new, youthful-looking Houston Rockets team emerged Thursday in
the comfort of the Compaq Center, and the team anchored by three of
the greatest players in NBA history made a stand when it had to.
The legends made the upstarts pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were as thoroughly dominating in their 102-88 Game 3
victory as the Lakers had been in Game 2. And with Scottie Pippen
torching the Lakers for a career playoff-high 37 points and Charles
Barkley torturing them with 30 points and 23 rebounds, the Rockets
pulled themselves back from the brink of premature elimination.
</P>
<P>
   They can even the best-of-five series at two games each with a
win Saturday at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers could do afterward was tip their hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's disappointing,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They're a talented ballclub, they've got great players on their
team. At the beginning of the series, if we thought we were gonna
waltz through this thing and just win three straight, we were only
kidding ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets showed all of the energy, hustle and poise the
Lakers had in Game 2, while the Lakers showed only glimpses of it.
</P>
<P>
   Houston outrebounded the Lakers 54-42. The Rockets took 19
offensive rebounds, converting them into 20 second-chance points.
They had three times as many steals (9 to 3) and forced 14
turnovers, leading to 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more intense than us, they got all the loose
balls,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers just kept misfiring under the frenzied pace. They
hit 37.8 percent of their field goals, and Shaquille O'Neal (26
points, 10 rebounds) was the only Laker who made an impact _ and
even then, he hit just 9 of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant got in early foul trouble guarding Pippen and
finished with 13 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Glen Rice had a
seven-point first quarter then faded, finishing with 13 points on
5-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on the court, on the bench or back in the locker room
could the Lakers find an answer for Pippen. The former Bull had
been left for dead after two ineffective games, but he quickly
morphed back into the multitalented, end-to-end weapon that won six
rings in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Skewered all week by the Houston media, Pippen found quick
redemption. His line also included 13 rebounds, four assists, a
steal and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept missing some easy baskets (early), but I had so much
energy and will power not to give up tonight. I wasn't going to be
denied this opportunity for us to win a playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially an elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went to work early, turning to his post-up game to get in
the flow. Bryant, so effective against him in the first two games,
suddenly seemed overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some quick and early fouls on (Bryant), and he was just
at my mercy at that point,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant just smiled afterward and credited Pippen with a good
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job of being aggressive,'' said Bryant, who
admitted to getting tentative after his two first-quarter fouls.
``That's something that I shouldn't have worried about. You just
have to go out there and be aggressive and play hard regardless of
foul trouble. It won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who had never led by more than seven points in this
series, took a 10-point lead into the intermission after overcoming
an early 11-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the third quarter before the Lakers regained the
lead, but it was short-lived. Barkley and Pippen combined for all
the points in a 9-1 run to close out the quarter and take a 76-69
lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A loss was unwelcome, but the desperate charge from Pippen and
the Rockets was not at all unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected it,'' Rice said. ``I tried to tell the guys, hey,
these guys are gonna come out with a lot of fire. Anytime a guy
takes the type of bashing that (Pippen) has lately, he's gonna try
to prove everybody wrong. That's what he did tonight.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BETWEEN them, the officials and Shaquille O'Neal conspired to make
Hakeem Olajuwon appear small and insignificant Thursday night.
Olajuwon has probably never made less of an impact in a crucial
game in the 15 seasons he has worn a Rockets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   And, amazingly, it didn't matter one bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, as you know, have three superstars, and the other
two picked up sufficient slack to more than negate Shaq. As a
result, Houston's season will last at least 48 additional minutes,
and Scottie Pippen's season can't yet be judged a complete failure.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen still has a ways to go to undo the damage he did to his
image and his credibility in the first eight quarters of the
Rockets-Lakers series _ never mind his tepid regular season _ but
at least redemption remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets do come off the mat to beat LA, then go on to
claim the NBA championship, few people will remember his shameless
finger-pointing after Game 1 or his shameful shooting in Game 2. He
will probably even be judged worthy of his $14 million salary by
the Houston fans.
</P>
<P>
   As for Charles Barkley, if he doesn't score another point or
grab another rebound and the Rockets go down in four to the Lakers,
we can still safely say he has already earned his paltry million
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Every darned penny.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, the Rockets' ranking warrior on a regular basis all
year, had nothing to prove to anybody this night. Nonetheless, he
proved it anyway, cutting loose for 30 points and 23 rebounds in
the 43 minutes he spent on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   His was a hugely magnificent effort, no two ways about it,
particularly since, in his spare time, he was also asked to
pinch-hit defending O'Neal, seven inches taller, 50 pounds heavier
and almost a decade younger.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Charles measured up to every challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen, his turncoat buddy, decided to aid and abet him, for
a change.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie, of course, had questioned Barkley's smarts for fouling
O'Neal, an impossibly inept free-throw shooter, in the waning
seconds of the series opener, and he did so after his costly
turnover had cost the Rockets any chance of winning. Barkley nodded
and grinned, saying nothing. He took the high road, even taking
Pippen out for dinner that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, though, he was hurt, very hurt. After all, he has
been in Pippen's corner all season, working behind the scenes to
get the ex-Bull comfortable in a vastly different system while
subverting his own deservedly extra-large ego to feed Scottie's. It
was a case of total selflessness.
</P>
<P>
   More admirably, when Scottie stunk things up so badly in the
second game, missing every shot he put up and doing his best to
disappear from the radar screen, the Chuckster kept his mouth shut
_ not always the easiest thing for him to do.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley took the high road because to do anything less would
have torn the Rockets completely apart and possibly assured them of
being summarily swept into the offseason by LA. For public
consumption, at least, he stayed in Pippen's corner, never mind
that his loyalty had heretofore been a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   And Scottie, glory be, would thus apologize in the most
productive, constructive way possible Thursday evening by
contributing a personal playoff best of 37 points _ plus 13
rebounds of his own _ in the Rockets' survival-mode 102-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   We're tempted to say it's about time, but why get grumpy on such
a celebratory occasion? The Pip was outstanding, so let's give him
his due and hope he has a few more of these monster games in him.
For the Rockets to survive the Lakers he must, since it appears
Olajuwon, at 36, has more than met his match against Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the order-keepers with the whistles around
their necks have concluded he is no longer worthy of their respect.
The rinky-dink fouls that stuck Olajuwon on the bench for all but
nine minutes of the first half and knocked him off his rhythm for
the entire game were appalling.
</P>
<P>
   That the Rockets could get by with Hakeem missing 10 of the 12
shots he took, receiving just one free throw and being held to six
rebounds tells us how different a team they have become. He remains
their center, but he's no longer the center of their universe.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen should be, for what he's taking to the bank. However,
Barkley, more often than not, has been the man. As to who takes the
lead the rest of the way, it makes no difference, as long as one or
the other does.
</P>
<P>
   We were again reminded how much experience matters in the second
season. The hotshot Houston rookies, Cuttino Mobley and Michael
Dickerson, would again be rendered virtually impotent, combining
for all of five points between them.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I say combining. Mobley scored all of the five as
Dickerson, who appeared to be a stud in the making at the end of
the regular season, took a second consecutive bagel. He's learning
the hard way about how the playoffs are different.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets can probably live with Dickerson's disappearing act.
But should Pippen go back into hiding, they're dead. While he put a
new load of pressure on himself by rising to such heights _ we're
going to expect it now _ it's the least he could do to help win
back the Chuckster's affection.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Pippen has six rings to Barkley's none. Scottie owes
it to Chaz to keep the pedal to the metal, to try to get him one.
This was a fine start, but that's all it was _ a start.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three games after the fact.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It was not artistic. It was not smooth, neat or pretty. And that
made it beautiful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets beat the Los Angeles Lakers 102-88 on Thursday night
at Compaq Center the hard way. In a game for playoff survival, the
Rockets were bloodied, battered and floor-burned but would not be
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my guys before the game,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said, ``I'd been in this situation a lot of times
before and I've never had to give a Knute Rockne speech. If I did,
I had the wrong guys in the locker room. They went out there and
played their hearts out. We talked about leaving it out on the
floor. That's what the Rockets did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   They did what they could not in Los Angeles. They found a way to
win _ many ways unexpected, difficult and almost all based on
effort. Unlike Game 1, when they shot well to take control but let
the win slip away, they extended the series to Saturday's Game 4 by
willing themselves past the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They made just 40.2 percent of their shots but dominated the
boards. They were in almost constant foul trouble, center Hakeem
Olajuwon limited to 28 minutes, five points and six rebounds, but
the Rockets took turns on Shaquille O'Neal until the committee of
big men, including Charles Barkley, held him in check.
</P>
<P>
   And they got sublime, determined performances from Barkley and
Scottie Pippen, who carried the Rockets through the fourth quarter
with indefatigable efforts. Barkley banged inside with everyone
from Robert Horry to O'Neal and still had to carry the offense
through the fourth quarter. Pippen played all 48 minutes with
determination and aggression he did not have in LA.
</P>
<P>
   They got a huge and necessary lift from reserve Brent Price,
whose manic, body-sacrificing intensity _ more than his 10 points,
seven assists, four rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot _
seemed to drive the Rockets through the rough spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that was a game,'' Barkley said. ``I was very proud of my
team. We got off to a bad start (falling 11 points behind) but hung
in there. Scottie played great. I was very proud of Brent Price and
Sam Mack giving us a lift. Determination comes out in a game like
this. Nobody wants to get swept. They really kicked our butts in
Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen rose from his LA haze to have one of the greatest playoff
games of his playoff-filled career, scoring 37 points and grabbing
13 rebounds. He helped hold Glen Rice, averaging 21.5 points in the
series, to 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a down game, it's not the end of my career,''
Pippen said. ``I wanted the ball and the opportunity to post up. I
have to come out and just play hard. I'm going to be aggressive.
I'm not letting up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, driving himself until he had to be wrapped in
ice-water-soaked towels during timeouts, had 30 points, grabbed 23
rebounds and spent crucial minutes matched up eye-to-chest on
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was just phenomenal,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I don't
know how he had the energy to play offense, holding up that big guy
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Pippen scored every Rockets point in the fourth
quarter, their first 20, until a Mack free throw with 31.6 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' last chance ended when, after a flagrant foul on
Pippen gave the Lakers two free throws and the ball with 38.8
seconds left, guard Derek Fisher missed his second free throw,
leaving the Lakers eight back, and Kobe Bryant missed a 3-pointer
from 26 feet.
</P>
<P>
   After Mack's free throw, the Lakers missed four shots on their
next possession, and the Lakers, who had checked out of their
hotel, could begin looking for a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the intensity,'' Rockets center Antoine Carr said.
``We were running back, even when they scored. We were banging
people. We were a whole lot more active. We have to play with
heart. If we don't play with heart, it's over. We just decided if
we're going to go down, we'll go down with our guns blazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets began the fourth quarter with Barkley tipping in a
missed shot, then passing to Pippen for a jumper to an 81-69 lead,
then their largest of the game. Having found a formula that worked,
the Rockets worked it hard. Barkley controlled the offense, posting
up inside on almost every trip down the court, and it worked almost
every time.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley scored six of the Rockets' next eight points until, with
4:23 left and the Lakers having cut a Rockets lead that had reached
13 to seven, he found Pippen alone outside. Pippen swished his 3
for a 92-82 Rockets lead, giving him 33 points, by one a playoff
career high.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference in the Rockets was clear much earlier. Price
forced jump balls with J.R. Reid and O'Neal, grabbed an offensive
rebound and redirected it to Barkley inside. He dove into the crowd
for one loose ball and face-first into Barkley's head for another.
In Barkley's five first-half minutes on O'Neal, the Lakers center
had one field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Olajuwon's immediate foul trouble, the Rockets worked
enough bodies onto O'Neal to limit him to 9-of-22 shooting for 26
points. He had 10 rebounds. And the Rockets attacked defensively,
scrambling in and out of double teams and rotations until the
Lakers could make just 37.8 percent of their shots and just four of
22 (18.2 percent) of their 3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't come close to laying down,'' Lakers guard Derek
Harper said. ``They played like a desperate team would play.''

PICK a play, almost any play.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Charles Barkley using Robert Horry like a yo-yo on a
string down in the low post, backing him along the baseline and
then whirling into the lane for that falling-away,
how-does-he-do-that little push shot that seems to chin itself over
the front rim and then snuggles into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Or smashing like one huge bowling ball into a set of tenpins,
mangling so many limbs and sending bodies flying as he wraps those
mitts around misses and turns them into big opportunities for
offensive-rebound hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Scottie Pippen turning himself into a one-man version of
the Brian Setzer Orchestra, jumping, jiving and wailing all over
the court like it was his own personal dance floor. Flashing across
the baseline for the niftiest peekaboo reverse move, keeping his
feet alive to tap in his own little jump hook, spinning past Kobe
Bryant like he was just another teen-ager without a date at the
senior prom for a tomahawk dunk. The only thing missing was a zoot
suit and a long, gold watch chain.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a play, any play from the Rockets' 102-88 win over the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a foul-plagued Hakeem Olajuwon taking another early seat
on the bench and Antoine Carr coming in like the hungriest Big Dawg
in the neighborhood, slamming himself into Shaquille O'Neal,
setting himself up in the passing lanes and even taking his aging
body down to the floor for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sam Mack coming in with a six-shooter that wasn't firing
straight, but keeping himself on the floor by chasing, bumping,
pushing, pulling, shoving, harassing Bryant up and down the court.
Taunting him, even, with a word that rhymes with witch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brent Price. Oh, yes, definitely Brent Price, who exploded
like a firecracker in the silverware drawer and let everybody in
the house know this wasn't a weekend in LA anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night when the Lakers, using $2 motivational tactics,
checked out of their hotel rooms before the game.
</P>
<P>
   This was the game when the Rockets finally checked into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot, intense, fiery, emotional. Everything the Rockets
were not in the last time out Tuesday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley strode through the hallway of the Laptop and entered the
locker room barely 45 minutes before the opening tap, looking natty
in a suit of emerald green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night's a good night for the Chuckster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was. He sank his teeth into 30 points and gobbled up 23
rebounds _ joining Olajuwon, Moses Malone and Elvin Hayes as the
fourth player in Rockets history to hit the 30-20 plateau in a
playoff game _ and then he was probably taken straight to the
doctor for a rabies shot.
</P>
<P>
   He went around J.R. Reid. He went through Horry. He went over
Bryant, and he even went toe-to-toe on the defensive end for long
stretches with Shaq, giving away nearly a foot in height but
nothing in fight. He did just about everything except foam at the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any more questions about who is leading this team now?
Is there anybody left who wants to shove him out the door just
because they don't like the way he runs his mouth?
</P>
<P>
   This was the Pippen that Houston has been waiting to see since
the stretch limo dropped him on the doorstep back in January. Alert
and alive and arcing like a live wire at both ends of the floor. He
put up 27 shots, and he nailed an even dozen for a playoff
career-high 37 points and also managed 13 rebounds and four
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see now. That's one for the season at $14 million. Would
the Rockets have had to pay him $742,000,000 to get the same
production for the first 52 games?
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and Barkley were the Dream Team reunited as they held off
the Lakers in the second half. Until Mack finally broke their
string with a free throw in the final 31 seconds, they had scored
30 consecutive points in taking on LA like Batman and Robin.
</P>
<P>
   If necessity is the mother of invention, then Olajuwon's foul
trouble turned Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich into the
reincarnation of Thomas Edison in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets went to a small lineup and played so big. But nobody
was so big, so huge, so gargantuan as Price. He has waited for
three years to make this kind of contribution, and he gave until it
hurt. In the second quarter alone, Price scored five points, dealt
six assists, made two steals and tied up both Shaq and Reid for
jump balls.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Pippen were the engines that drove the machine, but
Price was the spark in the ignition. Pick a play, almost any play,
and the machine finally hummed.
</P>
<P>
   One game that gave the Rockets hope.
</P>
<P>
   One night that gave the Lakers the unexpected _ room service.

 COMPUTER USERS EVERYWHERE INVITED TO JOIN SEARCH FOR ETS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Tens of thousands of computer users from
around the world are being enlisted to participate in an ambitious
effort to detect radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The project, called SETI &LR; home, is based on a software program
that uses idle computers around the globe to automatically analyze
data in search of oddly strong or repetitive radio signals from
distant space.
</P>
<P>
   If ET has called, scientists involved in the project hope,
someone somewhere will catch the signal.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to be a brilliant hacker to participate in the
project. Almost anyone with access to the Internet can play _ and
it's the start of what will surely be the biggest mass computer
hunt in the brief history of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Monday, scientists at the University of
California's Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, where the
project is based, will make the free SETI software available as a
screen-saver to every computer user who visits the SETI &LR; home Web
site. The address is http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400,000 people from 96 countries have already expressed
interest in participating in the search.
</P>
<P>
   The radio buzzing and crackling that fills all of space all the
time are constantly received by the powerful radio telescope at
Arecibo in Puerto Rico. The data embedded in that noise is what
will be broken into chunks and automatically transmitted to all
computers in the global SETI &LR; home network.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the project's free software have been developed for
Windows, Macintosh and 30 varieties of Unix operating systems, and
it can all be downloaded from the same Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a computer equipped with the software is idle, it will
receive a chunk of data, crunch it automatically, and then send the
results to Berkeley through the Internet. The computer will then
automatically acquire a fresh chunk of data.
</P>
<P>
   Already some 12,000 people around the world have volunteered to
test the system and have racked up about 200 years of free
computing time, said computer scientist David Anderson, the
SETI &LR; home project director. And already volunteers have translated
the software instructions into 30 different languages besides
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at the extreme eagerness of people to use this,''
Anderson said. ``Every day I'm getting e-mail in all languages
saying `Give me the software NOW!'''
</P>
<P>
   SETI, as millions already know, stands for the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, and its primary focus is at the
nonprofit SETI Institute in Mountain View. The original funding for
the worldwide computer project came from the Pasadena-based
Planetary Society, whose president, Louis Friedman, called the
venture ``a grand experiment _ in science, in technology and in
society _ a global cooperative effort at the frontiers of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is also a new experiment in a technology called
``distributed computing,'' in which a large and complex problem
demanding huge amounts of computation is broken down into small
chunks that can be handled by many small computers distributed
anywhere in the world and linked to the main center _ in this case,
UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of linking computers with many different operating
systems into a global network came from David Gedye, a UC Berkeley
graduate student in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``SETI &LR; home is a way of harnessing all the idle computers to
increase our computing capacity and our chance of finding
extraterrestrials,'' said Daniel Werthimer, the project's chief
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Werthimer and his colleagues at Berkeley have been operating
several other SETI projects, including a 20-year-old quest known as
SERENDIP, or the Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from
Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations.

Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It has broken international law in attacking a sovereign state
without seeking a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   It has killed hundreds of innocent Serb civilians _ in our name,
of course _ while being too cowardly to risk a single NATO life in
defense of the poor and the weak for whom it meretriciously claimed
to be fighting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war cannot even be regarded as a mistake _ it is a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, now part of the mantra of all criticism of
NATO that we must mention Serb wickedness in Kosovo. So here we go.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dreadful, wicked deeds _ atrocities would not be a strong
enough word for it _ have gone on in Kosovo: mass executions, rape,
dispossession, ``ethnic cleansing,'' the murder of intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of NATO's propaganda program has done more to cover up such
villainy than disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as we all know, the dozens of Kosovo Albanians massacred on
the road to Prizren were slaughtered by NATO _ not by the Serbs as
NATO originally claimed. But I have seen with my own eyes _
travelling under the NATO bombardment _ the house-burning in Kosovo
and the hundreds of Albanians awaiting dispossession in their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the subject _ and perhaps my first question should
be put a little more boldly. Not: ``How much longer do we have to
endure this stupid, hopeless, cowardly war?'' but rather: ``How
much longer do we have to endure NATO?
</P>
<P>
   ``How soon can this vicious American-run organization be
deconstructed and politically `degraded,' its pontificating
generals put back in their boxes with their mortuary language of
`in-theatre assets' and `collateral damage?'''
</P>
<P>

leaders realize that they are not fighting a replay of the Second
World War nor striking a blow for a new value-rich millennium? &QL;

   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair started the
whining.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 days of television coverage soaked in NATO propaganda,
after weeks of NATO officials being questioned by sheep-like
journalists, Blair announces the press is ignoring the plight of
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this is a lie is not important. It is the nature
of the lie. Anyone, it seems, who doesn't subscribe to Europe's
denunciations of Fascism or who raises an eyebrow when _ in an act
of utter folly _ the prime minister makes unguaranteed promises
that the Kosovo Albanians will all go home, is now off-side,
biased.
</P>
<P>
   Or worthy of one of Downing Street's preposterous ``health
warnings'' because they allegedly spend more time weeping for dead
Serbs than the numerically greater number of dead Albanians (the
assumption also being, of course, that it is less physically
painful to be torn apart by a NATO cluster bomb than by a Serb
rocket-propelled grenade). &QL;

It happily allowed Greece to remain a member when its ruthless

intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had no objection to the oppression of Salazar and Caetano _
who were at the same time busy annihilating ``liberation''
movements almost identical to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only time when NATO proposed to suspend Portugal's
membership _ I was there at the time and remember this vividly _
was when the country staged a revolution and declared itself a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Is it therefore so surprising that NATO now turns out to be so
brutal? It attacks television stations and kills Serb journalists _
part of Milosevic's propaganda machine, a ``legitimate target,''
shrieks Britain's Clare Short.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Chinese embassy? Did the CIA really use an
old map? Or did the CIA believe that because Mira Markovic (the
wife of the Yugoslav president) had such close relations with the
Chinese government that both she and President Slobodan Milosevic
might be sleeping in the Chinese embassy?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, had already targeted the Milosevic residence in
an attempt to assassinate him. It had already _ according to one
disturbing report _ tried to lure the Serb minister of information
to the Serb television headquarters just before it was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   So why not the Chinese embassy? Would NATO do anything so
desperate? Well, NATO is desperate. It is losing the war, it is

Clark told us.
</P>
<P>
   He did not explain why Milosevic would need to be told such a

from General Ratko Mladic _ the Bosnian Serb military leader whose
men were destroying the Muslims of Sarajevo _ a gift of an engraved
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, of course, did General Clark remind us that General Mladic
and his colleague Radovan Karadjic remain free in Bosnia _ which is
under the firm control of NATO troops.

continent led by the third-rate generals and two-bit
under-secretaries who have been ranting on our television screens
for the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want Europe to be ``protected'' any longer by the U.S.
If that means the end of the Atlantic alliance, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Because an Atlantic alliance that has brought us to this
catastrophe should be wound up. Until it is, Europe will never _
ever _ take responsibility for itself or for the dictators who
threaten our society.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Europe will never lay its own lives on the line for
its own people _ which is what the Kosovo Albanians need.
</P>
<P>
   Until NATO is dead, there will never be a real European defense
force. And until NATO is dead, there will be no need to seek the
international mandate from the United Nations which ``humanitarian
action'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. is the only institution the poor and the
sick and the raped and the dispossessed can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops are not going to die for Kosovo. So what is the
point of NATO? &QL;

 By HELEN WOMACK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``So...'' growled Boris Yeltsin and the pause seemed to
last for an eternity before he continued: ``You are not sitting in
the right seats. Stepashin is the First Deputy. Sergei
Vladimirovich, move up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ginger-haired and, by all accounts, modest Sergei V.
Stepashin, appointed days earlier as First Deputy Prime Minister,
blushed so deeply that his ears and neck went red and changed seats
with a lesser official at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
   On the instructions of Yeltsin's press secretary, Russian
television has cut scenes of the president rambling incoherently.
But it did show this game of musical chairs that the Kremlin leader
unexpectedly played last week in the middle of a planning meeting
supposed to be devoted to celebrations for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians took it as further evidence that their
unpredictable president was going senile. Experienced Kremlin
watchers saw it as a sign that Stepashin, who has had an up and
down career, was about to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed Wednesday Yeltsin appointed him acting prime minister
in place of the ousted Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, 47, has been dubbed by the Russian media ``the
rosy-cheeked hawk.'' Before his promotion Wednesday, he combined
the job of first deputy prime minister with that of interior
minister, which put him in charge of thousands of internal troops
and over a million police.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Yeltsin had that in mind when he sacked Primakov, a
move he knew must enrage the communists and nationalists in the
State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the appointment of Stepashin is little short of a
Kremlin coup.
</P>
<P>
   If political passions boil over and the confrontation between
president and parliament becomes physical, as it did in October
1993, Yeltsin now has not only a loyal prime minister but also a
man who can command the tank drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, born to a military family on a then-Soviet base in
China, began his career as a ``politrabotnik'' (political
activist), the Communist equivalent of a chaplain in the army.
</P>
<P>
   He also lectured at a military academy and wrote a doctorate on
``Party leadership in Leningrad's fire brigades during World War
II.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms gave him a better
opportunity to use his qualification as a lawyer and he became a
parliamentary deputy, known for his liberal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, six months after the failure of the parliamentary
uprising against him, Yeltsin appointed Stepashin to head the FSB,
the successor to the KGB secret police. Here he gained a reputation
for being calm.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his cool, however, during the ill-fated war against
Chechnya, which Yeltsin was later to regret as his greatest
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by hostage-takers, who kidnapped Russian civilians in
the town of Budyonnovsk, Stepashin applied too much force, which
only increased the number of casualties, and had to resign in
disgrace in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin brought him back from the political wilderness in 1997,
giving him the Justice Ministry, where one of his main tasks was to
improve conditions in Russia's notoriously overcrowded and
disease-ridden jails.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``So...'' growled Boris Yeltsin and the pause seemed to
last for an eternity before he continued: ``You are not sitting in
the right seats. Stepashin is the First Deputy. Sergei
Vladimirovich, move up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ginger-haired and, by all accounts, modest Sergei V.
Stepashin, appointed days earlier as First Deputy Prime Minister,
blushed so deeply that his ears and neck went red and changed seats
with a lesser official at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
   On the instructions of Yeltsin's press secretary, Russian
television has cut scenes of the president rambling incoherently.
But it did show this game of musical chairs that the Kremlin leader
unexpectedly played last week in the middle of a planning meeting
supposed to be devoted to celebrations for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians took it as further evidence that their
unpredictable president was going senile. Experienced Kremlin
watchers saw it as a sign that Stepashin, who has had an up and
down career, was about to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed Wednesday Yeltsin appointed him acting prime minister
in place of the ousted Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, 47, has been dubbed by the Russian media ``the
rosy-cheeked hawk.'' Before his promotion Wednesday, he combined
the job of first deputy prime minister with that of interior
minister, which put him in charge of thousands of internal troops
and over a million police.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Yeltsin had that in mind when he sacked Primakov, a
move he knew must enrage the communists and nationalists in the
State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the appointment of Stepashin is little short of a
Kremlin coup.
</P>
<P>
   If political passions boil over and the confrontation between
president and parliament becomes physical, as it did in October
1993, Yeltsin now has not only a loyal prime minister but also a
man who can command the tank drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, born to a military family on a then-Soviet base in
China, began his career as a ``politrabotnik'' (political
activist), the Communist equivalent of a chaplain in the army.
</P>
<P>
   He also lectured at a military academy and wrote a doctorate on
``Party leadership in Leningrad's fire brigades during World War
II.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms gave him a better
opportunity to use his qualification as a lawyer and he became a
parliamentary deputy, known for his liberal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, six months after the failure of the parliamentary
uprising against him, Yeltsin appointed Stepashin to head the FSB,
the successor to the KGB secret police. Here he gained a reputation
for being calm.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his cool, however, during the ill-fated war against
Chechnya, which Yeltsin was later to regret as his greatest
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by hostage-takers, who kidnapped Russian civilians in
the town of Budyonnovsk, Stepashin applied too much force, which
only increased the number of casualties, and had to resign in
disgrace in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin brought him back from the political wilderness in 1997,
giving him the Justice Ministry, where one of his main tasks was to
improve conditions in Russia's notoriously overcrowded and
disease-ridden jails.
</P>
<P>
   He became interior minister last March after Yeltsin sacked
Viktor Chernomyrdin's entire cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yeltsin, who Wednesday criticized Primakov for allowing
stabilizing policies to turn into stagnation, is hoping that his
protege will revitalize Russian economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   At a cabinet meeting where Primakov said goodbye to his team,
Stepashin was blushing again as he said he had ``honestly'' not
known that he was about to he promoted over his boss's head.

<P>
   Woe betide he who is perceived to threaten an ailing, wrathful
czar. Thus may be explained the fate of Yevgeny Primakov, the
latest victim of this age-old law of Russian governance.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin resented Primakov because his prime
minister was infinitely more popular and, thanks to his support in
the Duma, in some respects more powerful than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he had permitted investigations into alleged corruption
to go ahead against members of the president's family and inner
circle. In earlier times, Primakov might have faced a show trial;
instead he has merely been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative modesty of the punishment should not hide the
disturbing implications of what has happened; both for Russia's
internal political stability and for the management of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight months in office, Primakov did little to tackle his
country's appalling economic difficulties. But inertia brought a
stability of sorts that has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The one Russian politician who might have persuaded the
parliament to vote for the tough reforms demanded by the
International Monetary Fund, essential if the country is to put its
financial house in order, has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, the largest single party in the Duma, are up in
arms, and could well prevent confirmation of Sergei Stepashin,
Yeltsin's young protege, who has been named to succeed Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh elections may be unavoidable, there are even mutterings of
a coup in the offing. At the very least, the stalled impeachment
proceedings against Yeltsin will gain fresh momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's erratic behavior could destroy hopes of
Russia playing a role in ending the Balkans war.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's threat to withdraw from the diplomatic process because
NATO has ignored Russia's demand for a halt to its bombing suggests
he is seeking to assuage his nationalist critics, led by the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   If he is obliged to carry out the threat, and thus dash
prospects of an agreed U.N. resolution, the Kosovo crisis would
enter a more perilous phase.
</P>
<P>
   By sacking Primakov, Russia's modern czar has done both his
country and the international community a grave disservice. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin Wednesday tried hard to persuade the
world that the reason he fired his prime minister and the cabinet
was because they failed to do enough for Russia's emaciated
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But his true motives for plunging the country into fresh
political chaos, and picking a perilous fight with parliament, have
more to do with pique, personal rivalry and the erratic whims of an
autocratic and unwell president.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers who steal Boris Yeltsin's thunder rarely last long, at
least during the periods in which he is fit enough to turn up for
work. Yevgeny Primakov, his third prime minister in just over a
year, proved no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions surfaced soon after Primakov, the former foreign
minister, took office last year when he tried to cobble together a
political truce between the Kremlin and a hostile,
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was asked to forgo some powers, including suspending his
right to sack the government. Typically, he balked.
</P>
<P>
   Catapulted into office as the president's second-choice premier
after last August's financial meltdown (the Duma rejected the first
candidate, Viktor Chernomyrdin), Primakov arrived amid predictions
of civil unrest and total economic collapse. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he established a measure of stability in which the
ruble _ though a quarter of its 1997 value against the dollar _ was
holding its own. The economy was stagnant, but tiny glimmers of
hope had just begun to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, a crucial source of Russian revenues, were at last
rallying. A tentative $4.5 billion deal was last month cobbled
together with the International Monetary Fund, albeit one that
stood a strong chance of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The small Russian stock market this week reached its highest
point for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-suffering 146 million population was impressed and
relieved. Primakov's experience and apparatchik's manner reassured
many among the impoverished millions who blame corrupted
pro-western reformers for Russia's demise.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most trusted politician in the country. Although
elderly, (he is 69) unhealthy and _ he insists _ unwilling, he was
soon seen as favorite for the presidency. Polls invariably placed
him as the second-round winner of an election.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin evidently hated it. While he was sidelined by illness,
Primakov's stature and authority grew, enhanced by his
coalition-building skills based on strong ties with parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Back at work, Yeltsin sought to reassert his power, and began to
publicly humiliate his premier. Kremlin staff made no secret that
Primakov was dispensable; whispers ran around Moscow that he would
soon be axed.
</P>
<P>
   Another murkier issue may also be tangled up with this affair.
Primakov had sworn to clean up corruption. During his term,
investigators began to pursue the business magnate Boris
Berezovsky, an adviser of the first family and a friend of the
president's younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   They set their sights on several firms with which the mogul has
links, including the giant airline Aeroflot, run by the president's
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was uneasy. Its inner circle found themselves in the
cross-hairs as prosecutors probed claims that some of the
president's senior staff farmed out lucrative building contracts in
return for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, still incomplete, formally come under the
auspices of the hapless prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, whom the
Kremlin tried in vain to persuade parliament to oust by brandishing
a secretly recorded video showing the lawman having sex with
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the moving force was thought to come from within the
Primakov administration, and its parliamentary allies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons, Yeltsin has _ yet again _ dropped a
bombshell
</P>
<P>
   With a war in Europe and economic gloom at home, Russia is
without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF deal will almost certainly founder, and Russia will
drift for weeks as the parliament and the Kremlin haggle over a new
premier.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation with parliament, and a possible constitutional
crisis, is taking shape as the Duma seems certain to refuse to
confirm Yeltsin's nominated candidate for premier, Sergei
Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   If it does so three times, then the president must dissolve it,
forcing early elections. But the chamber is set to begin
impeachment proceedings this week _ a move which may also have
prompted Yeltsin's decision to fire the popular premier.
</P>
<P>
   If it votes in favor _ as now seems likely _ then it cannot be
disbanded. What then happens is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday there was widespread condemnation of Primakov's
sacking. Only pro-market liberals applauded. Most of the rest of
the political spectrum _ including the head of the pro-government
``Our Home is Russia'' _ saw it as a serious misjudgment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The West will also have serious doubts. Primakov was never much
loved in Washington, which recoiled at the presence of senior
Communists in his government _ notably, first deputy prime minister
Yuri Maslyukov (who Wednesday announced that he would have no part
in the next government.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his hardball, pro-Russian foreign policy _ honed in his
years as foreign minister _ win him many western fans.
</P>
<P>
   His mission to Belgrade at the start of the Yugoslav war _ in
which he was accompanied by his hawkish defense minister, Marshal
Igor Sergeyev, and was seen joking with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic _ went down particularly badly abroad. Soon afterwards
Yeltsin handed the Kosovo mediating job to Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, Yevgeny Primakov was respected. He was a tough
but pragmatic deal-maker, a safe pair of hands in an unstable and
heavily armed nation. The same cannot be said of the man who fired
him. &QL;

   But his true motives for plunging the country into fresh
political chaos, and picking a perilous fight with parliament, have
more to do with pique, personal rivalry and the erratic whims of an
autocratic and unwell president.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers who steal Boris Yeltsin's thunder rarely last long, at
least during the periods in which he is fit enough to turn up for
work. Yevgeny Primakov, his third prime minister in just over a
year, proved no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions surfaced soon after Primakov, the former foreign
minister, took office last year when he tried to cobble together a
political truce between the Kremlin and a hostile,
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was asked to forgo some powers, including suspending his
right to sack the government. Typically, he balked.
</P>
<P>
   Catapulted into office as the president's second-choice premier
after last August's financial meltdown (the Duma rejected the first
candidate, Viktor Chernomyrdin), Primakov arrived amid predictions
of civil unrest and total economic collapse. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he established a measure of stability in which the
ruble _ though a quarter of its 1997 value against the dollar _ was
holding its own. The economy was stagnant, but tiny glimmers of
hope had just begun to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, a crucial source of Russian revenues, were at last
rallying. A tentative $4.5 billion deal was last month cobbled
together with the International Monetary Fund, albeit one that
stood a strong chance of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The small Russian stock market this week reached its highest
point for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-suffering 146 million population was impressed and
relieved. Primakov's experience and apparatchik's manner reassured
many among the impoverished millions who blame corrupted
pro-western reformers for Russia's demise.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most trusted politician in the country. Although
elderly, (he is 69) unhealthy and _ he insists _ unwilling, he was
soon seen as favorite for the presidency. Polls invariably placed
him as the second-round winner of an election.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin evidently hated it. While he was sidelined by illness,
Primakov's stature and authority grew, enhanced by his
coalition-building skills based on strong ties with parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Back at work, Yeltsin sought to reassert his power, and began to
publicly humiliate his premier. Kremlin staff made no secret that
Primakov was dispensable; whispers ran around Moscow that he would
soon be axed.
</P>
<P>
   Another murkier issue may also be tangled up with this affair.
Primakov had sworn to clean up corruption. During his term,
investigators began to pursue the business magnate Boris
Berezovsky, an adviser of the first family and a friend of the
president's younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   They set their sights on several firms with which the mogul has
links, including the giant airline Aeroflot, run by the president's
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was uneasy. Its inner circle found themselves in the
cross-hairs as prosecutors probed claims that some of the
president's senior staff farmed out lucrative building contracts in
return for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, still incomplete, formally come under the
auspices of the hapless prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, whom the
Kremlin tried in vain to persuade parliament to oust by brandishing
a secretly recorded video showing the lawman having sex with
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the moving force was thought to come from within the
Primakov administration, and its parliamentary allies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons, Yeltsin has _ yet again _ dropped a
bombshell
</P>
<P>
   With a war in Europe and economic gloom at home, Russia is
without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF deal will almost certainly founder, and Russia will
drift for weeks as the parliament and the Kremlin haggle over a new
premier.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation with parliament, and a possible constitutional
crisis, is taking shape as the Duma seems certain to refuse to
confirm Yeltsin's nominated candidate for premier, Sergei
Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   If it does so three times, then the president must dissolve it,
forcing early elections. But the chamber is set to begin
impeachment proceedings this week _ a move which may also have
prompted Yeltsin's decision to fire the popular premier.
</P>
<P>
   If it votes in favor _ as now seems likely _ then it cannot be
disbanded. What then happens is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday there was widespread condemnation of Primakov's
sacking. Only pro-market liberals applauded. Most of the rest of
the political spectrum _ including the head of the pro-government
``Our Home is Russia'' _ saw it as a serious misjudgment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The West will also have serious doubts. Primakov was never much
loved in Washington, which recoiled at the presence of senior
Communists in his government _ notably, first deputy prime minister
Yuri Maslyukov (who Wednesday announced that he would have no part
in the next government.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his hardball, pro-Russian foreign policy _ honed in his
years as foreign minister _ win him many western fans.
</P>
<P>
   His mission to Belgrade at the start of the Yugoslav war _ in
which he was accompanied by his hawkish defense minister, Marshal
Igor Sergeyev, and was seen joking with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic _ went down particularly badly abroad. Soon afterwards
Yeltsin handed the Kosovo mediating job to Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, Yevgeny Primakov was respected. He was a tough
but pragmatic deal-maker, a safe pair of hands in an unstable and
heavily armed nation. The same cannot be said of the man who fired
him. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ I was lounging in the corridor, waiting to go into the
steam bath, when a fat lobster-colored figure in a towel lumbered
past, cursing: ``That ye B.N. Ye:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ye'' are the first letters of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's
surname. Ye is also the ``f'' word in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The bather could find only expletives to express his disgust at
the news that the Kremlin leader had again dismissed his
government, plunging Russia into new political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered around the television set in the anteroom, where
bathers of both sexes drink beer or tea between bouts of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old man Yeltsin, he's got a brain like baby food,'' said
a woman as we heard how the president had thanked and dismissed
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the man who managed to bring
stability to Russia after the acute crisis of last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, good thing I did not get undressed,'' I said. ``I'd
better be heading back to my office.'' At which point Borya, the
genial bath attendant whom I have know for years, turned to me and
said: ``You're English, aren't you? If I could only get my hands on
those (expletive) in NATO. It's only because of Yeltsin that we're
not helping the Serbs. You think you can squeeze the Slavs and go
on squeezing. Well, you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   I packed up my things and left, together with a friend. This
little scene at the banya spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the strength of feeling among ordinary Russians
against their president, who now has only a two percent approval
rating in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes to a confrontation between the Kremlin and the
Communists and nationalists in the State Duma, there is no doubt
that the crowds that once cheered Yeltsin will follow the red flag.
</P>
<P>
   And it illustrates how seriously the West has alienated Russians
by bombing Yugoslavia, a policy that arguably has contributed to
destabilizing Russia as well as the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad,'' said my Russian friend quietly when we were
outside the banya. ``Politicians in both the East and West take
decisions to further their ambitions and none of them cares about
the consequences for all the little people in the world.'' &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin Wednesday tried hard to persuade the
world that the reason he fired his prime minister and the cabinet
was because they failed to do enough for Russia's emaciated
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But his true motives for plunging the country into fresh
political chaos, and picking a perilous fight with parliament, have
more to do with pique, personal rivalry and the erratic whims of an
autocratic and unwell president...

   Yeltsin has _ yet again _ dropped a bombshell.

KOSOVO: A COUNTRY ERASED  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few hours after NATO dropped its first bombs on Serbia, armed
Serbs surrounded Bela Crkva, a village in southwest Kosovo. A group
of ethnic Albanians who had hidden beneath a bridge in a stream
were found alive soon after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, the men over 15 years old were shot dead and the
rest told to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the same region in the next two days, there were, say
refugees, five more massacres as Serb soldiers and paramilitary
forces began to ``cleanse'' villages. Since the bombing began,
refugees fleeing from Kosovo have brought with them many such
stories, and continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   How far is it possible to put together a picture of the scale of
the killing that has taken place there?
</P>
<P>
   Since monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and most journalists had to leave the
province in late March, the only reports available are those from
refugees and military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   A report by America's State Department, released on May 10,
tries to document the attacks by Serbs on ethnic Albanians since
late March. More than 100,000 men of military age, it suggests, are
missing inside Kosovo; at least 4,600 are almost certainly dead.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives details of serial executions in at least 70
towns and villages, for example in Cirez and Malisevo. Refugees
also say that Albanians are used as human shields for Serb tanks
and have been detained in factories, including a munitions plant in
Srbica, a town in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Out of an original population of some 1.6 million-1.9 million
Kosovars, some 600,000 are displaced within the province, according
to this report, many of them short of food or medicine and hiding
in forests.
</P>
<P>
   Given that another 900,000 are known to have fled the country in
the past year, this would mean that barely a tenth of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians are still in their original homes.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups and international organizations are also trying to
record and corroborate the refugees' stories. ``We work as a
clearinghouse for anecdotes,'' says one aid worker, ``though
quantifying what is going on inside Kosovo is nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Medecins
sans Frontieres and other aid groups have interviewed several
thousand civilian refugees. Their stories are chillingly
consistent: the herding of villagers from their homes, the
systematic rape of women, and the arrest and murder of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Action Coalition, a lobby group, reckons that the
number of dead could be in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty in establishing what has taken place is that Serb
forces, mindful of the possibility of war-crimes trials, have been
taking care to cover up their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees report seeing truckloads of corpses dumped in lakes,
soldiers and paramilitary groups swapping uniforms to avoid
identification, and efforts not to bury victims in mass graves.
This would make it harder to challenge Serb claims that most ethnic
Albanians died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Yugoslav minister suggested that only 900,000
ethnic Albanians had ever lived in Kosovo _ fully a third less than
most estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the killing is over,'' says a military analyst,
``Belgrade will claim all the victims died fighting, or that many
never existed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty is how far the Serb attacks on Kosovars had
gone before NATO began to drop its bombs. Plainly, ``Operation
Horseshoe,'' as the Serbs call it, was intensified after the
withdrawal of the OSCE's observers in March. However, Serb troops
had started attacking ethnic Albanians during ``winter exercises''
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Trains and buses to carry out refugees were ready before the
start of bombing. Since last May, food imports into Kosovo have
been restricted, and crops and animals have been destroyed;
Yugoslav soldiers in uniform have taken part in both operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We witnessed this sort of thing, the same modus operandi,
before the bombing,'' says an OSCE man now in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Where the military balance stands now is just as hard to fathom.
The Kosovo Liberation Army is said to have 10,000 men and a new
leader, Agim Ceku. Thousands more volunteers have returned from
jobs elsewhere in Europe to train near Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is thought to be active in pockets of territory near
Albania's border, by Junik and north of Pec, as well as in isolated
areas near Podujevo and southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
But it is a pygmy beside Serbia's ruthless army. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to put a smile on the rash, foolish and pointlessly
vindictive decision of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to dismiss
his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, this week.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Primakov was neither a miracle worker nor a bold
reformer. He was adept at making mischief for the West, even as
Russia's own powers, economic and military, continued to wane.
</P>
<P>
   But he commanded some respect at home, and at least offered a
respite of stability that was good for his country and so, on the
whole, good for the world.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomatic affairs, he was experienced, sober and sometimes
sensible. In economic matters, he was less confident, yet during
his eight-month tenure Russia's economy did not sink altogether out
of sight, as some had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Now confusion _ and the possibility even of bloodshed and the
demise of Russia's frail democracy _ are back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who will end up on top. Constitutional procedure
is blurry. Consensus is nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin will probably fend off an impending attempt by the Duma,
Russia's lower house of parliament, to impeach him, but his efforts
to do so (with the expected help of friendly judges on the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts) will make it even harder for him
to persuade a furious Duma to accept a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional turmoil, likely to last weeks if not months,
could well end with the Duma's dissolution, an early general
election, and a new parliament even nastier and less inclined to
cooperate with the president than is the present one.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin should himself have long ago resigned: fitful and
distempered, he is manifestly not up to the task of running Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Barring his early exit, the least bad hope was that he would
totter along, letting his government and prime minister stave off a
total collapse of the state, while political attention shifted
first to the general election due by December and then to the
presidential poll next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Primakov seemed as well suited as anyone to keeping
the show more or less on the road. Certainly, Yeltsin's choice for
an interim prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, inspires no more
confidence: he is imbued with the morals and methods of the
interior ministry (and helped run the war in Chechnya), whereas
Primakov was nurtured by the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in any event, did Yeltsin do it? Magnificent as he was in
the days when he did so much to destroy the Soviet Union from
within, he seems motivated nowadays less by a wish to do good to
Russia than to keep power for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only half-rational explanation for his dismissal of Primakov
is irritation at the prime minister's relative popularity, at his
modest success in bringing down some of Yeltsin's more venal
cronies, and at the prospect that Primakov might himself be elected
president in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is probably now unhelpable, best left to stew in its own
juice. The sacking of its prime ministers is becoming a routine
event: Stepashin is the fourth nominee for the job in barely a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial collapse last August set off a train of
events that caused damage as far away as Latin America, but most of
the delicate economies of Central Europe and the former Soviet
empire have managed to stay upright against the baleful Russian
wind. It is hard to imagine Russia now doing much more economic
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that were to prove false, there may be little that
outsiders can do to make matters better. Certainly, the West should
resist the argument that it, through the IMF, should bail out
Russia in return for cooperation over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of a hostile Duma, Primakov made little progress
towards meeting the Fund's minimal requirements for new loans,
notably the revamping of the tax and banking systems. Stepashin is
unlikely to do any better.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Russia should neither be ignored nor rejected. It
should be a welcome partner for the West and, in particular, it
could play a part in a Kosovo settlement that would be useful both
to itself and to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   With its rusting but still frightening stack of nuclear
warheads, its geographical reach across ten time zones, its
capacity for bullying small neighbors, and its ability to stir the
emotions of Slavdom against the seeming arrogance of NATO and the
West, even a decrepit Russia has to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will be _ if it has a government to represent it
effectively. But as long as Yeltsin remains president that seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are still that he will give way, at least by the
middle of 2000, either to Moscow's canny, crony-capitalist mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, or, possibly, to Primakov or, less likely, to a
cantankerous but probably more honest ex-general, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   It is just conceivable that a more frighteningly nationalist
figure will emerge. The confusion that Yeltsin has stirred this
week is much more likely to breed that sort of extremist. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to put a smile on the rash, foolish and pointlessly
vindictive decision of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to dismiss
his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, this week.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Primakov was neither a miracle worker nor a bold
reformer. He was adept at making mischief for the West, even as
Russia's own powers, economic and military, continued to wane.
</P>
<P>
   But he commanded some respect at home, and at least offered a
respite of stability that was good for his country and so, on the
whole, good for the world.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomatic affairs, he was experienced, sober and sometimes
sensible. In economic matters, he was less confident, yet during
his eight-month tenure Russia's economy did not sink altogether out
of sight, as some had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Now confusion _ and the possibility even of bloodshed and the
demise of Russia's frail democracy _ are back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who will end up on top. Constitutional procedure
is blurry. Consensus is nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin will probably fend off an impending attempt by the Duma,
Russia's lower house of parliament, to impeach him, but his efforts

<TEXT>
<P>
   Deadlines missed, settlements expanded, the peace process
stalled: a glance at the past three years suggests it would be
reckless to entrust Benjamin Netanyahu with parish-pump
negotiations, let alone the future of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the view of the Palestinians and his Israeli
opponents. But listen also to Netanyahu's erstwhile colleagues, who
worked with him closely until, in despair, they gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister lacks probity, integrity, decency, they
grumble; he makes a promise in the morning and breaks it in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a fellow, as depicted by one-time friends, the right
person to have at the helm as Israel approaches historic decisions
that could define its long-term relations with its neighbors in the
Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   The decisions themselves cannot be avoided. Although the Oslo
peace process is often pronounced dead, Israeli voters are probably
right in assuming that it will return to some sort of life
whichever prime minister they elect.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu dislikes the Oslo arrangements, but he is bound into
them. Moreover, except for a few diehards, right-wing Israelis now
base their objections to handing back land to the Palestinians on
security (a debatable subject), rather than on Israel's sacred
rights (non-debatable).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although Netanyahu never got around to talking to the
Syrians, the sharp rise in Israeli casualties in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon makes it imperative that a deal of some sort is worked out
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt is whether a Netanyahu-led government could or would
be able to bring talks with the Palestinians to a conclusion that
they were at all able to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected Israel's prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu
insisted that the Palestinians, facing a new ``strong'' leader,
would have to lower their expectations. He has been repeating that
mantra in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet expectations, of Palestinians or anyone else, cannot go on
being lowered forever without some consequence. The very real
danger is that Netanyahu might try to push the Palestinians so far
below their minimum demands that their own government could no
longer keep its citizens under control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu correctly says that fewer Israelis have been killed by
Palestinian terrorism on his watch than in the previous period. It
does not follow that the next three years will be equally secure.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his men, deeply unpopular
among their own people for being unable to deliver either a
political agreement or prosperity or good government, continue to
call for patience and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians see Jewish settlements burgeoning on the land
they want to make their state, while their own security forces
cooperate with Israel's to keep violence in check. There are
multiple signs of a conflict-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that time is on the side of a second Netanyahu
experiment is wholly improbable. The alternative is that the
Israelis elect Ehud Barak, the Labor leader, to be their next prime
minister on May 17 (or June 1 if there is no outright winner next
Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Barak is at present comfortably ahead of Netanyahu in the
opinion polls _ but Labor traditionally does better in pre-election
polls than in the elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was an intelligent choice to succeed Shimon Peres after
Labor lost the 1996 vote. An intellectual former chief of staff,
festooned with military decorations, nobody can accuse him of
Peres's alleged indulgence towards the Palestinians (Peres was once
a hawkish defense minister, but that is forgotten).
</P>
<P>
   His main known failing is a wooden manner. His political skills
are neither proven nor disproven.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's freedom for initiative, like Netanyahu's, would be
circumscribed by the coalition he would lead. Many Israelis look
towards a national-unity government, encompassing the Likud as well
as Labor.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this should be the perfect answer for polarized,
indecisive Israel; in practice, the record of Israel's previous
national-unity governments has been poor, with little achieved on
the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   But if Barak were able to pull together a reasonably like-minded
coalition, the advance towards a Palestinian settlement could be
swift.
</P>
<P>
   Although May 4 _ the deadline that Oslo had decreed for a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian agreement _ has slipped by, much of
the donkey-work has been done, either before the change of
government in 1996 or, unofficially, since.
</P>
<P>
   The various outlines at present stuffed into drawers are based
on degrees of compromise by both sides and suggest that few of the
``insuperable'' questions are really insuperable.
</P>
<P>
   The essential first step, however, is up to Israel's voters next
Monday. It is the step of choosing Barak. &QL;

<P>
   Leave your job, log on, click and _ hey, presto! _ you too can
turn into the newest pariah of America's stock markets, an
electronic day trader.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it was Wall Street's takeover barbarians. Today it
is the amateurs in jeans and sneakers who sit in front of a
computer and trade 40-50 times in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did with the Gordon Gekko types in the 1980s, Wall
Street's great and good are demonizing day traders, accusing them
of distorting the stock market and causing volatility in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), does not even dignify day traders as speculators,
let alone investors: he says they are gamblers. And that, as Keynes
once said, is not what the stock market should be about, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the great and good are wrong. Electronic day traders are
merely the most fanatical of a new breed of investors, born of
regulatory changes and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In general, America's 5 million-odd people who buy and sell
shares on the Internet are a good thing. The stock market has been
democratized; Granny can do what was once reserved for boys in red
braces.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has freedom bred recklessness. Most online investors trade
only a little more than they did offline, and extra trades have
meant a more liquid market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also driven down trading commissions, to the benefit
of all investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core day traders, of whom there are fewer than 100,000,
also help the market.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite strategy is to scrutinize quotes offered by
market-makers (professionals who publish prices at which they will
buy or sell shares). If this uncovers a market-maker who is slow to
react when rivals change prices, the day traders attack. But this
encourages market-makers to be alert, resulting in more efficient
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as day traders must complete their trades quickly,
they often offer keener prices than market-makers. This narrows the
difference between best buy and sell prices, giving all investors a
better deal at the expense of intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Against these benefits stands one big accusation: that day
traders who rush in and out of a company's shares make prices more
volatile. Actually, academic studies have found little evidence
that this is true, even for Internet shares, in which online
investors account for an unusually large slice of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than causing high volatility, day traders, who live or
die by exploiting short-term price movements, may be attracted to
shares that are volatile for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Internet shares, such volatility mainly reflects massive
disagreement among investors about what, if anything, the shares
are really worth.
</P>
<P>
   As for gambling, some day traders are doubtless in over their
heads. That is regrettable, but it is not a good reason to attack
day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for people with a gambling addiction, if it were not
shares, it would be something else. And at least in the stock
market, unlike a lottery or a casino, the average punter is not
mathematically certain to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Most day traders would probably be better off putting their
money in a fund that tracked the stock market index. But that
applies equally to most professional equity-fund managers, who also
fail on average to beat the market index.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders may be mauled if today's high share prices prove to
be a stock market bubble. But they would not be the only investors
left looking foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with their expertise at trading fast and often, when the
conflagration comes, they may prove fleeter of foot than the big,
staid institutional investors who have been bad-mouthing them.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's great and good would do better to remind all
investors that being in the stock market at all is, at today's
prices, something of a gamble. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The warrior and the executioner do similar jobs. Both kill the
enemies of the state. But there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   From time immemorial the warrior has been feted and honored. The
public executioner, by contrast, has always had to lurk in the
shadows, working anonymously or for a pittance. There is no glory
in what he does.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of discomfort and shame is why a growing number of
countries have washed their hands of judicial execution. Today
nearly all western democracies, as well as dozens of other
countries, have abandoned capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the countries which still use it with much frequency,
such as China or Iran, are authoritarian states without independent
legal systems.
</P>
<P>
   The single most defiant _ and most notable _ exception to this
trend is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To the irritation of many of its allies, the American government
regularly defends the death penalty in international forums,
reflecting widespread support for capital punishment at home.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, death-penalty opponents have reacted to America's
stubborn exceptionalism on this issue with knee-jerk condemnation,
or despair. Instead they should relish the chance to convert the
world's most vigorous democracy to a saner policy. For they have
the better case.
</P>
<P>
   Three basic arguments are made for the death penalty: that it
deters others, saves innocent lives by ensuring that murderers can
never kill again, and inflicts on them the punishment they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, utilitarian arguments, do not stand up to
scrutiny, while the moral claim for retribution, although naturally
more difficult to refute, can be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite voluminous academic studies of American executions and
crime rates, there is no solid evidence that the death penalty is
any more effective at deterring murder than long terms of
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counter-intuitive. Surely death must deter someone.
But the kinds of people who kill are rarely equipped, or in a
proper emotional state, to make fine calculations about the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even for those who are, decades of imprisonment may be
as great a deterrent as the remote prospect of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Although European countries have abolished the death penalty,
their rates of violent crime have risen more slowly than crime
overall. Indeed, their murder rates remain far below America's.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputable that executing a murderer guarantees that he
cannot kill again, and this argument once carried considerable
weight in societies that could not afford to imprison offenders for
long periods. But today most countries, and especially America, can
afford this.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that support for the death penalty among
Americans drops sharply when life imprisonment without parole is
the alternative. Executions are not needed to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   Against the dubious benefits of capital punishment must be
weighed its undoubted drawbacks. It is a dangerous power to give
any government, and has been grossly abused by many to kill
political opponents and other inconvenient people under the color
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Even America, with all its legal guarantees and complex system
of appeals, has not been able to apply it fairly or consistently.
Worst of all, it is irrevocable. Mistakes can never be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   America, like all countries which use the death penalty, has
executed innocents. This is too high a price to pay for an
unnecessary punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave retribution? Some crimes are so heinous
that a societal cost-benefit analysis hardly appears relevant.
Death alone seems sufficient. And yet, as many relatives of murder
victims have discovered, real retribution can never be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the only way to repay fully those who have
committed multiple murder, or killed in  ghastly way, would be to
torture them physically in turn, or to strive to make them endure
repeatedly the torments of death.
</P>
<P>
   Modern societies have rightly turned away from such practices as
barbaric, tempering their demands for retribution in recognition
that tit-for-tat vengeance is beyond the reach of human justice.
That is where the death penalty, too, belongs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The warrior and the executioner do similar jobs. Both kill the
enemies of the state. But there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   From time immemorial the warrior has been feted and honored. The
public executioner, by contrast, has always had to lurk in the
shadows, working anonymously or for a pittance. There is no glory
in what he does.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of discomfort and shame is why a growing number of
countries have washed their hands of judicial execution. Today
nearly all western democracies, as well as dozens of other
countries, have abandoned capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the countries which still use it with much frequency,
such as China or Iran, are authoritarian states without independent
legal systems.
</P>
<P>
   The single most defiant _ and most notable _ exception to this
trend is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To the irritation of many of its allies, the American government
regularly defends the death penalty in international forums,
reflecting widespread support for capital punishment at home.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, death-penalty opponents have reacted to America's
stubborn exceptionalism on this issue with knee-jerk condemnation,
or despair. Instead they should relish the chance to convert the
world's most vigorous democracy to a saner policy. For they have
the better case.
</P>
<P>
   Three basic arguments are made for the death penalty: that it
deters others, saves innocent lives by ensuring that murderers can
never kill again, and inflicts on them the punishment they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, utilitarian arguments, do not stand up to
scrutiny, while the moral claim for retribution, although naturally
more difficult to refute, can be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite voluminous academic studies of American executions and
crime rates, there is no solid evidence that the death penalty is
any more effective at deterring murder than long terms of
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counter-intuitive. Surely death must deter someone.
But the kinds of people who kill are rarely equipped, or in a
proper emotional state, to make fine calculations about the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even for those who are, decades of imprisonment may be
as great a deterrent as the remote prospect of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Although European countries have abolished the death penalty,
their rates of violent crime have risen more slowly than crime
overall. Indeed, their murder rates remain far below America's.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputable that executing a murderer guarantees that he
cannot kill again, and this argument once carried considerable
weight in societies that could not afford to imprison offenders for
long periods. But today most countries, and especially America, can
afford this.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that support for the death penalty among
Americans drops sharply when life imprisonment without parole is
the alternative. Executions are not needed to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   Against the dubious benefits of capital punishment must be
weighed its undoubted drawbacks. It is a dangerous power to give
any government, and has been grossly abused by many to kill
political opponents and other inconvenient people under the color
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Even America, with all its legal guarantees and complex system
of appeals, has not been able to apply it fairly or consistently.
Worst of all, it is irrevocable. Mistakes can never be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   America, like all countries which use the death penalty, has
executed innocents. This is too high a price to pay for an
unnecessary punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave retribution? Some crimes are so heinous
that a societal cost-benefit analysis hardly appears relevant.
Death alone seems sufficient. And yet, as many relatives of murder
victims have discovered, real retribution can never be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the only way to repay fully those who have
committed multiple murder, or killed in a ghastly way, would be to
torture them physically in turn, or to strive to make them endure
repeatedly the torments of death.
</P>
<P>
   Modern societies have rightly turned away from such practices as
barbaric, tempering their demands for retribution in recognition
that tit-for-tat vengeance is beyond the reach of human justice.
That is where the death penalty, too, belongs. &QL;

   AUSTIN _ Texans have always possessed an uncommon (to other
Americans, downright excessive) pride in their state. They print
T-shirts announcing that Texas is not to be ``messed with'' and
drive around with bumper-stickers reading ``I wasn't born in Texas,
but I got here as soon as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing enough speeches by Texas politicians, the casual
observer might begin to believe that the state's official name is
``The Great State of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if state officials get their way, this vast reservoir of
Lone Star devotion will put money into the pockets of Texan
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) will
launch its ``Go Texan'' campaign, an effort to promote goods grown
or processed in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Products will be ``branded'' with the campaign logo (based on a
cattle brand) and promoted first in Texas, and then across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The TDA will also run TV commercials featuring Texas-bred
celebrities such as Tommy Lee Jones, an actor, and Nolan Ryan, a
baseball star.
</P>
<P>
   When Governor George W. Bush announced the campaign last month
he stood on a stage overflowing with Texas-grown grapefruit, rice,
beef jerky and wine.
</P>
<P>
   If poll data are any indication, the ``Go Texan'' campaign has a
good chance of success. According to a recent survey, if Texas-made
products were identified as such, 89 percent of the state's people
would choose them over goods produced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The TDA believes the campaign will appeal to a natural instinct
among Texans to help out their own. And, if that doesn't work,
there is always peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Susan Combs, the Texas agriculture commissioner,
the idea is to make it ``un-cool'' and ``un-Texan'' to buy anything
but Texan products.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have run campaigns to promote individual
industries, but ``Go Texan'' is the first to label and promote all
a state's agricultural wares.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials believe that the product branding and the
television spots will allow state farmers to break into a national
market for farm products that is still dominated by Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the campaign may find its greatest success outside the
United States. Organizers hope to market Texas agriculture
worldwide by negotiating trade relationships with foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Combs, the Lone Star State has an
international mystique (and an easily recognizable shape) that she
believes can be cashed into revenues for Texan farmers.
</P>
<P>
   She may have a point. After all, international viewership of
``Dallas'' kept the TV series on the air long after J.R. recovered
from his gunshot wounds. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 11, just four days after American bombs had slammed into
China's embassy in Belgrade, the hoarsest cries in Beijing's
diplomatic district came no longer from angry mobs outside the
American and British embassies, but from a lively game of
volleyball in the Vietnamese compound.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden end to the most violent expressions of
anti-Americanism in China since the cultural revolution _ and the
biggest street demonstrations since the Tiananmen protests a decade
ago _ was perhaps not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Though anger was deep and genuine across China, it was nurtured,
channelled and ultimately reined in by a Communist Party that
displayed its still awesome power for social mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Anger was first whipped up by state media that refused to
countenance any interpretation of NATO's attack other than that of
a deliberate act of aggression _ a violent assault upon China's
sovereignty designed to taunt and humiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, students at Beijing University were given government
permission to demonstrate; buses swiftly appeared, and extra
transport was laid on when student numbers proved too large.
</P>
<P>
   In the embassy district the principal attractions were the
coconut shy of the British embassy and the American pillory around
the corner, where the trapped ambassador, James Sasser, was reduced
to eating military rations.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were clearly under orders not to stop paving stones
being ripped up and hurled at the windows. In the southwestern city
of Chengdu, the American consul's house was burned.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not want emotions to run too high for too
long. On May 11, Bill Clinton's apologies were broadcast on state
television, two days after they were first made, suggesting a tacit
acceptance of them.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing University put up notices reproving students for some
rowdy behavior and ordering calm. By May 12, when the ashes of the
three journalist ``martyrs'' killed in the Belgrade bombing arrived
home, the embassy area was entirely sealed off to ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On television, workers have been parroting that the best way
they can show their indignation is to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, especially American ones, got calm
reassurances that China is still open for business.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the end of the matter, at least as far as demonstrations
of high emotion go? Students are hacking away at American and NATO
computers, and earlier this week caused the White House website to
be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts of American products are urged, ``apart'' says one
placard, ``from high-technology ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It may prove to be fairly harmless stuff. It is, after all,
still the dream of many an undergraduate to study further in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate members of the government think that calm is certainly
needed to reassure foreign investors that China's economic
development will continue apace. The crisis comes as foreign
investment looks like slowing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the indignation had better be at least orderly if the
government is to press for its several pounds of diplomatic flesh
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   China is now likely to demand various concessions of America. It
had already withdrawn a set of market-opening measures that Zhu
Rongji, the prime minister, laid confidentially before American
trade negotiators during his trip to Washington last month (and
which the Americans rashly publicized, to China's anger).
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese may now try to insist that they should join the
World Trade Organization this year with few significant
concessions. They will also seek to get American promises that
Taiwan will not be part of a proposed defense umbrella for East
Asia, consisting of early-warning systems against incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And, most vociferously of all, China's leaders have been
insisting that if they are to help with a political solution to
Kosovo _ and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy, and Gerhard
Schroder, the German chancellor, both said in Beijing this week
that Chinese help was necessary _ then the bombing would have to
stop straight away.

<P>
   Since the United States seems unlikely to meet these demands,
how will China react? If the Belgrade bombing is a severe
embarrassment for NATO, particularly America, it is also the
biggest crisis for China's leaders since Tiananmen. Some onlookers
detected cracks in the leadership before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the question of NATO's war in Yugoslavia the government
has been speaking with one voice: if America intervenes over Kosovo
today, why not Taiwan or Tibet tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   The media have fed the Chinese a diet of oppressed Serbs, with
barely a mention of the Kosovars' plight. Yet some policymakers had
been looking more carefully for lessons from the war.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, new, more flexible, political structures might be
needed to head off ethnic unrest in China's own corners of empire,
notably Tibet and Xinjiang. Proponents of such a line, presumably,
are now ripe targets for hard-liners in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing, though, the cracks were widest over economic
policy. Details are hard to come by. But the reported resignations
tendered by two, possibly three, ministers last week looked like
more than carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, those pushing for more economic ties abroad and
faster, painful reforms at home, have made plenty of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, in particular, appears to have staked his political
reputation on forging closer ties to America. His less cosmopolitan
rivals will consider the bombing a chance to get their own back on
a man who himself admits he is brusque, short-tempered and lacking
a factional base. &QL;

   Perhaps not too much should be made of the nagging feeling that
the rabid state media may be getting beyond the control of their
political masters. Nor, perhaps, that the schoolboy of the
Politburo's standing committee, Hu Jintao, has been the front man
during this affair, leaving senior leaders notably less visible.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, Hu who had been chosen a week earlier to
deliver the anniversary speech commemorating the students of the
May 4th movement in 1919, a protest against imperial powers trying
to carve up China among themselves, and a turning point in national
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The students marching past the American embassy last weekend
were, they said, fired by May 4th patriotism. They are, anyway, of
a different generation from the Tiananmen protesters. So how they
will react to the tenth anniversary of the June 4th killings is
hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   For now, their indignation at America's bombing is also their
government's. But the students are visibly elated that popular
protests have become a practiced form of political theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this generation, now blooded, will get a
taste for expressing wider demands should it feel let down by the
government's eventual response to the bombing, or should factional
fights among the leadership become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In calmer times, China's senior men know they sink or swim
together. Not so now. The Belgrade bombing may yet claim some
individual victims. &QL;

<P>
   On May 11, just four days after American bombs had slammed into
China's embassy in Belgrade, the hoarsest cries in Beijing's
diplomatic district came no longer from angry mobs outside the
American and British embassies, but from a lively game of
volleyball in the Vietnamese compound.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden end to the most violent expressions of
anti-Americanism in China since the cultural revolution _ and the
biggest street demonstrations since the Tiananmen protests a decade
ago _ was perhaps not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Though anger was deep and genuine across China, it was nurtured,
channelled and ultimately reined in by a Communist Party that
displayed its still awesome power for social mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Anger was first whipped up by state media that refused to
countenance any interpretation of NATO's attack other than that of
a deliberate act of aggression _ a violent assault upon China's
sovereignty designed to taunt and humiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, students at Beijing University were given government
permission to demonstrate; buses swiftly appeared, and extra
transport was laid on when student numbers proved too large.
</P>
<P>
   In the embassy district the principal attractions were the
coconut shy of the British embassy and the American pillory around
the corner, where the trapped ambassador, James Sasser, was reduced
to eating military rations.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were clearly under orders not to stop paving stones
being ripped up and hurled at the windows. In the southwestern city
of Chengdu, the American consul's house was burned.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not want emotions to run too high for too
long. On May 11, Bill Clinton's apologies were broadcast on state
television, two days after they were first made, suggesting a tacit
acceptance of them.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing University put up notices reproving students for some
rowdy behavior and ordering calm. By May 12, when the ashes of the
three journalist ``martyrs'' killed in the Belgrade bombing arrived
home, the embassy area was entirely sealed off to ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On television, workers have been parroting that the best way
they can show their indignation is to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, especially American ones, got calm
reassurances that China is still open for business.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the end of the matter, at least as far as demonstrations
of high emotion go? Students are hacking away at American and NATO
computers, and earlier this week caused the White House website to
be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts of American products are urged, ``apart'' says one
placard, ``from high-technology ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It may prove to be fairly harmless stuff. It is, after all,
still the dream of many an undergraduate to study further in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate members of the government think that calm is certainly
needed to reassure foreign investors that China's economic
development will continue apace. The crisis comes as foreign
investment looks like slowing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the indignation had better be at least orderly if the
government is to press for its several pounds of diplomatic flesh
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   China is now likely to demand various concessions of America. It
had already withdrawn a set of market-opening measures that Zhu
Rongji, the prime minister, laid confidentially before American
trade negotiators during his trip to Washington last month (and
which the Americans rashly publicized, to China's anger).
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese may now try to insist that they should join the
World Trade Organization this year with few significant
concessions. They will also seek to get American promises that
Taiwan will not be part of a proposed defense umbrella for East
Asia, consisting of early-warning systems against incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And, most vociferously of all, China's leaders have been
insisting that if they are to help with a political solution to
Kosovo _ and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy, and Gerhard
Schroder, the German chancellor, both said in Beijing this week
that Chinese help was necessary _ then the bombing would have to
stop straight away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States seems unlikely to meet these demands,
how will China react? If the Belgrade bombing is a severe
embarrassment for NATO, particularly America, it is also the
biggest crisis for China's leaders since Tiananmen. Some onlookers
detected cracks in the leadership before the bombing.

<P>
   CANBERRA _ A year ago, Australians were being told to batten
down the hatches. The economic turmoil sweeping Asia was expected
to turn south and engulf a country whose economy has been
notoriously prone to boom-bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Australia sells about 60 percent of its exports to Asia, many of
them commodities that are always vulnerable to recession in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's day of reckoning has never arrived. Instead,
with a growth rate of more than 4 percent over the past year, its
economy has outperformed not only its East Asian neighbors, but
most other rich countries, as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Costello, the treasurer (finance minister), presented
his fourth budget to Parliament on May 11, he announced an almost
unheard-of surplus of A$5.4 billion ($3.6 billion) and talked of
Australia entering the next century ``a world leader in living
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking of an Australian miracle yet, as they used to
talk of an Asian miracle. But Australia's turnaround has taken many
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, one of the
country's four biggest banks, forecast recently that Australia
would ``remain a bastion of stability in an extremely volatile
world economic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Singapore, once fond of slapping down Australia's claims to
regional leadership, has changed its tune; during a recent visit,
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, praised Australia's
policies and contrasted them with many Asian countries': ``We were
concentrating on fast growth, quick infrastructure, but forgetting
the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's HSBC bank reckons Australia has entered a prolonged
period of growth that will continue well into the next decade, and
could even surpass the golden age of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Australia still ``rode on the sheep's back,''
with agriculture, especially wool, accounting for much of its
prosperity. Last year farm products made up only one-fifth of its
exports, and wool just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the 1990s has been a surge in manufactured
goods and services which together now contribute twice as much to
exports as farming does.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is seeing the benefits of structural changes over the
past 15 years that have made its economy more resilient. The
changes started with the former Labor government, which took the
crucial decision in 1983 to float the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It dismantled many of the tariffs that had for decades protected
inefficient Australian industries from foreign competition,
deregulated the financial system and started to privatize
transport, communications and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative government that came to power in 1996, headed
by John Howard, has taken these reforms further, especially by
reducing union power. It has sold one-third of Telstra, the
state-owned telecoms giant, and now wants to sell the rest and use
the proceeds to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's coalition was reelected last October with a mandate to
overhaul the tax system. But it faces a hostile Senate, where it
relies on two independents to pass its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that changes seem to be working should help Howard. Now
that they can no longer rely on Australia's small domestic market
of 18 million people, as they could in the bad old days of
protection, companies have learned to switch to new products and
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing factories, once heavily protected, have gone out of
business, whereas industries with higher added value, such as
medical equipment and car parts, have prospered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian turmoil began in 1997, many Australian producers
looked elsewhere to sell. Last year, Australia's exports to Europe
and America rose considerably as those to Asia fell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of Australia's new prosperity is being led by a
consumer boom, which has been supported by a rising stock market,
in which a record number of Australians are now investors. Buoyed
further by rising property prices, people have felt richer, spent
more and saved less.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for imports, together with weak prices for Australia's
commodity exports, has also contributed to one of the economy's
black spots: its current-account deficit, running at 5.5 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, the other black spot, is stuck at 7.5 percent and
shows no signs of improving.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Australia is entering its second century as a
nation in strikingly better shape than it entered its first, when
depression and drought in the 1890s almost strangled the new
country at birth. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA _ A year ago, Australians were being told to batten
down the hatches. The economic turmoil sweeping Asia was expected
to turn south and engulf a country whose economy has been
notoriously prone to boom-bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Australia sells about 60 percent of its exports to Asia, many of
them commodities that are always vulnerable to recession in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's day of reckoning has never arrived. Instead,
with a growth rate of more than 4 percent over the past year, its
economy has outperformed not only its East Asian neighbors, but
most other rich countries, as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Costello, the treasurer (finance minister), presented
his fourth budget to Parliament on May 11, he announced an almost
unheard-of surplus of A$5.4 billion ($3.6 billion) and talked of
Australia entering the next century ``a world leader in living
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking of an Australian miracle yet, as they used to
talk of an Asian miracle. But Australia's turnaround has taken many
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, one of the
country's four biggest banks, forecast recently that Australia
would ``remain a bastion of stability in an extremely volatile
world economic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Singapore, once fond of slapping down Australia's claims to
regional leadership, has changed its tune; during a recent visit,
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, praised Australia's
policies and contrasted them with many Asian countries': ``We were
concentrating on fast growth, quick infrastructure, but forgetting
the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's HSBC bank reckons Australia has entered a prolonged
period of growth that will continue well into the next decade, and
could even surpass the golden age of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Australia still ``rode on the sheep's back,''
with agriculture, especially wool, accounting for much of its
prosperity. Last year farm products made up only one-fifth of its
exports, and wool just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the 1990s has been a surge in manufactured
goods and services which together now contribute twice as much to
exports as farming does.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is seeing the benefits of structural changes over the
past 15 years that have made its economy more resilient. The
changes started with the former Labor government, which took the
crucial decision in 1983 to float the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It dismantled many of the tariffs that had for decades protected
inefficient Australian industries from foreign competition,
deregulated the financial system and started to privatize
transport, communications and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative government that came to power in 1996, headed
by John Howard, has taken these reforms further, especially by
reducing union power. It has sold one-third of Telstra, the
state-owned telecoms giant, and now wants to sell the rest and use
the proceeds to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's coalition was reelected last October with a mandate to
overhaul the tax system. But it faces a hostile Senate, where it
relies on two independents to pass its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that changes seem to be working should help Howard. Now
that they can no longer rely on Australia's small domestic market
of 18 million people, as they could in the bad old days of
protection, companies have learned to switch to new products and
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing factories, once heavily protected, have gone out of
business, whereas industries with higher added value, such as
medical equipment and car parts, have prospered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian turmoil began in 1997, many Australian producers
looked elsewhere to sell. Last year, Australia's exports to Europe
and America rose considerably as those to Asia fell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of Australia's new prosperity is being led by a
consumer boom, which has been supported by a rising stock market,
in which a record number of Australians are now investors. Buoyed
further by rising property prices, people have felt richer, spent
more and saved less.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for imports, together with weak prices for Australia's
commodity exports, has also contributed to one of the economy's
black spots: its current-account deficit, running at 5.5 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, the other black spot, is stuck at 7.5 percent and
shows no signs of improving.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Australia is entering its second century as a
nation in strikingly better shape than it entered its first, when
depression and drought in the 1890s almost strangled the new
country at birth. &QL;

   TOKYO _ So it's agreed: the future of entertainment is a box.
</P>
<P>
   The megadeals that are sweeping the technology and
communications industries all confirm the notion that some slab of
digital wizardry attached to a television will be at the heart of
tomorrow's wired home.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of box? The PC industry is betting on a simple and
cheap PC-based device. The broadcast industry swears by digital TV
set-top boxes. And the rest of the technology industry is busily
dreaming up other gadgets, from Internet appliances to ``AOL TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile another industry, far from the white-hot glare of the
convergence hype, has been making a plausible precursor to such a
machine and selling it by the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Video-game consoles, once the bleeping domain of cartoonish
kiddie-fare, have grown up into powerful computers capable of
near-cinematic realism. In the process they have become an
increasingly adult consumer phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming release of a new generation of superconsoles,
they are poised to break into the wider entertainment and online
world, expanding beyond games to Internet surfing, films, and even
home finance and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   They could thus challenge not only PCs but every other claimant
to the TV-top throne.
</P>
<P>
   The successor to Sony's best-selling Playstation, due out early
next year, will be a 128-bit computer more powerful than a Pentium
III. Analysts predict that it will be able to play DVD movies,
decode digital TV and surf the Web; yet it will sell for less than
$400.
</P>
<P>
   With this machine, claims Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, the
firm will do more than leapfrog its gaming competitors: it may even
challenge ``Wintel,'' the Microsoft and Intel PC standard.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Nintendo and Matsushita jointly announced the
outlines of their own next superconsole, which will have a DVD
drive and 400MHz processor and could arrive late next year.
</P>
<P>
   And in September Sega will unleash a $100 million marketing
campaign for the official release of its new 128-bit Dreamcast in
America.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, more than 100 million Sony
Playstations, Nintendo 64s, Sega Saturns and Dreamcasts will have
found their way into homes in America, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of American households and one-fifth of British
households already have one of these ``next-generation'' game
machines. In Japan almost half do _ far more than have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This year video-game industry sales (both the consoles and the
games they run) will for the first time overtake Hollywood's
box-office revenues. They should be close to $20 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer just kids' stuff: Sony says its average user
is 22 years old; nearly a third are over 30. Scratch an investment
banker and you may easily find a ``Duke Nukem'' death-match king. &QL;

<P>
   The video-game industry has had high points in the past but they
were never like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Atari craze of the 1980s put it on the map. But after
turning Pac-Man into the symbol of the decade (America's Postal
Service has chosen to commemorate the 1980s with a video-game
stamp), the industry burned out in 1984 in a wave of bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, led by Nintendo and Sega, revived it with more
advanced 16-bit machines until they, too, faded in the early 1990s,

   It took Sony and its first games machine, the Playstation, to
break out of the toy niche and reach adults. Launched in Japan in
1994, the Playstation was smart from the start: its spectacular 3-D
games, backed by techno soundtracks, were unlike anything that had
been seen before, even on PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of the Playstation, the games industry has
become the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation sales and games royalties accounted for half of
Sony's operating profits last year. Nintendo's N64, released in
1997, has sold 25 million units so far.
</P>
<P>
   One of its games, ``Legend of Zelda,'' earned $150 million last
Christmas in America, more than any film released in the same
period. &QL;

   The games industry is now preparing to take on the PC and the
television. But to say ``games industry'' is to underplay one of
its chief advantages: it now represents the greatest powers of the
consumer-electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Matsushita (which makes the Panasonic, Technics and
Quasar brands) are global leaders in televisions and in video and
music equipment. Who better to stake a claim on the
home-entertainment center of tomorrow _ and who knows better how to
sell such gear?
</P>
<P>
   Spurring them on is the worry that they may also have the most
to lose in the coming battles for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Their core business is the stuff of TVs, VCRs and CD players,
all of which are about to go through wrenching changes.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of digital TV, which requires heavyweight
electronics to decode the signal, means that a computer of some
sort will sit alongside most televisions in the years to come: the
TV itself will often be just a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of DVD as a video standard brings another digital
device; make it recordable and it starts to become almost another
computer. Add the expected rise in online music distribution, which
requires a network connection, and the home-entertainment console
begins to tilt seriously towards Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the spread of the Internet has created a demand
for Web surfing and e-mail, but with TV-like simplicity,
reliability and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Who can best put all the parts together? Dedicated Internet
appliances, such as Web TV, do not play games. Personal computers
are expensive, crash-prone and unnecessarily complicated. Digital
TV set-top boxes offer nothing but television.
</P>
<P>
   Only consumer-electronics companies have proved that they can do
it all. With games machines as their base, they have the
opportunity to put all the parts together in a way that their
competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games console is the stealth platform,'' says Jon Peddie
of JPA, a digital-media market research firm in San Francisco. ``It
is the first serious challenge for (interactive) consumer eyeballs
that the PC has seen. And it doesn't hurt that Sony is the Intel of
the consumer-electronics industry.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may come as no surprise that Sony and its sort will be
powerful forces in home entertainment. But are families really
willing to put a games machine in the center of their living rooms?
</P>
<P>
   They might be, if they could see what sort of games are on the
way. Visit Square, a game-software developer in Tokyo, and you
might be at George Lucas's digital soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between making a video game for the
superconsoles and making a special-effects film are vanishing by
the day. They share the same digital modelling, the same
sophistication of soundtracks, similar scripts and dialogue, and
even camera angles and techniques (for the games, the ``cameras''
are simply the computer's designated viewpoints, but to achieve
film-like realism, the software creates camera effects such as lens
flare).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after wowing gamers with its ``Final Fantasy'' series of
games, Square, along with Columbia Pictures, is now using the same
techniques to make a fully fledged film, for release in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Other games, including ``Tomb Raider,'' ``Resident Evil'' and
``Duke Nukem'' are all heading for the big screen as well; most big
sci-fi and action films also convert perfectly into games.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Pac-Man'' and ``Mortal Kombat,'' and think ``Bug's
Life'' and ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' Increasingly, it is
all digital entertainment in one way or another. The main
difference is that some is interactive and some is not. &QL;

   The coming of DVD as a video standard brings another digital
device; make it recordable and it starts to become almost another
computer. Add the expected rise in online music distribution, which
requires a network connection, and the home-entertainment console
begins to tilt seriously towards Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the spread of the Internet has created a demand
for Web surfing and e-mail, but with TV-like simplicity,
reliability and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Who can best put all the parts together? Dedicated Internet
appliances, such as Web TV, do not play games. Personal computers
are expensive, crash-prone and unnecessarily complicated. Digital
TV set-top boxes offer nothing but television.
</P>
<P>
   Only consumer-electronics companies have proved that they can do
it all. With games machines as their base, they have the
opportunity to put all the parts together in a way that their
competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games console is the stealth platform,'' says Jon Peddie
of JPA, a digital-media market research firm in San Francisco. ``It
is the first serious challenge for (interactive) consumer eyeballs
that the PC has seen. And it doesn't hurt that Sony is the Intel of
the consumer-electronics industry.'' &QL;

   It may come as no surprise that Sony and its sort will be
powerful forces in home entertainment. But are families really
willing to put a games machine in the center of their living rooms?
</P>
<P>
   They might be, if they could see what sort of games are on the
way. Visit Square, a game-software developer in Tokyo, and you
might be at George Lucas's digital soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between making a video game for the
superconsoles and making a special-effects film are vanishing by
the day. They share the same digital modelling, the same
sophistication of soundtracks, similar scripts and dialogue, and
even camera angles and techniques (for the games, the ``cameras''
are simply the computer's designated viewpoints, but to achieve
film-like realism, the software creates camera effects such as lens
flare).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after wowing gamers with its ``Final Fantasy'' series of
games, Square, along with Columbia Pictures, is now using the same
techniques to make a fully fledged film, for release in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Other games, including ``Tomb Raider,'' ``Resident Evil'' and
``Duke Nukem'' are all heading for the big screen as well; most big
sci-fi and action films also convert perfectly into games.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Pac-Man'' and ``Mortal Kombat,'' and think ``Bug's
Life'' and ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' Increasingly, it is
all digital entertainment in one way or another. The main
difference is that some is interactive and some is not. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ So it's agreed: the future of entertainment is a box.
</P>
<P>
   The megadeals that are sweeping the technology and
communications industries all confirm the notion that some slab of
digital wizardry attached to a television will be at the heart of
tomorrow's wired home.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of box? The PC industry is betting on a simple and
cheap PC-based device. The broadcast industry swears by digital TV
set-top boxes. And the rest of the technology industry is busily
dreaming up other gadgets, from Internet appliances to ``AOL TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile another industry, far from the white-hot glare of the
convergence hype, has been making a plausible precursor to such a
machine and selling it by the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Video-game consoles, once the bleeping domain of cartoonish
kiddie-fare, have grown up into powerful computers capable of
near-cinematic realism. In the process they have become an
increasingly adult consumer phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming release of a new generation of superconsoles,
they are poised to break into the wider entertainment and online
world, expanding beyond games to Internet surfing, films, and even
home finance and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   They could thus challenge not only PCs but every other claimant
to the TV-top throne.
</P>
<P>
   The successor to Sony's best-selling Playstation, due out early
next year, will be a 128-bit computer more powerful than a Pentium
III. Analysts predict that it will be able to play DVD movies,
decode digital TV and surf the Web; yet it will sell for less than
$400.
</P>
<P>
   With this machine, claims Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, the
firm will do more than leapfrog its gaming competitors: it may even
challenge ``Wintel,'' the Microsoft and Intel PC standard.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Nintendo and Matsushita jointly announced the
outlines of their own next superconsole, which will have a DVD
drive and 400MHz processor and could arrive late next year.
</P>
<P>
   And in September Sega will unleash a $100 million marketing
campaign for the official release of its new 128-bit Dreamcast in
America.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, more than 100 million Sony
Playstations, Nintendo 64s, Sega Saturns and Dreamcasts will have
found their way into homes in America, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of American households and one-fifth of British
households already have one of these ``next-generation'' game
machines. In Japan almost half do _ far more than have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This year video-game industry sales (both the consoles and the
games they run) will for the first time overtake Hollywood's
box-office revenues. They should be close to $20 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer just kids' stuff: Sony says its average user
is 22 years old; nearly a third are over 30. Scratch an investment
banker and you may easily find a ``Duke Nukem'' death-match king. &QL;

<P>
   The video-game industry has had high points in the past but they
were never like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Atari craze of the 1980s put it on the map. But after
turning Pac-Man into the symbol of the decade (America's Postal
Service has chosen to commemorate the 1980s with a video-game
stamp), the industry burned out in 1984 in a wave of bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, led by Nintendo and Sega, revived it with more
advanced 16-bit machines until they, too, faded in the early 1990s,
overshadowed by the PC. &QL;

   It took Sony and its first games machine, the Playstation, to
break out of the toy niche and reach adults. Launched in Japan in
1994, the Playstation was smart from the start: its spectacular 3-D
games, backed by techno soundtracks, were unlike anything that had
been seen before, even on PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of the Playstation, the games industry has
become the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation sales and games royalties accounted for half of
Sony's operating profits last year. Nintendo's N64, released in
1997, has sold 25 million units so far.
</P>
<P>
   One of its games, ``Legend of Zelda,'' earned $150 million last
Christmas in America, more than any film released in the same
period. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The games industry is now preparing to take on the PC and the
television. But to say ``games industry'' is to underplay one of
its chief advantages: it now represents the greatest powers of the
consumer-electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Matsushita (which makes the Panasonic, Technics and
Quasar brands) are global leaders in televisions and in video and
music equipment. Who better to stake a claim on the
home-entertainment center of tomorrow _ and who knows better how to
sell such gear?
</P>
<P>
   Spurring them on is the worry that they may also have the most
to lose in the coming battles for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Their core business is the stuff of TVs, VCRs and CD players,
all of which are about to go through wrenching changes.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of digital TV, which requires heavyweight
electronics to decode the signal, means that a computer of some
sort will sit alongside most televisions in the years to come: the
TV itself will often be just a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of DVD as a video standard brings another digital
device; make it recordable and it starts to become almost another
computer. Add the expected rise in online music distribution, which
requires a network connection, and the home-entertainment console
begins to tilt seriously towards Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>

reliability and cost.

 WASHINGTON: development program. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American intelligence community has suspected that China
stole W-70 design information from Lawrence Livermore since the
early 1980s, according to officials. The FBI investigation,
code-named Tiger Trap, never led to any arrests. But officials said
that the scientist who was fired as a result of the investigation
made a series of trips to China after he left the laboratory in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea that the stolen W-70 design technology was being
applied by China for use in its new generation of small warheads
for the DF-31 was a subject of intense controversy within American
intelligence agencies until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that it was not until last month's
government-wide damage assessment report on Chinese nuclear
espionage that many intelligence analysts began to connect the
theft of design secrets with the evidence gathered on the DF-31 and
the ongoing modernization of China's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The DF-31, a solid-fuel missile, would be the first Chinese
inter-continental ballistic missile that would be moved on roads.
China test-fired its rocket motor last July, and the missile was
scheduled to be flight tested last December, The Washington Times
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the missile has apparently been slower than
that of its warhead, officials believe. China conducted six or
seven tests of the two-stage warhead the United States expects to
be deployed on the DF-31, and completed that testing in the early
1990s. U.S. officials now believe the DF-31 will carry only one
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Once the DF-31 and other advanced missiles are deployed, China
is expected to begin to phase out its older and less accurate
ballistic missiles that carry large, bulky warheads. ``The DF-31
ICBM will give China a major strike capability that will be
difficult to counterattack at any stage of its operation, from
pre-flight mobile operations through the terminal flight phase,''
the 1996 Air Force intelligence report predicted. The ``road
mobility'' of the DF-31, the report adds, ``will greatly improve
Chinese nuclear ballistic missile survivability and will complicate
the task of defeating the Chinese threat.''

 &HT;    PLIGHT OF KOSOVO ALBANIAN CHILDREN, RUNS PARALLEL TO THOSE OF
BOSNIAN WAR
 &HT;    With Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ They joke and laugh and draw
pictures, just like so many children the world over. For a moment,
it's easy to imagine the eight- and nine-year-olds in Hamdija
Pasic's art class are just like other children.
</P>
<P>
   But these children have seen the worst the adult world has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the bloody civil war ended here, many of
Bosnia's youngest victims are still reeling from the horrors they
lived through. Horrors that aid officials worry are now being
repeated on a new wave of innocents from the war-torn Serb province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Pasic and scores of psychologists, psychiatrists, social
workers and teachers struggle to undo the damage the war did to
Bosnia's children, they hope that their work here sheds some light
on the problems sure to arise with Kosovar Albanian refugee
children.
</P>
<P>
   Pasic, a counselor with the Christian aid organization World
Vision, particularly worries
</P>
<P>
   about one little boy. There's one like him in every class, a
withdrawn, troubled child who won't talk about the memories that
haunt him. When he draws a picture of himself, he scribbles over
the face, obliterating the eyes and nose, scratching out the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a refugee, but we're not sure what else happened
to him,'' Pasic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some pretty serious problems, self-esteem issues. We
think there are family problems, but we're not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   So how will the children of Kosovo fare? What ongoing effects
will they feel years from now?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say, experts in Bosnia say. Nationwide statistics
aren't available, though counselors say they're seeing some very
serious problems, including an increase in juvenile crime and
suicide. A few months ago, a Sarajevo 13-year-old committed suicide
with a hand grenade, a method that's become increasingly common
since the war here ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the world will never understand what these children
have suffered,'' said
</P>
<P>
   sociologist Milanka Mikovic. ``Hundreds of thousands lost their
homes, their friends, their
</P>
<P>
   schools, their pets, and all the things that make the lives of
kids what it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikovic studied a group of 500 schoolchildren between the ages
of six and ten in Sarajevo. Twenty-three percent had seen a
relative wounded; 38 percent had seen dead bodies in the street; 46
percent were refugees within the city. Among those children, she
found an unusually high incidence of insomnia, aggressive behavior,
panic attacks, depression and problems in school.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, 45,000 children lost a parent. More than
3,000 lost both parents. And tens of thousands lost relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors like Pasic do what they can for the children. The
World Vision program includes music therapy and group discussions
about things like conflicts and how to resolve them, fears and how
to cope with them, memories and how to understand them. At
HealthNet, another humanitarian aid group working here, counselors
work one-on-one with the more seriously disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to make a prognosis,'' said psychologist
Amira Gradincic. ``What we're
</P>
<P>
   seeing, is it going to be a damaged generation in two years?
It's hard to know. In 15 years, yeah, maybe. They did suffer a lot
and they are still carrying those experiences with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's children are also struggling with the physical
consequences of the war. More
</P>
<P>
   than 35,000 were wounded and approximately 4,000 of those
suffered disfiguring injuries,
</P>
<P>
   according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed a lot of eye problems and more leukemia than we
used to,'' said pediatrician Mira Ademovic. ``But we don't have the
funds to do any kind of systematic analysis to be able to say for
sure, this child's problem is because of the war or we have more of
this type of problem because of the war. We don't even have the
equipment to do analyses to determine nutritional deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ademovic said she has seen many children who's growth was
stunted by poor diet and health care during the war and even three
years later; they're shorter and smaller than
</P>
<P>
   their ages would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, counselors at Moj Prijatelj, which means ``My
Friend'' in Serbo-Croatian,
</P>
<P>
   work with another group of children struggling just to be kids.
</P>
<P>
   The girls in the seven- to 12-year-olds group idolize the Spice
Girls and worship the
</P>
<P>
   Back Street Boys. They come to the center every afternoon to
practice dances they'll do
</P>
<P>
   in a play they're planning.
</P>
<P>
   A video-tape of last year's play, which the children wrote
themselves, seems to start like any other school play. The princess
complains she's bored and one of her friends suggests she have a
new dress made. No, the princess says, she has too many dresses.
Another friend suggests she start another war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We've already fought everyone. I'm bored with war,'' the
princess says, almost hopefully.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis go to the polls Monday to choose their next
prime minister. Though they could face a run-off on June 1, the two
clear frontrunners are incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin ``Bibi''
Netanyahu and challenger Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   THE INCUMBENT UNDER FIRE: BENJAMIN ``BIBI'' NETANYAHU
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS: Elected in 1996, heads the right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE: The American-educated 49-year-old is smooth and
telegenic. First Israeli prime minister to really resemble American
politicians. Fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   BRAINS: Went to high school in the United States, got a master's
degree in business from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   BRAWN: Commando captain in the Israeli army. Was shot in the
hand by friendly fire during the rescue of a hijacked Sabena
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWS: Fierce opponent of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
Oslo peace process. Since being elected, he has slowed the process
down.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING: Support from Jewish settlers living in the disputed
West Bank territories, ultra-religious Jews and the blue-collar
Jews whose families immigrated to Israel from other Middle Eastern
countries.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNTESTED CHALLENGER: EHUD BARAK
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS: Barak heads the left-wing Labor Party, but spent most
of his career in the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE: The 57-year-old is short and stocky, and speaks with
heavily accented English.
</P>
<P>
   BRAINS: Master's in engineering systems from Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   BRAWN: Israeli army's most decorated soldier. Was Netanyahu's
commander. Once sneaked into Beirut, disguised as a woman, and
assassinated terrorists in a PLO headquarters. His campaign
commercials call him ``soldier number 1.''
</P>
<P>
   VIEWS: Would accelerate Oslo peace process but says he will give
up little more than Netanyahu. He has stressed economic and social
issues in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING: His support mostly comes from secular Jews of European
descent and Israel's large Arab population.

 &HT;    AS WORLD WATCHES, ISRAELI VOTE WILL HINGE ON PERSONALITIES
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-CANDIDATES-$ADV16.
 &HT;    For Sun., May 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Israelis prepare to vote in elections Monday, the
question of how their country will co-exist with its neighbors is
being pushed slowly aside by the question of how Israelis will live
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   They will be voting according to their disparate views on
whether Israel should be a Western-styled democracy or a Jewish
fundamentalist state. They will be expressing their frustration
over a recession and looking for candidates that sympathize with
their particular ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   And, while they revel in the politics of the region's only
democracy -- voter turnout is sure to be over 80 percent -- the
divisions between what many call Israel's ``tribes,'' are in plain
view.
</P>
<P>
   On major intersections across the country, religious Israeli
youth -- boys in yamulkas and girls in long skirts -- carry signs
for the several right-wing and religious parties. Opposing them are
left-wing secular youth, in halter tops and jeans -- touting their
favorite pols.
</P>
<P>
   Five candidates vie for prime minister. The clear front-runners
are incumbent right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin ``Bibi'' Netanyahu
and former general, left-winger Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The minor candidates -- former defense minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, extreme right-winger Benjamin ``Benny'' Begin and Arab
candidate Azmi Bishara -- could likely drop out before Monday's
vote. If not, Netanyahu and Barak will probably face each other in
a June 1 run-off. Polls currently show Barak with a small lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, and Netanyahu, 49, used to be in the same elite
commando unit, but they battle each other now under the guidance of
their American political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu tells Israelis that even the Arabs want Barak because
he's weak. Barak, on the other hand, seems to appeal on a wider
range of issues. He tells Israelis that Netanyahu has left the
country ``stuck'' on all fronts, from economic development to
religious tolerance to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, far from world peace, the race could hinge on the
personality of Netanyahu, who seems to both inflame and personify
the country's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters are the ultra-religious and ethnic groups that
proudly call themselves ``the rabble.'' They feel Netanyahu fights
for them against Israel's elites just as he does against the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's opponents are fed up with that confrontational
nature. They call him a liar who is exploiting Israel's divisions
and pushing it toward war its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of Netanyahu's cabinet ministers have abandoned and
bad-mouthed him. The distrust seems to trickle down to his voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay loyal to who is with the right wing,'' says reluctant
Netanyahu supporter Eliyahu Mordechai, 33. ``But, as far as the
personal aspect goes, there have been changes. He's not so
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai sells nuts in Jerusalem's Mehaneh Yehudah produce
market, long a Netanyahu stronghold. The market is filled with
blue-collar Jews descended from other Middle Eastern countries who
feel alienated by Israel's Jews of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai removed the prime minister's picture from his stall
after Netanyahu fired a popular defense minister. Striding out of
his shop toward the crowded market, Mordechai sums up the changing
mood: ``Barak is going to win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former Netanyahu supporters have been repelled by the
power he has granted to the ultra-religious parties in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union voted heavily for Netanyahu in 1996, tipping the election his
way. They were hawks on security and felt ignored by the Labor
Party elites.
</P>
<P>
   But they are largely secular, and Netanyahu's religious allies
have challenged their Judaism, making it difficult for them to get
married or bring other relatives to the country. Polls show many
Russians are looking toward Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week(CQ), as he plunged in public opinion polls, the brash
Netanyahu turned to contrition. Telegenic as always, the
American-educated politician called his Likud Party loyalists home,
trying to remind them of the issue that has usually mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching a moment of truth in these elections,''
Netanyahu stated. ``I never said I was free of errors, but there is
one thing I can say, with my hand on my heart: That I have lead the
state of Israeli on the only road that can bring security and
peace. . . . I implore you to put aside all other concerns. I
implore you to come home to the Likud.''
</P>
<P>
   But, security is a tougher sell this year than in the past.
Barak's stance toward the Arabs differs little from Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sting of the campaign, the Arabs, has been neutralized,''
said pollster Hanoch Smith. ``It's very hard to differentiate among
any one of the candidates as to what they're saying about the main
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Netanyahu may be tough, but Barak was Netanyahu's
former army commander. He is also Israel's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, he would likely move quicker than Netanyahu on small
issues in the peace process, but stay firm on the major principles.
He refuses to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians, insists on
keeping most of the West Bank settlements in place and says he'll
be stingy with West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference is one of attitude. While Netanyahu reminds
Israelis of their fear of Arabs, Barak tells them they have nothing
to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more powerful than any neighbor. We can afford to
pursue peace from a position of strength,'' says Barak, whose short
and stocky physique belies his commando past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to fight terrorism. I will not let anybody strain
our security,'' Barak says.
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk has helped Barak bring the Labor Party toward the
political center, just as U.S. President Bill Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair did when their parties were viewed as too
far left of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak has taken cues from the outside world, world leaders
seem to be pulling for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Clinton administration appeared to back Netanyahu's
losing opponent, Shimon Peres. Now, it has been careful to remain
neutral. But it's clear that Netanyahu has frequently upset Clinton
by stalling the peace process and encouraging settlements on
disputed West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   Several Arab leaders, through appeals to his opponents, indicate
they also want Netanyahu out.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact Netanyahu is quick to publicize. But, it doesn't
matter to people like Galit Natan, a 30-year-old architect who
brought her daughter to a ``Just not Netanyahu'' rally recently.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barak and Netanyahu will make similar concessions in
the peace process but, ``the process to get there with Netanyahu
will be horrible. It's the person. We are voting for a person, not
a party.''

<P>
   BENITO JUAREZ, Mexico _ Scorched pines appear to scream against
the sky here, the victims of devastating fires that swept through
Mexico last year and sent plumes of smoke wafting into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican forestry experts say parts of the Chimalapas wilderness
in southern Oaxaca and Chiapas states -- which includes Mexico's
last virgin jungle and cloud forest -- were left in ashes and will
need a century or two to grow back.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than forest fires that threaten one of the world's
most biologically diverse landscapes, where pine-studded mountains
blend into lowland jungle and misty cloud forest so rugged it has
never been fully explored.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts to teach other ways of farming have begun,
many peasants in the Chimalapas this spring are continuing to use
slash-and-burn farming to prepare fields for planting and make way
for cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The centuries-old practice of setting fire to land is killing
off life in once lush valleys and slopes of the Chimalapas. Because
Mexico's National Ecological Institute estimates that more than 95
percent of the country's original tropical and rain forests(CQ)
have been decimated since the Spanish nearly 500 years ago, the
Chimalapas is a precious survivor dear to conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   The forest, which occupies much of Mexico's Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, is home to plants that grow nowhere else on the planet
and endangered animals like jaguars and the green-plumed quetzal
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Slash-and-burn farming was blamed for sparking many of last
year's fires, along with fires set by squatters clearing land for
cattle pastures and narcotics traffickers carving out space to
plant marijuana or opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal logging continues to claim threatened cedar and mahogany
in the Chimalapas. And squatters continue to encroach on lands
belonging to the native Zoque (pronounced, ``So-kay'') Indians
sparking violent clashes over land ownership the government has so
far failed to address.
</P>
<P>
   After the fires last year, a presidential decree was issued to
prevent charred forest from being colonized. But the World Wildlife
Fund and Zoque natives here fear the decree is being ignored --
easy enough in a region so remote and wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man's only limits to moving in are his own,'' said Domingo
Jimenez, a Zoque Indian with a third-grade education who fought
fires last year and is a passionate environmentalist, organic
farmer and foe of slash-and-burn agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Casteneda of the World Wildlife Fund in Oaxaca said the
organization has already received reports of people moving into
fire-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF collaborated with the Mexican government on a post-fire
study that estimated that at least 35 percent of the vast
Chimalapas forest -- which is more than 1.4 million acres -- was
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated four percent of the damaged area was completely
incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the WWF and the government agree that most remote
sections of the jungle terrain are too sensitive to be reforested
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of acres of jungle teems with as many as 400 species of
flora or fauna and reforestation would probably upset that delicate
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the diversity is so great that if people don't enter
the forest to use the land or raise cattle on it then it has a
greater chance of recovering,'' Casteneda said. ``But in no less
than 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wendt, a University of Texas at Austin botanist who began
exploring the Chimalapas in the late 1970s, said keeping people out
is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fires were devastating,'' he said. ``But the real problem
is what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Squatters have been picking at the edges of the Chimalapas for
decades, eroding pines by repeated burnings and moving further into
the heart of the forest, where only a handful of communities are
legally entitled to own land.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are worried that a highway under construction
on the forest's northern border with Veracruz will cut through the
jungle and create more pressure to open up it up for exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxacan government officials are considering making the
Chimalapas a protected biological reserve. But they've run into
resistance from the Zoque, who fear outsiders will end up
exploiting the forest, not protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a writer and one of Mexico's most outspoken
environmentalists, says the Zoque have a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in Mexico is that laws protecting biological
reserves are constantly being violated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez agrees, and believes the Zoque should be made stewards
of a reserve. ``We know the valuable resource we have and we know
we're capable of taking care of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old farmer lives in Benito Juarez, a hamlet of
wooden huts with no electricity that's three hours into the
Chimalapas by car and 40 miles from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bone-crunching drive with rivers to ford and narrow
twists that drop off into mist-filled canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Peaks topped by cloud forest soar above pines covered in
epiphytes and flocks of parrots circle in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez knows the Chimalapas as well as anyone, and last year he
walked through smoke and flames into the jungle to cut landing
zones for firefighters dropped in by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The carbonized remains of pines and other trees disturb the
beauty of the landscape along the road to Benito Juarez. But the
most devastated areas -- where 200- and 300-year-old trees were
killed -- are at least a six-hour hike into the jungle, Jimenez
said.
</P>
<P>
   When smoke from the Chimalapas fires and others in Mexico wafted
across the Gulf of Mexico in May 1998, communities in Texas were
forced to declare environmental alerts. After diplomatic haggling,
Mexico finally asked for help and a team of U.S. firefighting
experts arrived in the Chimalapas to offer technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spent $7.6 million in aid, especially for the
rental of special airplanes to help douse flames that hop-scotched
through the jungle. Never before, natives said, had the moist cloud
forest been consumed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico's spring rains were late last year, the jungle
was drier and vulnerable to sparks from controlled fires that
leaped out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and other farmers who harbor a deep distrust for the
government also believe arsonists set fires to help open the way
for the government's large highway project.
</P>
<P>
   This year rain has already moistened the Chimalapas, squelching
fear of a similar catastrophe, said Oscar Sedeno, director of
forestry for Mexico's environmental ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Although slash-and-burn farming has not been prohibited, Sedeno
said, federal officials are offering workshops on how farmers can
turn the remains of corn stalks and other crops into mulch rather
than burning their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who belongs to an environmental group in Oaxaca called
Maderas del Pueblo, or Forests for the People, is way ahead of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Maderas del Pueblo, he's been leading a revolution
among villagers by teaching organic farming methods.
</P>
<P>
   He's been slashing and plowing under crop remains for five
years, fertilizing his land with compost he makes instead of
relying on ash from burnings. He mixes insecticides from the same
herbs he uses as medicinal teas and poultices.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 80 families in Benito Juarez have been converted to
organic farming, especially after they saw Jimenez's crop yields
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to just strike a match and walk away,''
Jimenez said. ``It's almost double the work to plow the field
under. But it pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The village of Benito Juarez and neighboring villages of outside
colonizers live in an uneasy truce. But Jimenez says many outsiders
aren't interested in protecting the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over control of the Chimalapas go back to colonial times,
when Jimenez's ancestors were forced to buy back their land from
the Spanish, giving birth to the name, ``Chimalapas,'' which means
``gourd full of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the road to Benito Juarez, Jimenez surveys fresh ash
covering a hillside that a colonizer has burned for several years
each spring so new grass will grow as pasture land.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day nothing will grow here, not grass, not trees,''
Jimenez said. ``There are alternatives to this, but it's hard to
break with tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires set by other farmers were crackling along the road, some
smoldering unattended -- a violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Juarez resident Miguel Maya turned over the names of two
offenders of the law to authorities this month and is waiting to
hear the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should get jail,'' he said. ``The people who burn the
forest endanger the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maya joined one of the new fire brigades Mexico's environmental
ministry established this year to patrol Mexican forests at risk.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chimalapas still doesn't have sufficient look-out
towers, but at least the brigades are better equipped than last
year, when kerchief-clad peasants tried to fight fires by swatting
at flames with branches.
</P>
<P>
   Sedeno said the country has tried to improve its firefighting
capability over the last year with more training, radio
communication systems and public information campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This month U.S. Forest Service employees paid a follow-up visit
to talk about safety in areas where firefighter fatalities
occurred, Sedeno said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has established a system for offering quick
financial and technical support again if Mexico requests it, said a
spokesperson at the United States Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico was severely criticized at home and in the
United States for not requesting aid sooner from the United States
to extinguish the fires, some of the worst this century.

   MAP INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Benito Juarez, Oaxaca is a village inside the Chimalapas forest,
which occupies half of Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
</P>
<P>
   For big picture purposes, Benito Juarez is about 254 miles
southeast of the capital city of Oaxaca and about 40 miles north of
the small city of Zanatepec, which is on Highway 190 on the
southern half of the Isthmus. Zanatepec is 53 miles east of the
city of Juchitan, a relatively large city also on Mexico's Highway
190.
</P>
<P>
   The Chimalapas forest is a massive area of some 1,467,180 acres.
Its western border is, roughly, Mexico's Highway 185 and its
southern border is Highway 190. To the west, the forest extends
into Chiapas almost to the city of Cintalapa and north to the
reservoir Netzahualcoyotl. The northern border of the forest is the
state of Veracruz.

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the host of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour
With Lou Dobbs.'' What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dobbs, 54, has a degree in economics from Harvard University.
So it came as a surprise to friends and family when he announced
his intention to pursue a career in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He began his broadcast journalism career as a police and fire
reporter for KBLU-AM in Yuma, Ariz., and was a copy editor for the
Los Angeles Times before joining Seattle's KING-TV as a financial
news reporter. While there he caught the eye of CNN, which hired
him in 1980 as the network's chief economics corresponent and
anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Four years later, Dobbs became vice
president and managing editor of ``CNN Financial News,'' and in
1992 was named senior vice president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He was named CNN's executive vice president in May 1995 and was
responsible for the launch of CNNfn _ the first network to launch
simultaneously on TV and on the Internet _ in December 1995. In
addition to being responsible for CNN Financial News, Dobbs anchors
``Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs,'' ``Business Unusual'' and
the weekend program ``Managing With Lou Dobbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel the other day showed the
launching of a Navy ship named the Carole Lombard. I've never heard
of it. Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a Navy vessel, said John Reilly of the Navy
Historical Center in Washington. The Carole Lombard was a Liberty
ship, one of the mass-produced merchant ships built for the Federal
Maritime Commission. It's a common misconception that ``anything
that floats'' during wartime is believed to be a naval vessel,
Reilly said, but Liberty ships had nothing to do with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Carole Lombard, Clark Gable's wife, had been killed in a
1942 plane crash in Nevada while participating in a bond drive for
the Hollywood Victory Committee, Reilly recalled. So, he said,
someone in authority decided it would be appropriate to honor her
memory by naming a Liberty ship after her.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said anyone interested in such vessels can find a wealth
of information in the book ``The Liberty Ships,'' by L.A. Sawyer
and W.H. Mitchell. It can be found at many libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the taxpayers pay the cost of the trip to Europe for the
delegation led by Rev. Jesse Jackson? Was the group flown over on
U.S. military aircraft?
</P>
<P>
   A: No on both counts. The Jackson delegation's trip was
privately funded, said James Gomez of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's
Washington office, and its members flew on commercial aircraft. The
White House press office said that as a privately funded
humanitarian mission, the group would not have been able to use
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that 751 people were contacted for a
nationwide poll. That amounts to about three people per million.
How could that be called accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poll-takers call the process ``probability sampling'' and
say it's the fundamental basis for all survey research. The Gallup
Organization says the basic principle is that a randomly selected,
small percentage of a population of people can represent the
attitudes, opinions or projected behavior of all of the people, if
the sample is selected correctly.
</P>
<P>
   For national Gallup polls, the objective is to present the
opinions of a sample of people which are exactly the same opinions
that would have been obtained had it been possible to interview all
adult Americans in the country. That not being possible, a sample
is taken. If every member of a population has an equal probability
of being selected, then the sample will be representative of the
population, Gallup contends.
</P>
<P>
   The 751 people you refer to is a bit smaller than Gallup's
preferred range. Gallup says the current adult population in the
continental United States is 187 million, and the typical sample
size for a Gallup poll designed to represent this general
population is 1,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us how to get into the lottery for Masters practice
round tickets for next year. My question: Are those of us who were
able to get tickets for this year's practice rounds automatically
in the drawing for next year, or do we have to resubmit?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll be included in next year's drawing, said Glenn
Greenspan at Augusta National Golf Club, so don't submit your name
again. For recorded information about the 2000 Masters and practice
rounds, call 706-667-6700.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something on TV about a study by Harvard or its
medical school proving conclusively the importance to children of
eating breakfast. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest in a series of Harvard research studies basically
affirmed just what parents have been telling their children for
years: Eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with improved
performance in school.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported at a U.S. Department of Agriculture
Symposium on breakfast and learning in children. Dr. Robert
Kleinman, a Harvard Medical School researcher, coordinated a series
of research studies sponsored by the Kellogg Co. ``The body of
evidence is still growing, and it points to the fact that children
who eat breakfast perform better in school,'' Kleinman reported.
``Breakfast positively impacts children's cognitive, emotional and
psychosocial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What to feed them is as simple as cereal, milk and fresh fruit,
the researchers said. Tracy Fox of the American Dietetic
Association said alternatives can be a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich or leftovers from the night before, and they can be eaten
either at home or at school. Whatever the food is, she concludes
that ``breakfast is the most important meal of the day'' for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Rep. Bob Barr (D-Ga.) was the
top House member taking privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips
last year. The item said Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and John
Conyers (D-Mich.) were second and third, but gave no details on
their travels. Can you shed some light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported initially by The Hill, the Capitol Hill
newspaper, Barr took 25 privately funded trips last year. Many were
sponsored by conservative organizations and some by news
organizations, such as NBC, that invited him to be interviewed
about the House impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Conyers both spoke frequently at the expense of
African-American interest groups. Waters ranked No. 2 on the list
with 17 trips last year, The Hill reported. Her husband, Sidney
Williams, former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, often joined
Waters on her trips. Essence Communications, on whose board Waters
sits, sent her on a three-day jaunt to the Bahamas for a music
festival empowerment seminar. Conyers came in third with 16 trips.
Most of his travel was for speeches to minority groups, The Hill
said, but he also attended the birthday of Lionel Hampton courtesy
of the jazz musician's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   These were among 790 expense-paid trips taken by members of
Congress last year at the expense of corporations, nonprofit
organizations and other interest groups. While critics contend that
the interest groups involved in such trips get a golden opportunity
to give members of Congress a skewed view of the facts, the
invitees defend the trips as invaluable learning tools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper sports section graded the NFL draft. The text on
each team began with the word ``skinny.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this context, it's slang for ``inside information.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently outlined the years when the new quarters
celebrating the nation's 50 states will be issued. Where can we get
these coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50 state quarters will be produced at both the
Philadelphia and Denver Mints and distributed by the Federal
Reserve through the commercial banking system nationwide, just as
regular circulating quarters are today. Consumers can expect to
receive the state quarters as change when conducting normal
commercial transactions. Some already are appearing routinely in
change, and the Mint says more should be in general circulation by
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint also is selling special collector sets. Call
202-283-2646, the U.S. Mint Customer Care Center, to receive more
information about them. Information also is available on the
Internet at www.usmint.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the people accompanying the Rev. Jesse Jackson on
his Yugoslavia trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delegation members: Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.); John Wyma,
chief of staff for Blagojevich, Washington; the Rev. Dr. Joan Brown
Campbell, National Council of Churches, New York; Bishop Dimitrios
of Xanthos, Greek Orthodox Diocese in America, New York; Dr. Nazir
Uddin Khaja, American Muslim Council, Los Angeles; the Rev. Leonid
Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church in America, New York; Rabbi Steven
Bennet Jacobs, Los Angeles; Father Raymond Glen Helmick, Boston;
Mark Schlansky and Charles McLean, UPLIFT International,
Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Rev. Roy Thomas Lloyd, National Council of Churches,
New York; Bishop Marshall Meadors Jr., United Methodist Church,
Jackson, Miss.; Pastor James Trent Meeks, Salem Baptist Church,
Chicago; Virgalem Tadesse and Marie Nelson, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
Washington; Landrum Bolling, Conflict Management Group, Cambridge,
Mass.; the Rt. Rev. Kodic Mitrophan, Eastern American Diocese,
Sewickley, Pa.; the Rev. Irinej Dobrijevich, Serbian Orthodox
priest, Cleveland; Dr. Zoran Svetislav Hodjera, St. Luke's Serbian
Orthodox Church, Bethesda, Md.; and Obrad Kesic, ICN
Pharmaceutical, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear comments about how hard it is to get
tickets to the Masters golf tournament. I've even heard that some
people bequeath their tickets to heirs as part of their will. Does
it actually happen, or is that just another urban myth?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a ticket-holding spouse dies, the surviving spouse then
can use the ticket, said Glenn Greenspan of Augusta National Golf
Club. But that's it. ``There's no leaving it in wills, no
bequeathing it,'' he added. ``That's a legend like the one saying
we pack ice around azaleas to keep them at their peak. It doesn't
happen.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>

wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>
<P>
   Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.: Ames conducts
wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and
the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in
Fairmont, West Va. _ are Ames subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.: develops
everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to
next-generation launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.: the birthplace of
Sojourner, Cassini, Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space
vehicles, JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space. The
labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert, Spain and Australia
communicate with spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Space Center, Houston: mission control, where astronauts
train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking. JSC coordinates the
development of the International Space Station. The White Sands
Test Facility, in Las Cruces, N.M., is part of JSC.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Research Center, Cleveland: specializes in supersonic- and
subsonic-engine design.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla.: receives all
the different pieces of a spacecraft, readies them for takeoff, and
launches them.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.: manages satellites,
with branches at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and the
Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.: develops new aircraft
designs.
</P>

   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''

   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.: develops
everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to
next-generation launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.: the birthplace of
Sojourner, Cassini, Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space
vehicles, JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space. The
labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert, Spain and Australia

</P>
<P>
   Johnson Space Center, Houston: mission control, where astronauts
train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking. JSC coordinates the
development of the International Space Station. The White Sands
Test Facility, in Las Cruces, N.M., is part of JSC.
</P>

   CALIF-BUDGET (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Gov. Gray Davis is proposing
to spend $1 billion on public works projects _ including prisons,
streets and public transit _ in the largest cash investment to
repair California since the go-go years of the late Gov. Edmund G.
``Pat'' Brown. By ROBERT SALLADAY.

   POLICE-HARASS (San Antonio) _ Several police officers have

ordered to keep downtown streets tourist-friendly by harassing
human ``eyesores'' that included youths and the homeless. By MARO
ROBBINS.

   STOP-SIGN-FINE (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The ``California stop'' _
gliding through an intersection without actually stopping _ could
result in a $270 fine under one of several measures that have been
green-lighted by the Legislature. Last year it boosted fines for
running red lights to $270. Now it's going after stop-sign running.

   BOY-HERO (Colonie, N.Y.) _ Patrick Gavin-Brynes, 11, of Lake
George, N.Y., has over the years raised thousands of dollars for
charity through walk-a-thons, car washes, raffles, hot dog sales
and foot races. Now he's been honored by the American Red Cross as
a hometown hero. By JAY JOCHNOWITZ.

   FORBES-SITE (Undated) _ In search of politics that swim against
the tide? This may be the Web site for you: www.forbes2000.com.
This is the virtual land of conservative politics and the national
online headquarters of Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine
publisher who is seeking the Republican nomination for president
for the second time. By GEORGE RAINE.

<P>
   TV-JOAN (Undated) _ Here is a question posed by ``Joan of Arc,''
the engrossing four-hour miniseries starting Sunday on CBS: If a
person is the embodiment of a myth, can that myth in fact be a
reality? Or is that person just a fraud, since a myth is merely a
morally relevant fictitious tale that can't come true? By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MIDSUMMER (Undated) _ You have to hand it to
Shakespeare. Any playwright who'd name one of his characters Bottom
and then turn him into a long-eared ass has a profound appreciation
for vulgar word play. That down-and-dirty playfulness is one of a
few things going for ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' a whizzy, uneven take on the old fairy romp. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   ATOMIC-TRAIN (Undated) _ The NBC mini-series ``Atomic Train''
would be a quintessential 1959 B-movie, best viewed from the back
seat of a Chevy Bel Air convertible. Sure, it's cheesy, but it is
fun cheese. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-CONFESSIONS (Undated) _ In Ingmar Bergman's
``Private Confessions,'' his gift for laying bare the human heart
is given haunting, sometimes lacerating, form. This is a film about
people talking to each other, with the classic Bergman themes front
and center: the painful, perhaps futile search for love, God,
freedom, truth and meaning. By WALTER ADDIEGO.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-CASTLE (Undated) _ There is nothing in movies more
crowd-pleasing than the little guy, tired of being pushed around,
getting angry enough to fight the system. The bare-bones Australian
movie, ``The Castle,'' cashes in on that theme. By EDVINS BEITIKS.

   COFFEE-TABLES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Coffee tables, which have been in

after the mid-16th century. By FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release
Sunday.)

   RAC-LUKAS (Baltimore) _ D. Wayne Lukas has trained winners of 11
Triple Crown races in a Hall of Fame career, but he's still waiting
for that exceptional 3-year-old who can win all of them in the span
of six weeks. Lukas, who will be enshrined in the Racing Hall of
Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in August, has another opportunity

Woods. No. 1 in the world golfing order vs. No. 2.
Clubhead-to-clubhead. By STEVE CAMPBELL.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Ah, democracy. What was it
Churchill said? It's the very worst form of government _ except for
all the other forms of government. He had a point. The relentless
political fundraising on the part of legislators is distasteful to
watch _ especially when you realize that few people attend these
events out of political conviction. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I have no friends. I have
colleagues, neighbors, people I talk to on the phone and nodding
acquaintances at the grocery store.Like many modern Californians, I
have a diaphanous social network of people I see regularly and
often have stimulating conversations with, but whose names I keep
forgetting. By ROB MORSE.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: How-to for Hollywood
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever thought you wanted to be a movie star, here's a
how-to book just for you _ one that's funny, informative and
entertaining: ``Hollywood, Here I Come!'' by Cynthia Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Cynthia Hunter. No?
</P>
<P>
   Boy, I sure do.
</P>
<P>
   We became great friends several years ago when I was on
assignment in Los Angeles for a series of stories on the weird,
weird ways of Hollywood. Cynthia, whom I met through a mutual
friend, knew the ropes as well as the yarns. We had a fun time.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's written this great book, billed as ``an insider's
guide to a successful acting and modeling career in Los Angeles,''
outlining most every aspect of a career, from your image to your
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia arrived some 16 years ago, having sold her car for a
ticket to stardom. Since then, she has appeared in 160 episodes of
a soap opera, six movies, 12 TV shows, 63 commercials, five cartoon
series (she does the voices) and countless training films and
modeling jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And she tells great stories. ``Hollywood, Here I Come!'' is a
whole book full. I'm going to recount just one that she told me
when we first got to know each other ...
</P>
<P>
   Holly (let's call her) wanted movies to be her life. So far it
had been the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Naive young woman meets war hero, marries and lives dream life.
Yachts and limos. Lots of money and excitement. In the end, lots of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of trouble?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kind,'' Holly would say, smiling a sweet smile.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years, she decided to divorce him. Easier said than
done.
</P>
<P>
   He told her if she ever tried to leave, there'd be a new patio
in their back yard, the kind made of pea gravel. But one of those
pebbles would be the tip of her nose.
</P>
<P>
   She went into hiding for six weeks. He disappeared into South
America. She hasn't heard from him since. Knock on wood.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Holly had always wanted to be a movie star. When she
came out of hiding, she came to Hollywood. Along the way, a lot had
changed. Her name, her hair color, her nose, her voice. Her dream
was still the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want, to be an actress,'' she told her friends.
``Even if I'm never a success, I'll still have some part of it.
Something is better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first came to Hollywood, she knew hardly anyone. There
was one man she met, who was very respectable. He was a banker. He
invited her to his house one evening. They were supposed to make
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   He'd made a special cookie for her.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't wake up until the next morning. She tried to never
let herself think about what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ever happened to him. He denied everything, said she'd
gotten drunk. He was still a banker. She was no longer the dreamer
...
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia, even back then, was giving advice to anybody,
especially women, who wanted to come to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer the casting couch that we used to hear
about. That went out with the big studios. For the independents,
making a film is a business. But there's still plenty of sleaze
around the edges of the industry. Check everybody out. Never talk
to anyone who won't talk to your agent.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more where that came from _ some 350 pages of
good advice that fills Cynthia's book. The price is $19.95. The
publisher is Yellow Deer Press, P.O. Box 7309-103, Santa Monica,
Calif., 90406; e-mail: 4dreams(at)iname.com.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Don't leave for Hollywood without it.

 &HT;    Figuring out what will survive me
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A depressing yet exhilarating thought
occurred to me the other day while putting the finishing touches on
a curved-back English garden bench that has dominated my spare
hours for the past two months. Of everything I've done, written or
photographed over nearly 30 years of earning my living as an
ink-stained wretch , what will survive my passing the longest are
these modest pieces of furniture I build.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm dead and gone (or now, for that matter) people won't
sit around and reread the more than 1,000 columns and 2,500
editorials I've written thus far to pay the mortgage and buy braces
for the kids. Oh, maybe my children, or past and present wives will
drag out the scrapbooks every once in a while and show the
grandkids what their long-gone patriarch used to do for a living.
But not often, and not for long.
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame them? I deal in a disposable commodity,
where yesterday's paper becomes today's fishwrap or recyclable
material. I have no ambition to do any more than try to entertain
you for a few moments while you eat breakfast on Sunday morning, or
settle back after church to finish reading the paper. I'm happy
enough to do that, along with writing editorials that provoke
readers to think, to write nasty letters, or to maybe try to change
the way things are. It's a great way to make a living. But it's not
literature, at best a modest rough draft of history in our little
town and in my modest life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I turned to making furniture as a pastime. Let
me hasten to note that I am not particularly good at this hobby.
I've gotten better at it over the past months, but this won't be a
second career. Friends are polite, but I see the flaws and resolve
to do better.
</P>
<P>
   To date I've built:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A cabinet to hold cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A few jewelry boxes given away as presents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two Adirondack chairs and a matching table.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The aforementioned garden bench.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to put a price, including labor, on the bench, for
example, I would have to charge about $2,000 to break even. It's
made entirely of red oak that I bought rough cut, planed myself and
cut to size. It's not a bad looking bench, though I see its flaws _
the curve that's not quite perfect, the slight gaps on a few of the
slats, the mortise-and-tenon joints that are off by maybe a
sixteenth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   You could buy an absolutely perfect, machine-made bench for
about $250 max. I'm going to have to get a lot faster at this to
consider doing it for a post-retirement living.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, much as I love working with wood, making the same
thing twice bores the fire out of me. I about had to beat myself to
get through making the second Adirondack chair, though it only took
a third as long as the first one. The joy for me is in creating
something I've never built before. Doing the same thing over and
over is getting too close to drudgery for my
attention-deficit-disordered mind. Nope, best stick to my day job
and hope the 401K does well enough to tide me over in the golden
years.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder sometimes about where these pieces will end up someday,
after I'm stuck in the ground. Our house is filled with antique
pieces of furniture, some of which I picked up here and there over
the years, the rest inherited from my wife's large family. It's
fine stuff: a pie safe refinished by her dad; an old buffet I
bought at the flea market back in college; a one-of-a-kind 1940s
vertical filing cabinet I bought for $50 and have been offered 20
times as much for; a dresser delicately scrolled with intricate
designs; and the 19th century oak desk on which I'm writing now,
which once served as a dining room table for who knows how many
families.
</P>
<P>
   Woodworkers made these pieces. Maybe they did it for a living,
maybe not. Maybe it was a hobby, like it is for me. Like my pieces,
none are perfect, but they're solid, comfortable and will survive
long after a thin veneer-covered piece of particle board has turned
to dust. The Adirondack chairs will provide comfort to someone many
years after I'm gone, as will the garden bench.
</P>
<P>
   The owners might not know the progeny of their furniture as they
sit and sip a cool drink on a summer evening. But maybe they'll
think good thoughts about the woodworker and appreciate the time
and love that went into those pieces. That's reward enough for me.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ There's hardly a day goes by that I don't do or

Computing Systems Division of IBM, 1968, commenting on the
microchip.

home.'' _ Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital

Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?'' _ David
Sarnoff's associates in response to his urgings for investment in
the radio in the 1920s.

<P>
   _ ``The concept is interesting and well-formed, but in order to
earn better than a 'C,' the idea must be feasible.'' _ A Yale

 &HT;    U.S. seeks greater role for NATO
 &HT;    By Sharen Shaw Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Allegations of Yugoslav war crimes, ``ethnic
cleansing'' and genocide; controversy over the morality (and
efficacy) of NATO's air war; the Chinese embassy bombing: They
capture our headlines, but history may see them as no more than
sideshows to the main event _ or, at most, its trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dayton has such strong, numerous ties to that troubled
land and because almost every major Dayton industry already feels
pressure to compete internationally, we would be well-advised to
understand said main event. Here is one view: Yugoslavia may be our
first clear look at the new alliances replacing the Cold War's
east-west split.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances are young enough to remain fluid. But generally,
NATO powers are arrayed against a bloc that has both China at its
core and a gravitational pull that attracts U.S. antagonists such
as Iraq. Russia's role? The wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Prevailing in Yugoslavia is vitally important for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and its lead player, the United
States; the Clinton administration has flagged that NATO is its
choice to replace the United Nations as top world peace-keeper.
This is relatively new; four years ago, NATO teetered on the canyon
rim of collapse over U.S. reluctance to back the U.N.'s
French-British mission in Bosnia. But China may have made NATO more
attractive to Washington by using its U.N. Security Council veto to
thwart U.S. aims.
</P>
<P>
   So by December, U.S. officials were unveiling the armature they
hoped would support a new, more muscular NATO. When the North
Atlantic Council met in Brussels to set the agenda for this April's
50th-anniversary NATO summit, the Clinton administration announced
that it would propose a NATO clearinghouse for intelligence sharing
by Washington. The theory: More sophisticated intelligence would
produce allies more alert to the world's danger spots and more
willing to help police them. The United States made clear that it
was targeting both rogue states, such as Iraq, and terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also began lobbying at this meeting for greater
NATO collaboration to destroy weapons of mass destruction, such as
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's suspected biochemical arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.S. officials fleshed out this view in speeches and
events leading up to NATO's historic admission of former East Bloc
members Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary on March 12:
</P>
<P>
   _ On March 8, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told Radio Free Europe
the alliance would update its mission statement at its anniversary
summit to help ``cope with future threats. . . proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons; the emergence of 'rogue' states; and the access
of terrorist organizations to 'designer weapons.' ``
</P>
<P>
   _ On March 10 in London, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott told British military leaders NATO must be better able to
deal with the ``challenges that we are more likely to face. . .
ethnic strife, regional conflict, weapons of mass destruction and
missile proliferation.'' He reassured them that the White House had
no blueprint for a ``global NATO'' but added that the alliance
``has always had broader political functions,'' such as helping
keep Greece and Turkey at peace.
</P>
<P>
   _ On March 12, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Polish
Public TV, ``There are many new threats that are much harder to
describe. We don't have a single enemy. That is why it is so
important to keep NATO vibrant and relevant, to be able to deal
with the new threats, which are weapons of mass destruction, ethnic
conflicts, divisions over borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set _ but then Yugoslavia erupted. NATO's 50th
anniversary, in Washington on April 23-25, was overshadowed by the
immediate drama of its controversial new war. Still, the leaders
held a solemn ceremony in which each signed a ``vision statement''
that would expand NATO's role as Albright and Talbot outlined.
</P>
<P>
   The term _ ``vision statement'' _ was significantly informal: It
differs enough from NATO's current mission that were it considered

governing bodies for reratification. And in a series of muddled
votes about the Yugoslav air war, the Republican Congress has
indicated its unhappiness at the extent of U.S. involvement with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate: The Clinton administration's vision for an
expanded NATO makes sense. We need look no further than Baghdad or
Belgrade to realize that the Cold War nuclear threat has been
replaced by the almost greater terror of rogues with poison-packed
warheads. The United Nations has shown itself inherently incapable
of containing such threats. And halting as NATO intervention has
been against atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo, it at least
acknowledges that those nations with

 &HT;    Silverstein's time a lesson in rhyme
 &HT;    By Brian Colligan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Here is a poem dedicated to author and
songwriter Shel Silverstein, who died on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   How can one try
</P>
<P>
   to measure a life,
</P>
<P>
   That mixture of laughter, of fear and of strife?
</P>
<P>
   It may be awards or achievements bestowed,
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps walking down a number of roads.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by the number of those mourning the loss,
</P>
<P>
   Thinking for hours about society's cost.
</P>
<P>
   But it's probably those who simply just smile
</P>
<P>
   And think of the joy you brought for a while
</P>
<P>
   And in that spirit think long and then strive
</P>
<P>
   To do what they can to keep your spirit alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easy,'' you say from your new perch above
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to your children with nothing but love
</P>
<P>
   Help them to learn to reach and to grow
</P>
<P>
   Teach them there's nothing that they shouldn't know
</P>
<P>
   That's how I'll know that I've done something well
</P>
<P>
   For the benefits reaped will be unparalleled''
</P>
<P>
   The children, you know, were the point of it all
</P>
<P>
   They all learned from him, the big and the small.
</P>
<P>
   Shel Silverstein graced this world for a time,
</P>
<P>
   Filling blank pages with magical rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   We lost him on Monday _ a terrible day
</P>
<P>
   And though he was silenced, he left more to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Light in the Attic,'' and ``The Giving Tree,''
</P>
<P>
   His books were a journey, and something to see.
</P>
<P>
   For a good many years he polished his craft,
</P>
<P>
   He was good for a lesson and good for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But words are forever and in that spirit he lives,
</P>
<P>
   And the messages written will continue to give.
</P>
<P>
   And though the loss is like that of a friend's
</P>
<P>
   We will meet again where the grand sidewalk ends.
</P>

 &HT;    Searing Sobieski lends fire to `Joan of Arc'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Talk about girl power!
</P>
<P>
   Joan D'Arc, that army-slaying peasant girl, had more clout than
500 Spice Girls. That's what happens when you see angelic visions,
boast a direct hot line to God and help save a wartorn France.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Joan of Arc,'' CBS' lavish and beautifully filmed
miniseries, our 16-year-old heroine (Leelee Sobieski) is the
embodiment of steely courage and doe-eyed innocence. In fact,
Sobieski, who resembles a younger Helen Hunt, gives a star-making
turn as France's doomed savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan of Arc'' tells the age-old tale of a young girl chosen by
God to help pry France from England's iron grip. As Joan is told by
a caring nun (Olympia Dukakis), she has a gift. And that
touched-by-an-angel gift enables her to see religious visions and
hear the voices of St. Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan doesn't understand her gift. Teens, you know, have a
tough enough time getting through life without hearing voices.
Since the gods tend to desert Joan when she needs them most and
aren't always that specific about her destiny, you can't blame the
poor lass for being a tad confused.
</P>
<P>
   But when the mission becomes clear, a courage-filled Joan sets
out to lead a violent revolt against the cursed English.
Unfortunately for Joan, it was a thankless job. At age 19, she was
burned at the stake after being charged with heresy.
</P>
<P>
   At $21 million, CBS didn't skimp on what is the centerpiece of
the network's sweeps programs. With wonderfully drab costumes and
even drabber sets, the producers faithfully re-created 15th-century
France in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Duguay's (''The Assignment'') artful, sure-footed
direction gives ``Joan of Arc'' a sweeping, epic look. The
super-slow-motion battle scenes are especially stunning. While four
hours is a bit long for most miniseries _ unless it's ``Roots'' or
``Rich Man, Poor Man'' _ ``Joan of Arc'' stays interesting despite
a few slow spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan of Arc'' also features a wealth of inspired performances.
An all grown-up but still boyishly charming Neil Patrick Harris
(Doogie Howser M.D.) is at his slimy best as King Charles, the
ruler who ultimately betrays unsuspecting Joan. Peter O'Toole gets
to chew half the scenery as a hard-charging bishop. The always
menacing and gravelly voiced Robert Loggia, however, is woefully
miscast as a kind-hearted local priest.
</P>
<P>
   But this film belongs to Sobieski. And her searing performance
gives ``Joan of Arc'' its strength _ and heart.

 &HT;    MOVIE REVIEW: A devoted father defends his abode from bulldozers
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It is reassuring to know that certain
deeply held beliefs are universal. That folks on the other side of
the world also have contempt for government, distrust of lawyers,
anger at powerful corporations and affection for any simple soul
who can triumph against all odds to protect his home.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and an appreciation of a well-written comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Direct from Australia, the land that gave us such cultural
milestones as ``Babe'' and ``Crocodile Dundee,'' make way for ``The
Castle.'' No, not a medieval costume drama but an enormously
audience-friendly comedy about one man's battle to keep his
ramshackle abode from being bulldozed. Who wouldn't root for the
Kerrigans to bumble their way to victory?
</P>
<P>
   True, the house is in the Melbourne airport landing path,
beneath a forest of high-power towers and over a toxic landfill.
But to Darryl Kerrigan, a tow-truck operator who dotes on his wife
and four children, his home is a castle. A castle about to be
``compulsorily acquired'' for airport expansion, until Darryl
stands his ground and fights his way through the Aussie legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   From the fable-like tongue-in-cheek tone that first-time feature
director Rob Sitch concocts, the resolution is never really in
doubt. The fun is getting there, laughing at thick-headed but
incredibly well-meaning Darryl and warming to his daft but
endearing family exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Lovingly, he compliments wife Sal for her rudimentary cooking
creations (``What do you call that?'' ``Chicken . . . with
seasonings.''). Like big-time wheeler-dealers, he and son Steve
mull the second-hand bargains advertised in the Trading Post,
weighing the just price for, say, jousting sticks. And you'll never
convince Darryl that imprisoned son Wayne is truly guilty of
robbing that bank.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's overcooked-shrimp-on-the-barbie dry humor comes from
Sitch and his longtime comedy collective _ Santo Cilauro, Tom
Gleisner and Jane Kennedy. They're fixtures of Australian
television, now jumping into the feature-film pool. Even though
they have begun at the shallow end, when you compare their results
to the sledgehammer-obvious, gross-out comedies Hollywood has been
serving up, ``The Castle's'' wry style is a welcome breeze from
Down Under.

she recited, after placing the shiny blade of her dagger over a
small bowl of salt. ``May we always honor the blessed Earth, its
many forms and beings.'' This gathering of witches celebrating the
vernal equinox didn't take place some hidden glen but on Fort Hood,
the largest military base in the United States, and the witches
were active-duty Army. Three years ago, Fort Hood's top brass
recognized Wicca as a legitimate faith, and the post became the
first U.S. military installation to allow space for neo-pagan
rituals. Now other U.S. military bases worldwide are following
suit, and the chaplain at Fort Hood is considered the Army expert
on the unorthodox religion that is growing rapidly in the military.
The chaplain fields calls from colleagues around the world and even
the chief chaplain's office at the Pentagon. The biggest problem

 &HT;    Under the spell of Joan of Arc
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Leelee Sobieski, the 16-year-old actress
who plays Joan of Arc in the upcoming TV miniseries, told Parade
magazine that, to prepare for the part, she read Mark Twain's
``Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing statement. Nobody reads Mark Twain's ``Joan of
Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was panned when it was published in 1896 and has been
panned over and over again since. It is universally deplored, even
ridiculed, as the worst novel Twain ever wrote. His own close
friend, William Dean Howells, spoke of ``Joan of Arc'' with pity
and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had frankly refused to attempt it at all,'' Howells
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the book came out, one reviewer said only one person in the
world had read it clean through, and it was he, the reviewer. He
urged everyone else to give it a miss, because of its ``egregious
dullness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the novel, with all its flaws and outright silliness, is one
more feather in Joan's cap _ Twain has her wearing an absurd cap
with floppy feathers in some scenes _ one more proof that the Maid
of Orleans has the power to bewitch even the clearest intellect,
make believers of agnostics, make scoffers pray. Mark Twain had
ridiculed Mormons and Christian Scientists. He toured the Holy Land
with a brilliant, lucid wit in ``Innocents Abroad,'' his very first
novel.
</P>
<P>
   He fell headlong at the feet of Joan of Arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is easily and by far the most extraordinary person the
human race has ever produced,'' he wrote in a 1904 essay, years
after his book had been damned by critics. He couldn't get over
Joan.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot get over her either. She had her first vision at the
age of 16 in her hometown of Domremy. At 17, she was besieging
cities and commanding the armies of France. She was captured at the
siege of Paris, tried by a French court friendly to the English,
found guilty and burned at the stake as a witch, aged 19. A second
trial rehabilitated her posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   When she was canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920, a squadron
of World War I vintage biplanes flew high over her statue in Rouen,
the town where she was combusted. It was one of the first
``fly-overs'' in parade history.
</P>
<P>
   She is today the patron saint of France and of all French
soldiers who are Catholic. A chapel where she prayed has been
brought, stone by stone, to a university in Minnesota. The name of
the bishop who prosecuted her _ Cauchon _ is an insult in French
even today.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Internet Web sites have sprung up around her. Modern
feminists, gays and lesbians claim her as one of their own (one of
the charges brought against her at trial was that she wore pants).
You can even call up a ``magic eye'' image of Joan on your computer
at http://www.stjoan-center.com/p00591.jpg _ a stereogram. You can
stare at it until she appears to you, emerging from a sea of
autumn-colored pixels, red and gold.
</P>
<P>
   She lived from 1412 to 1431, but her cult, her spell, is very
much alive. Each generation has to come to terms with Joan, her
purity, her incredible career, her supernatural strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to her being declared a saint in 1920, liberals
and conservatives in France both supported canonization, but for
different reasons. Conservatives thought she would reinforce
Catholic morals and values. Liberals and socialists saw her as a
firebrand revolutionary against the entrenched power of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, to the French, who in World War I had lost 895,000
soldiers in action, along with another 420,000 who died of wounds
or disease, Joan of Arc was something talismanic, a symbol of
France, victorious even amid the flames.
</P>
<P>
   But one keeps coming back to Twain. What was it about Joan of
Arc that so fascinated the cynical, skeptical humorist who saw so
clearly through all the folly? Modern scholars have suggested Twain
modeled Joan after his beloved daughter, Susy Clemens, who died
suddenly of spinal meningitis, aged 24 in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's grief over the loss of his daughter may have spilled
over into Joan of Arc. The book is at times almost incoherent, shot
through with strange lights and shadows, flights of rhetoric and
bizarre asides.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 19 has absolutely nothing to do with Joan of Arc. It
contains a ghost story, in which the narrator and some companions
spend the night in a haunted house, tormented by screams and
gibberings. When a wall is broken down, a hidden chamber is
revealed. On its floor are two objects: ``a rusty sword and a
rotten fan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know all that I know. Take the pathetic relics and
weave about them the romance of the dungeon's long-vanished inmates
as best you can,'' Twain writes. It's as if he is sleepwalking.
It's as if he doesn't care if the reader can follow him. It's as if
Joan of Arc drove him half-mad.
</P>
<P>
   The frontispiece of Joan, in the 1899 Harper's edition of
Twain's collected works, is a bizarre iconic work by an otherwise
unknown artist, F.V. DuMond, which makes her look like a cross
between a saint and a steel robot, like something out of the
Terminator movies, or Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   She is clad in shining metal, her lethally spiked, metal-shod
feet rest on the head of the English King Henry V, the man who
dared beat the French at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. She wears
the crown of martyrdom. She grasps a sword, a staff with a
fleur-de-lis and a spear. Her armored legs seem welded, bolted,
riveted shut, in a stern denial of any conceivable sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler-headed historians have pointed out that the real Joan
enjoyed combat almost too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fever of battle had entered her blood,'' writes Will
Durant in ``The Reformation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acclaimed as inspired and holy by half of France, she almost
forgot now to be a saint, and became a warrior. She was strict with
her soldiers, scolded them lovingly, and deprived them of the
consolations that all soldiers hold as their due; and when she
found two prostitutes accompanying them, she drew her sword and
struck one so manfully that the blade broke and the woman died.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain doesn't explore this side of Joan. For him, the
French girl is perfection incarnate, a lily in a degenerate world.
Twain himself detested the oozing wealth of the 1890s in the United
States, an era he called scornfully ``The Gilded Age.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in a curious way, his view of Joan strikes a chord in our
own times, when large corporations merge and enlarge themselves,
laying off thousands of workers in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Is this such bad writing?
</P>
<P>
   ``She was truthful when lying was the common speech of men; she
was honest when honesty was become a lost virtue; she was a keeper
of promises when the keeping of a promise was expected of no one;
she gave her great mind to great thoughts and great purposes when
other great minds wasted themselves upon pretty fancies or upon
poor ambitions; she was modest, and fine, and delicate when to be
loud and coarse might be said to be universal; she was full of pity
when a merciless cruelty was the rule; she was steadfast when
stability was unknown, and honorable in an age which had forgotten
what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a time when men
believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was unfailingly
true in an age that was false to the core; she maintained her
personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities;
she was of a dauntless courage when hope and courage had perished
in the hearts of her nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and
body when society in the highest places was foul in both . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Now she is back, this troublesome paragon: Back to rebuke us
again, back to remind us there is more to life than life itself.

 &HT;    MOVIE REVIEW: `Dream' no scream, but laughs fly fast in fairy
fable
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Perhaps only ``Hamlet'' among
Shakespeare's plays has gotten stranger treatment than ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' The interpretations have often had a
Freudian bent.
</P>
<P>
   So would the new film version of the quirky comedy turn out more
weird than whimsical? A mean sexual nightmare, for example, rather
than a fanciful tale of romantic mischief and misalliances?
</P>
<P>
   No. While the movie has been relocated to 19th century Italy, it
hasn't been re-interpreted in light of the 19th century Austrian.
As directed by Michael Hoffman (''Restoration''), it is a visually
beautiful romp, largely faithful to The Bard, full of very broad
gags, moonshine and fairy dust.
</P>
<P>
   What it isn't is magic. And this story requires an hypnotic
charm to make us drop our hip cynicism and get into the spirit _
or, should we say, spirits _ of things.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say why the filmmakers decided to place the story
in 19th century Tuscany, unless it was to grab the chance to let
folks wander an enchanted forest on bicycles, and fill the
soundtrack with operatic arias.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's jarring at first to hear Elizabethan English
spoken in this setting, we get used to it. But it may also take
some time to follow the plot for those not used to the play:
</P>
<P>
   Hermia (Anna Friel) loves Lysander (Dominic West). But her
father has ordered her to marry Demetrius (Christian Bale), and the
Duke (David Straithairn) reluctantly backs up papa.
</P>
<P>
   So the frustrated lovers elope. However, Helena (Calista
Flockhart) is also in love with Lysander, and warns Demetrius of
the plans. He takes off after the pair, with an exasperated Helena
pedaling along behind.
</P>
<P>
   They wind up in a moonstruck forest that could pass for Hugh
Hefner's backyard. It seems that even the fairies are having a
tough time in the love department. Oberon (Rupert Everett) is mad
at Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), and uses his impish servant Puck
(Stanley Tucci) to play mischief on everybody, fairies and humans.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, also wandering the forest is a group of workmen
from town, who want to rehearse an amateur play. Led by Bottom,
(Kevin Kline) these bumblers also get caught up in the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Will everything work out? Will the right lovers pair off, and
will the actors pull off their silly play? Will the ``dream''
affect reality? It's another play, but will it be a case of ``all's
well that ends well?''
</P>
<P>
   The cast is fine, including the flighty Flockhart (Ally McBeal
). The play is less famous for its soliloquies than its one liners,
such as ``What fools these mortals be.'' But except for a rather
screechy Friel, the actors present less familiar dialogue with
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   But it must be admitted that the film works best when the comedy
is presented in a thoroughly contemporary manner, and the audience
can take its cues as to when to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci is irrepressible as the ironic Puck. But Kline steals the
movie as a hammy Bottom, the town joke with a romantic soul. It's a
sight when he's turned into a donkey, and the gorgeous Pfeiffer
murmurs words of love to this braying jackass.
</P>
<P>
   When the workmen finally get to put on their play, the shtick is
straight out of early television _ so lousy and full of mishaps
it's almost charming.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the film itself _ almost, but not quite, charming
enough to make us believe in fairies.

 &HT;    MOVIE REVIEW: Odd, expatriate ladies ignore Mussolini's big, fat
boot
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Tea With Mussolini'' is a quaint title
for a quaint movie about quaint people. Oh, let's be honest.
Eccentric people. They're Brits.
</P>
<P>
   This charming, sentimental flick is about a gaggle of old gals
keeping their lips stiff in Fascist Italy. It's soap opera,
drenched in atmosphere. But how many sudsers can boast a cast of
Joan Plowright, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Lily Tomlin and Cher?
</P>
<P>
   Or Franco Zeffirelli as director? His romanticism, put to good
use in bravura adaptations of operas, becomes a tad mushy in this
case. And the film eventually loses some steam, turning predictable
and occasionally clunky.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeffirelli has an eye for beauty. He should, since the
Florentine is filming his native Tuscany. Indeed, the movie is
adapted from the director's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   The English flocked to Italy. It was cheap, sunny and full of
art. This made up for the fact that Italy was also full of
Italians. British culturati nestled in cities such as Florence,
soaking up the atmosphere while remaining very John Bullish.
</P>
<P>
   English such as the ``Scorpioni'' _ the scorpions. That's what
the Italians call a hardy band of older ladies noted for their
sharp tongues. The film opens in Florence in 1935. There's a
foreshadowing of political trouble, but Mussolini seems to be
simply a pomposity with a knack for train schedules.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, we observe the Scorpioni through the eyes of a boy
named Luca (Zeffirelli's alter ego.) Born out of wedlock, his
mother is dead, and his Italian father wants as little to do with
him as possible. The ladies take him under their wings, especially
gentle Mary Wallace (Plowright). She introduces the lad to
Shakespeare and the possibilities of a life of art.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Luca leaves for school, returning as war breaks out
and the Scorpioni are interned as enemy nationals, much to the
chagrin of bossy, bigoted Lady Hester (Smith). The widow of a
former ambassador, she has it in her head that she possesses a
special relationship with Mussolini, with whom she once had tea.
(Thus, the film's title.)
</P>
<P>
   Danger, or at least degrading circumstances, face the Scorpioni,
including two Americans _ a butch archaeologist (Tomlin) and a
rich, Jewish, ex-Ziegfield girl (Cher). Luca (attractive newcomer
Baird Wallace) is now on the verge of manhood, and he's called on
to make a mature decision in a life-or-death matter involving
Cher's character.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully filmed, the movie captures the languor of lazy,
art-filled days in prewar Florence. The multi-talented Zeffirelli
could also have been a designer. Witness the icy marble hallways of
Il Duce's chilly headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Plowright, whose face has become more and more lumpy and lovable
with age, is especially poignant as Luca's wise surrogate mother.
Smith is nicely pursed-lipped as the haughty, self-appointed leader
of the Scorpioni. Dench has a lesser role as an eccentric, would-be
artist, but we know what she can do with lesser roles.
</P>
<P>
   Cher mixes warmth and theatricality as a flashy rich woman with
a heart of gold. Tomlin is all dry sarcasm as the bemused observer
of The Scorpioni and their foibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' may have a few too many lumps of sugar.
But the quiet film often cuts through the sentimentality to touch
the heart.

she recited, after placing the shiny blade of her dagger over a
small bowl of salt. ``May we always honor the blessed Earth, its
many forms and beings.'' This gathering of witches celebrating the
vernal equinox didn't take place some hidden glen but on Fort Hood,
the largest military base in the United States, and the witches
were active-duty Army. Three years ago, Fort Hood's top brass
recognized Wicca as a legitimate faith, and the post became the
first U.S. military installation to allow space for neo-pagan
rituals. Now other U.S. military bases worldwide are following
suit, and the chaplain at Fort Hood is considered the Army expert
on the unorthodox religion that is growing rapidly in the military.
The chaplain fields calls from colleagues around the world and even
the chief chaplain's office at the Pentagon. The biggest problem
with Wicca, he says, is other people's ignorance. (Perkes, Austin

FRIENDSHIP AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I have no friends. I have colleagues, neighbors,
people I talk to on the phone and nodding acquaintances at the
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the perfect arrangement for a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   This dawned on me the other day when I saw a new doctor and had
to fill out the form on whom to notify in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, my best and only friend, wouldn't want to hear the
news. My editor might.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't anybody to call in case I lapsed into a coma
reading old Smithsonian magazines in the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Like many modern Californians, I have a diaphanous social
network of people I see regularly and often have stimulating
conversations with, but whose names I keep forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can say for these low-maintenance relationships:
You never have to invite these people to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The downside (or upside) of that is less housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just this week I had a nice conversation at Tully's coffeehouse
on Fillmore Street with a guy who was hanging out with his young
son before going to work in his home office.
</P>
<P>
   This home-office worker and I compared notes on growing up back
East in ethnic neighborhoods where kids knew the old-fashioned joys
of family, food, friends and beating the bejabbers out of kids from
other ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   See, maybe that close-knit neighborhood stuff isn't so great.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscing about it is better, and you can make up better lies
if you're reminiscing with a low-maintenance coffeehouse buddy.
</P>
<P>
   I have scads of coffeehouse buddies whose names I always forget.
With one coffeehouse buddy who's a musician, I talk about music, a
subject I know barely enough about to last one non-grande coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Another coffeehouse buddy is a distinguished psychologist, and
over a latte she'll give me a psychological profile of Bill Clinton
she'd never give me over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A coffeehouse is also one of the few places a graying fogey like
me can make eye contact with a young woman with a nose ring, even
if she doesn't smile when the fogey tips her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, who else is in my low-impact social network?
</P>
<P>
   There's the homeless guy on the corner who always rocks back and
forth and says thank you, even though my commitment to him is about
one quarter a month.
</P>
<P>
   I've got about a dozen maitre d's and restaurant owners I really
like, but don't see often enough because of the mortgage lenders
I've never met.
</P>
<P>
   My garbage man and mailman are terrific, and I try to tip them
every Christmas, or at least wave when they're blocking my car.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to like the contractor who has been putting an
addition on the house across the street for longer than it takes to
build the average high-rise. He's very considerate, and did some
great repairs on my driveway his cement trucks turned into talcum
powder.
</P>
<P>
   I've liked a lot of local bus drivers, but for some reason I
never get to see them again. Of course, when you have 3,000 drivers
and only five working buses, the odds of seeing the same driver
twice are small.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting conversation. That's the perfect level of social
commitment for the Bay Area of Y2K Minus One.
</P>
<P>
   Think of these interactions as chat rooms where you don't have
to type and you get to see faces, without seeing smiley faces.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I know the idea of low-maintenance community may seem
cynical and twisted, but it's not a bad option in an age where
people wear Sony Walkmans so you can't talk to them, and then shout
into their cell phones so you can't hear yourself think.
</P>
<P>
   What, after all, are the Bay Area neighbors of 1999? For most
people, a neighbor is someone whose trees grow to block your view.
The word ``neighborhood'' most often modifies ``dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``community'' is long gone. Nowadays it doesn't mean a
group of people living together. It means a group of people who
don't know each other and are ticked off at everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, traditional family and neighborhood ties
have come undone. Something has to take their place. What's more
American than on- and-off Velcro attachments?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of shoes, the sport of soccer blossomed in America so
parents could get out of the gated community and gather around the
field on picnic blankets _ as far as I can tell as a non-soccer
non-dad.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe parents are doing all that chauffeuring just for
the kids? I've watched a few of those games, and the gossiping
parents seem to have a lot more fun than the puffing kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's one good reason to have a kid. You get a lot of low-
maintenance relationships, for the price of the highest-maintenance
relationship of all.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. In case of emergency, call Tully's coffeehouse on
Fillmore. Tell whoever answers the phone that the guy who always
has a large decaf, but still talks too much, won't be in.

   SAM _ Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback has found himself well-placed

   ENERGY: Private contractors of the Department of Energy -
including AlliedSignal and Midwest Research Institute of Kansas
City - are doing little to curb excessive travel costs, a recent
government audit shows. The 32 contractors failed to meet the
department's 1995 goal to cut $35 million a year in travel.
Altogether, we footed $250 million for their travel last year. Some
firms show little interest in containing costs - paying $1,000 + on
airline tickets they could get for less than half that amount and
spending $300 a night on hotel rooms. Oddly, the Department of
Energy is tightening its own travel belt, but contractors are not.
The General Accounting Office says contractors should have a
conscious and that the department should set travel cost targets.

   PARK _ On a bluff with a good view of the Mississippi River, a
statue of Jefferson Davis stands tall in the middle of Confederate
Park in Memphis, Tenn. Appropriately, his back is turned to the
river and instead he peers east into downtown. It was here that
Memphians gathered June 6, 1862, to watch the Battle of Memphis in
the river below. The Yankee ironclad gunboats quickly whipped the
southerners. But this week, the Confederacy _ or its great-great
grandsons _ won one. The Memphis Park Commission retreated from a
plan to oust the rebel president and rename the 90-year-old park.

   WOMEN: Peggy Nothnagel of Kansas City finally decided to go back
to college when she realized she'd never make a decent living
without one. Women need some college to earn what a male high
school graduate can make in the workplace and that's one of the
realities fueling a national trend. Women are greatly outnumbering
men on college campuses and are earning most of the college
degrees. Men's share of bachelor's degrees declined from 81 percent
in 1900 to just 45 percent today. In Missouri and Kansas, those
percentages are slightly lower. Some people celebrate women's
success at earning college degrees as payback for years of
exclusion from higher education. But others bemoan the trend,
saying men are losing out in a changing world that often requires a
college diploma for good careers. Lynn Franey. 45. Photos and

and what's being planned to stop it. He is charged with two counts
of first-degree murder for killing a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old

outraged a city trying to come to grips with rising juvenile
homicides. In response to last year's murders, the Partnership for
Children and 25 other agencies will soon release a series of

CALIF. GOVERNOR PUSHES $1 BILLION PLAN FOR REPAIRS IN THE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis is proposing to spend $1
billion on public works projects, such as prisons, streets and
public transit, in the largest cash investment to repair California
since the go-go years of the late Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be used to build a maximum security,
4,500-inmate prison in Kern County and start planning for a second
prison in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   California houses 158,000 inmates in three dozen state prisons,
but it will need space for 50,000 more by 2003, prison officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also wants to give cities and counties an unprecedented
amount of cash to improve streets, public transit, flood control,
port operations, sewage and trash facilities, and parks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would do that by dumping $425 million into
California's newly created infrastructure bank, allowing cities and
counties to leverage the money with low-cost financing that could
total $2 billion in civic improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments range from $6 million to buy ferries for the
San Francisco Bay area to paying for about half of all the urgent
park improvements in the state. The parks list includes repairing
lifeguard towers, restrooms, trails and, among other things,
sprucing up historic buildings on Angel Island.
</P>
<P>
   The money for bay ferries comes as a task force is urging
lawmakers to raise bay area bridge tolls to $3 to pay for a $2
billion, 40-terminal system of high-speed ferries. The plan is to
attract 40 million to 50 million new water-transported passengers a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hasn't taken a position on that proposal but has proposed
spending $6 million on any publicly run ferry service in the bay
area.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion investment announced Friday comes from an
expected $4 billion budget surplus. California's purring economy is
requiring more and more people to pay higher taxes on their
steadily increasing pay and bonuses, giving Davis and the state
legislature unanticipated spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the start of final negotiations on the state's
total budget of $77.5 billion, which the legislature must approve
and Davis must sign before July 1, the start of the fiscal year.
Davis is pressuring lawmakers to approve the document by the
deadline, even though the budget has been late 9 of the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers are arguing for a tax cut, saying the state
can afford to return some of the windfall to California taxpayers.
They want to accelerate the next round of cuts in the state's car
registration fee, which could punch a $500 million hole in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said his top three priorities for the extra money are
schools, increasing the state's reserve fund and giving state
workers a pay raise. The infusion of cash for prisons, ferries,
parks and other construction projects was leaked Thursday by
administration sources and was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The new spending recalls the era of Pat Brown, who as Democratic
governor from 1959 to 1967 launched the country's most ambitious
public works program, including 1,000 miles of freeways, 11
university campuses and the huge California water project.
</P>
<P>
   Brown triggered the massive government spending to meet the
needs of a state growing almost a third to 19 million people during
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hauck, president of the California Business Roundtable,
said, ``Business leaders will be very encouraged by the governor's
level of funding to the infrastructure bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate groups have been continually calling for more money to
improve roads, sewers and other civic projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, were caught off guard by Davis' plan to
build a new $335 million Kern County prison. Davis also wants $20
million to plan a San Diego prison and $2.3 million to hire more
prison staff.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President pro tem John Burton, a Democrat from San
Francisco, said of Davis' prison-building plan, ``Not having heard
about this except through the press, I don't think much about it.
We ought to figure out some punishment options that are cheaper
than sending nonviolent offenders back for 18 months because they
don't pass a urine test.''

SHAKING THE POLITICAL MONEY TREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There were three of them. They were pleasantly
smiling women sitting at a table outside a meeting room in the Omni
Hotel the other night. One by one, elegantly dressed men walked up
to the table where the women sat. Names were checked off a list.
</P>
<P>
   Then, their wallets lighter to the tune of $150 apiece, the men
went inside the meeting room to join a few dozen other elegantly
dressed men. Most of these guys were lobbyists. They were there to
grab a quick drink, down some finger food and watch a New York
assemblyman shake the money tree.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't stay long, though. They had other stops to make.
Further down State Street Hill, at LaSerre restaurant on Green
Street, another assemblyman was also shaking the money tree. A
state senator had a similar gathering going west of the Capitol, at
the Fort Orange Club. And, out at the Desmond in suburban Colonie,
the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee was throwing its annual
``Spring Fling.''
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to fling along with the Assembly Democrats, you'd
better have $125 in your pocket. Of course, that was less painful
than the 500 bucks a head the Republican Assembly Campaign
Committee had charged the night before at the University Club, at
their ``Prelude to Summer'' soiree.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, democracy. What was it Churchill said? It's the very worst
form of government _ except for all the other forms of government.
He had a point. This relentless political fundraising on the part
of legislators is distasteful to watch _ especially when you
realize that few people attend these events out of political
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Except for legislative employees, who kick in as an unspoken
prophylactic against unemployment, you see the same people running
from fundraising event to fundraising event all through the state
legislative session. Lobbyists tend to be equally respectful of
both parties, since each controls its own house of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   And the money goes to a good cause _ namely, to crushing
opposition in the legislator's home district. It goes to pay
campaign staff, take polls, produce campaign literature, to buy
advertising and _ in no small measure _ simply to intimidate
potential opponents who lack their own money tree.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent legislators virtually never lose, unless they run into
a little bad luck in primary elections. Why not? The money, that's
why not. Unless a legislator is confronted by a well-financed
candidate who enjoys name recognition, he or she is generally
golden back in the home district. That's the time-honored Albany
way.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the state six weeks late in deciding how to
spend its money and no resolution in sight to this intractable
budget battle, the money tree is vibrating like a tuning fork. In
all of last year, New York's lawmakers threw a 201 fundraising
events. That was nearly two dozen more than the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they're already up to more than 150 or so
fundraisers, and it's still early. They're throwing roughly twice
the number of money tree-shaking sessions they threw just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's most disturbing about this is that most of these
shakedown sessions are held at Albany restaurants and hotels, only
blocks from the ornate building where the laws are actually made.
All three lawmakers who were picking pockets the other night
represent districts far away from Albany. They were, essentially,
peddling their influence instead of raising money from loyal
constituents back home.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to a problem like this? Simple. Forget about public
financing. It'll never pass anyway. Just limit political
contributions in state legislative campaigns to gifts from
constituents who actually live in the lawmaker's district. And, by
the way, do the same thing with Congress. That would slow the flow
of special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, forget that nutty idea. It might be illegal.
Besides, they would never pass that either.
</P>

TIGER WOODS VS. DAVID DUVAL ISN'T A HISTORIC RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no need to get out a calendar and circle the date. The
sheer magnitude of the event undoubtedly will make the date stick
in the mind as indelibly as the Fourth of July, Christmas and New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, April Fool's.
</P>
<P>
   Clear the schedule. Make sure the television _ now might be the
time to take the big-screen plunge, if you haven't already _ is in
working order.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, we're getting plenty of notice. Come Aug.
2, from 8-11 p.m. EDT, the sporting world as we know it will take
one giant step forward for humanity and/or the almighty dollar.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval is going to take on Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 in the world golfing order vs. No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Clubhead-to-clubhead.
</P>
<P>
   Live. On network television. For stakes so high, it makes a
check for winning the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open or
the PGA Championship look like chump change.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval haven't been able to create that sort of
spectacle on merit, so the International Management Group and ABC
decided to intervene. IMG, which represents Woods and Duval,
brokered a winner-takes-most-of the $1.5-million-on-the-table
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance where David and I can compete head-to-head, beat
each other's brains out, walk away and say it was great for the
game of golf,'' Woods said, as if he were promoting a
``Wrestlemania'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   What would really be great for golf would be for Woods and Duval
to both bring their A games to a tournament that matters. Since a
12-shot victory in the 1997 Masters, Woods has been a fringe major
player. Though Duval has won 11 times since the fall of '97, his
next major championship will be his first. Until Woods and Duval
actually get into contention at the same major, this will have to
do for intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't a rivalry make,'' Duval said. ``But it might be a
good start.''
</P>
<P>
   No, a good start would be for Woods and Duval to lay the
groundwork for a storied rivalry the old-fashioned way. By bringing
out the best in each other at the biggest moments. Let's put Woods
and Duval in historical perspective: They have combined to win half
as many majors as Andy North.
</P>
<P>
   A rivalry is Jack Nicklaus vs. Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino, Tom
Watson and all other challenges. Wilt Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell.
The New York Yankees vs. the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods belong in that group like Tony Bennett in Kiss
makeup. That could change over time _ the way Michael Jordan made
the transformation from showman to champion. At the moment, the
Woods-Duval match belongs somewhere between Billie Jean King vs.
Bobby Riggs (harmless fun) and Foolish Pleasure vs. Ruffian
(harmful fun) in the food chain of made-for-TV sporting spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   King struck a minor blow against male chauvinism by beating a
65-year-old man. Ruffian broke an ankle in a $350,000 challenge
race and had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Life usually has a way of going on, though, no matter how cheesy
the sporting spectacle. One generation's Roller Derby is another
generation's American Gladiators.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath wore _ ugh _ pantyhose on TV. Ahmad Rashad _ groan _
proposed to Phylicia Ayers-Allen on a 1985 National Football League
Thanksgiving Day telecast. Now Tiger Woods and David Duval are
coming to prime time on the network that created The Women
Superstars, Challenge of the Sexes, Celebrity Challenge of the
Sexes, The Battle of the Network Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The $400,000 of the prize money from the Woods-Duval match that
will go to charity is some consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see it become a series,'' Woods said, ``where
we could have more special events like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative calculations indicated that the audience for such a
thing will grow at least 525,600 every year. One sucker, born each
and every minute of every day.

SAN ANTONIO POLICE SAY THEY WERE TOLD TO HARASS HUMAN `EYESORES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Several police officers have testified in federal
court this week that they were ordered to keep downtown streets
tourist-friendly by harassing human ``eyesores'' that included
youths and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Past and present members of the police department's downtown
foot and bicycle patrol said they were told to demand
identification from patrons in certain bars, to snatch suspected
gang clothing from teen-agers and to push homeless people out of
the area with or without probable cause _ actions that suggested
laws had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   But San Antonio Police Chief Al Philippus, testifying Thursday,
said none of the alleged activities, if they in fact occurred,
violated residents' rights to walk the streets downtown.
</P>
<P>
   He charged that the complaining officers never documented
specific abuses and never complained through official channels. He
also noted that probable cause is not needed for officers to
request identification.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, nine officers have testified in a trial brought
against the city by Officer Onofre Serna, who in 1996 was
transferred from the highly visible bicycle patrol to squad-car
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Serna claims the transfer was punishment for complaining about
the unit's harsh methods, which allegedly started in 1994 and
lasted about two years. He also claims the transfer violated his
civil rights and laws protecting whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city said Serna suffered no retaliation. They
suggest the allegations stem from personality conflicts and ``petty
employment issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial has offered a rare view inside the squad room where
officers navigated the politics of policing one of the city's most
valued assets, the River Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Bandannas, baseball caps and other pieces of suspected gang
regalia decorated the walls of the patrol's office, several
officers said. A box in a back room held more confiscated items,
some, according to testimony, snatched without probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically theft,'' Detective Miguel Mares Jr., a former
member of the patrol, said on the witness stand, describing why he
and other officers balked at instructions to take suspected gang
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaining officers acknowledged that downtown
streets had gang problems. But they said their orders also targeted
teen-agers who broke no laws but wore gangster-style clothing
simply to blend in with peers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, many youths lingered downtown to avoid
trouble in their own rough neighborhoods. ``Even if they were just
standing around, we were instructed to do something about this
problem,'' Mares said.
</P>
<P>
   Mares also said the patrol had specific instructions to demand
identification from customers in certain bars. Other officers said
they were advised to let bouncers and hired security aides handle
upscale establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming any businesses, Philippus argued that the
department simply focused on unruly areas and certain crimes, like
driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We target problems, specific violations of law, not particular
(groups of) people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers claimed the heavy-handed orders came from the patrol
supervisor, then-Lt. Harry Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, now a substation captain, also was transferred from the
patrol about the same time as Serna. He has been named as a
potential witness, but he couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Thomas Froelick said Griffin considered the teen-agers
as ``eyesores,'' and wanted them off the downtown streets. ``The
homeless in San Antonio _ he didn't like them, either,'' Froelick
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Mares said Griffin once ordered him to remove a mentally
disabled homeless woman from the bench where she had sat quietly
for years without causing many complaints. He was told to drop her
off under a bridge by a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, Philippus said he wanted to hear Griffin's
testimony before he assessed the incident, but he balked at
labeling the woman's removal an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, Philippus assembled a panel of police supervisors
to examine the grumbling coming from the downtown patrol squad.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens of interviews, the panel reported that a clique of
officers was defying supervisors and intimidating peers. It
described Serna as ``very disruptive,'' while acknowledging that
Griffin had ``serious managerial and supervisory shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also stated the officers believed the tactics Griffin
demanded ``were heavy-handed, illegal or racially and politically
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippus said those allegations were too vague to warrant an
inquiry into whether the patrol was harassing downtown visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Philippus said he followed the panel's recommendations.
He transferred Griffin, Serna and two sergeants. Transfers of three
other patrol officers already temporarily assigned to other
divisions became permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both Philippus and Froelick testified, the unit's
troubles have dissipated.

&HT;        TILTING AT OBELISKS: A WASHINGTON COVER-UP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By C.J. Karamargin  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In a city well-known for cover-ups, this story is
different.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of a keep-it-covered-up.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it covered is what Chad Allen wants to do with the
Washington Monument, the 555-foot marble and granite obelisk that
rises from the National Mall in honor of the nation's first
president.
</P>
<P>
   The monument has been sheathed in scaffolding since December as
part of a $6.5 million restoration project. Designed by the
internationally renowned architect Michael Graves, the scaffolding
was intended to be practical and attractive - but temporary.
</P>
<P>
   That last part is key. The scaffolding is scheduled to be
dismantled and removed when the restoration is completed in the
summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, the managing editor of an on-line travel service,
likes Graves' work. He likes the scaffolding better than the
monument itself. And in what can only be a called an example of
someone tilting at obelisks, Allen thinks it should become
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more modern look,'' said Allen, a native of Kalamazoo
who has lived in Washington for nine months. ``There are times when
it makes sense to update our symbols, to make a gesture that we're
moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allen, that time has arrived. To promote his admitedly
quixotic cause, Allen is using that most modern of weapons, the
Internet. He has created a Web site - www.keepitcovered.org - where
he urges potential signers of an ``e-petition'' to ``join the
cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Allen's top ten reasons to keep the scaffolding in place
is that ``the covered monument is an apt metaphor for the need for
greater discretion in personal conduct among politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, the holder of a master's degree in philosophy from
Western Michigan University, is more concerned about aesthetics
than politics. In his view, the scaffolding simply makes the
111-year-old monument a more interesting piece of architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just it looks better, especially at night with the
lights,'' he said. ``I guess I just don't have this overwhelming
nostalgia for a big piece of stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Allen is that many people do. Washington is a
city that takes its monuments seriously. Suggestions to fiddle with
them do not go over well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we endorse,'' said Jen Larson, a
spokesperson for the National Park Service Foundation, the
non-profit organiztion spearheading the restoration fundraising
dirve. ``The scaffolding is going to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Graves intended. Tom Rowe, an architect
with Graves' Princeton, N.J. firm, said the scaffolding was not
designed to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering on the one hand,'' said Rowe. ``On the
other, what we designed technically can't last.''
</P>
<P>
   Now at work designing a $70 million addition to the Detroit
Institute of Arts, Graves designed the scaffolding to mimic the
grid pattern of the monument's mortar joints. Transparent netting
attached to the scaffolding allows visitors to watch work crews
scaling the monument's facade, inspecting, cleaning and repairing
the giant stone blocks.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the scaffolding-enveloped monument evokes the Eiffel
Tower, the 984-foot wrought-iron icon of Paris that surpassed the
Washington Monument as the world's tallest structure in 1889.
Normally illuminated by a battery of floodlights shining up from
its base, the monument now is illuminated by 500 light fixtures
attached to the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   The image, Allen is convinced, is worth preserving. And, he
said, he's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just picking up the vibe from the street, I sense that other
people think it looks better (with the scaffolding) too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A handfull of supporters have signed his petition, but Allen
admits that the battle to preserve the scaffolding might require a
general of Washington's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a grassroots thing,'' he said. ``It's just a
matter of building momentum.''

LUKAS, TRAINER OF WINNERS, EYES THE PREAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT GRAVES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ D. Wayne Lukas has trained winners of 11 Triple
Crown races in a Hall of Fame career, but he's still waiting for
that exceptional 3-year-old who can win all of them in the span of
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who will be enshrined in the Racing Hall of Fame in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in August, has another opportunity with
Charismatic in Saturday's 124th running of the Preakness at Pimlico
Race Course, the second jewel in the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has trained four Kentucky Derby winners, four Preakness
winners and three Belmont winners, but not once has he gone to the
final leg of thoroughbred heaven with a chance to win the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the three races in a row; I just can't get them with the
same horse,'' said Lukas, referring to his sweep of the 1995 Triple
Crown events with Thunder Gulch (Derby, Belmont) and Timber Country
(Preakness). ``One of these years, that's gonna fall in place.
Maybe this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic would be the least likely Triple Crown winner in
history, having come out of the claiming ranks to stun the Kentucky
Derby field at odds of 31-1, but Lukas said it's not beyond the
realm of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this horse in the second leg because he's
really peaked at the right time,'' Lukas said. ``I'm sure there'll
be people who will digest this and say there's too many outs (15
starts) and he's got to bounce, but don't count on that. He's doing
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic also has Preakness success in his bloodlines. His
sire, Summer Squall, won the race in 1990. Charismatic's
grandfather, Northern Dancer, won the 1964 Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pimlico oddsmaker Clem Florio isn't convinced Charismatic
has the goods, making the Derby winner the third choice in the
expected field of 12 at revised odds of 5-1. He was originally
listed as fourth choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said that while it's true Charismatic enjoyed a smooth
ride in the Derby _ several other horses were jostled in the
crowded field _ he had to overcome the difficult 16th post position
and was never able to run close to the rail, making his neck
victory over Menifee all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came from an outside hole, we were wide into the first
turn, wide down the backstretch and wide on the far turn,'' Lukas
said. ``The only thing we didn't do was (check), and that was by
design. I told my riders, do anything, but don't start-and-stop
because I don't know if we're good enough to overcome that.''Lukas'
horses finished 1-3 in the Derby, with Cat Thief taking the show
position behind the late-charging Menifee, the likely post-time
favorite in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of my riders rode hellacious races in light of what you
saw,'' Lukas said, praising winner Chris Antley and Cat Thief's
Mike Smith. ``It's a great tribute to both Chris and Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Derby marked the first time Charismatic had put together
back-to-back wins. He won the Lexington only 13 days before the
Derby upset. Cat Thief has been consistent in big races, but hasn't
won any of them this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect Cat Thief to keep everything honest again,'' Lukas
said of Charismatic's front-running stablemate. ``It wouldn't
surprise me to see him win this race. He's got the right running
style for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Cat Thief would put Lukas in the same position he
was in four years ago _ having saddled different winners of the
first two legs of the Triple Crown. That year was part of an
unprecedented string in which Lukas horses won six consecutive
Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   Now 63, Lukas seems confident he still has time to accomplish
what hasn't been done since 1978 by colleague Laz Barrera with
Affirmed _ win a Triple Crown.``We'll just keep coming back,'' he
said, ``until it falls in place for us.''

THE `CALIFORNIA STOP' MAY FINALLY BE STOPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The ``California stop'' _ gliding through an
intersection without actually stopping _ could result in a $270
fine under a measure that has been green-lighted by the state
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly approved a stop-sign measure offered by Assemblyman
Kevin Shelley, a San Francisco Democrat, which follows a Shelley
measure signed into law last year that increased fines for running
red lights to $270. San Francisco officials pushed for the bill
after a rash of accidents in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-stop-sign-running measure passed the
Democratic-controlled Assembly 45-22 on Thursday and heads to the
Senate. The bill gives local governments the option of raising the
fine from the current $103 to $270.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol reports that 170 fatal collisions
and more than 17,000 injuries were caused by drivers ignoring red
lights and stop signs. Last year, the CHP issued 40,000 citations
for running stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no room for this kind of behavior on the
road,'' Shelley said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Assembly also approved a measure that has been pushed by
outgoing San Francisco schools chief Bill Rojas, who has resisted
giving thousands of San Francisco schoolchildren a state assessment
test written in English.
</P>
<P>
   Students in grades 2 through 11 are required to take the state's
so-called STAR test, regardless of their English skills. About a
third of San Francisco's 60,000 public school students are learning
English, and Rojas and others say it's not fair give them a test
they can't even read.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Carole Migden, also a San Francisco Democrat, has
offered a bill to exempt limited-English speaking students
statewide from having to take the STAR test for 30 months. Migden
is considering reducing that time to 24 months with an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson had vetoed Migden's measure last year.
This year's bill now moves to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, another Shelley measure was approved, 43-29,that would
allow cities and counties to start needle-exchange programs for
intravenous drug users as long as the programs are designed with
``community input.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has the nation's largest needle-exchange program,
but it operates under an emergency order from Mayor Willie Brown
and the Board of Supervisors. About 17 clean-needle programs in
California flout state law by operating with emergency measures
enacted by counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelley bill, if signed by Gov. Gray Davis, would allow San
Francisco and other areas to operate without emergency orders.
</P>
<P>
   Co-authored by Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni, a Democrat from
Novato, the measure ``puts sound public policy above politics,''
said Pat Christen, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation.

 UNDATED: hotel rooms.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I found the hotel I wanted,'' Sheppard said, ``saw the price
was $160 a night, which was much less expensive than the price that
a local travel agency gave me for the same hotel, and booked it.
They sent e-mail to confirm the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   While some sites have streamlined the purchasing process, do not
expect from travel sites the kind of one-click shopping that makes
it so easy to buy, say, books on Amazon.com. ``With travel, one
click is too quick,'' said Suzi Levine, a product manager for
Expedia. ``This is often an expensive purchase, and we want to make
it very clear to customers that here is what they are buying. You
don't want customers to have remorse. We want them to feel like
they're in control.''
</P>
<P>
   But booking on line works best for travelers who want to make
relatively simple arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the technology is ideally suited to someone who
needs a round-trip ticket on a well-traveled air route, who can
say, `I know what I want and what I'm willing to pay,''' said Gadi
Maier, chief executive of the Internet Travel Network
 &UR; (www.itn.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   For travelers like Lisa Myers, a moher of two who has booked
several family trips on Travelocity in the past two years, the
Internet can seem an ideal solution. ``We travel a lot to see our
family, and I'm looking for a good air fare,'' said Ms. Myers, who
lives in Houston. ``I usually have some flexibility on dates, so I
look to see when we can fly the cheapest and then I book it. I
usually do it at night, after the children are asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But planning something more complicated, like a cruise, can
require an expert's advice. You're not very likely to find out how
old the ship is or how nice the staff is just by surfing travel
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about travel today, there are two general
categories,'' said Ms. Swerdlow, the analyst. ``There's complex
travel, which involves lots of questions to be answered, and then
there's fairly simple travel, which might require nothing more than
a point-to-point airline ticket. In the future, you'll see online
sites becoming easier to navigate, but today, the straightforward
type of arrangement is what most people would feel comfortable with
doing on line.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One Chance At a Low Price &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who care only about price and don't mind compromising
on departure times can check Priceline.com, a hybrid travel site
that lets you place a bid. But for each itinerary, a traveler gets
only one chance to bid _ if the first bid is too low, there is no
chance to enter a higher bid and try again.
</P>
<P>
   For a discount air fare, a customer types in bare-bones
itinerary information _ departure and arrival dates and cities _
then enters the price the customer is willing to pay for an airline
ticket or hotel room. A company spokesman said that customers had a
35 percent chance of getting a ticket if they made what he called a
reasonable offer _ an offer that is within 30 percent of a 21-day
advance-purchase price for a particular air route.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com  &UR; (www.priceline.com) &LR;  can offer those discounts
because it negotiates deals with major carriers in advance. ``If
Delta has lots of excess inventory on a given flight, of course,
they want to fill those seats,'' said Fiona Swerdlow, a digital
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``If you know the going
price for a fare, and you would be willing to pay a little less,
maybe your fare will be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part is that the customer must agree to buy the
ticket _ and type in credit card information _ before finding out
whether the flight is available at that price. Also, the customer
must agree ahead of time to fly on any major airline that is
willing to sell a seat and to fly on any flight departing between 6
a.m. and 10 p.m. It's a service aimed at bargain hunters willing to
make a few compromises for price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have told us they are willing to entertain these
low offers as long as they are serious, no-fooling-around offers,
which is why customers have to agree up front to buy the ticket,''
said Brian Ek, a Priceline.com spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline's popularity has grown consistently in the
year since its debut _ in April, the site sold an average of 20,000
airline tickets a week _ the rules can be confusing to
inexperienced travelers. Charles Sheppard, a Pepsi warehouse
manager who lives in Nahunta, Ga., learned that lesson a few months
ago when he was planning a trip to New York with his wife, Julia,
to celebrate their 12th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline got me a $125 round-trip ticket from Jacksonville,
Fla., to New York City, but then when I looked at the details, the
times were terrible,'' Sheppard said. ``We would have to be flying
through the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Sheppard, when he phoned Priceline.com's customer
service department to explain the situation, ``they were very
cooperative and said, `Yes, sir, we'll cancel the order.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they told me not to do it again,'' he added.
</P>
<P>

MEN TIRED OF LOOKING OLD TURN TO COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by Slang partners --) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Comedian John Byner was tired of the grumpy face
that greeted him in the mirror each morning. The downturned corners
of his mouth, puffy eyes and creases on his face prompted one fan
to remark: ``I can't believe all that humor comes from such a
sad-looking man.''
</P>
<P>
   His grim visage wasn't keeping him from landing roles on sitcoms
like ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and ``Caroline in the City,'' but the
61-year-old veteran television and movie actor didn't feel the way
his face looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good inside, and I'd go by a mirror or a window and I'd
see this grumpy-looking guy,'' Byner said. ``I thought I looked
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   So Byner joined the growing ranks of men who are shaving off
years of worry and wrinkles with cosmetic surgery. On March 8,
Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Richard Ellenbogen gave Byner a full
face lift, sucked the fat deposits from under his eyes, lifted the
corners of his mouth and raised his forehead. The surgery was
broadcast live on the Internet as a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Byner got the surgery for free _ one reason he's talking about
it while most men keep their cosmetic nips and tucks a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Byner said last week. ``I don't even think
about it anymore. I don't like to think about it in terms of how
many years the surgery took off. I look at it in terms of looking
the way I feel _ and that is a lot less grumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, more than 99,000 men underwent cosmetic surgical
procedures in 1998. That accounts for about 10 percent of all
procedures performed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the percentage of men seeking cosmetic surgery
has increased only slightly since experts starting tallying numbers
in 1992. But overall, both men and women are seeking out plastic
surgeons in record numbers _ up 153 percent from 413,000 patients
in 1992 to more than 1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Liposuction _ sucking away love handles and other fatty deposits
_ leads the way for both men and women. But men also are signing up
in record numbers for blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), followed by
face lifts, rhinoplasty (nose jobs) and male breast-reduction
surgery to correct the condition known as gynecomastia. The
popularity of short hairstyles also has men seeking oloplasty,
surgery that aligns the ears closer to the head, in numbers nearly
equal to women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gross, an assistant professor of plastic surgery at the
University of Southern California, said now that men are living
longer and healthier lives, it's natural they also want to look
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stigma that used to go along with plastic surgery
_ that it is only a female thing _ has passed,'' he said. ``As the
comfort level increases, it will be talked about more and
eventually will become the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for now at least, there are centuries of machismo to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not the macho thing,'' Gross admitted. ``I just saw
a husband and wife in their 60s. I'd already done their daughter's
face lift, and the mother is coming in to have her face lift. The
husband really wants his neck done, but I can tell he's too macho
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop men entirely. It just makes them more stealthy
than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman has breast enlargement surgery, she shows
everyone,'' Ellenbogen said. ``Men are a little less showy. They'll
talk about it, but they just don't volunteer much. That's the crux
of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons also say they're seeing more than just actors and
executives on their operating tables. Notice the UPS delivery man
looking a tad younger?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of the above,'' said Dr. Michael Rabkin, an expert in
using lasers to zap fat from eyelids. ``I've done professional
wrestlers, guys who work for the phone company, even a UPS
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me who does this stuff,'' echoed Ellenbogen. ``I
have a patient who is a Harley-Davidson biker who came in for
liposuction. He's the last guy in the world you'd think would be
unhappy with his beer belly. But he had his girlfriend's breasts
done a few months ago, and while we were in the office he lifted
his shirt and asked, `Can you do anything about that?'''
</P>
<P>
   High costs still make cosmetic surgery a luxury. A face lift
costs more than $4,500. And upper and lower eyelid surgery will set
you back nearly $3,000, according to the ASPRS.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last decade, cosmetic surgery techniques favored women
over men. Men's skin is looser than women's, and if it's just
pulled back it can leave a feminine look. Then there's the beard;
surgeons have to be mindful not to change the locations of the
beard or sideburns when moving skin.
</P>
<P>
   Male fat also tends to be more fibrous. But new ultrasonic
liposuction techniques liquefy fat and make it easier to suck out.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, new techniques using lasers and laparoscopy
(performing surgery via cameras inserted through small incisions)
mean the recuperation time that used to be associated with plastic
surgery is minimal. Now a man can slip away from the office on
Friday to get his eyelids done and return to work on Monday looking
well-rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually brought plastic surgery to the masses by
bringing it to outpatient centers instead of the hospital,''
Ellenbogen said.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery isn't for everyone. Surgeons love the boom but
warn image-conscious consumers to shop around and make sure they
have an understanding and rapport with their doctor before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to have realistic expectations about how they are
going to look,'' Gross said. ``Don't expect more than can
surgically be delivered. You can't take a 300-pound, markedly
overweight man and make him look like an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal candidate for cosmetic surgery is already in fairly
good shape and just wants some minor improvements to look younger.
</P>
<P>
   Byner is happy with his results, and he's not sorry he went
public, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will look into my face like they're looking
into a crystal ball, trying to see what I had done,'' Byner said.
``But most people are hip to it, as they say in the music world.
They say, `Hey, you look great. You still look like John Byner, and
you look younger, too.' &UR;  &LR; ''

COFFEE TABLES COMES IN MANY STYLES AND PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Coffee tables, which have been in use for
centuries, are both useful and enhancing to a room.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee table originated shortly after the mid-16th century,
when tables were abundant in various forms for various purposes.
Originally, the name applied to any small, light occasional table,
later known as nesting tables, which were brought out for tea or
ashtrays when needed.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1940s progressive American furniture manufacturers
began using the coffee table as a vehicle for novel and
experimental designs, according to ``The Encyclopedia of Interior
Design'' (1997, Fitzroy Dearborn).
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, the coffee table had become a standard item of
furniture marking the center point of the seating area and a place
to display the social accoutrements of the modern home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, any low table that is placed directly in front of a sofa
is called a coffee table. Styles range from two small square tables
placed almost side-by-side, to massive rectangular, square, oval
and round shapes, to works of sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Materials range from glass, wood, metal and stone to the new
polyresins. The shortage of timber following 1945 inspired
furniture designers to use glass or tray tops.
</P>
<P>
   New coffee tables can cost hundreds of dollars or more,
depending on the size, material and style. But just about any find
can serve as a coffee table, from old trunks, which are great for
storing games, toys and magazines, to a large ottoman with a tray
and some coffee table books on top.
</P>
<P>
   You might even enlarge the surface of a trunk, pedestal, piece
of sculpture or driftwood by adding a wider, thick piece of glass.
The glass will both show off and protect the base.
</P>
<P>
   Another quick fix is to find an old round or square dining-room
table (preferably not an antique) and cut the legs down, so that
the table top is at the desired height.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules when it comes to selecting a coffee table,
other than to know what size you need. Purchase or make a very
sturdy model if you have children or do a lot of work at the table.

PIONEER COUNTS ON POT OF GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- Placing your nest eggs in different baskets might be
a good strategy for individual investors, but it can be a lousy one
for investment management companies.
</P>
<P>
   Take Pioneer Group Inc., the mid-sized mutual fund firm with an
unusually motley collection of businesses _ and a tarnished record
at making them work. Once lauded as innovative for launching
overseas commodities and financial ventures as a hedge against
downturns in US stocks, the Boston-based company faces growing
scrutiny from shareholders over its money-losing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer is ``a first-class mutual fund business and distribution
outfit with some awful, awful diversification,'' said investor
Mario J. Gabelli, whose fund firm, Gabelli Funds Inc., is Pioneer's
third-largest shareholder, with an 8.9 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   After a weak first quarter following a year of steep losses, a
management shakeup, and even loose talk on Wall Street of a
possible sale of the company, Pioneer is finding its biggest
international assets the most difficult to dump.
</P>
<P>
   Having worked for months to drum up interest in its Siberian
timber project, which has never made a profit, the company has
still not found a partner to share the costs and risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand deadweight is its gold mine in Ghana, a
once-profitable venture now dulled by low bullion prices and
management missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who gather on Tuesday for Pioneer's annual
shareholders' meeting are looking for signs that plans to sell the
mine, known as Teberebie Goldfields, will help restore the bottom
line at Pioneer and improve the company's depressed stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold mine sale will be the key determinant of
profitability,'' said analyst Bruce R. Brewington, who follows the
company for Putnam, Lovell, De Guardiola &AMP; Thornton in San
Francisco. Pioneer lost $20.6 million last quarter, with the gold
mine accounting for nearly one-third of that total. After years of
profits, the company, whose core business is mutual funds, reported
1998 losses of $33.5 million, with the mine accounting for 60
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen G. Kasnet, head of global strategic investments at
Pioneer, said only that the company, which has hired Salomon Smith
Barney for the mine sale, was talking to several buyers, and a deal
would be completed in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But already there are questions about Pioneer's chances of
getting a good price for Teberebie, which the company developed
from the ground up. Citing steps by Ashanti Goldfields Co. Ltd., a
Ghana-based mining company, to shut down its nearby Iduapriem mine,
Douglas Donald, a former Scudder Investments gold fund manager who
is now an independent consultant, sees only one potential buyer for
Pioneer's property: South African miner Gold Fields Ltd., which is
expanding output at its Tarkwa mine, an open pit adjacent to
Teberebie.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer buyers, Donald said, means less price negotiation leverage
for Pioneer, whose property by some estimates could fetch up to $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer originally had expected to unload Teberebie by the end
of March. But late last year, it ran into unexpected difficulties
when it reached harder ore, making it tougher and more expensive to
recover gold through its heap-leaching process. Recent analysis of
the problem led Pioneer to revise downward its estimate of
Teberebie's recoverable reserves to 3.8 million ounces from 4.9
million _ a drop of 22 percent _ and switch to a costlier milling
process.
</P>
<P>
   The setback, which industry analysts say may have spooked some
potential buyers, forced Pioneer to delay the sale by several
months while it reformulated a prospectus for the property.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, gold's depressed price has also hurt matters. The
lowest bullion prices in 20 years _ the product of the precious
metal's waning status as an investment and slack demand in hobbled
Asian markets _ has caused Pioneer to rework its production cost
forecasts, which were initially predicated on an average market
price of $340 an ounce. Gold now fetches around $279 per ounce.
</P>
<P>
   But Pioneer's woes were not caused by exogenous factors only. By
most estimates, Pioneer made several missteps on Teberebie. First,
it declined to hedge, or lock in a future price, for mined output _
a move that would have buffered against low prices. At one point it
had executives with coal-mining expertise involved in the project,
according to Donald _ a choice that may have hampered production.
And it ordered new ore-hauling trucks to replace an old fleet but
scrapped the old ones before the replacements arrived, resulting in
production delays when the delivery was late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pros in the gold-mining business,'' Kasnet admitted.
</P>
<P>
   That statement reflects a dramatic shift _ begun eight months
ago and still unfolding _ in Pioneer's philosophy. Reluctantly
letting go of its old-economy vision of gold as a solid investment
and admitting defeat with most of its diversification strategy,
Pioneer cracked down last September, reshuffling executives and
business units and taking a new, harder line on its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The change strikes at the heart of the company, one of the
nation's oldest fund firms but also one of its most eclectic. While
a few money management companies have diversified their businesses
with varying degrees of success _ mutual fund giant Fidelity
Investments has newspaper and limousine units, and John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co. has international logging operations _
few have been as bold as Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe Pioneer's new strategy, John A. Boynton,
the company's chief financial officer, said, ``I would primarily
describe it focused on financial services and asset management.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer has already taken steps to pare its assets. It recently
sold its US-based venture capital unit to a private competitor,
Connecticut-based Landmark Partners Inc. After years of high-flying
profits from its Moscow financial services unit, it has all but
exited Russia, where economic and political collapse broadsided its
brokerage business and an investment in a Moscow bank went awry
when Russian executives fudged accounts. It also sold a 30 percent
stake in its Polish pension company subsidiary to Nationwide Global
Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While timber prices have recently improved, Pioneer's
Forest-Starma timber production unit in the Russian Far East is
still too cost-intensive for the company to justify going it alone.
But there have been no takers, even though export markets in Japan
and Korea have recovered.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, the Teberebie mine was handsomely profitable, full
of soft, easily extractable ore that contributed an average 56
percent of Pioneer's profits from 1993 _ its second year of full
production _ through 1996. Pioneer president John F. Cogan Jr., who
purchased rights to the mine in the high-inflation, depressed stock
market era of the late 1970s, saw the far-flung property as a
natural hedge for Pioneer's core fund business. Indeed, many
investors once bought the company's stock on the strength of
Teberebie, whose market value in earlier years outstripped the
company's market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in recoverable reserves isn't Pioneer's first problem
with Teberebie. A 1995 plan to sell a 20 percent interest in the
property and list the shares on London and Ghanaian stock exchanges
flopped twice on weak bullion prices. And in recent years Pioneer
reportedly turned down a handsome offer for the asset from miner
Santa Fe Gold Corp., now part of Newmont Mining Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, where Pioneer is now concentrating its
efforts, things are somewhat brighter. Pioneer's core mutual fund
business ``is getting better all the time,'' Brewington said,
referring to the company's success in getting other firms to
distribute its products (Pioneer does not sell its funds directly
to investors).
</P>
<P>
   ``While they made a number of monumental tactical mistakes in
their diversification strategy,'' said R. Bentley Offut from Hunt
Valley, Md.-based Offut Securities, ``they still have a very
valuable investment management group.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pioneer had net redemptions for its equity funds last
quarter _ its first net outflows in seven quarters _ after record
sales of $961 million in 1998, according to Financial Research
Corp. Two high-profile funds with poor performance, Pioneer II and
Pioneer Capital Growth, were the main problems.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult, which analysts attributed to investor confusion over
the company's internal reorganization, meant Pioneer's total assets
under management fell to $22.9 billion in the first quarter from
$23.4 billion at the start of the year _ all at a time when the Dow
Jones industrial average was soaring and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index posted good gains.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, at least eight portfolio managers have
resigned or been asked to leave. Just three funds _ Pioneer Fund,
Pioneer Equity-Income, and Pioneer Growth Shares _ now account for
the bulk of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pioneer announced Thursday a new arrangement for a unit
of insurer Aetna Inc. to distribute its three most popular funds,
the dampened fund returns and flows could crimp plans to expand
distribution further. In a recent report, Financial Research wrote
that Pioneer ``has fallen into a position where it is now critical
to its sales efforts that it put highly competitive product on the
shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, the company has to contend with a
downturn in its stock price after years of heady gains. Pioneer
shares fell 25 percent last quarter after losing 29.8 percent in
1998. Having closed at 18 1/8 Thursday, they are down 8.2 percent
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brewington, who has a buy rating on the stock, said that
``generally, the prognosis is good'' for Pioneer as it refocuses
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``we need to see success in their sales
channels and with the mine sale.''

TIMING IS EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just once in my life, I'd like to really screw up, resign, and
be handed a $25 &UR;  &LR; million check to go away. But then I'm not a CEO.
I'm not Abe Gosman.
</P>
<P>
   If he had walked away a couple of years ago, Gosman could have
gone out on top as the Michael Jordan of the health-care industry.
Instead he's just another guy with bum knees bouncing around the
CBA, albeit a very rich one.
</P>
<P>
   Gosman is hardly the only great man to have been wrong at the
end of a career; An Wang and Ken Olsen come easily to mind. And
Gosman has been good to me over the years: I've been down to his
incredible Palm Beach mansion; he's suggested snappy headlines for
stories about him; and, more than anything, he's returned my calls
on deadline (a sure way to be my friend).
</P>
<P>
   So I was disinclined to kick him when he's down _ until he took
the $25 &UR;  &LR; million payout at Meditrust Cos., a payout that showed up
this week as a huge charge to the Needham company's earnings.
Haven't Meditrust's shareholders paid enough for Gosman's mistakes?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gosman built a reputation as an astute investor
who makes people money. That rep has taken a big blow.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Meditrust, the real estate investment trust, have
fallen 63 percent in 1 1/2 years. Gosman's CareMatrix Corp., the
assisted &UR;  &LR; living company, has been cut in half. His PhyMatrix
Corp., which was designed to buy physician practices, has collapsed
from $15 to a buck and change.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the $2 million Gosman and his son Andrew lost in
investing in little companies like Palomar Technologies Inc. and
NUKO Information Systems Inc. and it has been an ugly run for the
man with the golden touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of money for shareholders, a lot of money,''
Gosman told me Thursday. But he declined to discuss the Meditrust
settlement, citing legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Gosman is a terrific story. He grew up poor in a three-story
walk-up in Manchester, N.H., the only child of Russian immigrants.
His mom saved for his college education by tossing the winnings
from penny poker games into a blue box on the kitchen shelf; his
dad was an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Gosman started a business selling laminated
snakeskin before jumping into the nursing-home business that would
put him on the Forbes list of richest Americans. Gosman made his
fortune and reputation at the Mediplex Group, the nursing-home
company he built, sold, repurchased, and resold.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, we should have smelled trouble when Gosman
started touting his ``Wheel of Fortune'' strategy. At 68, Gosman
launched the most ambitious gambit of his career. The idea was to
take Meditrust, which operated retirement communities, and surround
it with a range of barely related ventures.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be his Wheel of Misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   Gosman spent $383 million to buy Santa Anita Cos. He was not
after the faded race track, but a rare legal status providing the
favored tax treatment of a real estate investment trust without the
strings that are usually attached. The so-called paired-shared REIT
was to allow him to build his wheel of fortune, and he quickly
spent $1.6 billion for a hotel chain and $241 million for a
golf-course operator.
</P>
<P>
   Timing and instinct are what made Gosman rich and famous, and
they were also what failed him in the end. Soon after Meditrust
introduced its diversification strategy, Congress pulled the rug
out from under Gosman, ending the paired-shared benefits. Timing?
Instinct? Live by the sword, die by the sword.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Meditrust, the 70-year-old Gosman has taken over
as joint chief executive of struggling PhyMatrix and chief
executive of CareMatrix. Son Andrew, formerly CareMatrix president,
has been relegated to vice chairman; number one son Michael has
been shuttled off to a new consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Gosman and his family were also shareholders and got
hurt in the collapse of Meditrust, CareMatrix, and PhyMatrix. But
the $25-million payday should help cushion the blow. And he had the
muscle to wrestle a $2-million settlement out of Smith Barney for
his sour investment in Palomar and NUKO; little investors haven't
been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great country. For some people.

WELL-PLANNED PORTFOLIO FALLS INTO THE INFLATION TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Enclosed is a list of the investments of myself and my wife.
The total value is now $461,940. We want to retire five years from
now when she will be 56 and I will be 55. We are currently
investing $500 a month in IDS New Dimensions fund, Class A, and a
similar amount in IDS Diversified Equity Income, Class A. Do we
have enough invested to retire and draw approximately $40,000
annual income from our savings?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Desert Hot Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think you will have enough saved to attain your goal,
but there's some question whether you will have enough to protect
yourselves from the likely ravages of inflation in the later years
of your retirement. Here's the math: If you continue your $1,000
monthly contributions to the accounts and achieve 8 percent
portfolio growth during the next five years, the pool would be
$751,796 at retirement time. Presuming you could achieve a 6.5
percent average yield from a fixed-income portfolio, you would need
about $615,000 thus invested to support $3,333 monthly withdrawals
without erosion of capital. That would leave you with $136,796
which you could leave in growth-oriented investments to deal with
later inflation. In all likelihood that would suffice, but for an
ultra-secure retirement package, I would rather see that number at
about $300,000. Remember, the earlier you retire, the more you
should worry about the effect of future inflation on your
retirement assets.
</P>
<P>
   How might you get from here to there? Well, if you continued
saving at your present rate, it would require average annual
returns of about 12.53 percent to reach $915,000. Pretty unlikely,
in my opinion. If you achieved average annual investment returns of
10 percent, you'd have to boost monthly savings to $2,231 to reach
the target. Or if you achieved average annual returns of 8 percent,
you'd have to boost savings quite dramatically -- to $3,236 a month
to reach a $915,000 pool.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it seems to me most likely that the third projection is
the most likely. First of all, nearly 24 percent of your current
portfolio is in fixed-income investments, and the fixed-income side
of holdings such as IDS Mutual would boost the fixed-income side
higher still. Second, I just don't think the stock market
investments which dominate your portfolio will have the legs to
continue the strong growth of recent years. And third, since you
should be moving the portfolio toward more conservative holdings as
you approach retirement, the prospect of high growth will be
accordingly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to begin this process immediately by
diverting your ongoing contributions from IDS New Dimensions and
IDS Diversified Equity Income funds to fixed-income options. To
make this move, I would leave IDS, partly because it's not
particularly strong on the fixed-income side, but moreso because
the Class A funds you have been buying from IDS carry 5 percent
front-end sales charges. I see no good reason to pay and
substantial sales charge for a fixed-income fund; the effect of the
sales charge is simply too much for even a talented fund manager to
overcome when the bottom line is compared to the results of no-load
funds. My suggestion would be to look at funds such as Vanguard
GNMA, AARP GNMA and US Treasury, or Fidelity Mortgage Securities
for your ongoing contributions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 52-year-old woman who hopes to retire at about 65. I
have the following IRA mutual fund accounts: $9,406 in Franklin's
Mutual Beacon Z, $4,086 in Fidelity Puritan, $10,431 in Fidelity
Growth and Income, and $35,489 in IDS New Dimensions. Through my
present employer I have $4,000 in a 457 deferred compensation
program, with 60 percent of it in Janus Twenty and 20 percent each
in Janus Worldwide and Fidelity Growth and Income. I add $50 a week
to this account. I also have $10,593 in a 401(k) program with a
previous employer, and I would like to reallocate this money. How
should I reallocate these holdings? I feel I should probably have
some money in a bond fund and some in a small-cap fund. I have
looked at Baron Small Cap fund, but I really hate to have holdings
with so many companies. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   N.M., Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think both categories you're suggesting make sense,
although you may be a few years early in establishing a heavier
bond position (remember that about a third of the Puritan portfolio
is on the fixed-income side). If you want to continue with the fund
families you're now using, I suggest you take a look at Janus
Venture fund as a small-cap holding, and at Fidelity Mortgage
Securities fund for your first all-bond holding. Other than that,
the only imbalance I see is the concentration in large-cap domestic
holdings, represented by the stock side of the Puritan, and all of
Fidelity Growth and Income, IDS New Dimensions, and all of Janus
Twenty. My suggestion for a final diversification would be to move
half of the money that's in the Fidelity Growth and Income IRA into
Fidelity Select Health Care. Other than that, it seems to me you're
doing fine.

   Q. I am 33 years old, married, and have a four-year-old
daughter. I currently earn approximately $42,000 a year as a
federal employee, and 10 years from now can retire at half of my
base salary for the rest of my life. All of my savings is in mutual
funds, allocated as follows: $50,000 in Vanguard Windsor II,
$32,000 in Janus fund, $25,000 in Fidelity Magellan, $20,000 in an
IRA invested in T. Rowe Price International Stock fund, $12,000 in
Janus Twenty, and $2,500 in a money market account. In addition, I
invested $3,000 in American Century Twentieth Century's Giftrust
fund for my daughter. I have been adding $166 a month to the T.
Rowe Price IRA account, and I also add $100 a month to the Janus
fund account. My goals are to save for my daughter's education and
to retire comfortably at age 65 (after working another job after
retiring from the military). I am considering starting a Roth IRA
account for my wife in Janus Worldwide fund and investing $100 a
month in Vanguard's Index 500 fund. With the latter investment, the
account would be in my name, but would be earmarked for my
daughter's education. I would then stop the monthly contribution to
Janus fund. Do you think I have too many funds? Am I
over-diversified? The Giftrust account has performed very poorly
over the last two years, but the contract requires that I keep if
for at least 10 years. Do I have any options here? I am also
hearing that this was not a wise investment because children are
expected to contribute higher percentages of their assets to
educational expenses than children. Is this basically true? My hope
with the Vanguard Index 500 idea is to keep both expenses and taxes
down. Finally, is it prudent for both me and my wife to have IRAs
invested in the international sector?
</P>
<P>
   T.P., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Starting with the last question, I see no problem right away,
but if you continued putting all your retirement savings in world
or international funds, you would soon enough find that sector
represented too much of the retirement savings. Right now, your
position in T. Rowe Price represents 15.5 percent of your portfolio
(excluding the Giftrust account). It wouldn't take very many years
of contributions to the two IRA accounts before that sector would
get beyond 20 percent, which is where I would place the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with Janus Worldwide, why not look to funds
that would take a different path to getting you better diversified.
The biggest problem I see is that more than 80 percent of the
portfolio is in domestic large-cap stocks. So I suggest you divide
your wife's IRA money between Janus Enterprise, a mid-cal growth
fund, and Janus Venture, a small-cap fund. Both are rated
three-star, or average, by Morningstar, but when you look at the
ratings in those fund sectors, you'll discover that three stars are
excellent in these two sectors, which have been taking their lumps
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The story on Giftrust is even worse than you fear. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds, the contract for this fund's owners
requires that the investment be held for 10 years or until the
owner reaches the age of majority -- whichever comes later.
</P>
<P>
   So there's nothing you can do but stick with it -- and, of
course, refrain from making further contributions to the account.
You are correct that it's best to keep your daughter's college
money in your name, and index funds such as Vanguard Index 500 tend
to be relatively tax-efficient, so that seems a good choice for
that account.

11-YEAR-OLD BOY, A WHIZ AT CHARITY DRIVES, IS NAMED HOMETOWN HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ When he was six, Patrick Gavin-Brynes went to a
5K run with his mom. He didn't know much about the charity it was
for, but he sure liked all those bright ``trophies and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, the Lake George, N.Y., boy worked at getting
sponsors of his own for a walk-a-thon, aware that his little legs
weren't quite up to a full-fledged race. He came to the contest
with $3,200 in pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat everybody else and got my little dream,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His budding philanthropy didn't stop. Over the last five years,
he raised $14,000, breaking his original record the last time
around by hustling hard and getting a commitment from Wal-Mart to
match his pledges up to $2,000. With $3,000 of his own pledges,
that brought in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts by the busy 11-year-old _ who also plays piano,
trumpet, French horn and soccer and attends Boy Scouts, school and
chorus _ didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Patrick joined seven others here honored by the
American Red Cross as a Hometown Hero. The award is given to people
who go above and beyond the call of duty or personal responsibility
to benefit others.
</P>
<P>
   The money Patrick raises goes to Operation Santa, a year-round
program set up by his uncle, Frank Munoff, to provide food and
clothing to the needy. Patrick has raised funds through car washes,
raffles, hot dog sales and, now that he's a little older, getting
into the 5K run. ``I sort of suffer through it, but it's worth
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He now has his sights set on raising $10,000 through the help of
an anonymous mortgage agent, who has pledged to give him $50 from
every closing fee the agent earns.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Patrick has gotten his trophies, he says he'd like next
to appear on the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like her and her personality,'' he said, adding that if he
gets invited to the talk show, he hopes to inspire other people to
do charitable work.

DISTRIBUTION HINDERS DATA GENERAL COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; We had heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
   Data General Corp. stock began to bounce off the walls on
Monday, moving up on sharply higher volume. The buzz: Shares of the
Westborough, Mass. company were moving on takeover talk.
</P>
<P>
   This has happened so many times in the last year or two that
it's hopeless to try to keep count. Rumors of some big company
buying Data General have always led nowhere. Trading has calmed
down this week, with only modest price gains, to 12 11/16 on
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Our question: Why do they keep popping up? And does their
persistence suggest that one day the whispers will finally come
true?
</P>
<P>
   Data General illustrates themes woven deep into today's
competition among technology businesses: how hard it is for
computer hardware companies to reinvent themselves, the
extraordinary amount of stock market capital that flows to industry
leaders at the expense of second-tier competitors, and the critical
importance of distribution to any computer-related company.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are all behind the talk about Data General, one day
rumored to be purchased by a competitor like EMC Corp. and another
day thought to be a target of a big computer hardware seller like
Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Data General declined to discuss its strategy with us, citing a
media conference it scheduled for next week to discuss new
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there is nothing at all wrong with Data General's
products, but the company remains susceptible to twists and turns
in the markets for its products and its stock. ``They're fragile;
that's the problem,'' said a technology analyst who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Data General continues to exist at all is a kind
of tribute. Practically all Data General's competitors from the
long-gone days when its minicomputers were hot are now history:
Digital Equipment Corp., Prime Computer, Apollo Computer, and
others. Add Wang Laboratories Inc. to the list soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a company that's left over from the last generation,''
said Carl Howe, a research director at Forrester Research in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Data General hasn't gone away, but from a shareholder's point of
view it hasn't gone anywhere. The company reorganized its business
to sell computer network servers and data storage hardware years
ago, and for a time seemed to be climbing out of a deep hole.
</P>
<P>
   Data General stock advanced into the 30s in 1997, but quickly
retreated; it now trades below its prices of a decade ago and far
lower than in its 1980s heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Computer network servers account for more than 40 percent of
Data General's business, but investors are more interested in its
smaller unit, which sells data storage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, computer network servers are the kind of products
that face bone-crunching competition from huge companies with
resources to spare. Data General can make money selling its Aviion
servers, but it isn't going to muscle its way into the front line
of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their server business does not have critical mass,'' Howe
said. ``They don't have the scale necessary to go up against the
Dells of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Data storage is hot right now, and Data General
has top-notch fiber-channel technology available for its hardware.
The growth of computer systems and the Internet have generated
explosive demand for data storage, and lots of companies are
cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   But who is going to sell Data General's storage gear?
</P>
<P>
   Data General has relied on other hardware companies, original
equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, to sell its storage devices. But
Data General's top OEM customer, Hewlett-Packard Co., is moving
away from that relationship and is expected to all but disappear as
a source of DG storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett Packard wasn't just a big source of revenue; it was a
partner whose reputation for quality helped Data General products.
``It was a halo effect,'' said Robert Gray, research director for
storage systems at International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Data General has signed up Dell, another computer Big Foot, as a
new storage OEM client, but analysts disagree about how much
business the relationship will generate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Data General is trying to quickly build its own sales
force. That worked for EMC, but most analysts question how
successful a new Data General sales team can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technology point of view, their products are as good as
anybody's,'' said Roger W. Cox, an analyst at Dataquest Inc. ``I
think their issue is the marketing, sales, and support. They're
going to compete against the giants, IBM, EMC, Compaq, and Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound to you like a market in which the little
hardware company can thrive and stay independent? It's hard to
imagine.

 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The scouting report on Greg Montalbano has an
inch-thick addendum. Inside an ordinary manila envelope,
Montalbano's medical records are carefully packaged for his
prospective employers. The weightiest of the five sections begins
with a letter of introduction from Montalbano's oncologist and
proceeds to document every doctors appointment, every test, every
scan taken the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano's mother, Sharon, handed out several envelopes of
medical history between games of a recent doubleheader. She
continues to accommodate all requests from baseball scouts for
medical information. Her son, the lefthanded ace of the
Northeastern pitching staff, has nothing to hide. He has a major
league fastball clocked in the low 90s, great command of the strike
zone, the lowest earned run average among Division 1 pitchers, and
a medical history that includes cancer, two courses of
chemotherapy, and 5 1/2 surgical procedures since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time in his Northeastern career,
Montalbano's health has not interfered with a season. Scouts have
become a regular presence at his games. They file a one-page,
type-written report that details the obvious talent. Three good
pitches that he spots well. Can mix speeds. Knows how to put
hitters away. Good frame. The page gets sent to teams along with
the much bulkier medical history in the manila envelope.
</P>
<P>
   As the June 2 draft approaches, Montalbano's status is difficult
to predict. The measure of his potential must take into
consideration the weighty prose of the medical experts and the
simple sentences of the baseball experts. The Montalbano story is
incomplete without both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer is always going to be an issue, but I'd like to
think the way things are going kind of puts it to rest,'' said
Montalbano. ``I'd like to think that with the way I'm pitching
people are going to stop saying, `Oh this is the sick kid.'
Hopefully, they're going to say, `Oh there's the lefty.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano has done everthing within his power to erase the
specter of testicular cancer found and surgically removed in
February 1996. This season, he has managed a one-man campaign from
the mound. After a preseason uninterrupted by medical concerns,
Montalbano is proving each start that he can dominate opponents and
maintain a high level of consistency when healthy. Those scouts who
come to contests questioning his stamina are pleasantly surprised
by his complete-game performances.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty pitched a no-hitter in the season-opener against
Niagara, striking out 12 and walking just three in seven innings.
He threw a one-hitter with nine strikeouts against Hartford. Just
two weeks ago, Montalbano set school and America East conference
record for strikeouts in a seven-inning game with 15 K's in the
first game of a doubleheader against Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the record-setting performance that scouts went
clamoring for the envelopes with Montalbano's medical history.
Representatives from Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Boston, Toronto, Tampa
Bay, Anaheim, Philadelphia, Colorado, Cleveland, and Arizona have
been spotted at games.
</P>
<P>
   When they come to watch, the scouts see a poised lefthander with
a lanky 6-foot-2-inch frame. He still appears thin, though he has
regained the 20 pounds lost as a result of chemotherapy and stands
at 192. He believes his body can carry another 15-20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano's arms look disproportionately long and extend
halfway down his thighs. The pitcher's physique translates into a
long arm delivery that gives hitters trouble. The chest-high kick
of his right leg balances the long reach of his left arm as
Montalbano uncoils to the point of release. The ball whistles by
with speed.The motion appears fluid and effortless, his dangling
limbs the only distraction from the continuous flow.
</P>
<P>
   Medical history aside, Montalbano possesses the physical
attributes of a classic lefthanded pitcher. The package wrapped in
Husky red and black and wearing No. 30 comes close to the ideal
when measurements and statistics are discussed.In the scouting
venacular, he has ``the tools'' and ``the makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The tools are a fastball clocked at 88-91 miles per hour, a
major league curve that he practiced last summer as a reliever with
the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod League and the makings of a
major league changeup. Those three pitches _ though credit belongs
primarily to his fastball _ have kept Montalbano's ERA below 1.00.
His 7-1 record comes with the lowest ERA in the country at 0.68. No
other pitcher stands below 1.00, with Florida hurler Ben Grezlovski
the closest at 1.71. He ranks 20th in strikes-per- nine-innings
pitched with 11.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a player to perform better than
Greg has performed this year,'' said Northeastern coach Neil
McPhee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this year's statistics only begin to reveal the mental
toughness that has always been a part of Montalbano's competitive
personality. The moment that defined his focus came during the 1997
America East championship game. The lefty entered the game against
Vermont with the title hanging in the balance. Seventh inning.
Bases loaded. No one out. Northeastern ahead, 5-1. He struck out
the side in the seventh, then fanned two in the eighth and two in
the ninth. He recorded three scoreless innings and earned his third
save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a savvy pitcher,'' said one scout. ``He knows his way
around the mound. On top of that, he has great fight to him. He
battles hitters and that's a testament to his character. The fact
that he was sick and battled back, that just shows his courage and
his fight. He doesn't let that get the best of him. You can tell he
loves to pitch. He loves the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when he did not pitch, Montalbano watched
intensely as his teammates faced Harvard at Friedman Diamond. He
looked straight past the pitcher's mound, keeping his line of sight
above the treetops, and could see the hospitals that constitute
Boston's medical district. The distance from the diamond to Brigham
and Women's Hospital is no more than a mile. Montalbano had his
last medical procedure at Brigham and Women's and spent five days
in the hospital.

 BOSTON: ... in the hospital.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I like the view better from here,'' said Montalbano the sun on
his face and the sound of baseball in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The endless schedule of doctors appointments, catscans, MRIs,
blood tests, and hospital visits began in the winter of 1996.
Doctors found a cancerous tumor in Montalbano's right testicle and
removed it on Feb. 1. He was 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my kid was going to die,'' said nurse Sharon
Montalbano about the moment she learned of her son's cancer. ``When
I studied it in school, you died from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you think about that?'' said Greg. ``I'm 21. I'm not
ready to think about that stuff. I can't say it was never in the
back of my mind. You wonder because it can happen, but I didn't
worry about it happening to me. I always thought of the
positives.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, the good news would be coupled with
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of doctors called the tumor board reviewed
Montalbano's case after the initial surgery and discovered a nodule
in his right lung. Two sessions of chemotherapy were prescribed.
Each session lasted three weeks. At the start of the second
session, Montalbano lost his hair and lost weight. With
chemotherapy in February and March, baseball was not an option, and
Montalbano was a medical redshirt his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his college career, Montalbano would be plagued not
with a recurrence of the cancer, but with the appearance of tumors
called teratomas. A patient with Montalbano's history of cancer
must have any growth monitored carefully and removed if there's a
concern about malignancy. The timing of the surgeries always
interfered with baseball season and prevented Montalbano from
participating in a full season until this year. And each time he
came back from a surgery, Montalbano battled soreness and the
frustration of spending time away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the highly invasive nature of the many surgeries that
would follow as a result of the teratomas, his doctors made every
attempt to preserve his body for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would speak with Coach McPhee he would say, `Do they
have a clue Sharon? Do they know what's really going on?' '' said
Montalbano's mother. ``When they read through Gregory's medical
notes, it says he's a pitcher and he's concerned about being able
to play baseball afterwards. I would always start out saying, `His
life is the most important thing to us.' Don't get me wrong, but
this child also has a talent.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctors understood and made every attempt to take his future
as an athlete also into consideration, while placing a priority on
curing him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of 1996, Montalbano would have two more surgeries
to remove teratomas. The most difficult was a right thoracotomy in
September 1996 to take out two tumors in his right lung. In order
to reach the tumors, Montalbano's lung was collapsed and doctors
made an incision that stretched from his spine to his sternum.
Recovering from the surgery, Montalbano would have trouble
breathing when rolled onto his side so the incision could be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he pitched the following spring, saving the confererence
championship game in dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery No. 4 followed in August 1997. Surgery No. 5 in February
1998, when multiple teratomas were removed from his pelvic area.
Last November, he underwent cryotherapy at Brigham and Women's to
disolve yet another teratoma.
</P>
<P>
   When a recent medical exam revealed no new growths, Montalbano
called it a ``big step.'' It was an important sign, especially
considering the upcoming draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a certain point, it really does affect your chances,''
said Montalbano of the constant removal of teratomas. ``If
something else were to happen, then that's where the scouts and the
major league teams might start to say, `Oh well, that's the one.
That's too many. We can't take a risk on this kid.' That's fine. If
that's the way it is, that's the way it is. I don't necessarily see
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Anaheim Angels didn't see it that way, either. They
selected lefthander Scott Schoeneweis in the third round of the
June free agent draft. During his career at Duke, Schoeneweis had
testicular cancer and shoulder surgery. Montalbano is widely
considered the No. 2 college prospect in New England. And while
some have projected he'll go in the later rounds, the fourth or
fifth round seems more than reasonable for such a lefthanded
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano understands baseball is a business and that teams
invest in players. There are two approaches organizations can take
with his case. They can decide he presents too big a risk to take
early and wait to see if he's available later. They can also weigh
his medical history against his potential and decide he presents a
tremendous upside. With all of his surgeries and medical
treatments, Montalbano missed critical periods of development.
There is no doubt his body will mature and more experience will add
needed polish to his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that I have stuff to get picked pretty high,
but there's also 45 rounds and I've got all the baggage to go
late,'' said Montalbano. ``Granted I think I bring a lot more to
the table than other players do as far as the mental edge and
sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this to say,`Hey, I told you so.' I'm doing this
because it's my dream. This is what I want to do with my life. I
really don't think I have anything to prove to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two big packages up for grabs. The manila envelope
documents the past. The 6-2 lefty represents the future.

GOODBYE SLIDERS, HELLO CURTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I want to take off my shower sliders. They are messed up and
I'd like to replace them with a curtain. Are they difficult to
remove?
</P>
<P>
   D. P., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really, but it might be a bit tedious. That should not
deter you from getting rid of the doors; many of the inexpensive
ones don't work very well, and all are miserable to keep clean.
And, if you have young kids that need bathing in the tub, the
sliders, which open half way, can make it difficult, if not
hilarious, to try to grab a soapy kid who has escaped to the wrong
end of the tub.
</P>
<P>
   I think curtains are the best way to go, because modern curtains
have many styles and colors, they don't stiffen like the old ones
did, are inexpensive and easily replaced, and can be washed in the
washer to remove mildew.
</P>
<P>
   To remove the slider, take out the doors. Remove any screws that
are holding the frame to the tiled walls, and push and pull the
frame off the tub rim. The frame has been caulked (or should have
been) so it will take some pretty hard prying with a chisel or
other prying instrument to get it off. Remove glue residue from
tiles and tub by scraping and treating with a solvent: rubbing
alcohol, paint thinner, dry cleaning fluid or chemical paint
remover. Or, try heat from a hair dryer to soften the glue for
scraping.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the screw holes in the tile with joint compound or sandless
grout; paint to match.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My back yard is a tiny area that is muddy in winter and dusty
in summer. I'd like to install a pavement as a broad walkway and
also space to park a car. Are the concrete ``brick color'' concrete
pavers (6 inches square) any good to use? The whole area is only 20
by 15 feet; I'd like to pave an area 8 by 12-15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   FLORA HAAS, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pavers will hold up well because modern ones are made of
high-pressure concrete, which is stronger than standard, and are a
far cry from ordinary concrete blocks. There are more varieties
than the 6-inch by 6-inch one you have in mind. The colors may
fade, the concrete will endure. And, they will stand up under a
car. An alternative is real paving stones, chunks of cut granite in
various shapes; the granite, being granite, will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   To install, set the pavers in 2 inches of stone dust or sand,
which really can be tamped firm enough so the pavers will not sag
or sink. Of course, you will have to excavate to keep the pavers at
the proper level.
</P>
<P>
   If the area is so small, why not pave it all, or leave a strip
of earth for growing flowers. If you pave it all, you can buy
whiskey half barrels and other containers and grow your flowers in
them. There should be some relief from all that paving, as good
looking as it will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am finishing a hardwood floor after taking up a rug and the
nailing strip, but several big-headed common nails were driven into
the wood and I cannot pull or countersink them. A cat's paw to pull
them would gouge the wood. How can I conceal or remove those nail
heads?
</P>
<P>
   TOM ANGUISH, Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try cutting the heads off with a hacksaw blade. You can buy a
handle that holds just the blade so you can get under the head. You
will have to cut into the wood to get a bit below the surface to
get to the shank so you can cut off the head, but it can't be
helped. Countersink the nails and fill the holes with wood filler,
sand and finish.
</P>
<P>
   Or, slip a narrow chisel under the head and pry up enough so a
hammer claw can grab it. You will ruin the chisel doing this, so
use a cheap chisel. Be careful of flying chips when you pry; wear
safey goggles. You will also cut some of the wood, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   Another way: tap the top of the nail head with a nailset to
create a pilot hole, then drill a hole into the head, repeating the
drilling until you've drilled the head right off. Countersink the
shaft and fill with wood filler or a dowel.
</P>
<P>
   If the floor is on the first floor and the ceiling in the
basement is exposed, before doing anything, check to see if you can
see those big common nails coming through the floor boards. If so,
drive them up and pull them out or cut off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My deck is peeling like crazy, but the wood is intact. I
bought the house with the deck already built, so I don't know if it
is paint or what kind of wood it is. What finish can I use that
won't peel, and protect the wood?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY COSTELLO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The wood, at least the floor boards, might be
pressure-treated, mahogany, or cedar. It might possibly be fir, but
that is unlikely. Only the fir needs protection. The solution is to
sand the deck (floor) to the bare wood and apply a semitransparent
house stain. This is not designed for decks, but it will work,
provide color and protection, and last for three to five years. If
it is pressure-treated wood, sand carefully, wear a dust mask and
collect the dust for safe disposal. All the old finish must be
removed for the semitransparent stain to penetrate.

SINGLE-ISSUE PARTIES ADD SPICE TO ISRAEL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Ezra Tissona is sure that legalized gambling will
solve Israel's problems. Reuven Zelinkovsky thinks meditation is
the answer. Boaz Wachtel says the best thing is to sit back and get
high.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just a few of the new faces on Israel's political
scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli voters go to the polls on Monday to elect a new
prime minister and parliament, they will choose among 32 different
parties ranging from the right-wing to the fairly offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Take Zelinkovsky and his Natural Law Party. The retired army
officer believes that Israel's biggest problems _ from conflict
between secular and religious Jews to the stalled peace process
with the Palestinians _ can be best addressed by mass meditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to train and enjoyable to practice _ when groups of
people are practicing meditation, there is a strong influence on
the surroundings,'' said Zelinkovsky, 55, vice chairman of the
International Meditation Society of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Natural Law Party could face tough competition from
Wachtel's Green Leaf Party, which wants to see cannabis for
personal use legalized as a way to promote, among other things,
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being attacked by conservative forces in Israel who try
to diminish our existence in a variety of ways _ but I smoke pot
and there's no addiction, only great love,'' said the 40-year-old
Wachtel, who graduated from the Hebrew College in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether this will be enough to grab voters. With a
national unemployment rate of nearly 9 percent, an overburdened
health care system, and a stalled peace process with the
Palestinians, Israelis may have more than spirituality in mind when
they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Tissona thinks he has the edge. His Casino Party
has a simple answer to almost every problem _ legalize gambling in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis must leave the country if they want to place a bet.
Since last year, this often means an hour's drive to the
Palestinian-controlled city of Jericho, where an Austrian-managed
casino has proven to be a financial windfall for its Palestinian
and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Tissona probably represents the view of more than a few Israelis
when he says he does not see why the Palestinians should get all
the money. ``If we open a casino, we're going to have a few million
tourists _ we are going to have Israelis _ if we have all this it's
going to make Israel much stronger,'' said the 53-year-old
businessman, an avid gambler.
</P>
<P>
   These political novices may be more astute than their party
platforms appear to reflect. It takes 1.5 percent of votes cast to
make it to the 120-seat parliament, meaning that a political party
can win a seat with about 55,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for small parties, but many analysts complain
that the voting system encourages fractionalization and makes it
difficult to put together a working coalition. Under the system,
voters cast two ballots, one for prime minister and one for a
political party.
</P>
<P>
   When the system was first applied in 1996, 11 of the 21 parties
made it to parliament and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended
up with what proved to be an unwieldy coalition that mixed his
right-wing Likud party with Orthodox and other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little parties make it hard to form a coalition, and it's
damaging to the system, because people get into sectoral
politics,'' said Janet Aviad, Israel director of the Charles R.
Bronfman Foundation, which works on issues of coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those registered for Monday's elections are three parties
representing Russian immigrants, one party of Bukharan Jews,
another founded by Romanian Jews, and a party for the Negev desert
region. Then there are the more established parties that represent
not just nationalists, moderates, and centrists, but Arab Israelis,
religious Jews, and secular Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the new small parties said that Israelis had
nothing to fear from a parliament that could include the Power to
Pensioner's Party for the elderly, the Green Party for the
environment, or the Rights of Man in the Family Party to protect
men's rights after divorce. They plan to be loyal to anyone who
works for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Casino Party chairman, Tissona, said there was no point in
asking him about the peace process. ``I don't like to get involved
in politics, the one who is elected will decide these things and I
will support whoever is elected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he goes for peace, I go for peace, if he goes for war, I go
for war, it's not my problem,'' he said. ``I just go for the
casinos.''

LIFE IN THE CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Volunteering in Tirana to help the American Refugee Committee
set up on the ground to help minister to hundreds of thousands of
Kosovar refugees, Peter Lucas promptly discovered what was most
needed in the primitive 1,000-person camp at Golem on the Adriatic
coast: ``frozen chicken and ladies' underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   It was part Frank Perdue, and part Victoria's Secret, but it
worked. Red tape, inefficiency, ethnic rivalries, and desperate
shortages of everything from good roads to adequate transport make
it hard to shuffle supplies to those most in need. So the veteran
Boston-born journalist-turned-bureaucrat, one of the first
Americans of Albanian descent to re-enter the tiny nation after its
half-century-long isolation from the West under communism, played
his hole card: the plastic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my friend, Agim, I went to the American Express office in
Tirana, gave them my credit card, and eventually got $2,000 in
traveler's checks. I turned that into dollars. Then on the black
market I turned that into about 400,000 leks, the local currency.
Then we hit the market, an open-air bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   With cash and a truck to collect his booty, he paid for 50 boxes
of frozen chicken parts for the Kosovars, mostly women and
children, who had been denied protein for three weeks or more.
``The labels on the boxes said the chickens had been packed in
Gainesville, Ga.'' He has no idea how it got to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: the section of the market where he bought ``4,000
sets of women's cotton underwear made in Turkey _ all sizes.'' On
his first visit to Golem, he had heard refugee women and girls
lament a lack of underclothes; most had fled on short notice. After
a month of rough living, their garments were tattered.
</P>
<P>
   Think global, act local. Adopt a village, was Lucas's practical
response to the sight of hundreds of NGO workers thrashing around
in the confusing melee of relief work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albania is an ecological disaster,'' Lucas matter-of-factly
recounted for a Boston audience of two dozen Wednesday, which also
heard from two other Bay State natives freshly returned from the
war zone. Dr. Tom Durant of Massachusetts General Hospital, an ARC
board member, and Morton Dean, the fall River native and Emerson
College alum who was ABC's man on the scene for 31 days in
Belgrade, nodded assent as Lucas explained the refugee plight.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs of feral boys, orphans scavenging for food, turn the
roadsides into grotesque pantomimes of ``Animal Farm.'' Lucas:
``There's rubbish in all the camps, beside the roads. Come summer,
and the heat, without adequate water or food, there'll be cholera,
tuberculosis, and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant: ``There are 800,000 people living in tents or shelters.
The tents are saunas in two weeks, and refrigerators on Oct. 1.''
Lucas, who covered the Vietnam War for the old Boston Herald, said
Tirana's airport reminded him of the US military presence in
Saigon. Durant said that what refugees run into everywhere, whether
in Somalia, Cambodia, or Kosovo, is ``the four B's _ bureaucracy,
baksheesh, bribery, and bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant voiced skepticism about Clinton's ability to deliver on
his pledge to Kosovars that they will one day go home. ``How you do
that short of sending ground troops, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A month in Belgrade reporting from the Serb capital convinced
Dean that ``most Serbs don't care what happens to the Kosovars, or
to Milosevic,'' but they fear the bombing, hate NATO, and blame
America for the rising toll of bomb damage. ``Serbs look down on
Kosovar Albanians as lazy;they say `they don't want to work,' ''
said Dean, and are locked in the prism of the revenge of history.
``They give you the history lesson: `In the year 1369, here's what
happened . . ..' ''
</P>
<P>
   Serb television does not show pictures of the Kosovar refugees,
said Dean, whose own video reports, screened but not altered by
Serb government censors, were transmitted out of the TV station
damaged by a NATO missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who has visited Albania 15 or 16 times in the last
decade, is on a first-name basis with most of the Albanian
leadership. That government hangs on the thin thread of hope that
the US will redeem President Clinton's pledge to see the Kosovar
refugees safely home. ``I back the NATO bombing, and I back
Clinton,'' said Lucas in a later interview.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans of immigrant stock, he has a deeper
understanding of his own good fortune when he sees how the old
country is faring. ``The way I look at it, I've hit the lottery
twice in my life. First, in being born. Second, in being born an
American. That's no bull. When you come back out of there, that's
how you think.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the eventual outcome, Lucas thinks US and NATO policy will
ultimately prevail, and that Clinton, a politician often denigrated
as an opportunist, will be redeemed by backing a policy that looked
like a political loser at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton will pull this off, the refugees will go back,
and this will save his presidency _ that this is what he'll be
remembered for.''

`DANCING IN THE DARK' TRACES A WOMAN'S WANDERLUST

DANCING IN THE DARK 
Romance, Yearning, and the Search for the Sublime 
Barbara Lazear Ascher 
Cliff Street/HarperCollins, 228 pp; $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she turned 50, Barbara Lazear Ascher wanted some edge in
her life _ the kind of voyage out that is rarely granted doting
mothers and dutiful wives. ``Why are the boys having all the fun?''
she muses in ``Dancing in the Dark,'' an eloquent collection of
essays that makes up her fourth book. ``William Least Heat Moon.
Peter Matthiessen. Paul Theroux. They do that sort of thing in real
life. Girls do it in fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ascher sets out on her own quest, seeking ``passionate
connection, something beyond love affairs and official business.''
Whether she is in Madrid gazing at a Hieronymous Bosch triptych in
the Prado or lusting after Woody Allen's typewriter in an office
supply store in Manhattan, Ascher is able to find a sort of
everyday bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romance is in the quest. That a hand may never close on
the object of desire or that facts learned do not necessarily
reveal answers sought doesn't dissuade. The romantic, undeterred by
mystery, enters it with enthusiasm and reverence as though entering
a cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   Onetime author of the ``Hers'' column in The New York Times and
apparent Renaissance woman (the book is a worthy read for the
bibliography alone), Ascher begins in her own backyard: Central
Park. Ignoring the plaints of her daughter, who asks if this is
``another menopause thing,'' Ascher determines to test Henry David
Thoreau's theory that ``it takes a man of genius to travel in his
own country, in his native village; to make any progress between
his door and his gate.''
</P>
<P>
   She joins a band of birders and stalks a long-eared owl that
sleeps in a spruce tree near the 79th Street traverse and the
canyons of success on Fifth Avenue. The birder seem perched at the
exact intersection of nature's wild bramble and the hemmed-in
hustling city. Like 19th-century Romantics and Transcendentalists,
she writes, the birders have ``open minds, sharp eyes, uninhibited
imaginations and available souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ascher notes: ``They heeded the cry of their mentor Goethe,
whose Faust, finding himself imprisoned by intellect, sought
experience as an escape from institutional learning into vaster
knowledge. `You must escape from this confining world!' '' Ascher
sanctifies the mundane: owl, tree, life; faith, mystery, surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Although it begins with nature, ``Dancing in the Dark'' doesn't
neglect the more civilized pleasures and patterns in places like
Madrid and Venice. Some of her adventures owe more to the
journalists' trade than the philosophers', but they keep the book
from being too heavy. Her day with the pastry chef at Le Cirque in
Manhattan serves as kind of an intermezzo, amid musings on Keats,
Virgil, and the Barbizon painters.
</P>
<P>
   Ascher also gives glimpses of her own rich family life. When she
travels to Los Angeles to interview director Sydney Pollack, ``the
king of foreplay,'' it is partly at her daughter's behest.
(``Enough about Thoreau!'') She attends a birthday bash in the
Rainbow Room for her brother-in-law, magazine editor Dan Okrent,
and finds desire and yearning in the enduring calm of a long
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Andrea Marcovicci is flown in for the party; for Ascher,
the lyrics of Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern recall a golden age. If
her quotes from Hesiod feel a little forced, her larger point seems
to hold true: Cole Porter's tunes bring us closer to paradise than
the postmodern ethos of ``do it till you're satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Ascher's supple prose and catholic tastes certainly entertain.
But she also understands what it means to be an outsider, forever
trying to apprehend the mysterious order of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance is structured yearning,'' she writes early on. ``In
the romantic moment, we gather and focus that yearning in order to
connect with something outside ourselves, believing against all
odds that such connection is possible, knowing paradoxically that
romance is born in the space between our reach and our grasp.''
Sometimes, a long gaze at the thing apart unlocks a few sweet
secrets.

STYLISH ACTING IS SERVED WITH `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI'

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TEA WITH MUSSOLINI 
Directed by: Franco Zeffirelli 
Screenplay by: Zeffirelli and John Mortimer (from Zeffirelli's
autobiography) 
Starring: Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, Lily
Tomlin, Charlie Lucas, Baird Wallace, Massimo Ghini, Paolo Seganti,
Claudio Spadaro 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: PG (thematic elements, language, brief nudity and some mild
violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Tea with Mussolini'' is a pretty long tea and a pretty diffuse
one, but it's carried by its generous helpings of warmth and period
flavor. Essentially, it's Franco Zeffirelli's semiautobiographical
homage to a gaggle of eccentric British ladies and two expatriate
Americans residing in Florence between the wars. When they're not
turning Italy's cultural glories into the 20th century's first
theme park, they help a boy orphaned by the death of his unwed
mother and abandoned by his father, a Florentine dealer in British
textiles. The ensemble piece gives Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright,
and Judi Dench the chance to unfurl high feelings and high style
against which Cher's showgirl turned rich art collector and Lily
Tomlin's lesbian archeologist more than hold their own.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful Zeffirelli surrogate (Charlie Lucas as a boy, Baird
Wallace as a teen) understandably fades into the background, given
the formidable women. Even more formidable is the Tuscan
architecture, including the Renaissance orphanage from which
Plowright's gentlewoman plucks the orphan and installs him in her
own pensione. Because she must earn her living, she's the most
reality-oriented. But Dench's art devotee is no less humane and
helpful to the boy, if less well defined. Smith's snobby widow of a
diplomat, who refuses to entertain even the possibility that the
impending turbulence about to be ushered in by Mussolini will in
any way disturb her comfortably blinkered routine, mostly holds
center stage, treating it as a natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   This gives her something in common with Mussolini. Yes, there is
a tea. Shamelessly milking her late husband's connection, she
elbows her way into the dictator's company with the other ladies in
tow, as well as a newspaper reporter. For the sake of public
image-buffing, Claudio Spadaro's thuggishly polite Mussolini
reassures the Englishwoman that she may consider herself under his
personal protection. It's all she needs to hear. But of course it
isn't true. As the Black Shirts step up their terrorism, the women
find their insulated lives knocked out from under them, culminating
with the throwing of their tea tables off the balustrade of the
Ufizzi Gallery and, once war is declared, their internment.
</P>
<P>
   The obtuseness of Smith's character slides into caricature after
a while. Dench's character never is allowed to take on much depth,
unlike that of Plowright, who is as warm as she is shrewd. Cher
makes a strong impression as the headstrong wife of an absent rich
man, and Tomlin impresses with her easy authority, too. Perhaps
inevitably, the film becomes a vehicle for the women rather than
the fully dimensioned emotional experience it could have been by
including the Italians. The celebration of the ladies' eccentricity
and character sweeps before it any attempt at a deeper take on the
emotions detonated by the war. Zeffirelli is content to allow his
younger self to stand back and the let the women carry the film.
It's more a portrait gallery than the rich landscape it could have
been. Still, it's impossible not to savor the veteran actresses'
style and finesse.

MEEHAN SHOULD KEEP HIS WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admittedly, we have come to expect a lot from Marty Meehan, the
congressman with the delightfully ordinary personality and the
extraordinary ability to drive pivotal issues onto the national
stage. Perhaps, it now seems, we expect too much.
</P>
<P>
   In six years in Congress, he has emerged as the savviest, most
significant member of the state's congressional delegation. He has
been lauded by President Clinton for his work on tobacco regulation
and campaign finance reform. He is already a looming force in the
2002 gubernatorial race _ his prospects second only to Joseph
Kennedy and far ahead of Governor Paul Cellucci, who appears
unintentionally committed to serving a single term.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the last week, it has become painfully apparent that
too much of Meehan's politics is born of convenience rather than
conviction, that he is not a man of his word, that he has rendered
himself just another untrustworthy politician in an age when a dose
of trust is so urgently needed in the body politic.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when he defeated an incumbent from his own
Democratic Party, Meehan rode the trendy term limits issue for all
it was worth, pledging that, if elected, he would serve just eight
years in the House. ``It's bad to have members of Congress who are
absolutely desperate to get reelected,'' he told voters. ``I want
to do my job and do it well and then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is precisely this: He did his job and did it well,
but now he refuses to get out. Rather than adhere to a promise that
helped him win election, he reversed course last weekend and said
he plans to seek a fifth two-year term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will realize that someone can change their mind or make
a mistake,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, at 42, has tasted power and glory, and like so many
thousands of congressmen who have come before him, has decided he
can't get enough. He has, in short, become the politician against
which he once railed.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to break his promise, he has committed intellectual
back-flips. He claims not to have realized the crucial role of
seniority in the House, even though it would have been obvious to
him when he worked for Representative James Shannon in the early
1980s. He now says his success mandates his continued tenure.
</P>
<P>
   His decision has been met with curious support among a community
of political followers who have grown absurdly tolerant of lies and
broken pledges. His hometown paper, the Lowell Sun, ran an
editorial this month pleading with him to run. Two of my esteemed
colleagues on the Globe's op-ed page lauded his decision in
Sunday's paper. This newspaper published an editorial in January
urging him to break his promise, saying he should ``show the
independence and common sense voters have come to expect of him.''
Independence from those pesky commitments?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, term limits, especially unilaterally imposed ones, are
a profoundly foolish idea. The conveniently converted Meehan is
right when he recently said it is voters who should have the right
to decide who their representative should be.
</P>
<P>
   Equally truthful is this: Meehan's been a terrific congressman,
both for his district and for the national causes that he's
championed. His name stands on the seminal campaign finance reform
bill of the decade. Though it has failed in the House, it spurred a
national conversation on the dire need for fundamental change in
the way candidates raise money.
</P>
<P>
   But that's irrelevant to the issue at hand. Meehan made a
promise in the heat of a political campaign because he thought it
would help him win. He repeated it often, even signing a gimmicky
letter of resignation four years ago postdated to January 2000 that
haunts him today.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his decision last week, trust in politicians could
not have been lower, thanks to a president who treats the truth as
he treats his wife, which is to say with no respect at all.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan could have decided to keep his word to re-instill a
measure of trust between the nation and politicians. He could have
stood down for two years then run again. He could have begun the
spadework for a statewide campaign. He could have entered the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't. He succumbed. The temptation of power is
overwhelming. The Democrats may recover control of the House next
year. Meehan may need his congressional perch to pad his $1.1
million war chest for a gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan may yet be governor or senator. God knows, he has the
talent and ambition. But I'll always think of what else he could
have been. He could have been a man of his word at a time when we
needed one most. He'll never be that again.

<P>
   BOSTON -- In a murderous attack on three American outposts in
Korea in March 1953, 3,500 communist Chinese forces virtually wiped
out 120 Marines trying to hold three hilltop positions northeast of
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the hills, a Navy hospital corpsman from Dorchester,
Joseph Francis Keenan, continued to treat casualties, though he had
been blinded and struck by shrapnel four times within four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan, who had just turned 20, died while caring for others on
that dusty hill thousands of miles from home. His superior officer,
Dr. William Beaven, a battle surgeon, nominated him for the
congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy sent Keenan's body home in a flag-draped coffin, and it
arrived the ``day of the 1953 Worcester tornado,'' his younger
brother, Mike Keenan, remembered. But, though he had received a
Purple Heart for his injuries, the Medal of Honor never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Mike Keenan, an elevator repairman from
Hanover, set out to win his beloved big brother the recognition he
deserved. He searched records, researched military documents,
interviewed veterans who had been in Korea with him, and gathered
letters his brother had written his parents 46 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his case to the Navy. After a six-month
investigation, the merit of the case was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday (May 14) Mike Keenan's persistence was rewarded. At
ceremonies at the Marine Corps barracks in Washington, his country
honored Hospital Corpsman 3d Class Joseph F. Keenan with the Navy
Cross, the second highest military award the nation bestows.
</P>
<P>
   The family is content Joe Keenan is finally being remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty wonderful about this,'' Keenan said Thursday.
``The beauty of this award is not that it is just my brother, but
all the people he served with.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, no one knows for certain why the Navy failed to
award the medal. And nobody has been able to locate the original
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Polley of Georgetown, Ky., a corpsman who was temporarily
blinded in the same battles as Keenan, Thursday remembered the
confusion and casualties that marked the end of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about 78 percent casualties,'' said Polley, who was
also awarded the Navy Cross. ``About 10 or 15 people got
battlefield decorations every day. Joe's brother fought very hard
for this and Joe certainly deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after receiving word from the Navy about Joe's death, the
Keenan family was not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy telegram said he was dead, but two of his buddies
wrote us that he had been wounded. My parents finally got
confirmation (of Joe's death) from the office of John F. Kennedy,
who was then a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan recalled the day the telegram came.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother called my father at work. We lived on Mather Street
in Dorchester, about a block from the T station, and I could see
the tears in my father's eyes as he walked home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keenan began his labor of brotherly love in 1982 when he
received the letters Joe had sent from Korea to their parents. He
did other things. He went to reunions in Washington of Fox 25, the
Marine unit Joe had served with.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them mentioned my brother's name,'' he said. ``Another
said he had seen a card file of people who had received the
congressional Medal of Honor. There was a card with my brother's
name, but nothing else on it. I wrote to Dr. Beaven in Saudi
Arabia, and he said he had nominated my brother for the medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Keenan had only been in Korea a month when he was killed. A
letter to his parents on Feb. 25, 1953, was prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrived here on Feb. 13,'' he wrote. ``It's a good thing I'm
not superstitious. Many boys here will awake tomorrow with either
both arms or legs missing. They asked for a volunteer corpsman to
go up to evac. some patients. I said I'd go but didn't realize what
I said till after I was in the halftrack, but then I got scared. I
went up the hill but when I got there it was too late so I came
back to the aid station. I loaded eight or nine cases on the
`copters' bay. They sure are life-saving machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Keenan family and former war comrades of Joe Keenan at
the ceremony Friday was the nephew named for him, Joseph F. Keenan,
33, of Cohasset.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I always looked up to my brother, Joe,'' Mike Keenan
said. ``He'll always be my hero.''

IF MEEHAN BREAKS HIS TERM-LIMIT PROMISE, WHO CAN TRUST HIM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Power is an aphrodisiac. At its most seductive, it causes you to
fall in love with yourself.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain Marty Meehan's love affair with Marty
Meehan?
</P>
<P>
   Meehan is the Democrat who last week notified his Massachusetts
constituents he will run for a fifth congressional term despite his
pledge to serve only four two-year terms. He made the pledge when
he first ran for Congress in 1992 and reiterated his commitment
numerous times since, even putting it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I be elected to serve more than two additional terms in
the US House of Representatives following the 104th Congress, by
this letter I hereby resign and direct you to remove my name
permanently from the roll of the members,'' Meehan wrote in a 1995
letter filed with the House clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Again in 1998, it was reported by the organization US Term
Limits that Meehan had reaffirmed his term-limit pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change of heart in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Well, more than one political operative believes Meehan's change
of heart came long before 1999. The reform candidate for Congress
took the pledge, realized soon enough he would ultimately break it
and should have stamped the letter sent to the House clerk with the
words: ``Return to sender. This is filed for publicity purposes
only and should not be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, that is not Meehan's view. He calls his promise
``boneheaded'' and a mistake but one he gave in good faith. He also
says it was never intended to be a central part of his 1992
campaign. As for his decision to reiterate it in writing, he
describes that action as a drastic step taken to force the
Republican leadership to take an up-or-down vote on term limits.
</P>
<P>
   His disingenuousness is distressing.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face facts. Political expedience shaped Meehan's decision
when he first ran for Congress just as it shapes it now. Meehan
wants us to view his pledge as the misjudgment of a political
neophyte. But it is clear he made it with absolute calculation,
opting to tap into the tide of public opinion at a given point in
time to benefit his own ambition.
</P>
<P>
   As he acknowledged last week in a letter to constituents:
(itals)``In response to overwhelming sentiment,(unitals) I
developed a campaign that focused on job creation, deficit
reduction, and congressional reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney Frank, the veteran Democratic Massachusetts congressman,
recently told The Wall Street Journal that breaking a term limits
promise is ``the worst kind of lie to the people _ you have traded
this pledge for their vote.'' Frank was talking about a cast of
Republicans who have made term-limit vows. Later, when asked
specifically about Meehan, Frank said Meehan, too, should abide by
his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Meehan's original intent, it is obvious that for a
while now he has been looking for a way to break his word as
painlessly as possible. Over the past year or so, he made the
rounds in Massachusetts asking for advice, support _ and, as
always, for money. With $1.1 million in his campaign fund, this
champion of campaign finance reform is considered the most
aggressive fundraiser in the Massachusetts delegation.
</P>
<P>
   More than one person told Meehan privately to keep his pledge
and leave Washington. It would make him a true national political
story: a politician whose word is good.
</P>
<P>
   But like legions of incumbents before him, Meehan now considers
himself too important to leave. After four terms, he can't imagine
Congress without him in it and points to his experience and
seniority as pluses for his constituents. Now he believes members
of Congress need at least two terms ``to learn the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when he won election in 1992, Meehan was the guy who
challenged and defeated incumbent Representative Chester Atkins,
who at the time was the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and
Means Committee. Meehan was the guy who said, ``It's bad for the
country to have members of Congress who are absolutely desperate to
get reelected. I don't want to spend 20 years in Washington. I want
to do my job and do it well and then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Meehan is the insider sticking around Washington. His
decision raises an array of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't he at least be honest about the political decision he
made in 1992 and the one he is making now?
</P>
<P>
   If seniority is good for Meehan and the constituents of the 5th
Congressional District, is it still bad for others? Are only
liberals entitled to the benefits of seniority?
</P>
<P>
   If he does not want to hurt his constituents by depriving them
of the services of a veteran congressman, how much time does he owe
them now? How will he explain a decision to abandon the district
and run for another office, such as governor?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, when should voters take him at his word?
</P>

LAWSUITS IN STEREO: BOSE V. KLOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the same age, and enjoy the same ``power ranking'' on
Boston magazine's current list of 100 most powerful Bostonians. But
the magazine forgot to mention one thing: They're always suing each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The men in question are audio bigwigs Henry Kloss (the K in KLH,
stereo of choice for '60s-era stoners) and Amar Bose, founder of
the Bose Corp. Kloss is the founder of Newton's Cambridge
SoundWorks, which Bose sued five years ago for claiming that its
speakers were ``better than Bose at half the price.'' That suit was
settled. Since then, Bose has hauled CSW into court for alleged
patent violations. Late last month, CSW counter-sued, claiming that
Framingham-based Bose is making false advertising claims when it
hypes its Wave table radio as the best-reviewed in its field. CSW
insists its own Model 88 is superior, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   How much do these two legendary entrepreneurs dislike each
other? ``There's no personal edge at all,'' Kloss assures me.
``Amar has a history of litigiousness.'' Kloss recalls that Bose
pursued a suit against Consumer Reports for 14 years, all the way
to the Supreme Court, ``largely for egotistical reasons as far as I
can explain.'' (The suit concerned a review that criticized Bose's
901 speaker system. The Supreme Court threw out a libel award Bose
won in a lower court.) When it comes to suing, Bose ``has the
money, he has the ego, and he has a competent attorney'' _ that
would be Fish &AMP; Richardson lawyer Charles Hieken _ Kloss says. ``We
call (the company) junkyard dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But remember, there's nothing personal about this.
</P>
<P>
   Bose does have a reputation for suing. In a forthcoming
commentary on the Bose-CSW lawsuits in the Boston Audio Society's
newsletter, audiophile David Moran writes: ``You might think
veteran Bose legal watchdog Charles Hieken might get tired of such
predictable snarling after 30 years of it, but the obnoxious Bose
style remains indefatigable.'' A few years ago, Bose threatened to
sue a tiny Peterborough, N.H.-based publisher called Audio Amateur
over an alleged patent violation, then backed off. ``We were sort
of hoping they might do it,'' says company president Ed Dell, whose
lawyers advised him that the Bose suit was meritless. ``It would
have put us on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   On legal matters, Hieken runs interference for his MIT
classmate, longtime colleague, and friend Amar Bose. Accusations of
predatory litigation ``are unfair,'' Hieken says in a faxed
response to my inquiry. ``Bose attempts to resolve disputes
amicably.'' He correctly notes that the Supreme Court did not
disagree with Bose's claim that the Consumer Reports review was
damaging; the court held that Bose could not prove it had been
libeled. Concerning its latest anti-CSW action, Hieken writes that
``Bose tried to amicably resolve the . . . case before bringing
suit.''

   Is there such a thing as nice payback? I think so. Or perhaps it
is just coincidence that an unnamed Boston Globe music critic makes
a cameo appearance in Vikram Seth's new novel, ``An Equal Music.''
Globe music critic Richard Dyer reviewed Seth's previous novel, ``A
Suitable Boy,'' and liked it a lot . . . Why does the already
famous, well-connected, and terrifying Robert Popeo of Mintz Levin
want to be head of the 8,300-member Boston Bar Association? Popeo
is starting the wearisome climb through the BBA hierarchy. Having
served as BBA secretary, he is now seeking the association's vice
presidency. There are still two rungs above him: president-elect
and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this for me,'' says Popeo, who points out that
his eventual assumption of the BBA presidency is not a sure thing.
``Lawyers from major firms should participate in a leadership role,
or organizations like the bar association lose prestige and
influence.'' Perhaps, like John Curtin and the late Robert Meserve
before him, Popeo will use the BBA as a springboard to the
presidency of the American Bar Association. Stranger things have
happened.

LITTLE RISK OF ABUSE SEEN FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY MEDICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A condition called ``social anxiety disorder'' this week joined
the long list of downers in life _ including obesity, impotence,
and depression _ that Americans once commonly saw as challenges of
willpower and character but can now have treated by popping a pill.
</P>
<P>
   The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Paxil, a
popular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive
disorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may
conjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before
speaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   But area specialists stressed Thursday that the pill will work
only for treating the kind of acute, irrational shyness that
devastates people's careers and social lives. Anyone who thinks
taking one to feel more confident or convivial in a special
occasion, they said, will have trouble getting a prescription
filled and is bound to be disappointed if they try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about people who are a little anxious about
giving a talk or business presentation or feeling a little nervous
about meeting strangers,'' said Dr. Mark Pollack, director of the
Anxiety Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Pollack and others said, acute social anxiety involves
such intense and irrational levels of shyness that it leads people
to shun others, avoid seeking promotions at work, drop out of
school, or feel terror at the prospect of signing a check in public
or using a public restroom. Some people resort to alcohol or drugs
to stave off the feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Paxil is the first drug approved by the FDA specifically for
treating social anxiety disorder. Epidemiological studies have
found that acute social anxiety is the third most common
psychiatric disorder in the United States after depression and
alcoholism, affecting up to 13 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Paxil, from the class of psychiatric drugs called selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft, must
be taken for several weeks before patients see a marked change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get any effect if you take one now and then,'' said
Dr. Jonathan Cole of McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., a Harvard
psychiatry professor and pioneer in the field of psychoactive drugs
who has worked in the field since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been widespread reports of people abusing
Viagra in hopes of enhancing their sexual performance, or taking
prescription weight-loss drugs intended for the morbidly obese just
to shed 15 pounds, Cole sees little likelihood of social
wallflowers abusing Paxil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't likely to be abused by anyone, because they don't
work that way,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of
America and a private-practice clinical social worker in
Washington, said she hopes a publicity blitz planned by Paxil
manufacturer SmithKline Beecham will raise awareness of social
anxiety disorder and lead more people to seek help, which could
include psychotherapy instead of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs have boomed
into a $7 billion-a-year global market, with Paxil second only to
Prozac in sales, but analysts disagree over how large a market
Paxil might find for treating social anxiety disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social phobia has been so grossly underdiagnosed and
undertreated,'' Ross said. She has seen patients who wake up every
morning tallying with dread the people they will have to say
``hello'' to during the day, hate eating lunch with anyone, or who
will only go to the supermarket late at night because they want to
minimize encountering other shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are living in a constant state of nightmare,''
Ross said. ``All of us from time to time feel shy, and there are
situations where it is natural and healthy to feel uncomfortable,
but this is a situation where the shyness is so intense and
pervasive that the person makes very negative changes in their life
to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul K. Ling, a clinical psychologist, said he fears that ``a
great mistake would be a reliance on Paxil alone'' or pressure by
health plans to push Paxil as a cheaper alternative to therapy.
Many people, he said, can have their social anxiety eased by
exercises that help them see many of their fears are groundless or
irrational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel ambivalent about the approval of this use of Paxil,
because there is the danger that it is just another example of how
we are moving toward a pop-a-pill culture,'' Ling said.
</P>

   However, Pollack of the MGH said the much greater danger is not
that people will try to abuse Paxil, but that people with social
anxiety disorder will not seek help ``when they have something that
is treatable, and they can do better and function better in life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a still-sleepy Courtney Love whose familiar voice comes
over the phone line early one morning from Cincinnati. It's the
first day of her band Hole's tour, a swing that stops Sunday night
at the Orpheum Theatre for a sold-out-in-a-day show.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' says Love, yawning, ``you have me when I am so
vulnerable. I just woke up. I am not all sharp and facile. I was
just dreaming about having a crush on somebody and it was very
inappropriate _ you know, somebody you have a crush on but it's
very inappropriate. But it was such a nice dream. . . . This was
totally cerebral, absolutely romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be impolite to ask whom it concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot ask and I won't tell,'' she says, ``but I will tell
you that it is really, really inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I have my social controls on. At least I have learned
some boundaries. At least I can say it is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Love: a tease, even when she's half asleep. If you know
anything about her, you know that when she is on, she might,
metaphorically speaking, bestow upon you a dozen roses or rip you
to shreds with her verbal machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   Love, 33, is both a celebrity and a musician. On Hole's latest
album, ``Celebrity Skin,'' that's a theme, how her world is
balanced or not balanced. Love started out as a rock 'n' roll
hanger-on and moved quickly up the food chain. She became known
primarily as Kurt Cobain's spotlight-stealing drug-sharing partner,
girlfriend, and, later, wife, and the mother of their child,
Frances Bean. It was after Cobain's suicide in the spring of 1993
that her star shot into the stratosphere, just as Hole's second CD,
``Live Through This,'' came out. The album spawned a slew of hits,
including ``Miss World'' and ``Doll Parts.''
</P>
<P>
   People say she's a loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a loose cannon,'' she says. ``I don't think I have
ever been much of a loose cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reference point: the snarling line ``I am the girl that lies and
lies and lies,'' a key passage in ``Miss World.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Love is the remade and remodeled controversial figure of
concert stage and screen. On stage, she'll drop her top and cuss
like a pirate if the spirit moves. On screen, she first appeared in
the 1986 movie ``Sid and Nancy'' and got an Oscar nomination for
playing the drug-addled sex bomb Althea in the 1996 movie ``The
People vs. Larry Flynt.'' She also became the unwilling and
unsympathetic subject of ``Kurt and Courtney,'' Nick Broomfield's
film that raised serious questions about the role she may have
played in her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is it, she is asked, that Hole brings to the party?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Love, ``I want to play with whatever I want to
play with, whatever energies I want to play with. There is a lot of
romance and there has always been a lot of romance. And there is a
lot of rage, and I don't think that people in our culture really
are used to rage and romance existing inside a female body, one
that's a celebrity or a musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about it last night. I was rehearsing last
night and I just thought it was really so weird. . . . I was
figuring out how to write a Korn song and we were sort of jamming
in this really easy key, and it was actually very satisfying. I was
missing being able to write in a Polly Harvey `I like it rough /
You know what I mean / Spread your black wings / I wring your neck,
baby' way. I hadn't written one like that in a while and I really
wanted to write one. But they're really dated, like an old blues
riff.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Hole audience packing this string of shows, who
might be hearing this band soon? The gentlefolk at Lilith Fair. No
lie. Finally, a brash in-your-face band on Lilith's main stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, right,'' says Love. ``We're doing five dates for
sure.'' It's uncertain whether the Tweeter Center date will be part
of it. Love says her new pal Sheryl Crow turned her on to the idea.
``I think it's wonderful and it should be a really fun, interesting
crowd to mess with. I will make them take to us. I can make anyone
take to us, but it is about acclimation, what energies you want to
play with.'' Love threatens noisy 10-minute reworkings of Hole
songs and Sonic Youth covers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hole, which had been coheadlining with Marilyn Manson, left the
tour last month. Problems ranged from staging difficulties to
unresponsive audiences to Love and Manson sniping at each other in
public. Love says she thought the tour might work, given that the
two bands played together _ and got on well _ in Australia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare, horrible and negative,'' says Love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smart . . . if you know it's not working, to stop while
you're ahead before you destroy yourselves or lose tons of money,''
explains Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson, on the phone from Kansas
City, Mo., a few days after we talked with Love. ``It was presented
to us in a way it looked good _ we were friends with them, still
are, we'll run into each other and it'll be fine _ but it was a
weird mix, like R.E.M. opening for Twisted Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Love: ``I only believe in romantic comedy. I don't know why
I was forced into what I want to call this lowbrow melodrama, but
it was even less than that. It was much more burlesque. I believe
in drama, but I have never believed in wrestling, and, somehow
through different circumstances and different people's agendas, I
found myself in this wrestling circus.''
</P>
<P>
   The males _ and a Manson audience is largely male _ did not
fully appreciate Hole's less theatrical, punk-inclined,
femalecentric pop-punk. They came, says Love, ``to see the crosses
burn, to see a spectacle, to see the DRUGS sign (that Manson
employs), and to see his butthole. I have no problem with that
crowd, except there is nothing I can do to help them.'' They see
Hole and ``all they do is go, `She's prettier than I thought and,
um, they kind of rock and they remind me of Lita Ford. I think that
she is probably pretty cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hole, Erlandson says, has been getting a blast out of this
theater tour (the other members are bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur
and new drummer Samantha Maloney): ``We're having a great time. The
audience is incredible. There are a lot of young girls that are
totally into it; the whole vibe is completely different. We're able
to be a little bit looser; we can play any song at any time, whip
out a cover. (Listen for the Beatles' ``You've Got to Hide Your
Love Away'' and the Standells' ``Dirty Water,'' among others.)
</P>
<P>
   With Love, you don't know if she's going to sing, rant, make a
joke, or lift her shirt. ``I like to play with an audience,'' says
Love. ``I like to find out what the key to the audience is,
although I am sort of sick of manipulating audiences _ maybe the
audience needs to manipulate me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney,'' says Erlandson, ``is probably one of the greatest
front people in the history of rock.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality and sexuality are on Love's ever-active mind.
</P>
<P>
   She's flashed more than a few audiences, Boston ones among them,
over the years. ``The first few times, I did that,'' she says,
``there was actually an organic reason. (Recently) during `Northern
Star' I took off my shirt so I was, like, you know, bare-breasted
singing this really bare song _ saying there is nothing evasive,
there is no manipulation, there are no pop hooks. I thought it was
a confluence.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Erlandson, of Love's stage demeanor: ``When she swerves, I
think it's a good thing. If she's emoting that's always good. So
many front people don't have much of that spark; they just walk
onstage and play. Sometimes, lately, with Courtney, I've been
going, `Hmmm, where am I?' But that's fine. We want to create our
own riptide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hole formed in 1989. Before fame came a-knocking, Hole's sound
was defiantly rough and grungy on its debut disc, ``Pretty on the
Inside.'' ``We were playing Joni Mitchell and Journey covers and
Fleetwood Mac covers on our first album,'' says Erlandson. That's
not true, but what he means is this: ``I always thought there were
these well-crafted pop elements, but we weren't skilled enough to
pull that off at the time, and we were more into deconstructing
things. (Over time) it's been a process of peeling away the layers.
A pop core has always been there, but it had this muck on top of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity Skin'' is a cleaner record _ still cynical at times,
but certainly with more hope than on ``Live Through This.'' It took
a lot of work in the studio and helping hands from Smashing
Pumpkins' Billy Corgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted get this pure, well-crafted sound,'' says Erlandson,
``but we didn't want to lose the edge. We're not studio musicians.
I'm not like a guitar player's guitar player, a muso guy. I have
this quirky rough way I play. But for me to force myself into that
(studio role) helped us out. Same with Melissa. We overreached.
It's still us, but it's slicker 'cause we were trying hard to play
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Love answers a question about her motivation _ be it movies or
music _ this way: ``I get really energized when I talk to people
that really have a muse, and I have a muse. If I didn't have the
ability to play music, I'd go nuts. I would be really hostile and
really angry. As I said, I have a great love of romantic comedy,
and I put it into this thing. I can't explain it to you. How do
people like (editor) Tina Brown _ who I don't like and for a really
basic reason (Vanity Fair reported Love used heroin while pregnant,
which Love disputes) _ who is a boomer, who looks at a rock person
and says, `There is no way that person can be as smart as me, there
is no way that that person is bringing anything in. I picked on her
a couple of seasons ago, so it's boring, but as an example, there
is no way that that person threatens my status quo, because they
are from the burlesque or from vaudeville. I don't consider rock
'n' roll vaudeville.''

THE CASTLE 
Directed by: Rob Stich 
Screenplay by: Stich, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy 
Starring: Michael Caton, Anne Tenney, Stephen Curry, Anthony
Simcoe, Sophie Lee, Tiriel Mora, Charles Tingwell 
Running time: 85 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sits on a toxic waste dump alongside Melbourne's airport
runway, and as for its decor, don't ask. It's not much of a house,
really. But it's all the home Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) and
his family need. When the local government wants to bulldoze the
Kerrigans off it to expand the airport, the ordinarily cheery
Darryl gets mad and decides he's not going to take it. That's all
the premise that's needed to launch Rob Stich's ``The Castle,'' a
winning Aussie mix of Frank Capra and John Waters.
</P>
<P>
   First, the airport dealmakers try bribery. Then they try
intimidation. Then they find themselves sneering down their noses
in court at Darryl, who goes to bat for his family and neighbors,
but with an endearingly, hilariously inept lawyer (Tiriel Mora)
who's the first to admit that he's in over his head. To argue his
case, he doesn't cite legal precedents, relying instead on what he
takes to be the vibes underlying Australia's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Castle'' is too resolutely benevolent to leave it at
that. It brings in a ringer who meets Darryl on the sidewalk
outside the court, takes a liking to him, and turns out to be a
constitutional law authority much better equipped to do battle with
the well-heeled establishment on behalf of the little guys. You'll
likely like Darryl too, if only because it's difficult to imagine
anyone disliking him. He's a loving family man, warm and sunny and
filled with admiration at his wife's mastery of such mouthwatering
staples as meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle,'' in short, is a film that has only one big
moral-esthetic decision to make, and it resoundingly makes the
right one. It must have been tempting to get snide about the
Kerrigans' plasticized decor, souvenir beer mugs, oversize TV
antenna, and other lapses in taste. But ``The Castle'' isn't the
film to equate good taste with goodness, and its celebration of
happy family closeness makes it easy to buy into its feel-good
mode. It would rather err on the side of sentimentality than
snobbery. Led by Caton's undentable optimism as Darryl, it's got
just the cast to convince you there was no other way to go.

`THREE SEASONS'' POSTWAR VIETNAM TREADS GENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THREE SEASONS 
Directed and written by: Tony Bui 
Starring: Don Duong, Ngoc Hiep, Tran Minh Cuong, Harvey Keitel, Zoe
Bui, Nguyen Huu Duco, Minh Ngoc, Hoang Phat Trieu 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Bui's ``Three Seasons'' paints a delicate picture of the
grueling lives of four inhabitants of modern-day Saigon. The first
American independent feature to be filmed in present-day Vietnam,
it's a four-track look at the lives of a prostitute, a cyclo
driver, a young boy working as a street peddler and a young woman
working as a lotus harvester. Although it was American-produced and
Harvey Keitel, who helped produce it, stars as an ex-Marine driven
by conscience to seek out the daughter he fathered years ago,
``Three Seasons'' doesn't present Vietnam as a product of the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fissures opened by that conflict still can be felt,
it suggests the lives of working-class Vietnamese have always been
arduous. While teeming and steeped in poverty, the streets of Ho
Chi Minh City, nevertheless, seem less meaner than their American
equivalents. Part of it is Bui's inclination to tread lightly, with
visuals that emphasize the subtle sunset tints, shots through rain
and proverbial lotus-blossom gentleness. Actually, it's the last
that ushers in the closest thing to shock theater, as Ngoyen Ngoc
Hiep's harvester in a lotus pond owned by a reclusive poet, learns
his story after being ushered into his intimidating presence in a
beauty-and-the-beast replay.
</P>
<P>
   In less discreet hands the love story between Don Duong's ardent
cyclo driver and Zoe Bui's sad prostitute would disintegrate into
cliche, and the Dickensian chapter built around the stolen
merchandise of the street kid (Nguyen Huu Doc) would dissolve in
sentimental bathos. So would the quest of the ex-Marine driven by
guilt and a belated surge of paternal feeling. There's much that's
absorbing in this film starring mostly Vietnamese actors, but the
film in the end seems a bit like the Marine's quest, vague and
rudderless, in search of an imperative, or even a narrative, to
give it shape and purpose. It's great on atmosphere, but it seems
in the end no more than a screenful of the ingredients of a
compelling film, never quite combined to become the film it could
have been.

ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was 17, it wasn't an overly good year until I discovered
a singer named Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that I was a raging rock 'n' roll fan. Frank Sinatra,
who died a year ago today &UR;  &LR; (May 14), had captivated me with the
voice that said so much. And there was that ring-a-ding-ding,
world-on-a-string persona, too. I bought my first-ever long-playing
album, ``Songs for Swinging' Lovers'' (I, of course, was anything
but). Then I bought ``In the Wee Small Hours'' and played it until
it was all skips and scratches. Who knew that these two albums
would be the foundation of a collection that one day would grow to
gargantuan proportions?
</P>
<P>
   When I was 21, I had accumulated a small but significant
collection of Sinatra LPs, including more of his magical Capitol
albums, some of his earlier songs on Columbia, and an album or two
on the new label that he founded, Reprise.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 35, I may have been less enchanted with the Sinatra
lifestyle but was more captivated than ever by the music. That's
because audiocassettes and eight-track tapes had come on the
market. Whatever their faults, they didn't scratch. So I began
replacing some of my favorite Sinatra LPs (and by now they were
many), mostly with cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm in the autumn of my years (well, maybe the late
summer) and pristine-sounding compact discs are the recordings of
choice, I've done what I had to do: quietly accumulated virtually
everything Sinatra officially recorded _ some 1,500 different
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   That, to my knowledge, is all of his authorized studio vocal
recordings on all of his major US labels and all of his officially
released live songs. Also in the collection are a couple of dozen
discs of sometimes muddy quality and dubious legality, adding a
couple of hundred songs culled from Sinatra's radio and TV
broadcasts and stage shows.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's a lot of albums; yes, there are also several
repeats; yes, there are different versions of the same song; and
yes, there are flaws in a few. Some may consider this extreme, and
I can't deny it.
</P>
<P>
   How did I do it? One of the wonderful things about compact discs
is that they have inspired record labels to release box sets of an
artist's complete recordings. After Sinatra died, an incomplete
collection seemed, well, just not complete. I already had all of
the chairman's Capitol albums (16 discs, 255 songs, his best work)
except a couple in which he only conducts. But now available were
his complete recordings with Tommy Dorsey on RCA (5 discs, 120
songs), all of his Columbia studio recordings (12 discs, 285
songs), his V-Discs, recorded for those serving abroad during World
War II (2 discs, 53 songs), all of his Capitol singles (4 discs, 96
songs), and all of his Reprise records (20 discs, 450 songs). My
checkbook was cringing.
</P>
<P>
   And how do I play so many records? With a 60-disc Panasonic
stereo that holds most (but hardly all) of my collection. Almost
every night, when the non-Sinatra fans are fast sleep, I turn on
the stereo and press the ``random'' button, which selects a song or
two from all the albums in no particular order. There's a young,
thin, silky-voiced Sinatra singing with the Harry James and Tommy
Dorsey bands. There's a slightly older but still skinny Sinatra,
warbling the tender tunes that made the girls go gaga at the
Paramount. There's the fedora-wearing Sinatra of the 1950s, his
rich baritone letting you in on the sorrows and joys that
accompanied his fall from popularity and his return to the top of
the heap. There's the older and heavier Sinatra, past his peak but
nonetheless sounding better than any other pop singer. And finally,
there's the old man, the pipes badly rusted but the singer still
worth listening to because he is, after all, still Sinatra. Through
it all, there are the marvelous musicians behind the man: Stordahl
and Riddle, Costa and May, Ellington and Basie.
</P>
<P>
   This is the music of my life and so many other lives. I regret
none of the time spent accumulating the records, tapes, and discs,
and none of the expense. There is one thing, though: My wife
doesn't fully realize the extent, and thus the cost, of my
collection. If she reads this article, the title of an early
Sinatra song will be most appropriate: ``I'll Never Smile Again.''

<P>
   The only way to reconcile two terribly contradictory perceptions
about Mexico's current and future prospects circulating today is to
understand how deeply the country has been divided by the process
of change over the past decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The cleavages sundering Mexico have created not only two
countries, but two increasingly alienated societies.
</P>
<P>
   A booming export sector, concentrated in and looking to the
north, has taken off. It is competitive, efficient, dynamic and
outward-looking. Its inputs, credit, output and standards are all
U.S.-based.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Mexico _ where more than 80 percent of the nation's
100 million inhabitants live and work _ finds itself sinking into
political fragmentation, economic stagnation and social
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   The images and assessments arising from these two situations are
both accurate: The aggregate economic numbers, heavily influenced
by the export sector, are improving constantly; the pessimism and
chaos pervading the rest of the country reflect the growing
intractability of Mexico's underlying problems.
</P>
<P>
   The most characteristic and worrisome among them is that it is
virtually impossible for the country to agree on anything. For
decades _ if not for centuries _ Mexico lived under a regime of
consensus: mostly imposed through authoritarian means, on occasion
freely consented. But gridlock, whether it be regional, political
or social impasses, were infrequent, if not totally absent.
Mexicans agreed, or were forced to agree, on most issues facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the Carlos Salinas administration, Mexico carried
out dramatic changes in its development plans and policies without
serious dissent, or in any case without experiencing severe
consequences when silencing dissent through governmental nastiness
or heavy-handedness.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, which for better or for worse allowed the country to
experience half a century of political stability, economic growth
and social modernization, has obviously come to an end. As Mexico
enters the first truly uncertain presidential election in its
history, the country seems singularly devoid of any capacity or
inclination to agree on any conceivable question, important or
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   The examples are countless and revealing, and they range from
the truly substantive to the symbolic. Among the latter, the most
symptomatic are perhaps those related to the Power and Light
privatization project submitted by the government to the Congress a
couple of months ago, and the proposal to charge modest tuition
fees at the National University to those students able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   On both counts the proposals are arguable and reasonable;
sensible people can dislike them or find them beneficial for the
country. But instead of arousing a serious debate and negotiation
from which a long-term national consensus would emerge _ in one
direction or another _ the two initiatives have awakened passions
and fanned the flames of social discontent.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Mayday demonstrations were the most
anti-government, intense and well-attended in years. The
possibility of reaching closure and convergence is more remote than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the inability to decide has affected apparently minor
affairs. One involves time zones in the country, and the absurd
debate that took place in late March as to who would adopt daylight
savings time, and who would not, and why.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, some Mexican states adopted the hour change, and
others did not; some are on U.S. Central Time, some on Rocky
Mountain Time and some on Pacific Time, while the one that used to
go by Eastern Time _ Quintana Roo, where Cancun is located, decided
to go back to Central Time, perhaps because the drug traffickers
found it more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas wisely desisted from
heeding the calls of his rank-and-file and accepted the federal
government's decision to move clocks forward on April 1, it was
touch and go for several days, in the capital and in Guadalajara,
the country's second largest city. The country cannot even agree,
literally, on the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it figure out what to do with the 2 million, or perhaps
even 3 million, imported used cars circulating without valid
license plates, registration cards, insurance or inspection
controls. They were brought in over the years by migrants returning
from the United States, or by border state inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these mostly dilapidated vehicles entered Mexico with
temporary importation permits; they paid no taxes on entry, nor any
property levies like all other cars and trucks pay in Mexico. They
have all outstayed their welcome and their authorization. The local
automobile industry is up in arms over the prospect of regularizing
these imports. The inhabitants of the northern cities where they
are largely concentrated want some sort of amnesty and
after-the-fact legalization.
</P>
<P>
   The government is caught in a vicious cross-fire between
hundreds of thousands of owners who cannot afford the much more
expensive used cars available in Mexico, and others who feel
punished for having purchased their vehicles in Mexico and obeying
the law. The likelihood of any agreement in the near future is
close to nil.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's surprising macro-economic numbers are neither imaginary
nor artificial. But they cannot blot out the collapsing national
consensus on any issue of substance, in a country where, since time
immemorial, centrifugal forces have always threatened Mexican
cohesion. More than lower interest rates, higher exports, or more
foreign investment _ all necessary and desirable, of course _
Mexico today needs to craft the instruments for constructing new
broad agreements on at least basic matters, whether decisive or
inconsequential. Today it disagrees on both.

STARTING THE `PARTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Timing is everything, or so they say. And
Boston's Push Stars have waited for just the right moment to
release their major-label debut album, ``After the Party.'' Given
their buoyant, pure-pop sound, the Push Stars knew it had to be a
springtime release.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are out in the spring. They're feeling happy and
upbeat, which is what this record is about,'' bassist Dan
McLoughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   For all you shiny, happy people (no slur intended), get ready
for the Push Stars disc on May 18 from Capitol Record, followed by
a CD release party at the Paradise on May 22, then a national tour
with fellow popsters Better Than Ezra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of negativity in the music business right now,''
says McLaughlin. ``We feel music should be a completely positive
force. It should be uplifting and therapeutic. If we can get people
to listen to the record and say it makes them feel good, then
that's the ultimate payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The band accomplishes its purpose on the new CD, which is
sentimental but not treacly. It rocks with an uncommon glee and
breezy intelligence on guitar-stoked tracks such as ``Everything
Shines'' (which first appeared on the soundtrack to ``There's
Something About Mary''), ``Any Little Town'' (the first single),
and the humorous ``Drunk Is Better than Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs were written by Push Stars singer/guitarist Chris
Trapper, who grew up outside Buffalo, N.Y. He writes about boy
chasing girl, sometimes finding girl, sometimes losing girl, but
always with an engaging, indomitable spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much all of it is autobiographical,'' says Trapper, who
at 29 is the oldest band member. ``If I tried to write a song just
to be cool, I couldn't do it. It has to be honest. And I'm a white
guy from a country town outside of Buffalo, so that's what I write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Push Stars formed nearly four years ago. Trapper had left
another band and was working at the Copley Plaza Hotel as a
purchasing food clerk. His boss saw him writing song lyrics on box
tops and wine cases and told him to try music again. That struck
home with Trapper, who recruited upstate New York friend McLoughlin
(then an engineer at Dreamland Studios in Woodstock) and met
drummer Ryan MacMillan, after a gig MacMillan played at the Middle
East in Cambridge. ``Chris said, `I really like your playing.
You've got a nice feel,' '' notes MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
   The three Push Stars then began playing Tuesday nights at the
Common Ground in Allston, building things up from there. ``We've
played everywhere in town many times,'' says Trapper.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the band never had a rehearsal space, but worked out
song arrangements at shows and soundchecks. ``A band is based on
chemistry and trust _ and we've shared that,'' says Trapper.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the music stayed simple and concise, so it's no
surprise that the new album follows suit. ``It's a pop record _
three chords and the truth,'' says Trapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we have something,'' he adds. ``And it
feels good to bring that to the public now. More than ever, people
need something positive out there.''

IRELAND A SOMBER BACKDROP FOR `FATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THIS IS MY FATHER 
Directed and written by: Paul Quinn 
Starring: Aidan Quinn, James Caan, Jacob Tierney, Colm Meaney,
Donal Donnelly, Brendan Gleeson, Moira Deady, Moya Farrelly, Maria
McDermottroe, Gina Moxley, Eamonn Morriseey, Stephen Rea, John
Cusack, Susan Almgren, Pauline Hutton, Fiona Glascott 
Running time: 120 minutes 
Rated: R (a scene of sexuality and brief language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared to most of what we'll see this summer, ``This Is My
Father'' is radically unfashionable. It's a slow, dark, somber but
emotionally solid film that eventually repays the patience it takes
to stay with it. In more ways than one, it's a family film, with
the name Quinn all over it. Paul Quinn wrote and directed, brother
Declan photographed it, and it stars brother Aidan as a
pure-hearted but inarticulate farmer named Kieran. The farmer's
circumstances add up to a textbook case of the reasons young Irish
fled Ireland in the days before the current economic boom and
reverse brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   It's framed by the present-day search of James Caan's burned-out
suburban Chicago high school history teacher for his Irish roots
and, specifically, for the father he never knew. He's spurred on as
well by a need to revive the spirits of his aged mother, recovering
(or perhaps not) from a stroke. For good measure, and perhaps one
story strand more than the film can comfortably accommodate, he
takes his troubled nephew back with him. Before long, they're
installed in Colm Meaney's bed and breakfast, listening to the
proprietor's mother, a treasure trove of local lore, fill in the
blanks in the visitors' history each day at teatime.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film is given over to the troubled romance of
Quinn's laborer, regarded as a second-class citizen because he grew
up in an orphanage, and the lively young woman, Fiona, who takes a
shine to him. Moya Farrelly, the Irish actress who plays Fiona, is
a real find. She's spirited, beautiful, vivacious, and sincere. The
question is whether Fiona will be allowed to forget she's part of
the village gentry and pursue a romance with a man regarded as her
social inferior by her formidable widowed mother and as her moral
inferior by the fire-and-brimstone clergy, who between them hold
the village in an iron grip.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the Quinn brothers have called in a lot of favors from
good friends in the business. Such first-rate actors as Donal
Donnelly, Brendan Gleeson, John Cusack, and Stephen Rea fortify the
roster in small but flavorful roles. Caan hardly dominates as the
character whose inquiries set the story in motion. Yet ``This Is My
Father'' is anything but a vanity project. It's deeply felt and
gorgeously, if sometimes diffusely, photographed and acted. Aidan
Quinn gives the film the emotional core it needs as a passionate
but bottled-up man, and Farrelly gives the film its romantic wings.
Prewar Ireland is also a vivid presence in this sometimes ungainly
but always heartfelt and often moving work.

AUSTRALIAN MOVIE INSPIRES WRONG KIND OF LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITISK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing in movies more crowd-pleasing than the little
guy, tired of being pushed around, getting angry enough to fight
the system.
</P>
<P>
   The bare-bones Australian movie, ``The Castle,'' cashes in on
that theme.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of the cartoonish ``Patch Adams,''
``The Castle'' may be the least subtle beat-the-system film ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   A tow-truck driver and his family have lived happily for years
next to a runway at Melbourne's airport, but their placid lives are
interrupted when airport expansion threatens to take their house
through eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton), decides to fight
the airport through the appeal process, loses, hires a down-and-out
lawyer, loses again, and finally takes his case to Australia's
highest court with the help of a Queen's Counsel he's befriended
(``The kind of lawyer rich people hire.'') Through it all, Kerrigan
is seen as a saint by his youngest son, the narrator.
</P>
<P>
   The acting hits no false notes, from Caton to the mother (Anne
Tenney), a housewife deep into cheesy crafts, to the oldest brother
(Wayne Hope), serving a term in prison for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The middle brother (Anthony Simcoe) searches for bargains in the
paper (``Here's a guy with some jousting sticks, dad''), while the
youngest brother (Stephen Curry) interrupts conversations with
airhead questions and digs holes in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The sister (Sophie Lee) graduates from a beauty college and
marries a kick-boxer. The couple honeymoons in Thailand, as
impressed by the airline food as by going to the Orient. Much is
made of her appearance on ``The Price Is Right'' and the fact she's
the only one in the family with a degree.
</P>
<P>
   The father takes pride in everything around him _ his slow
greyhounds, his wife's cooking, a fake chimney on the roof and a
home- made pool room. There's also a powerboat and the family's
jerry-built vacation house by the lake at Bonny Doone (``I reckon
we're the luckiest family in the world,'' Dad keeps saying).
</P>
<P>
   It's the poor white trash lifestyle, seen through a precious
lens, as Kerrigan takes on the government and its preening lawyers.
The movie backs Kerrigan the whole way, but there's a fine line
between laughing at someone and laughing with him. ``The Castle''
constantly crosses that line.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gleisner, one of four writers on the project, says,
``Australians are very good at laughing at themselves, but it's not
meant as disrespect.'' The movie is supposed to be seen as a
``Capraesque symbol of lost family innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Castle,'' unlike the movies of Frank Capra and Preston
Sturges, makes fun of the people at the heart of its story. It
laughs at the Kerrigans' ordinary existence.
</P>
<P>
   As the family sits on the divan, chuckling at the TV, the
youngest son says, ``If there's anything Dad likes better than
`Funniest Home Videos,' it's `The Best of Funniest Home Videos.'''
The family is meant more than anything to be lovable, but the movie
never stops reminding you these folks are borderline dumb.
</P>
<P>
   There are some honestly funny bits, like Kerrigan's midnight tow
truck attack on the people causing him trouble, periodic
neighborhood gatherings, and Kerrigan's lawyer (Tiriel Mora) asking
the appeals court to feel ``the vibe of the thing'' when looking at
the Australian Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the laughs, though, come at the cost of the Kerrigans,
which undermines the movie's basic decency.

<P>
   Watching Diana Ross's hair get big-bigger-biggest during the
course of ``Double Platinum'' is a sad reminder of what this
made-for-TV melodrama could have been. If only the rest of the
movie _ the script, the performances, the costumes, the sets _ had
followed the same camp aesthetic, this familiar mother-daughter
story could have been juicy, soapy fun. It could have had the
bloated sentimentality of ``Beaches,'' or the insane emotionality
of ``Mommie Dearest.'' Instead, ``Double Platinum'' ends up as a
safe, middle-of-the-road vehicle for two singer-actresses, one that
tries in vain to fill its dramatic vacuum with a constant flow of
big, generic ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody had the idea: Diana Ross and Brandy star as mother and
daughter singers who are reunited after Ross abandoned Brandy as an
infant to pursue her career. But nobody invested much time in
elaborating on that concept with a fresh script, and so ``Double
Platinum'' runs through all the showbiz cliches as mother and
daughter come to terms with each other and each other's careers.
Brandy's Kayla had always revered the music of Ross's Olivia King,
but when she discovers Olivia is her mother, she is angry and
vindictive. She's not even consoled when Olivia provides her with
connections in the music business, and makes her into a hot new
star. There are absolutely no surprises in the plot, and the
dialogue is ridden with expected lines like ``Please don't play
mom. It's a little late for that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really a pleasure to see Ross, who doesn't act very often.
But she's too laid back here, unwilling to have some fun and come
off like a true bad guy for a few scenes. Brandy is more moody,
although her sullenness becomes tedious after a while, particularly
when you realize that she's dumped her father and best friend back
in St. Louis as easily as her mother dumped her so many years ago.

`ST. JOAN' SCORES A SURPRISING VICTORY

Olympia Dukakis, Maury Chaykin, Shirley MacLaine, Neil Patrick

<P>
   It wouldn't be hard for ``Joan of Arc'' to look like a class
act, as it arrives so quickly in the wake of NBC's fickle, phony
``Noah's Ark,'' which managed to reduce the Bible to ``The
Flintstones'' meets ``Waterworld.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS's two-part miniseries about the 15th-century peasant
girl who helped unite France is definitely more than a relative
success. With a grace and an ambition that are unusual for sweeps
``event'' TV, the movie relies as much on spiritual and religious
themes as it does on a haunting visual style. A few of the
historical twists and battle sequences are confusing, a muddy crush
of horses, swords, French cities, Prince Valiant hairdos, and
violent deaths. And some of the supporting players are wasted, with
Olympia Dukakis's Mother Babette allowed to extend her emotional
range from very maternal to very, very maternal. But ``Joan of
Arc'' contains a handful of wonderful characterizations, most
surprisingly from Neil Patrick Harris as the crafty King Charles
VII, and it manages to build to its fiery climax with restraint and
almost none of the sanctimoniousness you generally find in prime
time's other religious forays. It's never holier than thou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan of Arc,'' which airs Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9 on
Ch. 4, leads off with its most drab, least engaging scenes, as
young Joan discovers her one-on-one relationship with God during
her poor childhood in southern France. But once Joan leaves her
hostile father's house for a crusade to save her war-torn country,
the movie gains in pageantry and becomes more politically complex.
If Joan of Arc lived today, hearing the voices of saints and seeing
blazing hallucinations, she'd probably become a street person, and
``Joan of Arc'' would probably be more like ``The Fisher King.''
But in the 1420s people are drawn to her divine visions and
unshakeable faith, and the teenager becomes a mythic heroine for
whom her countrymen would give their lives. This power over the
masses makes Joan a perfect pawn for wily leaders, including Maury
Chaykin's Sir Robert and Harris's King Charles. It also makes her
into a pioneer for women, as she is consistently berated for
wearing men's clothing and engaging in men's pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   As Joan, Leelee Sobieski is all deadpan determination and
asexuality. The 16-year-old actress is low-key enough to hold the
screen for four hours without becoming tiresome, and she manages to
keep her contemporary affect at a minimum. She has the air of God
about her, but she is quite human, and her mission is sometimes
marred by pride. Oddly, Sobieski's biggest liability is her uncanny
resemblance to Helen Hunt. She has a depth and somberness that the
``Mad About You'' star probably couldn't call forth, but the
likeness is surprisingly distracting.
</P>
<P>
   While Sobieski's presence is sober and confident, the other
actors are vibrant and neurotic. Peter O'Toole shines as Charles's
spiritual adviser, Bishop Cauchon. He shakes with cynical intensity
in the face of Joan's claims, urging her not to pretend that any
human can know God's will. O'Toole's a scene stealer, of course,
and the angrier he gets, the more he leans on his syllables: ``The
only guide that will serve you well is mercy.'' He stimulates one
of the movie's central conflicts, as his position in the Church
leads him to fear and doubt a passionate faith that reaches beyond
Church teachings. Shirley MacLaine has a short, memorable role in
Part 2, as the dying Madame de Beaurevoir. Both tough and fragile,
she wants Joan to become her surrogate daughter and to fight for
the Bergundians. She looks a bit like an exhausted Agnes Moorehead,
and in one touching moment you can see her heart breaking as Joan
recoils from her touch.
</P>
<P>
   Harris appears to be having a good time as the foppish, naive,
and, ultimately, duplicitous King Charles. He's come a long way
from his days as the star of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' as he slings
lines like, ``Bishop, don't be so dreary.'' Charles doesn't like
being upstaged by Joan, but he seems familiar with the rules of
fame as we know them all too well in the 20th century _
particularly the business about backlash. Joan doesn't like being
famous, but she knows it can help her cause, even if it finally
destroys her, which, of course, it does.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the noble Joan is burned to death for heresy, ``Joan
of Arc'' resists undermining its story of faith by trading in
manipulative schmaltz. It's the sort of TV movie that has something
more than tears at stake.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM 
Directed and written by: Michael Hoffman (play: Shakespeare) 
Starring: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley
Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, Dominic West,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever I see a literary classic turned into a movie with its
author's name as part of the already well known title, I regard it
as a danger sign. Remember ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' ``Leo
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina'' and the overextended music video known as
``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet''? Given the less than
likely prospect of anyone supposing that ``Dracula,'' ``Anna
Karenina,'' and ``Romeo and Juliet'' might be written by anyone but
their respective illustrious authors, the tacking on of their names
seems a blatant and desperate attempt to borrow respectability for,
esthetically speaking, a lost cause. So it is with the new
``William Shaksepeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a total disaster, and it gives Shakespeare slightly
better billing than the famous Max Reinhardt version of 1935 with
Olivia de Havilland, Jimmy Cagney, and Mickey Rooney, with its
listing of two screenwriters, then, in smaller type, Shakespeare.
You can tell who didn't have an agent on the scene to protect him.
In this new version, the actors need more protection than they get
in Michael Hoffman's sometimes pretty but decidedly pedestrian
production that goes the leafy bower route, but misses entirely the
moonlit lyricism and poetry. It thus misses the play's subtext and
dualities of the regulated rational world of the dukedom played
against the gossamer strands of id bubbling up from underneath the
sleeping superegos in the nocturnally liberated natural world of
the forest.
</P>
<P>
   You know there's a gaping lack in any ``Midsummer Night's
Dream'' production which peaks with the Pyramus and Thisbe
travesty. Here it's the best element by far, not only because Kevin
Kline is one of the few actors whose recitation of the lines isn't
an embarrassment, but because he's got the training and finesse to
project the wistful dreamer as well as the overweening ass in
Bottom the Weaver. Part of the fun in ``Shakespeare in Love'' is
its way of convincing us Shakespeare knew how insecure actors
behave. Here's the play that confirms it. Kline's performance not
only is deliciously funny, but is touched with a nobility that
eludes almost all the nominal nobles. It's buttressed by Bill
Irwin, Max Wright and even, for a rarity, the piping Thisbe, played
here by Sam Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much romantic yearning in the romantic couples, who
are relegated to the rambunctious farce normally associated with
the rustics. After a few ill-judged displays of skin, they thud
into a display of mud wrestling from which none emerge unscathed,
especially Calista Flockhart's querulous Helena. Before Ally McBeal
made her famous, Flockhart did some terrific work in a couple of
films seen by few, ``Telling Lies in America'' and ``Drunks,'' but
her luck runs out here. So does Michelle Pfeiffer's. She's a
terrific-looking Titania, which means not just that she looks
golden and dreamy, but is convincing as a fairy queen in a jangly
snit. Still, she needs more coaching than she got to get her voice
around the lines in anything like musical fashion, which never
happens here.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Everett is one of the few who does speak Shakespeare's
lines well. Again, training shows. But his Oberon has little screen
time. Stanley Tucci gives us an interestingly earthy Puck, but is
undone, in the end, by too much eyeballing and mugging. As for the
music, Hoffman has augmented the usual Mendelssohn (the acting
isn't anywhere near as feathery as Mendelssohn's writing) with such
arias as Donizetti's Una furtiva lagrime and Bellini's Casta diva,
possibly to bolster his case for setting the play in fin-de-siecle
Tuscany, which doesn't make its case nearly as convincingly here as
it did in Kenneth Branagh's ``Much Ado About Nothing.'' At best,
Hoffman has given us a serviceable ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' but
not a magical one when nothing less than magical will do.

INGMAR BERGMAN IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The human face is the starting point for our work,'' Ingmar
Bergman once wrote. So it is in ``Private Confessions,'' in which
his gift for laying bare the human heart is given haunting,
sometimes lacerating, form.
</P>
<P>
   This is a film about people talking to each other, with the
classic Bergman themes front and center: the painful, perhaps
futile search for love, God, freedom, truth and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The story is simple and sparely told. A spirited young woman has
a revealing series of conversations with the three men who are most
important to her _ an elderly priest, her husband and her lover.
Both of the latter are theology students. The tale begins in 1925,
and the woman happens to be Bergman's mother.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third film in which Bergman, the son of a Lutheran
minister, has tried to come to grips with complex family issues
(1982's ``Fanny and Alexander'' and 1992's ``Best Intentions'' are
the others). All were made for Swedish TV.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Liv Ullmann, but this is in every other respect
a Bergman movie. Although he retired from film directing in 1983,
he has continued to write for the stage and screen, often drawing
on autobiographical materials; Ullmann, of course, is Bergman's
longtime star and protege, and the actors here, Pernilla August and
Max von Sydow, are also Bergman stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was even photographed by Bergman's celebrated
cameraman, Sven Nykvist.
</P>
<P>
   The film is broken into five ``conversations'' of varying
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   (The film's European title is ``Private Conversations,'' which
we're told was Martin Luther's term for his version of the
sacrament of confession.)
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Anna (August), a young married woman, tells her
pastor, Jacob (von Sydow), of the affair she's been conducting with
Tomas, a divinity student and friend of her husband. Though clearly
anguished, she describes her joy in the liaison and declares she
won't break it off.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob, who has known her since her confirmation (she calls him
``uncle''), tells her she must end all communications with her
lover and inform her husband. He's moved to reveal his own complex,
deeply held beliefs: ``We act out many roles, mostly to protect
ourselves, then we imperceptibly lose whatever is not a role. . .
.Only poets, musicians and saints have handed us mirrors where we
can discern the unfathomable. It consoles me to think of the
sanctity of man and the mysterious immensities surrounding us.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks provide a context for the remaining talks, which
take place both before and after the first conversation. We watch
Anna inform her weakling husband of the affair, then observe her
and her lover on a tragic, stolen weekend. Two more talks with
Jacob follow, one during his final illness, the other when Anna is
a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   The marvelous August, her visage plain and wholesome as a
Puritan's, played the same character in ``Best Intentions.'' (She
has a modest role in the upcoming ``Star Wars'' prequel.) In
``Private Confessions,'' the drama is played out not only in
Bergman's words but on her radiant, sublimely expressive face.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for these two powerful forces, Ullmann uses the
most austere directorial means: essentially a sequence of talking
heads that you might mistakenly label ``static'' if this were
lesser material. Von Sydow is magisterial. His gaunt face and
rumbling voice have become, for me, impossible to distinguish from
Bergman's own.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I find myself suddenly deluged with porno
e-mail on America Online. I am curious how I became the recipient
of such drivel. My only Internet usage has been for e-mail and for
searching medical literature through the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spammee
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SPAMMEE: Well, where do you think congressmen keep all
their dirty books? No wonder you're getting those solicitations.
And I wasn't aware that the latest copy of ``Big Buxom Babes'' was
considered ``medical literature.'' I'm more of a National
Geographic man myself.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think you're special just because some scumbucket is
filling your mailbox every morning. Spam is a fact of life. Who
knows how you got on the list? It could have been that time you
typed in the wrong keyword or visited the American Urological
Association home page or downloaded pictures of farm animals for
your kid's school project. There are slimeballs out there who spend
their whole day trolling AOL and a hundred other places for
potential suckers.
</P>
<P>
   About all you can do is set your mail controls to accept letters
only from a pre-approved list of other AOL members and Internet
addresses. And nobody says you have to read any of the crud you
receive. Delete it all and go back to your research, unless you
actually think a letter with a subject line of ``Free XXX pics''
could be from dear old Aunt Mabel. And that's just plain sick.
Maybe you should run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just read an article that when you visit a
Web site, you provide information about yourself, including your
viewing habits, search terms, etc. What is the truth?
</P>
<P>
   _ Not So Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOT: Are you kidding? They even know if you're wearing
clean underwear. The people who build Web sites are fond of pulling
every little trick out of the book when it comes down to figuring
out who you are and why you'd like to buy their products or enjoy
their muck-laden spam. Weren't you paying attention during the last
question?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they get all the normal stuff, like what browser or
Internet provider you're using. But every time you click on a link
or search a site, there's the potential some Web weasel just earned
a commission. And if you fill out any questionnaires? Well, duh.
What did you think they were going to do with that information?
</P>
<P>
   Here it is: If you do anything at all on the Internet, then
somebody else probably knows what it is. In fact, I can tell what
you're doing right now. And you'd better stop it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I don't understand how a program like Yahoo!
Pager knows that a particular person is online.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm Not Here
</P>
<P>
   DEAR I'M: Isn't anybody listening to what I've been saying? If
you're on the Net, somebody somewhere knows you are there. Programs
like Pager and AIM and ICQ compound the exposure. They log you in
to a server with all the other people running those programs. When
you put people on your notification list or vice versa, the
insidious little things actually query that server to see who's on.
</P>
<P>
   Call me paranoid, but sometimes I'd like to check out that hot
urology page the first guy was looking at without everybody in the
world knowing I'm hooked up. But that's just me.
</P>

Saturday in the Preakness, he won't be the favorite or even the
second favorite. Just who is this horse that isn't getting a whole
lot of respect and is trainer D. Wayne Lukas courting danger by
running him every two weeks? By Joseph Durso.

 &HT;    STARTING PAY FOR TEACHERS STAYS LOW
 &HT;    590&AMP;adds. With TEACHER-PAY-DATA. For release Sunday, May 16.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the nation's public schools gear up to hire
millions of new teachers over the next decade, they are offering
salaries far below what most of this year's college graduates can
expect.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be issued this summer by the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) shows that the average newly licensed teacher with a
bachelor's degree earned $25,735 in the 1997-98 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disgrace,'' said AFT President Sandra Feldman.
``Ultimately, if we plan to find a way to fill what will be
something like two million teacher slots over the next decade,
we're going to have to raise salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with adjustments for inflation, starting pay for teachers
remains below what is being offered to new graduates in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree is being
offered between $33,900 and $37,200 a year, according to a national
study by Phil Gardner, director of career services and placement at
Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, in the red-hot, worker-short field of
technology information, even a two-year associate degree in
computer science routinely leads to offers of between $32,900 and
$35,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is in a bind unless we come up with more money,''
Gardner said. ``I had an education major working for me who gave up
teaching and started her own Web site development company. It's
creative work and she can make more money that way.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report provided to Cox Newspapers by the AFT,
state averages for new teachers in the last school year were above
$29,000 in only three states: Alaska ($33,162), Connecticut
($29,506) and Pennsylvania ($29,581). The averages were below
$21,000 in four states: Mississippi ($20,630), South Dakota
($20,340), Idaho ($20,248) and North Dakota ($19,146).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody goes into teaching for the pay. It's something in your
soul,'' said Linda Koutoufas, an veteran teacher at Woodstock
Elementary School in Virginia Beach, Va. ``But I know of no new
teacher, not a one, who does not work two jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, said
schools need to find a lot more qualified teachers in math,
science, history and special and bilingual education. In addition,
he said, some states and districts face shortages caused by
``teacher retirement, population mobility, increasing birth rates,
immigration and a trend toward smaller class size.''
</P>
<P>
   In union and non-union school districts alike, starting pay is
held down by the custom of raising all salaries at all levels in
lock-step percentages, rather than in response to changing demands
for new teachers or for certain specialties, such as science and
math.
</P>
<P>
   AFT data show that in the 10 years that ended in 1998, both the
new teachers and experienced teachers received pay raises that
averaged about 4 percent a year before inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that while pay for experienced teachers (including
increases for seniority or graduate degrees) rose by $1,126 a year,
the pay for beginners rose by only $718 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particularly hurts in the competition for the most
academically able students,'' said Susan Moore Johnson, academic
dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ``Most of today's
young people don't see themselves as choosing a lifetime career
when they take that job after earning their degree; they're
comparing what they can make right now in investment banking with
what they can make in teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   To get new teachers, many districts are recruiting people who
earned teaching certificates but never did teach, or who left the
profession to raise families. Most states also offer special
regulations and courses that help people in middle management or
the military switch to teaching at mid-life.
</P>
<P>
   Those mature recruits could fill as many as half the vacancies
expected in the decade ahead.
</P>
<P>
   However, the competition for younger applicants is fierce:
</P>
<P>
   _ Detroit, short 1,000 teachers, pushed its starting pay above
$35,000, and offers a $1,000 signing bonus to those who sign a
five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ Massachusetts is offering bonus of $5,000 a year for four
years to the top 50 applicants in a new quality-teacher hiring
program.
</P>
<P>
   _ California offers education courses on the Internet to help
the more than 20,000 uncertified teachers working with
``emergency'' credentials in that state qualify for permanent
teaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Applicants in states as different as Alaska, Georgia,
Maryland, Mississippi and South Carolina can get daily updates on
almost all of each state's job openings, salary schedules and
incentive programs on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Maryland, Howard County offers a $1,000 bonus for those
signing one-year teaching contracts, and Baltimore offers $5,000
toward closing costs on the purchase of a home within the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not going to object to people getting that
kind of additional money,'' Feldman said. ``But ultimately what you
have to do to keep people on the job is to pay them a professional
salary.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Magi (cq) D. Shepley, a special education teacher, says she left
her first teaching job in Baltimore to take a better-paying job in
a suburban district because ``I owe $26,000 in student loans, and I
only made a bit more than that'' a year.
</P>
<P>
   To keep teaching in public schools she must earn 24 to 33 hours
of graduate credits within seven years. She estimates this will
cost her $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 'teacher shortage area' deferment (for teaching in
Baltimore) runs out in six months, at which time I'll start paying
$259 per month on those undergraduate loans, not counting what I'll
be paying back to my credit union for grad school,'' Shepley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work over the summer, while taking graduate classes,'' she
said. She commutes in a car which has more than 209,000 miles on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very soon I'll be forced to buy a new car,'' she said. ``It's
a tight squeeze.''

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ The latest Friday on the U.S.-led
NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. The Tanjug
state-controlled news agency, reported 100 civilians in a column of
500 ethnic Albanian refugees heading toward the Albanian border
were killed in a NATO aerial attack. The allies said they could not
immediately confirm or deny the report. Meanwhile, Apache attack
helicopters held their first ``live fire'' exercise. Developing.

   ISRAEL-VOTE _ El Al (the Israeli Airline) is offering charter
flights at cut rates, and several Israeli political parties are
sponsoring trips to Israel to bring back Israelis living in America
so they can vote in the May 17 election. Election turnout is
already about 80 percent in Israel and the last election was
decided by less than 30,000 votes of about 2 million cast. There
are around 100,000 Israelis living in America; none can vote by
mail except diplomats so the effort to get them back is intense. We
will speak to at least one Israeli living in Boca Raton about why
he feels it is important to go back, as well as Israeli political
analysts and political organizers in the Miami area. (Belkin, Palm

`ATOMIC TRAIN' IS CHEESY FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A freight train laden with nuclear waste and _ gasp _ a
contraband Soviet nuclear bomb, armed of course, rumbles toward
Denver. Then . . . no brakes! And it's all downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero jumps from a helicopter to try to stop the locomotive,
almost succeeds, but no. Fire lights up the skies. Coloradans flee
toward Kansas. Too late! Cue mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
   All this . . . and Rob Lowe, too.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is that Cold War-era title, ``Atomic Train.'' The
four-hour miniseries airs tonight and Monday (9 p.m. EDT on NBC).
Oh, the humanity of it all. Paging Ed Wood, paging Ed Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these elements together, and this recipe-for-a-disaster
flick seems like a recipe for a disaster. Then comes the biggest
shocker of them all: It ain't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   A tad slow in the first half, at times thrilling in the second,
this is a film made for the wrong venue. ``Atomic Train'' would be
a quintessential 1959 B-movie, best viewed from the back seat of a
Chevy Bel Air convertible. Sure, it's cheesy, but it is fun cheese.
</P>
<P>
   While the special effects are there, including a train crash
just a notch or two below the standard set by ``The Fugitive,''
``Atomic Train'' has an old-time feel, especially when Lowe _ as
National Traffic Safety Board investigator John Seger _ is
scampering onto, in and around the locomotive. Lowe says he is
comfortable around trains, but did that mean he really had to do
many of his own stunts?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my wife asks. I'm glad she was not on location,''
Lowe said in a recent interview. ``This is a genre that needs every
element to elevate it above something we've all seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is getting good as this Armageddon thing (remember him as
Nick Andros in the 1994 Stephen King miniseries ``The Stand''?). He
has recovered from his late-'80s videotaped career implosion and is
carving out a solid niche for himself as a secondary character in
movies. In ``Atomic Train,'' he proves he can still handle the
lead. Well, co-lead.
</P>
<P>
   The real star, at least in Part I, is the train, a vehicle that
traditionally on screen is a character unto itself rivaled only by
the 1930s gangster sedan with running boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys love them,'' Lowe said. ``There is something
genetically imprinted into Americans (about trains). Cinematically,
they are great characters. I've never seen a train movie I didn't
love.''
</P>
<P>
   A subplot to the movie is Seger's effort at melding a new family
with second wife Megan (Kristin Davis, of HBO's ``Sex and the
City''), her young son and his teenage daughter.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Lowe, 35, former teen idol, plays the dad of a
teenage daughter in the movie. ``Nobody was more worried about the
believability than me,'' said Lowe, who is the father of two young
sons. More surprising than him playing a dad is that halfway
through you forget about the narrow age gap.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the new arrangement is Megan Seger's ex, a gung-ho
cop named Mac played by Esai Morales (``The Burning Season'').
Morales comes off as a heavy-handed macho clown, but you realize
soon enough he is just a blundering father trying desperately to
connect with his kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you liked `The Hunt for Red October,' if you liked `Crimson
Tide,' you will love this movie,'' Lowe said. ``It is a nonstop
roller-coaster ride where the characters have tremendous humanity.
This is an action movie that takes its time and services
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk within NBC of temporarily shelving the
project after the school attack in Littleton, Colo. But while this
story does involve a bomb and takes place in Colorado, the
similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   While the network was right to raise the question of whether
such a film was appropriate, it was equally right to go ahead and
air the two-parter. The Denver NBC affiliate has chosen not to air
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a laden Sunday night of television, all three of the alphabet
networks have special offerings. All are worth watching to varying
extents, depending on what you are looking for:
</P>
<P>
   Historical: ``Joan of Arc'' (Sunday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT,
CBS.) Excellent drama.
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental: ``Double Platinum'' (Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT, ABC).
The ABC movie pairs Diana Ross and Brandy as a mother and daughter,
both singers, who are reunited. And, in the end, it feels so good
(Yeah, yeah, I know: It's Peaches and Herb).
</P>
<P>
   Action: ``Atomic Train.'' Plus, it's real fun to say over and
over and over. Try it.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TEACHING ASSISTANTS AT BERKELEY UNIONIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Capping a 16-year organizing drive which
generated three strikes, graduate teaching assistants at the
University of California at Berkeley have voted to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employment Relations Board, or PERB,
announced Thursday that the vote by members of the Association of
Graduate Student Employees for unionization was 833-293.
</P>
<P>
   The 70 percent turnout of the campus's 1,000 teaching assistants
in the election, which was conducted April 27-29, was the second
highest in the UC system's history, said association spokesman
Scott Prudham.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate assistants will be represented for collective
bargaining purposes by the United Auto Workers. ``We expect to
start bargaining pretty soon,'' said Prudham, a graduate student in
energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Berkeley is the second campus at which graduate assistants
have voted for unionization. The UCLA unit, which voted March 9-11,
has just begun bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate assistants at UC-Berkeley are paid $1,200 to $1,400 per
month during their five-month appointments and receive partial
health insurance and partial fee remission. They must re-apply for
their positions at the end of each five-month work period.
</P>
<P>
   The UC administration long resisted the unionization campaign on
the grounds that graduate assistants were not, technically
speaking, employees covered by the PERB.
</P>
<P>
   The board ruled last year that the graduate assistants were
within its jurisdiction and ordered elections for all eight of the
UC campuses.

`MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' WITH ALL THE FAIRY DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the women in Michael Hoffman's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''
look guiltily ravaged, sexually harassed and newly turned on _ like
they've wandered into the film's sun-dried 1920s Tuscan locales
from the wrap-party of an NC-17 Prince video.
</P>
<P>
   Their tendrils look more wrangled than done, their costumes are
almost on straight and their desire is barely in disguise, but
``necklines are high'' as the intro tells us, so there's not much
more in the way of dirty-mindedness than the implication that each
of the Shakespearean ladies that appear on-screen emits that
getting-it-on-in-a-cul-de-sac glow, even if it's not altogether
true.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman fools with the playwright's love farce with a
relaxed-fit, corsets-be-damned glee that, while truncating the
intricacies of the play's character relations, unleashes copious
amounts of fairy dust, body glitter and innocuous lust.
</P>
<P>
   That and Kevin Kline standing on the tip-toes of his softly
riotous jester-with-an-XL-IQ powers. As Bottom, the haplessly
grandiose leader of an actor's troupe, Kline pirouettes through the
film like a clumsy reject from some dance company smart enough to
say ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Save an overjoyed quickie by the madly emotive Sam Rockwell as
Flute, the ``boy'' in Bottom's troupe, Kline is the most astral
creature in a constellation lit up by a pack of actors who manage
to strike even when they're wearing their characters as if they
were plucked from a hanger in wardrobe: one-outfit, one-note
persona.
</P>
<P>
   But it's fun, for instance, to realize that Calista Flockhart is
that missing link in the degrees of separation between ``Ally
McBeal'' creator David E. Kelley and William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart's foppish, neurotic Helen is a lovesick rag doll of
ruthlessly lonely proportions, humiliated, rejected, embarrassed
and in constant search of a pratfall to clarify exactly how
pathetic she is. ``I am your spaniel . . . ,'' she tells Demetrius
(Christian Bale).
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Helen! One more self-flagellating confession like that and
you may as well be cat-fighting your rival in a waist-deep mudbath.
Huh? Oh that's right: She does pull hair and get dirty with Hermia
(Anna Friel) over two men. The other suitor, Lysander (Dominic
West), finds himself smitten with Ally _ doh! Helen! _ after a
spell is sprinkled on him in his slumber. The spellbinder is the
magically inept Puck (Stanley Tucci) and the soap opera on a yo-yo
is by Oberon's (Rupert Everett) design.
</P>
<P>
   Oberon's romantic machinations with the deity Titania (Michelle
Pfeiffer) are clipped at the expense of the 
Helen-wants-Demetrius-who-wants-Hermia-who-wants-Lysander-who-wants-
Helen-who-is-suddenly-wanted-back-by-Demetrius love rhombus.
</P>
<P>
   Though maybe Hoffman had something in mind, considering that
Everett carries on in a doldrums deadpan and Pfeiffer, who hasn't
looked this ravishing since swiveling all over Jeff Bridges'
Steinway, doesn't act so much as susurrate and respire like a
pixie-diva cum window fan made of God's own heavenly cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Pfeiffer, who's cameoed here, seems
particularly indifferent is that we're supposed to believe in the
spell under which she's been accidentally placed that makes her not
mind being in love with Bottom after he's transformed into an ass
(the beast of burden sort).
</P>
<P>
   She's inviting but school-play-lite, which is perfectly aligned
with the makeshift splendor of Lucianna Arrighi and Gianni
Giovagnoni's forest set. It's a sylvan, playpen-bound Oz where the
sprites and satyrs fondle 12-inch opera LPs and build bicyclettes
when they're not combing each other's hair.
</P>
<P>
   The leafy, nectar-soaked atmospherics and the horseplay that
abounds are the exuberant, eye-candy cortex of the ``Shakespeare in
Love'' brain: undaunted by being anything more than what it is _ a
gorgeous sliver of grown-up ambrosia.

WILL BUSH FLAME OUT? DON'T BET ON IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's really nothing to dislike about George W. Bush. He's a
nice guy. He's sincere. His political philosophy is conservative in
the best sense of the word, which is to say that his ideas and
policies are thoughtful, responsible and decidedly unthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are people who apparently loathe the Texas
governor _ people who seem determined to leave no stone unturned in
their crusade to derail Bush's fledgling presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about an extremely small minority here, but it's
an adamant minority. Any time that I say a kind word about Bush in
the newspaper, for example, I can count on getting a phone message
or two in which the caller pronounces Bush a worthless bum and
pronounces me a pitiable idiot for supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   To these readers I reply: I may be an idiot, but that's not why
I'm a Bush supporter. The fact is, Bush is a terrific public
servant and an outstanding politician who is on the verge of
proving himself more than worthy of the front-runner status he has
achieved in an election that is nearly 18 months away.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what the anti-Bush crowd is ticked off about _ that
the son of former President George Bush could so casually grab the
lead in the 2000 sweepstakes without even stepping into the
starting gate. He has not, after all, made an official announcement
that he's a candidate, and yet he consistently and convincingly
trounces all the other would-be presidents _ Republican and
Democrat _ in every public-opinion poll that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be more to it than that, though. Some of this
anti-Bush sentiment showed up during his 1998 campaign for
re-election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a week went by last summer and fall that I failed to get
a call from some Bush-basher who demanded: ``What in the world has
this guy done to deserve being re-elected? Name one thing. Name
just one darn (actually, the adjective was usually stronger than
that) thing that he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Those calls were easy to answer, of course, since Bush had done
any number of things to deserve being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he had kept every promise he made during his 1994
campaign _ a spectacular and virtually unheard of accomplishment by
any politician. Most of them start breaking promises at least two
weeks before they take the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised plenty in that first campaign for governor:
welfare reform, tort reform, education reform, revision of the
juvenile justice code, property tax relief. By developing a spirit
of cooperation and mutual interest with a state Legislature that is
notorious for ignoring the wishes of governors, Bush managed to
deliver every one of the promised improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And now he is working hard to push his 1998 campaign promises
through the Legislature before hitting the presidential campaign
trail next month.
</P>
<P>
   And while the governor tends to the job that he promised to give
top priority before seeking any other, the critics relentlessly
take potshots.
</P>
<P>
   They bash Bush for what he says, what he doesn't say, what he's
thinking, what he might be thinking, what he might have thought if
he had given any thought to whatever it is that his critics think
he ought to be thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   The critics can be found mostly in the media, of course, not
among the general public. Out here in the heartland, the few
Bush-bashers willing to weigh in seem to be the same ones who've
been bashing him for years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the media, well, it's only a matter of time until they
see that the Bush-for-president phenomenon is real, that the Bush
bandwagon is fueled up and ready to roll _ that the
self-destructive flame-out that they so eagerly anticipate is not
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy the sun while you can, Governor,'' Newsweek's Howard
Fineman wrote in the magazine's May 17 edition. ``After months of
pursuing his stay-at-home, low-profile campaign, Bush is about to
step into the maelstrom.''
</P>
<P>
   Maelstrom, my eye. The only thing Bush is about to step into is
the fast lane to the White House.

FORBES' NEW WEB SITE IS A VIRTUAL LAND OF CONSERVATIVE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In search of politics that swim against the tide? Had it up to
here with the mainstream media and Stone Age politicians tripping
on the front steps of the information age? This may be the Web site
for you: www.forbes2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is the virtual land of conservative politics, both fiscal
and social, and the national online headquarters of Malcolm S.
``Steve'' Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher who is
seeking the Republican nomination for president for the second
time.
</P>
<P>
   Here you will find, for example, a contrary view of Robert
Rubin, the Treasury secretary who was credited in most newspapers
this week with shaping economic policy in a time of gleeful
prosperity and no-show inflation. Rubin is resigning and will be
succeeded by Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promoting Larry Summers to be U.S. Treasury secretary is like
sending Typhoid Mary into a maternity ward,'' reads a posting from
Forbes, who criticizes fiscal advice the United States has given
abroad in Latin America, Russia and the Pacific Rim because he says
it contributed to currency collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubin news was breaking as Forbes arrived in San Francisco
to give a speech Wednesday, an especially appropriate day for him:
Tax Freedom Day, the symbolic line of demarcation for taxes _ all
income that the average worker earned this year, before that date,
would equal that worker's tax bill (paychecks thereafter can be
used for other purposes).
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax burden is the highest since World War II,'' said
Forbes, 51, the president and editor in chief of Forbes, the
business-oriented magazine his grandfather founded in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes, as he did in his 1996 candidacy, a flat tax of 17
percent and a form that could be filed on a postcard. There would
be no federal income tax on earnings under $36,000 in the Forbes
plan, one that appeals to 60 percent of Americans, according to a
recent Louis Harris poll.
</P>
<P>
   The flat tax always starts a fight, however, particularly
because key deductions for home mortgages and charitable donations
would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   It would ``devastate property values,'' said Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif., who favors the option of a national sales tax and who
also favors Elizabeth Dole in the GOP presidential primary race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can at least make the case with a straight face and more
than a clean conscience that a national sales tax would not
devastate property values,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Said a senior Clinton administration official who asked not to
be named: ``If you are not interested in collecting the same amount
of revenue we collect now, then you have to deal with the possible
consequences of throwing the federal budget out, back into
deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insists his themes will resonate, particularly in
California, where he said he will compete vigorously before the
March 7 primary and where he has installed former state GOP
Chairman John Herrington as campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will resonate is the idea of the rebirth of freedom,
certainly out here, where there is the potential of the Internet
and the expansion of bandwidth, and having more control over your
life,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having more choice will resonate, whether it is suppression of
the tax code, health care _ issues the Democrats think are theirs.
Shouldn't we be able to choose any doctor we want?'' asked the
advocate of HMO reform. ``Why should we have to go through a
gatekeeper or bureaucracy?
</P>
<P>
   ``And schooling! Why should a mother have to send her child to a
crummy school?'' asked the advocate of vouchers for private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   He also advocates individuals' ability to invest Social Security
funds in private retirement accounts similar to IRAs or 401(k)
plans. ``People love that because they are in charge of it, not
Washington,'' he said, noting that if individuals die prematurely,
their heirs receive none of the Social Security funds they paid
except for a small survivor benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have nothing for a lifetime of work, but with this system
you do,'' he said. ``More young people believe in UFOs than believe
the Social Security system will be there when they retire.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Forbes has emphasized his conservative anti-
abortion social agenda, thereby seeking to broaden his appeal
beyond fiscal conservatives to social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also says he'll be helped by the Internet. ``In the old days
you had physical precincts, but now you bring people on
electronically. You mobilize them that way,'' he said, adding that
13,000 campaign volunteers have signed on at www.forbes2000.com.

   NEW-THINKTANK (Washington) _ In Thinktankland, both conservative
and liberal groups have competed for years to convert their ideas
about taxes, foreign policy, the environment or whatever into
policy in the real world. But since the beginning of this year, a
new entry, the New America Foundation, has been trying to change
the think tank landscape. New America seeks to introduce younger
voices, break out of the traditional liberal and conservative
categories and produce unconventional ideas. Yet no matter how many

`JOAN OF ARC' IS AN OLD STORY WORTH RETELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a question posed by ``Joan of Arc,'' the engrossing
four-hour miniseries starting Sunday on CBS:
</P>
<P>
   If a person is the embodiment of a myth, can that myth in fact
be a reality? Or is that person just a fraud, since a myth is
merely a morally relevant fictitious tale that can't come true?
</P>
<P>
   What is true is a simple but devout teenage farm girl inspired
and led her people into battle from 1428 to 1430, only to be
betrayed and burned at the stake in 1431 as a heretic. In the eyes
of the church, acknowledging her would be to acknowledge her power
_ and challenge its own.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half a millennium later, Joan of Arc remains a
powerful and everlasting symbol, raised to sainthood by the
Catholic Church that condemned her. A medieval feminist whose life
had a Christ-like parallel (sans the pacificism), hers is a story
that still resonates.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has gathered the most star-studded cast of the May sweeps
for this miniseries (Sunday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT). In the lead
of Joan of Arc is Leelee Sobieski, portraying a teen who believes
she is empowered by the word of God through direct conversation
with saints to unite the people of France against England.
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Toole, Olympia Dukakis, Maximilian Schell, Peter
Strauss, Jaqueline Bisset, Powers Boothe, Robert Loggia, Neil
Patrick Harris, Chad Willett and Shirley MacLaine in a cameo also
star in this historical drama.
</P>
<P>
   Was Joan, an illiterate from Domremy in the South of France, the
mythical Maid of Lorraine foretold by the wizard Merlin? Her power
to inspire and lead France on its way to victory in the 100 Years'
War says yes. Her piety and devoutness say yes.
</P>
<P>
   But the church and the king she helped install recognized the
danger of the power she had, as myth and person. Her death was
pre-ordained.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski first garnered widespread attention and praise for her
starring role in the 1998 Merchant-Ivory production ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries.'' She was also in, among other films, ``Deep
Impact,'' and will appear this summer in ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the
Stanley Kubrick/Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman film.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski, who has a passing resemblance to a younger Helen Hunt
with a little bit of Jewel mixed in, plays the complex Joan
brilliantly, at times the confident leader emboldened by the
saints, at other times a confused girl who does not know her role
in God's plans.
</P>
<P>
   As magnificent as Sobieski is, it is O'Toole who gives the most
stunning performance as Bishop Cauchon, who first advises the
French King Charles (Harris), then serves as Joan's prosecutor in
her church trial on heresy charges.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole's character struggles throughout, between the vanity of
holding onto his role as the king's adviser and his powerful
position in the church, to finally believing that executing Joan is
the only way to save this girl's soul. In the end he realizes, too
late, that he was also fighting for, and losing, his own salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the Czech Republic, the battle scenes star not Joan,
nor the other soldiers, nor swords, nor horses, catapults, ladders
knocked off parapets, hand-to-hand combat, nor men dying _ although
all are there.
</P>
<P>
   No, the featured player, a character really, is the mud. Weapons
change throughout the history of warfare, from the rock to the
spear to the gun to the B-2 bomber. But mud, brown and black and
rivers of red from battle, mud has remained the constant.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Joan of Arc,'' engulfing ground coupled with a gray sky
capture the brutality of war better than any graphic gore.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the miniseries does not attempt to trot out fake
French accents (a French accent, from Powers Boothe? I don't think
so), which could have created a Kevin Costner-as-Robin Hood
scenario where the dialects somehow get lost halfway through the
movie. And this production, directed by Christian Duguay and
written by Ronald Parker and Michael Miller, is too good to fall
into that trap.
</P>
<P>
   As flames lap at Joan, who is tied to the stake, she looks
toward heaven and says repeatedly: ``Thank you. Thank you.'' In a
lackluster television season, you may say the same after watching
``Joan of Arc.''
</P>

 By JACK EPSTEIN 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After inaugurating Brazil's first computer-crimes unit earlier
this year, Belo Horizonte officer Marisa de Oliveira Costa quickly
found reason to celebrate. Within weeks, Brazil's first cyberspace
police chief had jailed a software pirate and nabbed a hacker who
had published confidential information about a local company on the
Internet. ``We are right behind these criminals and they know it,''
says De Oliveira, head of the Special Computer Crimes and
Electronic Fraud Precinct.
 &HT;    Collaring cybercrooks is one thing. Punishing them may prove
more difficult. Brazilian cops have a tool to help fight piracy in
a new federal law that grants software programs the same copyright
protection as books. But there is no specific law against hacking,
the electronic equivalent of breaking and entering, even as pursuit
of the activity for fun and profit grows in popularity. De Oliveira
used a 1996 wiretapping law to arrest her hacker. The legislation
sets prison terms for ``intercepting'' information over the
telephone by eavesdropping. Whether the charge sticks remains to be
seen.
 &HT;    ``We have caught about a dozen hackers, but no one ever goes to
jail,'' says Alberto Bastos, security director of Modulo Security
Solutions, a software developer that wrote programs to protect
vote-tallying computers used in the last national election.
 &HT;    The need for effective law enforcement is growing. Brazilian
hackers are boldly penetrating the country's largest state agencies
and private corporations at more than twice the rate of just a year
ago. Someone nearly erased the Federal Income Tax Service's website
recently. In more serious attempts, others boasted on the Internet
that they had broken into the network Banco Bradesco _ the latter
an incident that officials from Brazil's largest private bank deny
occurred. The country's Central Bank reports an average of three
online assaults a month, but officials say that security measures
have so far thwarted trespassers. ``I imagine the hackers are kids
who don't want to cause us financial problems, but want to make
their mark by breaking the barriers we put up,'' says Roberto Ozu,
head of the bank's computer department.
 &HT;    The damage they cause is no child's play. A study by Modulo
shows that one in three large companies has suffered a security
breach and the company estimates that hackers cost large Brazilian
firms an average US$568,000 a year through work shutdowns, data
theft, fraud, lost contracts and investigative costs. Few companies
report their experience to the police.
 &HT;    Internet sites devoted to the exploits of cyber bandits support
the theory of adolescent pranksters. Hackers call themselves
``alpinists'' seeking the thrill of ``reaching the top.'' They
proclaim their conquests at web sites with names such as Freecker,
Hack n' Roll, Top Hacker Brazil and Kingdom of Hackers. ``They are
typically boys between 14 to 17 years of age who exchange
information with U.S. hackers and then copy their methods,'' says
Julio Botelho, director of technology at Rio de Janeiro's City
University. However, some have developed lethal homegrown efforts
such as last year's so-called Leandro Kelly, a virus that began
destroying data stored on computers in the state of Minas Gerais
before spreading throughout the globe.
 &HT;    The rise in hacking is directly correlated to growing Internet
usage. Since the Internet started gaining widespread use in Brazil
around 1995, the number of subscribers has grown at a heady clip.
By 2001, Brazil should have 7 million people online. Together with
the increase in users, the surfers who have gone over to the dark
side of computing are growing in number and sophistication. ``It's
certain they are learning more each day and evolving,'' says
Botelho.
 &HT;    Adolescent hackers are tiring of simple thrills and graduating
to activities with payoffs. The most common online financial crime
involves stealing credit card numbers and withdrawing funds from
the estimated 3 million Brazilian users of home banking. Spying for
companies that pay to discover a competitor's business strategy is
another growth sector. ``Many companies are so unprepared to
confront hackers that they never know what hit them,'' says
Modulo's Bastos.
 &HT;    Police are no better off. ``Industrial espionage by computer is
a new area for us,'' says Mauro Silva, the head of the Sao Paulo
Internet Police Division. Silva, who took a course in computer
crime at FBI headquarters in the United States, hopes to create the
nation's second cyber police station later this year and encourage
more corporations to report online crime. ``I understand why most
today remain silent after a break-in,'' he says. ``Let's say
hundreds of American Express credit card numbers are stolen. [The
company] wouldn't want that made public.''
 &HT;    Despite their growing ranks, Brazilian hackers have yet to gain
much fame in the public eye. Not so in neighboring Argentina, where
Julio Cesar Ardita, a 23-year-old computer science student also
known as ``El Griton (The Screamer),'' pleaded guilty last year to
hacking after breaking into computer networks at the Pentagon and
NASA. Under a plea agreement, Ardita will serve three years'
probation in Argentina and pay a $5,000 fine.
 &HT;    Brazilian officials have decided it's time to dissuade their
young hackers before they hit the big time. At least eight bills
that would set punishments for online crime are under debate in
Congress. Security specialists and the country's budding cyber
police force applaud the measures. But Carlos Alberto Teixeira, an
ex-hacker who covers the computer industry for the Rio daily O
Globo, says jailing hackers may not be the answer: ``It will give
Brazilian hackers their first martyr and inspire them to increase
break-ins and destruction,'' he says. Yet Teixeira agrees that
stronger laws and more cyber cops will convince at least the teen
amateurs to pursue other hobbies, clearing the battlefield for
officer De Oliveira and other cybercops to pursue the hard-core
hackers.

`DOUBLE PLATINUM' ALL GLITTER AND NO SUBSTANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Double Platinum'' had the good sense to cast a diva and a
diva-in-waiting as a mother-and-daughter tandem, and even better
sense to put them in front of a microphone as many times as humanly
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Overplayed with teary emotion by Diana Ross, Olivia King is a
pure-voiced careerist singer, forced to soul-search when she
realizes that she has everything except the daughter she walked out
on some 18 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy is the abandoned Kayla Harris, now a teen-ager with a
nice little voice of her own. She's living in St. Louis, working
part-time at the dry cleaners owned by her dad (Brian Stokes
Mitchell), the jilted, abandoned, very unforgiving hubby. Kayla's
dream: to become a superstar like Olivia King, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international sensation, Olivia wants a parental do-over,
and she re-enters Kayla's life. The daughter hates the mother for
leaving _ especially this rich, famous mother she thinks ``is the
bomb!''_ but not enough to turn down Olivia's offer to come to New
York and meet the right music-biz folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be a star,'' mother says to daughter, who, while
packing her bags, growls something along the lines of, ``But I
don't wanna owe you nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Since you probably know where this is headed, it gives nothing
away to admit that mother and daughter fight, make up, break up,
fight again and reunite in a tear-filled, triumphant duet shortly
before the end credits. Lots of tears, lots of overacting in
between. Thin dialogue, the usual suspects in characterizations:
the uptight agent (Roger Rees), the funny manager (Harvey Fierstein
in a cameo), the sexy but oh-so-sleazy record executive (Allen
Payne).
</P>
<P>
   Movies don't come more simplistic and manipulative than ``Double
Platinum,'' a two-hour music video cleverly designed to do what
music videos do: sell records. This movie should do wonders for the
albums of the two singers, especially Ross' just released CD.
</P>
<P>
   The performers' songs are all from their albums, and most seem
to be played in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a revelation that the musical performances are the
better moments of ``Double Platinum,'' and that the writers decided
not to spend a whole lot of time coming up with anything to get you
from one tune to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Lady Sings the Blues,'' Ross has played the woman
hurting from the inside out. Crying and spewing I'm-so-hurt
dialogue. It's old, and it's not very good. Brandy won't become a
good actress until she realizes how severely limited her abilities
are. Ego can trip you up that way. (But she's young, so there's
hope.)
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that Brandy, Ross and Brandy's mother,
Sonja B. Norwood, are part of a five-person executive producing
team. Boy, to have been a fly on the wall in those tug-o'-war
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because as premises go, ``Double Platinum'' has a
pretty good one. But as in many Hollywood projects, artistic merit
went soaring out the window the moment Ross and Brandy _ their
managers, their agents and their record companies _ began
negotiating who'll do what and when.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is expecting sizable ratings for this movie, even up against
the first night of the far-superior ``Joan of Arc'' on CBS. And
they'll get those ratings. Viewers won't be able to resist seeing
Brandy and Ross together.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I tapped my feet while singing along with Brandy. (Ross'
music in the past 20 years hasn't moved me, so I elected to use
that wonderful fast-forward device). But I have to say: Shortly
after watching the tape of ``Double Platinum,'' I caught two of
Brandy's music videos on Black Entertainment Television. They had
more of a dramatic kick.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``City at Peace'' (6:30 p.m. Thursday, HBO) Barbra Streisand and
Cis Corman executive-produced this 90-minute documentary about what
happens when 60 teens from various backgrounds discover they have
more in common than they thought. It's a rich look at how social
and racial differences can be overcome when we set aside some of
our psychological baggage. The kids connect and learn about their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``City at Peace'' focuses on eight cast members, including a
high-school dropout whose past includes selling drugs, a girl who
struggles to keep togerher her suburban family, and a girl whose
parents are having difficulty with a gay, HIV-positive son.
</P>
<P>
   This is a well-crafted production which, if it doesn't entertain
you, at the very least will give you hope.

LOTS OF ROOM UNDER FIRST AMENDMENT'S UMBRELLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nude dancing. Flag burning. Political campaign contributions. A
Ku Klux Klan rally. Internet threats against abortion providers.
Voter initiatives. ``The Jenny Jones Show.'' Doom, the video game.
``Hustler'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, these appear as disparate issues. Yet at the
core of each sit the First Amendment and the right to free
expression for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment: 45 simple words that continue to fascinate
_ and sometimes frustrate _ folks across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the rights of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress
of grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Penned by James Madison more than 200 years ago, and ratified as
part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, the First Amendment is perhaps
the most widely known of the 10 amendments, although an
unscientific survey of people on the street recently revealed an
obvious gap in knowledge about just how many rights the amendment
covers. Many of the people could cite the speech, religion and
press components; assembly took some coaxing; forget about
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, everyone who was asked knew the Second Amendment _
the one that addresses the right to keep and bear arms _ which is
getting a lot high-profile attention these days as Congress and the
lawmakers in various statehouses wrestle with crafting more
gun-control legislation in the wake of the tragedy in Littleton,
Colo. But that, as they say, is another story for another day.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment considerations are also on Congress' mind. This
session is seeing yet another attempt to pass a constitutional
amendment to prohibit the desecration of the U.S. flag. At the risk
of alienating the affections of our nation's fine military veterans
_ men and women who served under the majestic banner of Old Glory _
Congress must see beyond the emotional hurt it will cause honorable
people and defeat the effort again.
</P>
<P>
   Government doesn't get to pick and choose which types of
expression are protected while making others unacceptable. Granted,
forms of speech do exist that can be actionable by law. You can't
threaten the president. Don't joke about having a gun or a bomb in
an airport. Most folks cite yelling, ``Fire!'' in a crowded
theater, although I've heard vigorous debates about whether that's
a First Amendment issue or one of inciting a public danger.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform has been stymied in part because of
First Amendment considerations. Attempts to regulate contributions
have passed court challenges, but not attempts to limit the amount
that a candidate can spend. Electoral spending facilitates
political speech, and that must remain unfettered. Government
doesn't get to single out a specific form of expression for
regulation, even if the form takes the shape of a
multimillion-dollar advertising buy.
</P>
<P>
   The recent $25 million jury verdict in the Jenny Jones civil
trial will undoubtedly be challenged on First Amendment grounds. As
reprehensible as her kind of televised garbage is _ setting up a
man to meet his secret admirer, and the admirer turns out to be
another man _ Jones, Warner Bros. and Telepictures Inc. did not put
a gun into Jonathan Schmitz's hands and force him to kill Scott
Amedure. The jury's disgust with the cesspool that is TV shock
shows was apparent, but the way to change television is to boycott
the sponsors or turn off the idiot box completely, not to trample
all over the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between speech and action is a tenuous one and
will continue to be tested in court, particularly as lawmakers get
sucked into the maelstrom of what role movies, videos and music may
play in influencing violent teen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, I often heard two contradictory phrases
uttered by friends and siblings when play took an ugly turn: ``Them
are fightin' words'' and ``Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but words can never hurt me.'' Little did I know that the same
First Amendment that protected my right to be a childish horse's
patoot then would one day protect my right to be a professional
horse's patoot now.

 Por JACK EPSTEIN 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO _ Despues de inaugurar a principios de este ano
la primera unidad contra delitos informaticos de Brasil, Marisa de
Oliveira Costa, de la policia de Belo Horizonte, encontro
rapidamente una razon para celebrar. En pocas semanas, la primera
jefa de la policia informatica brasilena encarcelo a un pirata de
software y atrapo a otro que habia publicado datos confidenciales
de una compania en la Internet. ``Seguimos muy de cerca a estos
delincuentes y ellos lo saben,'' dice De Oliveira, jefa de la
Unidad Especial contra Fraude Electronico y Delitos Informaticos.
 &HT;    Capturar a los delincuentes ciberneticos puede resultar mucho
mas facil que castigarlos. Los policias brasilenos tienen una
herramienta para combatir la pirateria: una nueva ley federal que
da al software la misma proteccion de los derechos de autor que a
los libros. Pero no hay leyes contra la pirateria informatica,
equivalente electronico del allanamiento, aunque crece la
popularidad de ese tipo de delito por diversion o por lucro. De
Oliveira uso una ley de 1996 contra la intercepcion de lineas
telefonicas para arrestar al pirata. La ley impone sentencias de
carcel por ``interceptar''informacion mediante la escucha
clandestina.
 &HT;    ``Hemos capturado a una docena de piratas, pero ninguno ha ido a
la carcel,'' dice Alberto Bastos, director de seguridad de Modulo
Security Solutions, empresa de software que elaboro programas para
proteger las computadoras que contaron los votos en la ultima
eleccion nacional.
 &HT;    La necesidad de una eficaz aplicacion de la ley va en aumento.
Los piratas informaticos brasilenos penetran audazmente en los
organismos estatales y empresas privadas a un ritmo dos veces
superior al de 1998. Recientemente, alguien casi llego a borrar el
website del Servicio Federal de Impuestos sobre la Renta. Otros se
han jactado en la Internet de haber penetrado en el Banco Bradesco,
aunque los funcionarios del mayor banco privado de Brasil lo
niegan. El Banco Central informa un promedio de tres asaltos en
linea al mes, pero los funcionarios dicen que las medidas de
seguridad son efectivas. ``Pienso que los piratas son muchachos que
no quieren causarnos problemas financieros, sino ganar fama
rompiendo las barreras que levantamos,'' comenta Roberto Ozu,
director del departamento de computadoras del banco.
 &HT;    Pero el dano que causan no es cosa de juegos. Un estudio de
Modulo muestra que una de cada tres grandes empresas ha sufrido una
falla de seguridad informatica y calcula que los piratas le cuestan
a las grandes firmas brasilenas un promedio de US$568.000 al ano
por interrupciones del trabajo, robo de informacion, fraude,
contratos perdidos y costos de investigaciones. Pocas empresas
informan a la policia.
 &HT;    Los piratas se llaman a si mismos ``alpinistas''en busca de la
emocion de ``llegar a la cumbre..' Proclaman sus conquistas en
paginas de la Web con nombres como Freecker, Hack n' Roll, Top
Hacker Brasil y Kingdom of Hackers. ``Suelen ser muchachos de 14 a
17 anos que intercambian informacion con piratas informaticos de
Estados Unidos y copian sus metodos,'' dice Julio Botelho, director
de tecnologia de la Universidad de Rio de Janeiro. Sin embargo,
algunos han creado mecanismos letales, como el llamado Leandro
Kelly, un virus que en 1998 comenzo a destruir informacion
almacenada en computadoras en Minas Gerais y de alli se extendio a
todo el planeta.
 &HT;    El aumento de la pirateria informatica esta directamente
relacionado con el crecimiento del uso de la Internet. Desde que la
red cibernetica se popularizo en Brasil en 1995, la cantidad de
suscriptores ha crecido a un ritmo impetuoso. Para el 2001, Brasil
debe tener 7 millones de personas en linea.
 &HT;    Los piratas adolescentes se aburren de las emociones simples y
pasan a actividades lucrativas. El delito financiero en linea mas
comun es el robo de numeros de tarjetas de credito y retirar fondos
de los 3 millones de brasilenos que usan servicios de banca en
casa. Otro delito es espiar para empresas que pagan por informacion
sobre estrategias comerciales de los competidores. ``Muchas
empresas estan tan mal preparadas para encarar a los piratas que
cuando golpean, no saben que paso``, dice Bastos, de Modulo.
 &HT;    La policia no esta en mejor situacion. ``El espionaje industrial
por computadora es un terreno completamente nuevo para nosotros,''
reconoce Mauro Silva, director de la Division de Policia de
Internet de Sao Paulo. Silva, que tomo un curso sobre delitos
informaticos en la sede del FBI en Estados Unidos, espera crear la
segunda unidad de policia cibernetica de Brasil a fines de este ano
y anima a las empresas a denunciar los delitos ciberneticos.
``Comprendo por que la mayoria guarda silencio. Digamos que se
roban cientos de numeros de tarjetas American Express. [La
compania] no quiere que el publico se entere,'' explica
 &HT;    A pesar de su crecimiento, los piratas informaticos brasilenos
todavia tienen que ganar mucha fama. No es asi en la vecina
Argentina, donde Julio Cesar Ardita, un estudiante de informatica
de 23 anos, conocido como El Griton, se declaro culpable el ano
pasado de penetrar en los sistemas de computadoras del Pentagono y
la NASA. Ardita estara tres anos en libertad condicional en
Argentina y pagara una multa de US$5.000.
 &HT;    Los funcionarios brasilenos han decidido que es hora de disuadir
a los jovenes piratas. En el Congreso se debaten por lo menos ocho
propuestas de ley para penalizar los delitos informaticos. Los
especialistas en seguridad y la flamante policia cibernetica
aplauden las medidas. Pero Carlos Alberto Teixeira, un ex pirata
informatico que cubre el sector para el diario carioca O Globo,
afirma que encarcelar a los infractores quiza no sea la respuesta
adecuada: ``Creara el primer martir de los piratas brasilenos y los
inspirara a ser mas destructivos,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Teixeira concuerda en que leyes mas severas y mas
policias ciberneticos convenceran al menos a los jovenes
aficionados a dedicarse a otras actividades, lo cual despejara el
terreno a De Oliveira y los otros ciberpolicias para que puedan
perseguir a los piratas mas empedernidos y controlar la situacion.

<P>
   A month shy of giving birth to her first child, Laura Pouzer, a
college chemistry teacher, reclines on a padded table at Johns
Hopkins University, the luxuriousness of her belly and her wit on
equal display as she takes the infamous Stroop stress test.
</P>
<P>
   Lists of words flash on a screen, each of them specifying a
color _ blue, yellow, white, purple _ but each printed in a color
other than the color it signifies. It is Pouzer's assignment to
call out, as quickly as possible, the colors the words appear in,
rather than the color they specify.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the slides over her shoulder and feel my brain lurch
and creak. I see the word ``blue,'' I think the word ``blue,'' the
tint it's written in be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Pouzer, though, is acing the Stroop, flying through the lists
without missing a beat or flubbing a shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect, perfect,'' says Kathleen Costigan, a researcher and
obstetrical nurse. ``You're awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pouzer barrels along, transponders taped to her belly reveal
two things: first, that she is enviably relaxed, her heart rate
slow and skin-conductance response flat; and second, that the
36-week-old male fetus within her is sleeping soundly. It is as
though the purity of the mother's mental concentration has lulled
the baby into long-wave bliss.
</P>
<P>
   The test over, the 28-year-old Pouzer nudges her eyeglasses up
her nose and shrugs. ``That wasn't too bad,'' she says to Costigan
and Janet DiPietro, a developmental psychologist. ``Much easier
than the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, thump, jab, squirm. Her fetus is awake.
Something about his mother has changed, and he is practically
knocking on the door of her uterine chamber to find out what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, in the laboratory of Yosinori Kuwabara and
his colleagues at Juntendou University in Tokyo, a fetal goat
floats in a clear acrylic tank the size of a large toaster oven,
bathed in eight quarts of artificial amniotic fluid kept at body
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Its umbilical cord is threaded to two machines that jointly
perform the nuts and bolts of a placenta, pumping in blood, oxygen
and nutrients and cleaning out waste. The fetus is almost 20 weeks
old, weighs about six pounds and has been living in its eerie
fishbowl of a universe since it was removed from its mother by
Caesarean section several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The creature behaves like any other prenatal goat, blinking its
soft black eyes and kicking its slender white limbs. Should it
survive for two more weeks, to the full 21-week goat term, it will
be ``born'': lifted out of the tank and its umbilicus cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his co-workers are striving to create a viable
artificial womb, a system to sustain a developing infant when the
real womb won't or can't do. So far, the researchers have managed
to keep their goats-on-a-rope alive for up to 10 days, and they are
getting closer to understanding why the artificial environment
eventually fails its charges.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists hesitate when asked when their experimental
uterus will be ready for human use, but others happily speculate
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of difficult technical problems to be
overcome,'' says Malcolm Levene, professor of pediatrics and child
health at the University of Leeds in England. ``But I see them as
being soluble in the next 5 to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In vivo, in vitro, the womb in two views: one, the mother's
belly, the sum of humanity's yesterdays, the umbilicus the original
apron string that yokes us all to the body's throbbing loneliness
and joy; and the other, the acrylic baby bumper, an embryonic
technology that has the seductive flash of the eternal tomorrow, of
the airplane foil, the computer screen, the crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as polarized as the two vignettes of the uterus initially
appear, they are both, in the end, about the future. Tales of
reproduction and birth have always been about the future, about
extending the shelf life of your longings and fantasies beyond your
personal expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my child will revolutionize art; maybe my child will help
colonize Mars. People have always dreamed of consorting with gods
and bearing immortal progeny, or suckling at the breast of the
Virgin Mary to attain eternal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Being the natural currency of tomorrow, the topic of human
fertility lends itself to the wildest sci-fi spasms and millennial
speculations. And as though to oblige our fixation on big round
numbers, our high priests and priestesses of fecundity, our
reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, gynecologists and
geneticists, lately have pipetted up an unceasing supply of
millennialist material.
</P>
<P>
   Postmenopausal women have gestated their daughters' eggs and
given birth to their own grandchildren. Congenitally infertile men
can have their dysfunctional sperm mechanically rammed into the
body of an egg, and thus sire sons who inherit the once
uninheritable: the fathers' sterility. An older woman's fading egg,
and the chromosomes it enfolds, can be rejuvenated through the
addition of the rich, viscous cytoplasm from a younger woman's egg.
</P>
<P>
   If that chimeric gamete is then fertilized and transferred into
the womb of a third woman for gestation, the resulting child can
claim three biological mothers: chromosomal mom, cytoplasmic mom
and gestational mom.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little couplet said it all: mother's baby, father's
maybe. Now DNA tests can pretty well settle the question of
biological paternity, while the issue of biological maternity has
been sufficiently muddied to demand the regular intercession of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being forced to rethink the whole concept of
motherhood,'' says George J. Annas, chairman of the department of
health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. ``I
never thought that would happen in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   These goggle-eyed tomorrow scenes are already today's tomorrows,
if not yesterday's. There are more to come, of course, many more.
Most of them can't be predicted or described in any detail, but
each will surely force us to think better and harder than we're
used to about two mighty piers of life's foundation: power and
love.
</P>
<P>
   How much power can we have over the timing and circumstances of
our reproduction? And does that power give us greater freedom, or
does it deprive us of one of life's most unsung freedoms: the
freedom to have things happen on their own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't choose to have children, they just get
pregnant,'' says R. Alta Charo, professor of law and medical ethics
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. ``Reproductive
technologies cumulatively reduce the range of events that happen by
serendipity and increase the range of events that happen by active
planning. This changes the texture of life. One of the rights we
have is the right to not have to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fertility fetishes also bring us face to face with our
concept of love, and what it means to love our children, and what
inspires that love or sullies it. Can we love a child who is
genetically unrelated to us? Of course; every parent of an adopted
child knows as much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet infertile couples go to extraordinary lengths to give birth
to a genetically related baby, and their hunger to see their
chromosomes represented in the next generation has inspired many of
the new reproductive manipulations. But does the quest to have
genetically related offspring mean that we are delighted with
ourselves, our spouses, our extant genomic kin?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to people who say how important it is that their
children be theirs, and who think of adoption as a terrible last
resort, I say to them, `Oh, you must be so close to your parents
and your siblings,''' says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at
the City University of New York. ``They say, `No, I haven't seen my
brother in three years _ he's a real jerk.' So I reply, `What makes
you think it will be different for you and your genetically related
children?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the emerging technologies exemplify the profound tension
and interdependency between power and love, between our hopes and
nattering fears for tomorrow, as medicine does what we demand that
it do, and plays the stork through any kind of outrageous weather.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial uterus is one technology: In this we see the
ultimate attempt to control gestation, which means to control
ourselves, the personal plant. The other is genetic enhancement,
the attempt to improve or select some of an embryo's traits _ that
is, to control our children.
</P>
<P>
   They are both coming, if not in 10 years, then in 15 or 50. If
we can tinker, we will tinker, and when it comes to our kids, we'll
hammer ourselves deaf, bent and bruised, until we hammer ourselves
away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in
``The Dialectics of Sex'' about the need for an artificial uterus,
a way to remove the act of reproduction from the female body and
thus free women from what she saw as the source of their biological
servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his colleagues are not working on the artificial
uterus as a nod to female liberation, of course. They're doing it
with the hope of helping extremely premature infants, those born
before 22 or 23 weeks of gestation, the current outer limit of
salvageability, when the fetus is meant to be an aquatic animal,
suspended in solution, its fragile gelatinous flesh shielded from
the brutality of air or touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artificial wombs will begin as a response to the needs of
women who are unable to carry a baby through to term,'' says
Marshall Marinker, a visiting professor of general practice at the
University of London. ``But like so many things in medicine, what
begins as a response to illness may become a lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at Viagra, he says. It began as a drug for clinical
impotence and now is seen as a recreational means to megapotence.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, horrors, the mother who would choose to turn her fetus over
to a burbling laboratory broth!
</P>
<P>
   Mary B. Mahowald, a professor at the MacLean Center for Clinical
Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, believes that the
demand for an artificial uterus will be negligible and that most
women view pregnancy as a whole-body thrill, one of life's few
genuine odysseys.
</P>
<P>
   She published a study in 1997 in the Journal of Women's Health
in which she asked women the following question: If you could
either gestate a baby using a donor egg or have your own egg
gestated by a surrogate mother, but couldn't do both, which would
you choose? A slight majority opted for gestation with donor egg.
``Many women feel that there's a relationship you can develop with
the fetus during pregnancy that men are not privy to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But when I posed Mahowald's question to a dozen friends
and colleagues, some of them mothers, some of them not, a slight
majority opted for having their personal eggs baked in a surrogate
womb. ``The idea of being pregnant seems noxious to me,'' explained
one woman, a childless professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   When I further told my respondents to imagine that they had had
a hysterectomy but wanted a child and asked if they would prefer to
have their eggs gestated by a surrogate human mother or in an
artificial womb, a sizable majority opted for the artificial womb.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the thought of a fake Frankenstein-ian uterus was not
as disturbing to them as the prospect of dealing with a genuine
surrogate mother, who might get drunk or smoke while pregnant or
demand visitation rights after birth.
</P>
<P>
   If we cannot blithely assume that every woman who wants to have
children wants to be pregnant _ if some women, like many men, find
the prospect noxious _ then we are left to wonder just how bad it
might be for a fetus to spend much of its tenure in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the artificial uterus may be reasonably proficient at
performing the basics of nutrient delivery and the exchange of
blood gases. But what of the rest, the spectacular rest that is the
maternal-fetal dyad, an exquisite push-me-pull-you relationship
millions of years in the forging?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to DiPietro's country, the land of blinkered darkness.
DiPietro is one of the only scientists in the world who are
studying the relationship between maternal and fetal behavior.
Doctors have spent a lot of time tracking how the fetus grows and
when its various organs and sensory capabilities mature: the fetus
as an independent operator, the free-floating homunculus at the end
of ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro herself was performing such an orthodox study about 10
years ago. She was electronically monitoring the progress of a
fetus that happened to be gestating in the belly of a nurse who
worked in a neonatal intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be conversational, DiPietro asked the woman if it
bothered her to be around desperately sick newborns while she
herself was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Not really, except once,''' DiPietro recalls.
``That was when her office was used as a temporary morgue for the
newborns that had died.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, DiPietro's monitors detected a big surge in heart
rate. ``At first, I thought it was the nurse's heart rate going up
at the memory,'' she says. ``But then I realized it was the fetus's
heart. It was racing. It was an instantaneous reaction.'' The nurse
remembered that she had felt a suffocating grief, and her fetus
fairly keened in reply.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, DiPietro changed her focus from tracking
prenatal development to the study of the behavioral interplay
between mother and fetus. She wanted to know whether a woman's mood
or temperament or stress level had any impact on her fetus. If so,
how, why, when, to what end? If not, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous _ the questions just haven't been asked,'' she
says. ``Women have their ideas. Anecdotes abound. There are
references in the Bible and in Shakespeare about how a mother's
emotions affect the fetus. But our scientific knowledge is utterly
crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's emotions have to affect an infant's temperament,
they have to,'' she says, at once earnest and matter-of-fact. ``A
fetus is bathed in maternal hormones, chemicals, peptides, at just
the time when its brain is forming.''
</P>
<P>
   But personal conviction is one thing; proof is another. And so
DiPietro studies pregnant women and their fetuses and puts women
like Pouzer through stressful quizzes to see how they and their
babies react and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning, what is a new scientific finding, is
that, yes, the fetus does respond to its mother's emotions,'' she
says. ``Sometimes the reaction of the fetus, in terms of heart rate
and movement, is even more pronounced than the reaction of the
mother. That reactivity is not necessarily a bad thing. The arousal
must be doing something to its nervous system, perhaps helping to
drive brain development, but we don't know that yet for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother provides such a complex, labile environment for the
fetus. She gets up, she sits down, she shifts position. She eats
something different, it affects the amniotic fluid. When she
laughs, she shakes the baby around really vigorously.'' DiPietro
waves her arms in the air to demonstrate. ``Who knows? That could
be why we like roller-coaster rides _ and why they make us laugh
even while we're screaming.''

<P>
   Not long ago, Ann Winblad, a successful venture capitalist well
known on the high-tech circuit, stood up to speak at a conference.
She tapped the microphone and inquired sweetly, ``Does this pick up
women's voices?''
</P>
<P>
   If Winblad, with a sterling track record and millions yet to
invest, can ask that, consider what it's like for most women.
</P>
<P>
   We now get the mike at conferences in part because organizers
are consciously trying to balance things, and in part because many
of us simply deserve it _ but over all, women still have trouble
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Can cyberspace change that? Or will it, like so many other tools
and technologies, simply become a way for the old order to
reinforce itself?
</P>
<P>
   Powerful tools in powerful hands tend to increase the
concentration of power, but the Internet isn't just a tool. It's a
medium that may change the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some history. Long ago, women's work was defined by
women's bodies. They bore children and were generally weaker.
Gradually, as work became less physical and personal service became
a commodity rather than something one did at home, women joined the
work force as nurses, servants and governesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the world industrialized and dexterity began to matter more
than strength, they became machine operators. In many semiconductor
plants, especially overseas in countries where discrimination is
legal, women are still preferred today for their smaller fingers
and the precision with which they can work. And as work began to
include information, many women became telephone operators,
typists, clerks and secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Then economic pressures started changing society and social
changes began affecting work patterns. As our economy has grown and
become ever more competitive, the stock market and other pressures
are focusing on performance rather than status, and capable women
have begun to get the work they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people are promoted more for performance;
businesses can't afford to do otherwise in a competitive market.
Women can get good jobs based on performance _ at least up to the
highest reaches of many companies.
</P>
<P>
   I wish that were reliably true. Twenty years ago, we thought
that the high-tech world would by now be different, that women
would succeed in large numbers because this was a world where
performance counted. It hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Women still have a tough time making it into management. We're
still socialized to look to men for leadership. Power is based not
on performance alone but on presence and personality _ and
perceptions of personality. In business, women still face a
different world from men.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the first board meeting of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I ever attended, way back in 1990 or 1991. I had been
invited to join the board by Mitch Kapor, the entrepreneur and
developer of Lotus 1-2-3, and an enlightened person if ever there
was one. I knew the other board members, who all respected me. But
I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Why? I couldn't imagine any
reason other than that I spoke with a female voice. It was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   These were no traditional troglodytes in suits; they were my
kind of people, striving to build a new world on the Net. (At the
next meeting we had a female facilitator, and it went a lot
better.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a common experience for other women and girls, from
second-grade classrooms to boardrooms. And the high-tech industry
is really no better than most. I've been to meetings where a woman
ventures a comment and is ignored. Minutes later a man makes the
same point and is noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as high-tech products are being integrated into
day-to-day business, people are using the Internet not just to
order products and retrieve information but also to communicate.
They use it to discuss issues, manage teams, negotiate contracts.
There's enough Net time for people _ women, that is _ to establish
themselves without a physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's the users of the Internet, rather than the
sellers of the Internet, that are changing fastest. As a
communications medium where personal presence is primarily text and
sex differences are not immediately visible, the Internet is
tailor-made to help women finally find their voices.
</P>
<P>
   And if women feel (rightly or wrongly) stifled in corporate
environments, they can more easily strike out for themselves. The
information, access and productivity once available only to big
businesses are now accessible to individual entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the interim chairman of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), I have become part of a
world full of discussions over so-called mailing lists, where
people E-mail their ideas to large groups for comment. It's not a
gender-free or character-free world. But gender is less noticeable
in our interactions on line. What are noticeable are the words on
the screen: Does this person make sense?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started, the names meant nothing; now I have some
notion of what to expect from each: insight, whining, skepticism.
Yes, people have on-line personalities, but their sex does not
generally color how people read their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   On these networks, women write in the same variety of ways as
men. But you can say your piece and post it without being
interrupted midway. The Net enforces a certain fairness by putting
everything up on the screen without fear or favor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are filtering tools, and there are certain people
many people filter out. But that usually has to do with content,
not gender.
</P>
<P>
   On line, I'm sure some people may filter me out, but it doesn't
happen the way it does off line _ unconsciously. Yes, people may
discount what women write, but they are more likely to read it. My
on-line voice does not have a high pitch of the kind that many men
find hard, for whatever reason, to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Another common experience of women _ having your good idea
picked up later and attributed to someone else _ is less likely to
happen on the Web. There's a record, and there are subtle ways of
pointing back to it if you are missed.
</P>
<P>
   Net-based discussion is likely to become increasingly important
in the way teams of people communicate, in politics, business or
other endeavors. It is important for women to join this on-line
world. But leadership goes beyond discussion to carrying things
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It requires making decisions that can't be made by consensus;
it's about absorbing the uncertainty everyone feels by making a
decision and taking responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not something most women are trained to do. But I'm
hopeful that on-line experience will help. The Net won't change
everything, but it's one more tool to overcome the destiny of
biology. The explicit rule is that we're equal, and new habits may
make it so. The ability to earn money at work has made a huge
difference in the balance of power at home.
</P>
<P>
   May the ability to be heard at work now make a huge difference
in the balance of power out in the world.

<P>
   When I was in my 20s and inhabiting rooming houses, I was given
a book called ``Cooking in a Bedsitter,'' by the formidable
Katharine Whitehorn. It pointed out that although I was living in
squalor, I didn't have to live in total squalor. With a hot plate,
some herbs and a little foresight, a degree of elegance might be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   I have been a grateful reader of such advice books and their
variants, women's magazine articles, ever since. (Grateful, though
sometimes bemused: Do I really want to marbleize an end table or
make a gingerbread chalet? Not today.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of such advice; nor is there any shortage of
women dishing it out. Where did they come from, all these kindly,
bossy, ersatz aunts, whether real or invented _ Fannie Farmer,
Betty Crocker, Martha Stewart and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   I'd say they trace their lineage to Mrs. Isabella Beeton.
</P>
<P>
   For most of our millennium, the few advice books for women were
likely to be religious or moral. Often the only women who could
read were nuns or noblewomen, and housework and cooking were done
by servants. If you were of the higher orders you supervised them,
a skill in itself; if not, you learned the basics from your mother
or from other servants.
</P>
<P>
   Advice books didn't arrive until the rise of a literate middle
class. The ``new money'' created in the 19th century by the
Industrial Revolution often meant young brides who were not only
unprepared to run large establishments but who were also unversed
in the manners required in the polite society to which they'd been
elevated.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the professional advisers, often calling themselves
``A Lady,'' offering bits and pieces of what you might require: a
cookbook here, an etiquette primer there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton was thus by no means the first of her kind. But
``Beeton's Book of Household Management'' was the first to use
tested recipes, with costs and sample menus. It was also the first
comprehensive book on running a household, telling readers what to
pay their servants and how to remove spots from lace. In addition,
the book had many helpful illustrations. (What does a stair brush
look like? How do you tell one breed of pig from another?)
</P>
<P>
   From her name, which suggests a round, industrious busybody,
you'd expect Mrs. Beeton to have been at least 40. Not a bit of it.
She was born in 1836, and through the death of her father and the
remarriage of her mother, she became the oldest girl in a family of
21 children, which gave her ample experience coping with domestic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 23 when she began her magnum opus, in successive
numbers of The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, published by her
husband's company; it appeared in book form in 1861. She was
compiling a cooking dictionary and writing a book on needlework
when she died of childbed fever after the birth of her fourth
child. She was 29.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton is direct in her style and equally clear about her
aims. ``What moved me ... to attempt a work like this,'' she says
in her introduction, ``was the discomfort and suffering I had seen
brought upon men and women by household management. I have always
thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent
than a housewife's badly cooked dinners and untidy ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you keep ``a comfortable home,'' she warns, the husbands
will flee to their ``clubs, well-ordered taverns and dining
houses''; it is with these that a wife must compete.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for her success was her acknowledgment of human
frailty. She knew that servants' references were likely to skimp on
truth, so she told employers to visit the reference giver: If her
own house is a wreck, don't hire the servant.
</P>
<P>
   She knew you could get caught short, so she explained not only
how to make butter but also how to make butter in a hurry. (Put the
cream in a bottle and shake it.)
</P>
<P>
   She advised the young wife about almost everything _ the
importance of keeping accounts, the best conversational topics
(entertaining histories), what to wear (green goes well with
violet) and how to spend evenings at home (the ladies do
needlework; the man reads aloud from some ``good standard work or
amusing publication'').
</P>
<P>
   And that's just in the first 17 pages. Her book is more than
1,000 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything Mrs. Beeton left out that she might cover now?
Germs; they hadn't really hit the scene. And sex, of course, which
was unprintable.
</P>
<P>
   About ``female emancipation'' she was dubious, but far from
being a delicate Angel in the House, a Beeton woman was the
Generalissimo in the House, commanding an army of servants, men
included. Her work was emphatically work, and required
intelligence, tact, character, energy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her advice is dated now, but her insight and common
sense endure. For Mrs. Beeton life is an art, and its aim is
enjoyment, one's own included. The woman practicing this art must
be a stage manager, but she is also the lead actress, saying her
lines effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   And the details of this art, which some _ men, for instance _
might consider frivolous, are actually of deep importance, because
on them depends the happiness of all.

 A KNIGHT TO REMEMBER: LIAM NEESON IN `STAR WARS'

 Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Liam Neeson
in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some days Liam Neeson spends his time working with Oscar-winning
actors like Ben Kingsley, Meryl Streep and Debra Winger.
 &HT;    Other days, he's playing opposite Jar-Jar Binks.
 &HT;    Actually, Neeson says, the challenge of playing a character like
his Oscar-nominated role in Steven Spielberg's acclaimed 1993 drama
``Schindler's List'' isn't that different from playing Jedi knight
Qui-Gon Jinn opposite the computer-generated Jar-Jar in ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day, you still have to act,'' Neeson says.
``There's still something you have to convey and share, be it
`Where's the nearest spacecraft? Let's get out of here' or whatever
other line you can think of.
 &HT;    ``You can't take it lightly or try to overplay it.''
 &HT;    Neeson brings genuine warmth and humanity to his ``Phantom
Menace'' role as mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and
protector to young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). But he says he
signed on not for the chance to wield a lightsaber or intone ``May
the Force be with you'' _ though he admits that that was ``cool'' _
but to work with the franchise's very own Yoda, writer/director
George Lucas.
 &HT;    ``George is the ultimate Jedi master,'' Neeson says during a
conversation at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan. ``You know that his
knowledge of cameras and his competency at making movies and
telling stories on celluloid is extraordinary, but he never forces
that on you _ it's just a given.
 &HT;    ``His direction was just perfect for what we were doing,'' the
actor says. ``Eight times out of 10 his direction would be, `Speak
a little faster on that line' or `When you turn, pick him up with
your right hand instead of your left.'
 &HT;    ``What he does is employ you because you're a good carpenter,
because you're a good actor, because you're a good scenic
designer,'' Neeson concludes. ``And then he lets you get on with
it.''
 &HT;    His performance as Qui-Gon, the Irishman reveals, combined
elements of Lucas and of Alan Ladd as the lone gunslinger in the
classic 1953 Western ``Shane,'' with a bit of Alec Guinness's regal
turn as a Jedi elder in ``Star Wars'' thrown in for continuity's
sake.
 &HT;    As for the lightsaber duels with the lethal Darth Maul (Ray
Park), Neeson benefited from the training he received years ago as
a top-ranked amateur boxer. The broadsword style he learned for the
1995 period epic ``Rob Roy'' didn't hurt, either.
 &HT;    Neeson spent much of the shoot acting in front of blue screens
and ``reacting'' to special effects and computer-generated
characters that would be added long afterward. Many actors are
thrown by this sort of thing, but Neeson says it doesn't make that
big a difference.
 &HT;    ``Acting is a leap of the imagination,'' he says. ``It's
`Imagine you're a king' or `Imagine you're a fairy.'
 &HT;    ``As wonderful as the technology _ the hovercrafts and the
machines _ was on `Star Wars,' it was the actors who sold it with
their nonchalance,'' he adds. ``To them, it was everyday stuff.
Mark Hamill jumps into his speedster and _ phooooph! _ he's off.
 &HT;    ``He sold it as much as the magicians did afterwards, and I
tried to do the same.''
 &HT;    While the faithful revel in ``Star Wars'' mania, slurping soda
from Qui-Gon cans, stockpiling Queen Amidala action figures and
seeking to find deep meaning in the apparently immaculate
conception of Anakin, Neeson is still pondering the whole
phenomenon.
 &HT;    ``It is just a film, but maybe for some little 9-or-10-year-old
boy it's something else,'' he says thoughtfully.
 &HT;    ``The whole culture around `Star Wars' is fascinating and kind
of strange to me,'' the actor says. ``It has something to do with
the psyche of all of us as human beings that we recognize these
incredible mythological stories, these fairy tales. Fairy tales
exist to bring a very complex world into an understandable form
that helps us through life.''
 &HT;    Neeson's next role is as a ghostbuster in Jan De Bont's horror
movie ``The Haunting,'' opening on July 23. Then he'll play a
neurotic spy opposite Sandra Bullock in ``Gun Shy'' and, he hopes,
star in an adaptation of ``Asylum'' with Natasha Richardson, his
wife and the mother of their two young sons.
 &HT;    And who knows, you may spot him at your neighborhood multiplex,
taking in ``The Phantom Menace.'' He does plan to catch it again,
he says.
 &HT;    ``I've seen it once,'' he says. ``It was like being very hungry
and having somebody bring in a tray of all your favorite foods _
but you only have time to grab the French fries before the tray is
taken away.''
 &HT;    Neeson laughs.
 &HT;    ``So I need to see it a few more times just to digest it all.''

   NEW-THINKTANK (Washington) _ In Thinktankland, both conservative
and liberal groups have competed for years to convert their ideas
about taxes, foreign policy, the environment or whatever into
policy in the real world. But since the beginning of this year, a
new entry, the New America Foundation, has been trying to change
the think tank landscape. New America seeks to introduce younger
voices, break out of the traditional liberal and conservative
categories and produce unconventional ideas. Yet no matter how many

rumblings of discontent about Ellison's persistent defense of
American ideals and his ``elitist'' esthetic demands. And matters

   The call of a male Majorcan midwife toad keeps females ripening
their eggs in anticipation of sex, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lea, a postgraduate student at the Open University in
Milton Keynes, England, has studied three groups of female Majorcan
midwife toads, Alytes muletensis. All the toads had ripening eggs
in their ovaries. To one group, Lea played synthesized versions of
the male calls. A second group heard the call of a different
species, while the third heard no calls at all.
</P>
<P>
   After a month, females from the first group had many eggs that
were ripe and ready for ovulation, while the females in the other
two groups had hardly any ripe eggs. Lea speculates that
stimulation of the female's auditory nerve fibers causes hormone
release in the part of the brain that controls reproductive
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The finding makes sense given the sex roles of Majorcan midwife
toads, says Lea. The males are in short supply because after
fertilizing the eggs they are celibate for a month while they raise
the brood on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''The males carry the eggs down the cliff faces to the pools
where they develop into tadpoles,'' Lea says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, females squabble over remaining males, who advertise
their readiness to mate by calling. Some females don't find a
partner for the entire breeding season. There's no point in wasting
energy ripening eggs that have no hope of being fertilized, Lea
says.

   Zachary Ruffing was born almost blind. The bones in his head and
shoulders are deformed and he has difficulty using his mouth, but
according to his lawyer, Amanda Hawes, he's bright.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to be an astronomer,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Zachary and his parents are trying to pin the
blame on one of the world's most powerful corporations. When he was
conceived and born in 1985, both his parents worked at an IBM
semiconductor plant in East Fishkill, N.Y., where they claim they
were exposed to a variety of solvents and other toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 140 other workers and children, they are now suing
Big Blue for compensation. Their case, the first of its kind, will
come to court this October.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic in Scotland, Grace Morrison, 57, blames
another American company, National Semiconductor, for the cancers
that killed her sister and her friend _ and nearly killed her. She
is leading a group of 70 women who say they were exposed to
chemicals at the company's plant in Greenock. The women are
launching a legal battle in Scotland for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The manufacture of semiconductors is a dirty, dangerous
business,'' Morrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Both IBM and National Semiconductor deny responsibility for
birth defects and cancers among workers and their children _ and it
will be hard to prove them wrong. But there is mounting evidence
that women in the chip-making industry do suffer an increased risk
of spontaneous abortion and that exposure to solvents may cause
congenital deformities.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing use of computers over the past few decades has
fueled an explosive growth in the microelectronics industry. From
its origins in California's Silicon Valley, it has spread
throughout Europe and Asia, and now employs more than a million
people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   There are 900 chip-making plants and a further 100 planned,
supplying a worldwide market worth more than $150 billion a year.

   ''Because of its growth and size,'' says Douglas Andrey of the
United States Semiconductor Industry Association, ''the chip
industry is the pivotal driver of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor industry may also be a world leader in another
way, according to Joseph LaDou, director of the International
Center for Occupational Medicine at the University of California in
San Francisco. ''What was once thought to be the first 'clean'
industry is actually one of the most chemical-intensive industries
ever conceived,'' he says. In the process of making, etching and
doping silicon chips, workers can be exposed to hundreds of
chemicals, including solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners fear that as the industry expands rapidly in the Far
East _ where safety standards are generally slacker _ birth defects
will be the unfortunate growth industry following right behind. Ted
Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a
campaign group in California, says: ''The dirtier and more
labor-intensive processes are increasingly being shuffled to
underdeveloped countries throughout the global South, creating a
whole system of environmental and economic injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   LaDou points out that many of the chemicals present in the
factories, such as arsenic and benzene, are known carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   In a semiconductor plant, much of the work takes place in
''clean rooms'' in which everyone has to wear head-to-toe bunny
suits. Unfortunately, this environment is designed to protect
sensitive chips, not the health of employees. The air in such rooms
is usually recirculated through filters to remove dust, but not
replenished with clean air from outside, says LaDou. Toxic fumes
are simply recycled.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks this may explain why U.S. Department of Labor
statistics show that rates of occupational illness in American
semiconductor plants caused by ''caustic, noxious and allergenic
substances'' are three times as high as in other manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent study to raise doubts about the safety of
semiconductor workers is one of the most dramatic. In Canada,
doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto reported in
March this year that 13 out of 125 pregnant women exposed to
workplace solvents gave birth to children with major congenital
malformations, such as spina bifida or deafness.
</P>
<P>
   This compares to only one out of 125 women in jobs where they
were not exposed to solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Hawes says this evidence will help Zachary Ruffing and her other
clients in their claims against IBM because many of the solvents to
which the women in the study were exposed are commonplace in
semiconductor plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''For people who have lived through this, it is not a mystery.
It is an outrage,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   IBM says it does not comment on any matter that is the subject
of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''IBM employs very rigorous safety standards in all parts of its
business,'' says a company spokesman in New York, ''and we believe
the facts are on our side.''

<P>
   Viruses that rip bacteria apart have been harnessed in a new
test that can reveal dangerous bacteria in blood, pharmaceuticals
and food.
</P>
<P>
   The test was jointly developed by English scientists at the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency lab at Porton Down in
Wiltshire and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's
Central Science Laboratory in York.
</P>
<P>
   Melenie Murphy, a senior scientist in the DERA team, says that
the viral test can pinpoint contaminated food in eight hours _
compared with the two to three days it currently takes to grow
colonies of bacteria from samples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is for a test which goes from sample to answer within
eight hours, even if as few as 100 bacteria are present,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The test has two major components. The first is a bacteriophage,
a virus harmless to people but lethal to specific strains of
bacteria. By selecting the right bacteriophage, the researchers can
tailor the test to spot particular types of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The second component is luciferase, the enzyme which creates the
glow in the tails of fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Suitable bacteriophages are readily available in the
environment. ''You just go to the local sewage works and pan for
what you're looking for,'' Murphy says.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, unveiled last week, the blood, drug or food sample
is mixed with bacteriophages which are known to detect a target
organism such as Salmonella enteritidis, which causes severe food
poisoning. Once the phages have invaded cells of S. enteritidis,
they multiply and burst out, breaking open the cell wall within 40
minutes and spilling its contents into solution.
</P>
<P>
   When luciferase is added to the mixture, it reacts with
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which has leaked from the burst cells.
This produces a characteristic yellow glow, but not enough ATP
oozes out to give a glow strong enough for detection. So to make
the light brighter, the researchers add adenosine diphosphate
(ADP). An enzyme called adenylate kinase, which also oozes out of
the burst cells, converts this to ATP The result is a glow 40 times
brighter than that created by the original ATP alone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the researchers began their project in January, they have
detected both S. enteritidis and Escherichia coli using the test.
They now plan to turn it into a commercial system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a home food-poisoning tester that uses different
principles to DERA's is being developed by Matsushita of Japan. In
two to three years, the company hopes to detect food-poisoning
bacteria in just 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Matsushita's system also detects harmless dead cells which
may have been killed by pasteurization, says Murphy, whereas the
DERA test only picks up live bacteria which pose a threat.

   Spiders kill off insects and help plants boost seed production
in exchange for dollops of sugary nectar, say scientists in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Many species of plants produce enticing nectar bonuses known as
extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). The EFNs attract ants which defend
the plant against leaf-eating insects in return for the sweet
treats. Some tropical tree species can die without the ants'
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few spiders are known to take an interest in EFNs. To
find out more, Steven Handel and Scott Ruhren from the State
University of New Jersey in New Brunswick studied the interactions
between jumping spiders from the genera Eris and Metaphidippus, and
a yellow-flowered legume (Chamaecrista nictitans) common to the
eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse experiments showed the spiders jumped onto plants
with active EFNs six times more often than they visited those
without, and regularly ate the extra nectar. The plants also
benefited from the spiders' presence in the field, with seed
production rising by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first evidence that spiders can increase plants'
fitness in terms of seed production,'' says Handel. ''It's a
completely unexpected link in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Most spiders sit and wait for their prey, says Handel, but
jumping spiders move around and are aggressive _ just like the ants
that protect trees. Handel suspects the spiders play as vital a
role as ants in protecting plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people hate spiders. Now there is finally one reason to
like them,'' he says.

SOMETIMES YOU GET MORE THAN YOU PAY FOR

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says you can't buy a roomy, comfortable, elegant and
mechanically reliable midsize sedan for under $20,000?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who does hasn't looked at the 1999 Hyundai Sonata. Prices
start at $15,000, even with air-conditioning and power windows and
door locks.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hyundai's reputation in the U.S. market is somewhat
tarnished, and you can't make a second first impression, as the old
saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   If American consumers could take a second look at Hyundai and
forget their first impression based on the Mitsubishi-designed
subcompact that Hyundai wishes it could forget, perhaps this South
Korean automaker could regain a measure of sales success in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned 1999 Sonata is perhaps is the best-kept secret in
the midsize class.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent car, with quality evident throughout. Its
comfort, performance and styling are on par with those of the
sector leaders: the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is as comfortable as you'll find in this class. The
vehicle isn't as quiet as a Camry, because the engine is a bit
noisy at high revolutions. But this really isn't a problem; the
noise isn't loud enough to be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is typical for an Asian sedan, and it corners
well. There is plenty of power with either the four- or
six-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are very comfortable, and three adults
can sit side by side in the rear bench seat, with adequate knee
room. The trunk holds 13.2 cubic feet of cargo, which is about a
cubic foot less than the Camry and Accord, yet still adequate for
most needs.
</P>
<P>
   Styling is among the Sonata's strong points. It's not a
cookie-cutter copy of any of its competitors, yet it has a
pleasant, modern look that compares well with cars in its class.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata even comes with side air bags for the front seat
occupants _ one of the first in its class to include this safety
feature. Sonata has advanced air bag technology: The passenger
front air bag will not activate unless more than 66 pounds of
weight is detected in the seat, and the side air bag won't deploy
unless at least 33 pounds is detected _ both great protective
features for small children riding up front. (Of course, the safest
place for children is in the back seat.)
</P>
<P>
   The best part is the price: The Sonata is thousands of dollars
less than most comparable midsize sedans.
</P>
<P>
   A base Sonata GL, with a 16-valve, 2.4-liter inline
four-cylinder engine, lists for an unbelievably low $15,799,
complete with four-speed automatic transmission, air-conditioning,
power windows and door locks, AM/FM/cassette stereo, tilt steering
wheel, rear defroster, wheel covers and dual remote-control outside
mirrors. The engine, rated at 149 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of
torque, is among the most powerful four-cylinders in this class.
</P>
<P>
   A base Camry is $17,838 _ $2,037 more _ but then you have to add
$1,005 for the air-conditioning and $780 for the power windows and
door locks.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the Camry's base price, with a 133-horsepower
four-cylinder engine, higher than the base price of the uplevel
Sonata GLS ($17,799), which comes with a 2.5-liter V-6 engine and
lots of extras not found on the four-cylinder Sonata or the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   A four-cylinder Accord, equipped comparably to the $15,799
Sonata, lists for $19,190. Even the cheapest Taurus, the
best-selling American car, lists for $17,445, but then you have to
add a few dollars' worth of accessories, such as the AM/FM/cassette
stereo, to match the content of the $15,799 Sonata. (Granted, the
Taurus comes with a V-6 engine, but it has 145 horsepower _ four
less than the power of the Hyundai four-cylinder engine.)
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the Camry or Accord would hold its value
better, so that in the long run, the consumer would make up the
difference between the two prices when the vehicle is resold.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many consumers _ and I'm among them _ who prefer
to pay less upfront and then to keep a car for a long time to get
their money's worth out of the vehicle. This strategy makes the
Sonata an outstanding buy _ in fact, the best buy in the midsize
sedan segment.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to spend $20,000 on a midsize sedan, then our test
car _ a fully equipped Sonata GLS V-6 (including leather seats and
wood interior trim!) _ would give you a lot more for your money
than any vehicle in this class.
</P>
<P>
   At a total sticker of $19,077, our Sonata GLS was $5,000 less
than a comparably equipped Accord and nearly $6,000 less than a
Camry. That means that for the same monthly payment you would make
for an entry-level Camry or Accord, you could enjoy a
top-of-the-line Sonata, riding genuine style and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there isn't much prestige. So if image is what you're
looking for, spend the extra bucks and go with a Honda or Camry,
or, hey, even a baby Lexus or Acura.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe that anyone who sees your new Hyundai GLS, takes a
ride in it with you, and then looks at the sticker price will
understand: You're a practical person who makes sound financial
decisions and still has a really nice car to show for it. The
Sonata, then, does make a positive statement on your behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the particulars on our test model GLS:
</P>
<P>
   The double-overhead-cam, 24-valve V-6 engine is rated at 170
horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the base price of $17,799 (plus $435 transportation)
are power windows and door locks, four-speed electronically
controlled automatic transmission with adaptive logic, power rack
and pinion steering, four-wheel power disc brakes (most of the
competitors have rear drums), cruise control, 15-inch aluminum
alloy wheels, tilt steering, power remote-control heated outside
mirrors, air-conditioning, rear defroster, 100-watt AM/FM/compact
disc stereo, front bucket seats, and a 60/40 split-folding rear
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The leather package ($1,200) also brings a six-way power
adjustable driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is about midrange for the class: EPA estimates are
20 miles per gallon in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. The tank
holds 17.2 gallons of gasoline, and unleaded regular is
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At a glance: 1999 Hyundai Sonata GLS V-6
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 powered,
front-drive sedan, completely redesigned for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: With its 170-horsepower V-6 engine, fresh styling,
roomy interior and loads of standard equipment, this is the best
buy in the midsize sedan class and perhaps the best-kept secret.
Sure, it's a Hyundai, but it's a nice one and it deserves a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Antilock brakes are optional even on the
top-of-the-line model; engine is a bit noisy at high revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, Oldsmobile
Intrigue, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Dodge Stratus,
Buick Regal, Chevrolet Lumina, Nissan Maxima, Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 20 miles per gallon city, 28 highway.

THE SCANDAL-AND-GOSSIP-MONGERING OF CAMPAIGN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over last three months, I have spent a considerable amount of
time researching what will eventually become two columns about the
year 2000 presidential campaign. This is what I've learned so far
from talking to people in Washington:
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush was a cocaine addict. His wife was
or is an alcoholic. Senator John McCain of Arizona has a dark and
crooked past. Steve Forbes is crazy. Al Gore is a womanizer and a
criminal co-conspirator in the 1996 fund-raising scandals. Tipper
Gore is or was a pill-popper. And Bill Bradley's wife is as nutty
as a fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   I am related to Governor Bush (he is my first cousin) so I
happen to know that he was not, in fact, a cocaine addict and I
also know that his wife is not an alcoholic. But what I know to be
true about two people whom I have been close to for a very long
time is irrelevant. What's relevant is what sells and what sells is
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   News media demand for juicy and juicier gossip has become
insatiable. Since May of last year, I have been contacted by more
than 30 news organizations regarding Governor Bush's presidential
campaign. Roughly a third of these inquiries have been serious and
substantial. The other two-thirds have focused, obsessively, on
allegations of drug use, extramarital sex and assorted other
character issues, as they are pretentiously called.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush hasn't even announced his candidacy yet. Friday, The
Wall Street Journal ran a long, front-page story about reporter
Ellen Pollock's quest to nail down the Bush-cocaine rumors. She
interviewed scores of people who know Governor Bush, who worked
with him in business and politics, who were with him at the time he
supposedly used cocaine, and she could not find one person who
would or could substantiate any incidence of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   One assumes that if Pollock were likewise assigned to dig into
the allegations about the other presidential candidates, she would
emerge similarly empty-handed. The truth is that John McCain, Steve
Forbes, Bill Bradley and Al Gore, regardless of what one thinks of
their politics, are all honorable, hard-working, conscientious
people. The same can be said of their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this is that it doesn't sell. CNBC and MSNBC
and Fox News Channel and CNN aren't going to spike their ratings
interviewing talking heads who assert that Bill Bradley worked hard
to master the details of the financial infrastructure of the global
economy. No one wants to watch a television program devoted to the
evolution of Steve Forbess thinking about the tax structure or Pat
Buchanan's views on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal sells. The proof is in the Nielsen numbers. The O.J.
Simpson trial enabled Steven Brill to sell his stake in Court TV
for $30 million. The same trial converted CNBC from a money-losing
cable news operation into a money machine. The Monica Lewinsky
scandal put MSNBC on the map and enabled Fox News Channel to beat
its earnings estimates and dramatically increase its distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Success breeds imitation. The success of scandal-mongering has
created a glut of scandalous gossip. We are rapidly approaching the
point when it will no longer matter whether the gossip is true. As
the Wall Street Journal story shows, reporting on the anatomy of a
rumor is now worthy of front-page treatment. And now we can look
forward to a week's worth of talking heads explaining what it all
means.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing we can be certain of is that
scandal-and-gossip-mongering will get much worse as the campaign
heats up. The net effect of that will be to turn more and more
people away from the political process and make it increasingly
less attractive to those who might have otherwise considered public
service.
</P>
<P>
   This is a result the nation can ill afford. The media elite's
conceit that politics doesn't matter anymore is exactly wrong. It
has never been so important. We are at war in the Balkans. Russia
is teetering on the edge of chaos. China has stolen our most
precious nuclear secrets and is using them to extend its influence
over Asia. The genomics revolution and the technology revolution
are transforming the global economy and in the process are erasing
the social, political and ethical boundaries within which we have
lived for a half century.
</P>
<P>
   There are more political issues to talk about now than at any
time since the creation of the atomic bomb. Having Geraldo Rivera
and Larry King lead the conversation away toward Tipper Gore's bout
with depression is insane. But that's what we're doing, that's
where we're going and that's why, before it has even begun, so many
people wish the 2000 campaign was already over.

   COURTS-HEARST (Washington) _ Most Americans give state and local
courts high marks for upholding justice, but many feel they don't
act quickly enough and that taking a case to court is unaffordable,
according to a survey funded by the Hearst Corporation. Frank A.
Bennack Jr., Hearst's president and chief executive officer, tells
officials attending a national conference on public perception of
the judicial system that the courts came out ``just OK on average''
in the survey. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also addresses
the group. By DAN FREEDMAN and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN.

   US-KOSOVO (Washington) _ President Clinton seeks to clear the
way for the quick insertion of a U.S.-led combat force into Kosovo
to help ethnic Albanians return to their homes after a peace

BACKLASH STRIKES LUCAS' EMPIRE, BUT IT'S UNJUSTIFIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' series has a lot to answer for. In the
specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as
the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking. Its success, along
with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind
of movie forever.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that
``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind.'' It
got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still
imitated today, 60 years later. ``GWTW'' producer David O. Selznick
made sure that every step of the film's conception was covered by
the all-too-willing news media: from the purchase of the rights to
Margaret Mitchell's novel to the highly publicized worldwide search
for a Scarlett O'Hara. If the cable outlet E!, which serves up
fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been
around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's
office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd
manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward
to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a
personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before
its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to
shop around to get made. Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit
``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars.'' And one of
the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was
stuck inside in the Sunday Arts &AMP; Leisure section, and detailed a
Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with
that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into
theaters on time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the
first post-Vietnam War-era movie. That is, the first big movie of
its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by
'70s cynicism or fear of the draft. (Lucas was set to direct what
became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's
not that he was unfamiliar with those elements.) The characters _
more archetype than character, really _ lent themselves to the
sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering
of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in
searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so. Luke Skywalker's
quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and
Superman's feats.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into
hyperspace. If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with
Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that
Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it
might have got the obsessives out of the house. But bringing the
trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who
were kids when they saw it the first time. And the rerelease also
served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting
appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace.'' ``Phantom''
is in the unique _ and intimidating _ position of being hyped
everywhere for its May 19 opening.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the
enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it
changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before. Before ``Star
Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on
well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and
spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from
their TVs. Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves
trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before
``Star Wars'' was made. (The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was
made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the
home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it.) Even ``Jaws''
was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on
a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach
blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience
that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson
(''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint
Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a
movie again and again. ``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and
science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation
that was running the film industry. They didn't yet realize that
science fiction was due to replace the western as the action
metaphor that mattered. The evidence, based on the middling ratings
of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage
industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't
rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen. Unless
Stanley Kubrick put them up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio
wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No. 1
grossing movie of all time from the box office. It took 35 years,
and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as
box-office champ. But it took less than three years for ``Star
Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star
Wars'' in box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the
film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a
way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a
manifest-destiny hit. They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens
of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who
had long since outlived their usefulness. (Although Eastwood did go
on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his
movies. If you need any further proof, just check the layers of
dust on top of that copy of ``Honkytonk Man'' at your local video
store.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,''
along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements,
Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling
of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action
adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit. That
is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such
as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi
documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete
with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern.
(At the time, it served as a fairly subtle indication that the
Force had fascistic implications.) Or the x-wing shootout sequence
lifted from scores of WWII dogfight scenes. In the pre-video days,
the world of old movies was mostly at the fingertips of film-school
students. People who could study them over and over, and carefully
decide what to steal _ or, more politely, pay homage to.
</P>
<P>
   By hitting so big so fast, ``Star Wars'' raised interest in
entertainment, so that now every publication except ``The
Watchtower'' sees the virtue of giving movie-related stories big
play. But the result is that the generation following every step of
``The Phantom Menace'' before it opens Wednesday is robbed of a
sense of discovery. They'll never know the thrill of going to a
late show on a Monday night and finding it's sold out. What ``Star
Wars'' helped to create, and has now become a part of, is the need
to have every element of a film spelled out before it's seen. Lucas
and company tried to sidestep spilling secrets, but the Internet is
filled with reviews by fans who sneaked into exhibitor screenings.
Almost everyone has forgotten the joy of having a hit sneak up on
you, of seeing a movie no studio wanted to make blast its way to
the top. That's why the world got sick of Quentin Tarantino so
fast.

A FERTILIZER MACHINE FUELED BY DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 16)  
(lh) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The uneven surfaces of my concrete sidewalk and driveway gather
pools of water after a heavy rain, and most times each pool has a
couple of earthworms in it. The worms look dead, or dying, and I
used to think it was unfortunate that they came to the surface to
escape their flooding burrows only to expire in these temporary
ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Then I learned that earthworms can survive several weeks under
water, and actually were coming up from their subterranean homes to
make whoopee. All those earthworms you see after a rain are there
because they can move easily over wet surfaces without drying out,
and mates are easier to find on the open ground than down in that
labyrinth of worm tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   So I am glad for the rain, not just because it means that I can
avoid the watering chores for a day or two, but also because it
promises to enhance my precious population of earthworms. It's a
rare gardener who does not know that earthworms are beneficial.
Cleopatra was so impressed with their work that she declared them
sacred. They are the best cultivators of the soil. They actually
eat it, as well as any organic matter mixed with it. The soil
passes through their soft, tubular bodies and comes out as fecal
matter called castings. Worm castings are the richest, most perfect
plant-growing medium I know.
</P>
<P>
   Worms distribute their nutrient-rich castings evenly as they
tunnel through the ground, and their tunnels help aerate and drain
the soil. They can bring up trace minerals and other nutrients from
8 feet below the surface, a better reach than even deeply rooted
plants like alfalfa and clover, which farmers often grow to draw up
subsoil nutrients and to improve aeration.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Darwin estimated that good soil has about 53,000 worms
in each acre. Taking that down to the garden scale suggests that a
10-by-20-foot backyard garden patch with decent soil has about 250
earthworms. Each worm is capable of producing, over the year, a
third of a pound of castings, which works out to 80 pounds of
top-quality fertilizer being added to that garden plot every year.
It's free fertilizer, requiring no transportation from the garden
store and no work on the gardener's part.
</P>
<P>
   If the soil is very rich, with plenty of organic matter for
worms to eat and sufficient moisture to keep them active and
healthy, there may be two or three times that many worms in
residence and two or three times that much fertilizer being
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Earthworms are so closely associated with fertile soil that it
seems unthinkable that good soil could exist without them. But the
earthworms common in North America were introduced from elsewhere,
like Japanese beetles and gypsy moths (and, for that matter,
honeybees).
</P>
<P>
   Any native North American species were probably wiped out by the
last ice age. Our current earthworms arrived with European settlers
in the 17th and 18th centuries, as worms or eggs in soil clinging
to the roots of plants brought by the colonists or in mud stuck to
shoes. They spread across the continent in the same way _
hitchhiking.
</P>
<P>
   The garden is usually host to two main types of beneficial
earthworms: night crawlers and field worms.
</P>
<P>
   Night crawlers (Lumbricus terrestris) are the big guys (up to 10
inches long), and tend to hang out in meadows or lawns where there
is a living cover of organic material. In backyard gardens, which
are usually surrounded by lawns, mulched beds or some ground cover,
the night crawler is the most common species.
</P>
<P>
   Field worms (various species of Allolobophora caliginosa) are
smaller and can survive on less organic matter. They are more
common in large farm fields, where the nearest grassy patch may be
a very long crawl away.
</P>
<P>
   A third type of earthworm might be in the yard if you have a
compost pile: the manure worm or red wiggler. This kind is often
offered for sale in garden catalogs. It is useful for digesting
organic materials in compost or manure piles, but requires such
high levels of organic matter that it cannot survive in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy night crawlers (at bait shops if necessary) to add
to the garden, but it's far easier and cheaper to encourage them to
reproduce on their own. Keeping high levels of organic matter in
the garden is the most important step. Artificial fertilizers do
not provide food for earthworms, and may repel them because of
their high soluble salt content.
</P>
<P>
   Worms also need moisture. In dry periods, they retreat far below
the surface, where the soil is wetter and cooler. If the soil dries
out too deeply, as in intense droughts, the worms will die.
</P>
<P>
   A few earthworms may be chopped up in tilling the garden,
although night crawlers can regenerate from pieces. But the real
danger to earthworms from excessive tillage is that it aerates the
soil, drying it out and reducing the organic matter that they need
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Earthworms are a favorite high-protein snack for some birds, as
well as moles and skunks. Robins are champion worm hunters. When
they cock their heads as they hop across the lawn, they're looking
for the slight movement of a worm sliding through the grass. The
hunting is best in the mornings, when the worms are heading home
after a night of dewy debauchery.
</P>
<P>
   People, too, can eat earthworms, which are said to be relatively
tasty baked up into earthworm-chip cookies. Personally, I prefer
chocolate. I can eat chocolate without guilt. Eating an earthworm
would be like eating my seed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I feed them with mulch, compost, grass clippings and
whatever other organic materials I can find. And these days, when I
see one exhausted and turning pale in a pool of water after a heavy
rain, I scoop it out and toss it onto the grass to recover, hoping
it's had a good time.

   PRINCETON-IVY-CLUB (Undated) _ To get into Ivy Club, the oldest,

   MASON-AUTHOR-NITEOUT (New York) _ I can't really believe I'm

of The New Yorker magazine last Monday night. Mason, 21 and not
that far removed from a daydreaming Eton schoolboy, has landed

   FLAMENCO-LESSONS (Undated) _ About halfway through my first
flamenco class, when the instructor, Jorge Navarro, said, ``Lift
your arms like the world is on them,'' I figured I was home free.
That's how I feel all the time, anyway. But by the end of the
class, feet throbbing, I was ready to surrender and I am no
stranger to dance. Growing up as an overprivileged suburban child,
I had years of ballet, jazz, even modern dance classes. My summers

they came to the surface to escape their flooding burrows only to
expire in these temporary ponds. Then I learned that earthworms can

<P>
   NEW YORK _ About halfway through my first flamenco class, when
the instructor, Jorge Navarro, said, ``Lift your arms like the
world is on them,'' I figured I was home free. That's how I feel
all the time, anyway. But by the end of the class, feet throbbing,
I was ready to surrender, and I am no stranger to dance. Growing up
as an overprivileged suburban child, I had years of ballet, jazz,
even modern dance classes. My summers were spent _ heaven help me _
at a camp that taught Israeli folk dancing. But never had I
encountered anything as complex as flamenco, which blatantly defies
three of America's favorite words: Easy. Now. Young.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it even more surprising that the age-old Spanish
dance of men in tight pants and women wielding castanets has
captured the imagination of the Gap generation. They are packing
places like Alegrias, Navarro's tapas bar at 46 Bedford St.; Xunta
Tapas Bar, at 174 First Ave., and N, at 33 Crosby St., for weekly
performances. Even Joe's Pub, the nightclub of the moment at the
Public Theater, recently featured Noche Flamenco, a company whose
performances proved so successful it is to return this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Menkes, the Spanish manufacturer of flamenco shoes and all
manner of costume and accessory recently opened its first store in
this country at 250 W. 54th St. Its manager, Maya de Silva, says
business is booming with flamenco students, people in search of
stylish scarves and earrings, and also drag queens, for whom Menkes
custom-makes platform boots up to a foot and a half high.
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco classes, too, are proliferating: Steps, on Broadway at
74th Street, now offers two every Sunday, counting between 15 and
30 students a class; Carlota Santana, whose company, Flamenco Vivo
Carlota Santana, recently sold out its weeklong run at the New
Victory Theater, says attendance at her classes at Fazil Studios,
Eighth Avenue and 46th Street, is up. Navarro teaches on Sundays at
the Sandra Cameron Dance Center on Cooper Square and on Saturdays
leads an advanced four-hour class at Music Theater Works, on
Lafayette Street, that includes choreography. He says his students
include increasing numbers of models and actors; the centered
confidence and erect carriage that are essential to flamenco help
them on runways and at auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of flamenco's new fans say the dance does not replace their
exercise regimens, but complements them. They consider flamenco a
form of self-expression and emotional release _ the physical
equivalent of poetry for people who speak better with their bodies.
What's surprising is just how popular it is becoming even though it
is the antithesis to the easy/now/young American mindset. Navarro
thinks the attention is due partly to Joaquin Cortes, who packs
venues like Radio City Music Hall with his fusion flamenco, which
adds jazz and modern dance. But the truth is that flamenco means
difficult/later/old. To learn the steps and arms, and for a woman,
the skirt, hands, and hips, all of which do different things at the
same time, takes years. And technique is only half of it. Some
people think women can't effectively dance flamenco until they have
reached middle age. Only then have they suffered enough pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Silva of Menkes notes: ``Part of its appeal is that as an
art form it's very forgiving. You don't have to be 18 and a slender
stick of a girl to do it. You go to Spain and see an old fat lady
who becomes a goddess when she dances. There is no age or weight
limit. It is an art form that speaks to the emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Metzgar, the producer at Joe's Pub, adds: ``Flamenco is
unique because within an evening you get the flamboyance and
ebullience and festive nature of tango, along with drama from a
place of sadness, a shout-in-the-night esthetic. People respond
viscerally to someone dancing from that place of searching.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on a recent Saturday night at Alegrias, the audience,
everyone from groups of twentysomethings to older Spanish-speaking
women (all of whom ate tapas and drank pitchers of sangria
throughout) was riveted by Navarro, who is originally from Granada,
Spain, and Antonio Hidalgo, visiting from Cordoba. They were
dancing martinete, a variety of flamenco using canes, a la
``Stomp.'' The dance became a competitive jam session between the
men, with the audience cheering them on.
</P>
<P>
   Then the singer sang an aching song that Navarro later described
as ``very tragic, about how much he loves a woman and how little
attention she pays him.'' The men danced so furiously that just in
keeping up with them the guitarist snapped a string. It was a
performance so infused with drama and urgency, it is easy to see
how people would want to be a part of it. Or think they do. After
this show alone, three people raced to the stage to find out where
they could learn. Navarro, of course, recommends himself.
</P>
<P>
   I attended one of his classes on a Sunday afternoon with six
other students, two men, both somewhat tentative, and four other
women. One was especially proficient, but she has apparently lived
a pain-free life: She danced like a windup doll.
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced student was Joanne Lomanto, 35, who works
as a research associate at an insurance company. ``Flamenco feels
like another world to me,'' she said. ``Ten years ago I saw Jose
Greco at the Joyce Theater, and when it was over my friends said
they had headaches from all that stomping, but I thought it was the
sexiest thing I had ever seen. And Jorge is very patient. He's
like, `If you don't learn it this week, you'll learn it next
week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ms. Lomanto demonstrate a dance with Navarro was
transporting, the grace of their movements suffused by a sexual
tension and longing that made the steps seem unimportant, though of
course, they are not. I did just fine with the constant repetition
of the Sevillanas step and fine with the constant repetition of the
arms, but when Navarro put them together, I ran into trouble. The
feet are supposed to move in a set, staccato pattern, while the
arms wind sinuously up, down and around. It's like patting your
head and rubbing your stomach at the same time, a talent I do not
have. He also kept saying things like ``Keep your body up and your
shoulders down,'' which for me, at least, is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   When the class was over, everyone paid Navarro their $14 (less
if you buy a series), and he stayed to chat. ``I'm 44, and I've
been dancing for 32 years,'' he said. ``In ballet you have to be
very young to accomplish the jumps and stretching. In flamenco it's
a way of expressing your feelings, and like any art, you mature.
When I'm dancing, I compare it with sex. It's something spiritual,
like you're not thinking. You've got an itch inside to express
yourself and the dancing is your partner.''
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way home, I considered whether I would take another
class. Besides my feet, I could feel the strain of the stamping
steps on my hips and calves. But I had been genuinely elated at
even the tiniest victory of matching a complicated movement to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was home though, and had fallen onto my bed
exhausted, I was pretty sure I would not go back. Summoning
Navarro's comparison of flamenco and sex, I figured I could look
upon this class as a perfectly satisfying one-night stand _ which I
thoroughly enjoyed and never had to do again.
</P>

DESPITE THE FLAWS, `MACARTHUR' LARGELY WATCHABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, May 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MACARTHUR 
Produced and written by: Austin Hoyt 
Directed by: Austin Hoyt and Sarah Holt 
Narrated by: David Ogden Stiers 
On: PBS 
Date: Monday and Tuesday, 9-11 p.m. 
Rating: PG-TV 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans know something of General Douglas MacArthur. His
line, ``I shall return,'' is chiseled into the national
consciousness as is his flamboyant image in braided cap smoking his
outsized corncob pipe. MacArthur himself was outsized, literally
and figuratively, a big, theatrical man with ambitions to match who
valiantly led troops in three major wars and battled his
commanders-in-chief, notably FDR and Truman, who fired the
larger-than-life five-star general for insubordination during the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   His story is as winding and episodic as his nature is
contradictory. So any treatment of MacArthur desperately needs an
organizing principle, to serve both as scaffold for the
event-filled narrative and lens for examining his complexity. The
new four-hour American Experience presentation packages MacArthur
as psychohistory.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH producer Austin Hoyt, who wrote and directed ``MacArthur,''
evokes him as a product of his doting mother's exhortations and his
father's lofty military example. ``You must grow up to be a great
man,'' MacArthur recalled his mother telling him as she tucked him
in at night. (Perhaps Hoyt should have noted that it would have
been consistent with MacArthur's vanity to have manufactured the
quote himself.) His father, Arthur, was a great Civil War hero,
deeply embittered by his later treatment at the hands of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for instance, the popular general's bitter feuds with
Roosevelt are seen in terms of his father's rejection as chief of
staff in the McKinley administration. And his sometimes
over-reaching quests for triumph, such as his desire to invade
China during the Korean War, are presumably impelled by his
mother's great-man expectations. Such psychologizing is too
superficial to yield lasting insight, and unfortunately, it isn't
skillfully exploited in the documentary as an organizing tool
either.
</P>
<P>
   However genuinely fascinating a lot of the material is, much of
this sweeping ``MacArthur'' unfolds without a strong, unifying
sense of purpose. Also, swaths of it, notably the long, narrowly
focused segments involving his World War II campaigns in the
Pacific lack an urgency that could have been provided by a wider
perspective on the world conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you see only one of the two parts of ``MacArthur,''
choose the second, which begins in the heat of World War II with
the general waging twin battles, one against the President, the
other against the Japanese in the Philippines where, earlier, his
forces had been routed. ``I shall return,'' he had vowed, to save
the suffering remnants of troops who had surrendered. To do so, he
politically threatened FDR, selfishly disregarding competing and
vital American campaigns elsewhere in the Pacific and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much disagreement among the articulate historians
Hoyt has assembled to comment on MacArthur's actions and character.
He was a daring, dynamic leader and formidable tactician, but so
dangerously egotistical that he often lost sight of larger
interests in the pursuit his own.
</P>
<P>
   In an irony never registered in ``MacArthur,'' the general
seemed most creative in his peacetime roles, especially as the
Supreme Commander of occupied Japan. The often dauntingly episodic
documentary excels on this topic, slowing down enough and providing
sufficient focus and bright detail to tell an important chapter in
the life thoroughly and well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the gentlemanly example set by his father that
prompted MacArthur to stage Japan's surrender as magnanimously as
he did. But ``MacArthur'' has the taste not to over-speculate about
the impulses behind this deft, healing piece of stagecraft or the
remarkable reforms MacArthur introduced into post-war Japan. We
also learn of MacArthur's cynical but effective public
rehabilitation of Emperor Hirohito from war lord (and probable war
criminal) to popular symbol of democracy. Yet, as with so many of
MacArthur's extraordinary achievements, the long-term results were
mixed. While helping to stabilize and democratize Japan, sanitizing
the Emperor, according to one historian, ``poisoned the thinking
about responsibility in general in Japan to the present day.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly enough of the panoramic biography equals this
smoothly unfolding segment in which solid facts, not glib theories,
fully reveal its colorfully complex and deeply contradictory
protagonist. Not only does it amply illustrate MacArthur's profound
sense of public duty, but also his sentimental private life,
especially his devotion to his young son Arthur, who led a lonely
life isolated in the American Embassy among military brass.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur's creative contributions in Japan resembled his
efforts as superintendent of West Point a quarter century earlier,
a useful connection the documentary perhaps should have made. He
considered the academy, where he endured horrific hazing and
finished first in his class, ``a provincial reformatory . . . based
on fear,'' and he tried to make it a ``cosmopolitan university.''
</P>
<P>
   ``MacArthur'' is largely watchable, surviving its many
deficiencies only because its subject is intrinsically interesting.
Imagine a decorated general not only personally leading his troops
under fire, but also, we are told, without benefit of helmet or
weapon. Instead of a gun, MacArthur carried a riding crop. The
renowned warrior considered it his role, according to the film, to
inspire killing but not to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Though noteworthy, this is just one of many perhaps defining
peculiarities this thinly psychological ``MacArthur'' teasingly
mentions but fails to probe.

`ATOMIC TRAIN' CAREENS TOWARD IMPROBABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ATOMIC TRAIN 
Starring: Rob Lowe, Kristin Davis, Esai Morales, Edward Herrmann 
Directed by: Dick Lowry and David Jackson 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday and Monday, 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The creators of ``Atomic Train'' probably worked pretty hard to
come up with a concept that borrows from every action movie,
including ``Speed,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``Independence Day,'' and, of
course, ``Die Hard.'' Indeed, they were downright diligent in their
equal-opportunity appropriation, and ``Atomic Train,'' an NBC
two-part event movie, is nothing if not familiar. It's a generic
piece of business about a runaway train carrying a Soviet-made
nuclear weapon careening toward Denver, and it's so loaded with
improbabilities you wonder how it manages to move forward at all.
But it does, it does, filling four hours of prime time with all the
predictable fire and brimstone and a little less than two hours'
worth of plot.
</P>
<P>
   One-time Brat Packer Rob Lowe is the heroic fellow who is
helicoptered onto the brakeless train, to help stop or derail it.
As an action hero, Lowe is suitably laconic and clever, although he
might be less bland if he were allowed a few ironic jokes or snappy
rejoinders. The movie follows his noble, but unsuccessful,
acrobatics on the train, as well as his efforts to protect his
family in Denver, including his new wife, his daughter, and his
stepson. In the background of the action plot, Lowe is trying to
make his new family work, befriending his hostile stepson while his
wife tries to rein in her rebellious stepdaughter. Ah, but there's
nothing like a good old-fashioned nightmare to bring a blended
family together _ ``Stepmom'' recently healed similar rifts with
the help of terminal cancer _ and so the dire events that transpire
in ``Atomic Train'' do their part to create family harmony. Think
of it as disaster therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The two parts of the movie are quite different from each other.
Part one, a high-speed drama in the Colorado wilderness, has more
pacing and oomph. It's silly, but never exactly boring, as the
train keeps a rolling all day long no matter what the authorities
do to stop it. Part two is a slower-paced ground adventure, and it
gets pretty lugubrious as the characters wander aimlessly around
the darkly lit city, which has become an anarchic mess on the order
of the L.A. riots, What both parts share is an almost comic amount
of coincidence, as the movie's main characters keep bumping into
each other in far-flung locations as well as the mass hysteria of
Denver. (Both also contain a misleading premise: nuclear waste is
transported in casks not shown in the film, and nuclear weapons are
transported by truck and disarmed. After preview tapes were sent to
critics, NBC decided to change the movie by tacking on a disclaimer
and replacing all references to nuclear waste with the phrase
``hazardous waste.'')
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the events in ``Atomic Train'' offer plenty of
opportunities for ordinary heroism, some of them quite gag-worthy.
Lowe's wife, played warmly by Kristin Davis of HBO's ``Sex and the
City,'' risks plenty to save her stepdaughter's long-haired
boyfriend, and her cop ex-husband virtuously tries to impose order
on the urban chaos. Edward Herrmann, the man who was born to play
president, is on hand as the country's compassionate leader,
keeping his faith in a happy ending even while the experts tell him
otherwise. There is a strangely stunted and pointless subplot,
involving a rookie cop and his wife, whose pregnancy is the
occasion for the movie's most naive optimism about the harmlessness
of nuclear radiation. No one seems concerned about the aftereffects
of the disaster in ``Atomic Train,'' unless the moviemakers are
holding on to that story for a sequel. Maybe they'll throw it
together for next year's May sweeps, and call it ``Brain Drain.''

THE LATEST IN SLEAZE TV FEATURES ADULTERERS CAUGHT IN THE ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A talk-radio host once asked me whether Jerry Springer's sleaze
and fisticuffs combo would ever catch on, whether shows that rely
heavily on the voyeuristic pain, misery and titillation of others
would eventually be the rule, and my answer was an emphatic no.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wonder. It's naive to think that Springer and other greedy
purveyors who exploit human frailties for cinematic sport have not
restructured what we see on television.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The more we get the more we can take and thereby
accept within the standards and practices of our personal
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   And although there has been no shortage of public and media
outcry over the explosion of explicit content, the healthy ratings
of such shows _ and the new ones that keep appearing _ simply don't
jibe with our heartfelt concern.
</P>
<P>
   Pacing our collective viewing these days is this kind of
ratings-rich phenomenon of reality programming, shows promising to
give viewers the real deal with real conflict, real emotion and
real blood. ``Cops'' is quietly celebrating its 10th year, for
example. After initially throwing up our hands about cameras
accompanying police officers into private homes as they settle
disputes, usually with force and often with the innocent, we said
little when the copycats followed, upping the ante.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Jenny Jones told ``Dateline NBC'' on Sunday that she
expects ratings for her talker to remain healthy despite being
found liable (to the tune of $25 million) last week in the shooting
death of a guest.
</P>
<P>
   To Jones, Jonathan Schmitz, who shot Scott Amedure three days
after the two taped a same-sex crush segment, was a troubled man
who would have harmed Amedure even had the two never set foot on
her stage.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed that Schmitz was mentally unstable, but found
Jones' producers negligent in putting him on the show and then
humiliating him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' most unsettling statement to NBC's Jane Pauley wasn't
that she felt no guilt or responsibility in the death of one man
and the imprisonment of another, but that shows like hers will be
around as long we watch them.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The major networks have, in the past three years,
quadrupled their use of reality specials, programs like ``Wildest
Police Videos,'' which Fox aired last month. That show featured a
law enforcement officer being struck head-on by a car, another
being shot, another being attacked by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, you could find only 11 reality-TV segments
totaling two hours of weekly programming on all the major networks
combined. In March of this year, according to the newsletter NewsTV
Reports, there were 118 segments totaling eight hours weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to censor, and you want to believe that viewers
should choose their pleasure or pain,'' says Michael Filberg, a
former professor of media studies who works as a consultant for a
Seattle-based advertising and marketing firm. ``But at the same
time, any responsible human being has to wonder, `So what's next?
How will we top this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Programmers will top it by tweaking the shows that are already
out there. The other day, I viewed a pilot called ``Cheaters,''
which catches adulterers on videotape, and then tapes ``the
confrontation'' in all its gory detail.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, which features actors, a woman leaps out of a
surveillance van with a camera crew and tries to wrestle her
``husband'' to the ground. Selling points were the woman sobbing as
she watched hidden camera videotape of her hubby and lover kissing,
and then physically attacking him. In another segment, a gay man
and his lover go through the same tango, with yelling and screaming
and more chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Set to air in the fall as a syndicated program, ``Cheaters'' has
already filmed a number of segments with real people, one featuring
a Dallas woman who was confronted at The Blue Goose restaurant on
lower Greenville Avenue. Her husband walked up to his wife and her
lover and screamed, ``What the hell (are) you doing!?'' Restaurant
patrons looked on; the cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents so far, in cities like Cleveland, Detroit and
New York City, have included fistfights and riotlike situations, as
bystanders are energized by the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   To ``Cheaters'' creator Bobby Goldstein, a Dallas attorney, the
more riotous, the better; he knows that will only enhance the
train-wreck appeal of his series. He admits that ``Cheaters'' was
turned down by the networks after ``heavy'' talks about how they
could get it on air with the least backlash. But judging by the
number of markets (not this one yet) that have already bought the
program, ``Cheaters'' will find a home.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein laughs at the thought of his program humiliating
anyone, instead considering his ``Cheaters,'' which is being
distributed by Los Angeles-based Keller Entertainment, as merely
giving audiences what they crave. Even need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the group that's compassionate, who could relate to
the victim or the complainant,'' he says. ``They would watch them
and want to have pain with them. The other (group) is satisfying
their voyeuristic interests in other people. The other is the cruel
element of the human kind that looks to watch other people caught
in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer, too, has said in interviews that reality TV will
remain a force because viewers are tired of fiction, of fantasy, of
sitcoms that are silly and unbelievable and dramas that would carry
more dramatic weight if they were real. Scary as it sounds, viewers
have seen so many staged fights and killings, only the ``real''
thing is of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Such programming was inevitable, and that's why shows such as
``Change of Heart'' (where couples berate one another, as well as
the person whom producers set up for their significant other to
date) were conceived. And it's why Goldstein is forging ahead with
``Cheaters,'' believing that reality programming represents ``a
form of truth'' that we can't resist as viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Although reckless, irresponsible talk hosts and reality
programmers have been castigated, the rules have been stretched for
some well-respected series. Certain allowances for language and
adult themes were offered to ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``Hill Street
Blues'' and to such current shows as ``Ally McBeal'' and ``NYPD
Blue,'' which brought seminudity to prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Once these shows claimed new territory in terms of what could be
shown and said, was it any surprise that sleazier programmers saw
an opportunity to pick up the baton and make a dash?
</P>
<P>
   Fox, for example, is the king of reality specials, showing
grisly footage of people hurt in attacks by animals, and it is
fending off accusations of staging or fabricating aspects of those
shows to make them ``more dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Los Angeles television stations interrupted
children's programming to provide live coverage of a standoff
between police and a man blocking a freeway. He eventually set
himself and his dog on fire, and then, after staggering out of his
truck, put a shotgun under his chin and fired.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five million is a lot of money, but I don't see Jenny
Jones sweating. She's frustrated, tired, perturbed, maybe. But
tomorrow, she'll tape another segment. And we'll be watching.
Wishing, hoping, for something crazier than the day before.

THIS ROBIN'S SONGS FINALLY FIND A NEST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robin Syler has always been a different sort of blues guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   No question, the 48-year-old Dallas native could always play the
fire out of a six-string; with touches reminiscent of Albert King
and Texan Albert Collins, he's been tearing up bandstands around
Texas since the '60s, at one point in the early '70s sharing guitar
duties with Stevie Ray Vaughan in a band called Krackerjack.
</P>
<P>
   But Syler has never been content to ``just'' play the blues:
He's always thrown a lot of rockabilly, surf and Louisiana swamp
pop into the mix, and had a taste for obscure covers, Link Wray
tunes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time, all that Syler loves to do is in
one place, on record.
</P>
<P>
   His new tape, the 16-track ``Double Dip,'' is a raw, homegrown,
turn-it-up-and-go trip through a whole lot of rootsy American
barroom boogie _ and exactly the right antidote for the sort of
overproduced, cliche-ridden stuff that masquerades as modern blues.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded last October through this January at Fort Worth's own
Eagle Audio (and available in limited quantities at Record Town on
University Drive across from TCU), ``Dip'' is a hybrid of styles
and influences. Among the covers are Link Wray's ``Steel Trap,''
Buddy Guy's ``Watch Yourself'' and Leroy Washington's ``Wild
Cherry;'' among the Syler originals are ``Ducks,'' a humorous tune
first released on a now impossible-to-find single back in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go in and do tunes that represent everything I do
and what you'd hear if you saw me somewhere,'' says Syler, who
moved to Fort Worth a decade ago and regularly plays at the Keys
Lounge (5677 Westcreek Drive) on Sunday nights. ``We intentionally
made it sound like an imperfect recording.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Dip'' is the brainchild of Wes Race, a fixture on the
Fort Worth blues scene for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, `Robin's due _ he's on fire a lot of nights,
and when he is he's practically untouchable,' '' says Race, who is
also a spoken-word poet. ``And I had the money. I thought, `Let's
do it.' I was sort of the cryptic adviser on the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Race is currently shopping ``Double Dip'' to different blues
labels, hoping for a bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he gets signed pretty soon,'' he says. ``But if nobody
picks it up, we'll just put it out ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Some sad news for Fort Worth music fans: Amazing jazz/Western
swing fiddle player Buddy Ray has left Cowtown after 25 years to
move to Waskom, which is east of Marshall and just this side of the
Louisiana border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real beautiful out there in those pine trees,'' says Ray,
79, who is best-known in Cowtown as a longtime member of the
Swingmasters Revue, a jump-blues/jazz/swing outfit that has played
swing night at Caravan of Dreams and other local clubs. ``I'm going
to enjoy getting out of the city. I like the atmosphere in the
casinos, watching people play craps and blackjack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray first recorded in 1937 as part of Houston's Modern
Mountaineers. Two years later, he was part of the Texas Wanderers,
who waxed the Western swing classic ``Pipeliner's Blues.'' He also
appeared in several movies, including ``The Benny Goodman Story''
and 1957's ``Jailhouse Rock,'' which starred Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Ray says he decided to move to Waskom largely to be near his
daughter Kim and her son, Eric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 4 1/2 years old and our pride and joy,'' he says. ``It's
really going to be a gas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While most 16-year-old girls might have headed for
the mall on a rainy spring afternoon to try on tankinis at Club
Monaco, a recent downpour gave Leelee Sobieski other ideas. Ms.
Sobieski, a Manhattan-born actress, stepped into a limousine
provided by 20th Century Fox, one of the movie studios she has been
working for lately, and cruised a few blocks from her parents'
apartment to Allan &AMP; Suzi, a vintage designer shop on Amsterdam
Avenue that specializes in clothes from the 1970s. There, she
plowed past racks of sequined Lycra and tie-dyed organza and
immediately wrapped herself in a floor-length fake-Persian lamb
coat. ``This,'' she said with the confidence of a fashion veteran,
``is really worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth $800? ``Definitely,'' she said. ``It's silk-lined and
everything. Not that I'd pay it. Hey, I'm 16 years old. My parents
would never go for it. And I wouldn't ask them. Where would I wear
it?''
</P>
<P>
   How about to the premiere this summer of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
Stanley Kubrick's last film, in which she plays the daughter of
Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise (yes, it is now time to imagine Tom
and Nicole as old enough to be the parents of a teen-ager)? Or to
parties surrounding the broadcast Sunday night of the first
installment of a two-part mini-series, ``Joan of Arc,'' on CBS, in
which she plays the 15th-century French heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time the virgin is really played by a virgin,'' she
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Spending an afternoon with Ms. Sobieski, it is often hard to
tell if she is playing the role of an ingenue, or just hasn't
adjusted to the fact that she's on the brink of stardom. A study in
quicksilver contradictions, she is from one angle the poised
celebrity with a publicist in tow; from another, a Manhattan
schoolgirl fishing for change from her ratty purse, while her
mother, who's also her manager, looks on. It's clear that Ms.
Sobieski would rather see herself as an average 16-year-old with a
taste for princess-y clothing than as a Hollywood cliche of a
starlet.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she glides from elegance to awkwardness like a swan
whose down is still damp. At Allan &AMP; Suzi, where she tried on gauzy
gowns and platform heels to the hushed delight of the other
shoppers, the curvy, 5-foot-9-inch Ms. Sobieski was every inch the
movie star, who has been pictured on the cover of Vanity Fair and
in virtually every celebrity-driven magazine. But in a flash she
reverted to the goony adolescent, rolling her eyes back in disgust
at the nonstop rain, and drawing her hair back with a cartoonish
barrette, part woman, part lizard.
</P>
<P>
   What do you expect from a Manhattan private schooler who went to
a recent fashion shoot straight from class still wearing her
uniform? ``The stylist said: `Ooh, I love that skirt. Is it
Prada?''' Ms. Sobieski recalled. ``And I said, `No, it's $25
polyester disgusting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, Ms. Sobieski has had a reprieve from the
indignity of inexpensive pleats. She has spent much of her time in
Los Angeles making movies, where she studies with a tutor on the
set. Discovered at 10 by a casting agent looking for talent in the
cafeteria of her Upper East Side school, in just the past couple of
years she has been singled out by film critics for her performances
in ``Deep Impact'' and ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little weird sometimes, and I do worry that I'm missing
the regular teen-age stuff,'' said Ms. Sobieski, whose speech is
noticeably free of ``like'' and ``y'know.'' ``I don't get to hang
out with a bunch of friends and shop.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when she is back in town, Ms. Sobieski makes up for lost
time on the retail trail. Though she is an up-and-coming member of
an elite pack of fashion-conscious actresses _ Claire Danes and
Rose McGowan also come to mind _ Ms. Sobieski doesn't care to
borrow clothes from designers. When Giorgio Armani approached her
to wear one of his gowns to the Venice Film Festival, she turned
him down, explaining that the clothes were too grown-up. She would
prefer more whimsical creations, like ones by the Dutch design team
Viktor &AMP; Rolf that she saw in the pages of Italian Vogue. Besides,
borrowing clothes takes the fun out of shopping for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever spent more than $200 on a dress,'' she
said, smoothing out the folds of the billowy, ankle-length dress
she was wearing with black Hush Puppy loafers, ``and that's for
something really nice, like for a film festival or a premiere or
something. I love looking around in this store, but I never really
buy anything really expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her restraint may stem at least in part from the decision by her
parents, Jean and Elizabeth Sobieski, to place the money she makes
in a trust fund that she can't touch until she's 18. For now, she
has an allowance, which she won't disclose. ``It's just what I
need,'' she said. ``And if I really want something, I can go to my
parents and ask. They don't always say yes, but they're pretty
reasonable.'' Generally, Ms. Sobieski puts the brakes on, herself.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, I love this,'' she said, holding up a $1,000 burgundy
velour halter dress for her mother's approval. ``But it's really
too expensive.'' In a flash, Suzi Kandel, one of the store's
co-owners, offered to cut 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if I did decide to buy it, exactly how much would that
be?'' Ms. Sobieski asked, cocking her head in an obvious ploy to
get even more shaved from the price. ``Five-hundred? Well, we'll
keep it in mind if I have something special coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sobieski said she gets her sense of style and her eye for a
bargain from her parents. Her mother, also striking, is a writer
who admires Yohji Yamamoto and Vivienne Westwood, but shops mostly
at Century 21. Her father, a French-born abstract painter who
starred in a few Westerns in his youth, wears L.L. Bean around the
house and Cacharel to the occasional art opening.
</P>
<P>
   With such bohemian parents, it is often Ms. Sobieski who has to
figure out what is acceptable clothing for a 16-year-old movie star
with the body of a Botticelli. ``My mother will let me wear a
miniskirt and a blouse with my nipples showing,'' she said. ``And
once there was this black dress that had the sides cut out, and my
father said in his accent, 'Zat lukes gret, rilly sexy.' And I had
to say, `No, it's too sophisticated for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sobieski lingered a little longer at Allan &AMP; Suzi over a
turquoise chain-mail tank top. ``I wore chain mail in `Joan of
Arc,' but it was like a jillion times heavier,'' she said, before
choosing instead a patchwork jacket from the early '80s _ lots of
satin, velvet and embroidery _ and a pair of skin-tight navy mesh
gloves. The total: $52.
</P>
<P>
   Piling back into the limousine, she said she is happiest buying
lots of small things. She showed off the spoils of a morning trip
to Alphabets, a novelty shop on Broadway near 83d Street: a
mechanical key chain with a shark eating a swimmer, and a pen
decorated with a woman who sheds her clothes when turned
upside-down. ``This is one of the really good ones,'' she insisted.
``Some of the women on those pens are really ugly. But look, this
girl has a really elegant face.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her own elegant face _ Ms. Sobieski bears a
much-remarked-upon resemblance to Helen Hunt _ like most
teen-agers, she has a feature she says she ``hates'' _ her hair,
which falls in perfect Seventeen magazine-style cascades around her
face. So self-conscious is she about her hair (``horrible and
thin,'' she moaned), that she collects wigs. ``I wear them to
parties or sometimes just out to the corner to get milk,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She'd been thinking about adding a pink Afro to her collection
of a half-dozen. When the car passed Ricky's, the Lincoln Center
outpost of the Manhattan beauty-supply chain, she shouted for the
driver to stop, and once inside, she darted around like, well, a
kid let loose in a cosmetics store. First she swooned over a
suitcase covered in psychedelic fake leopard print, then she fell
in love with a pair of $6 angular red sunglasses. Eventually, she
made her way to a long row of wigs and hairpieces, many in
fluorescent hues. She spotted the Afro of her dreams, a poufy pale
pink corona of curls. The saleswoman suggested she try an electric
blue pageboy, but Ms. Sobieski could not be swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really does it,'' she said, patting the pink wig into
place. Her mother looked on nostalgically. ``I wore a mauve Afro
wig when I was her age,'' she said wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   But before the $27 wig could be folded into a bag, Ms. Sobieski
was engrossed in the revolving racks of temporary tattoos. ``Mom,
I'm going to send this one to Drew, she's so great,'' she said.
Drew is Drew Barrymore, her co-star in ``Never Been Kissed.''
``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think she's already got some real ones, hon,'' her
mother said.``But I'm sure she'd appreciate the thought.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Teen use of drugs for depression on the increase
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dr. Richard Kenney admits he's a dinosaur in some
ways; a pediatrician for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenney, medical director of the Scottish Rite Pediatric and
Adolescents Consultants, says he's still uncomfortable with the
dramatic shift within the past five years of doctors treating more
kids' emotional problems not with individual or family counseling
but with a prescription pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy out,'' he said. ``If you give them a pill, you
don't need to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he hasn't seen amazing recoveries in children treated
with antidepressants and other pills for depression, anxiety and
psychosis. But Kenney says the best care still involves a
partnership of drugs and dialogue. And as taking pills gets more
hype, he sees less interest in the communication component of
healing, whether through therapy or old-fashioned dinner chats.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical treatment for troubled teens _ like video games,
school security and parenting _ is being re-evaluated since the
shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. One of the killers,
Eric Harris, was taking Luvox, a prescription that eases
obsessive-compulsive behavior and depression. And yet, his parents
apparently were unaware he was building bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, experts don't know whether Harris was getting
appropriate treatment. But they are assessing whether the newest
psychological drugs are so good that they are leading to shortcuts
in mental health care. In addition, many still have lingering
doubts about the wisdom of treating kids with pills scientifically
tested mostly on adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, these (medications) are not heroin,'' said
Stephen Fried, author of the book ``Bitter Pills: Inside the
Hazardous World of Legal Drugs'' (Bantam, $24.95). ``They're not
evil. They do miraculous things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we need to find safe, solid ways to test them and
administer them,'' said Fried, a Philadelphia investigative
reporter who wrote the book after his wife had a life-altering,
adverse reaction to an antibiotic. Fried interviewed hundreds of
doctors and patients, including teens, about prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about depressed children are incomplete. Although it
is widely believed that about one in three adults will experience a
major depression in his lifetime, far less is known about
depression among the young. Community samples have put the number
of clinically depressed teens between 0.4 percent and 8.3 percent
of the age group, according to Nadine Kaslow, a professor in Emory
University's department of psychology and behavioral sciences and
the chief psychologist at Grady Health System.
</P>
<P>
   But depressed teenagers often grow up to be depressed adults,
with a much higher rate of suicide and suicide attempts, according
to a study published today in The Journal of the American Medical
Association. Researchers, following two groups of teens for more
than a decade, found that those who were depressed as adolescents
had more than five times the increased risk for a first suicide
attempt during the time period tracked _ and a 14-fold increase of
risk over their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And such discoveries are leading to lots of sad, frustrated and
angry kids getting lots of drugs. For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Almost three out of four family physicians and pediatricians
said they had prescribed an antidepressant to patients under 18,
according to a recent survey of 600 doctors presented at the
Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting. Almost 70 percent said
they prescribed the drugs for mild to moderate childhood
depression.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Of the top 10 drugs prescribed ``off-label'' to children, two
are antidepressants _ Prozac and Zoloft _ according to IMS America
LTD, a research firm that tracks prescriptions. An off-label use
means the drug is prescribed for conditions or groups of patients
not originally intended by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug
Administration. Prozac, which is annually prescribed almost 350,000
times to children under 16, ranked sixth. Zoloft, prescribed almost
250,000 times annually to children under 16, ranked eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The new popularity of psychopharmacological agents is tied to
the development over the past two decades of a new class of
anti-depressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
or SSRIs. These drugs, which include Luvox and Prozac, are
considered to be much safer than the older types of medications.
For example, they don't have the typical side effects of
sluggishness, constipation and weight gain. And it is also very
difficult to overdose on them - a key concern when physicians are
dealing with depressed or suicidal patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my patients not to even try to overdose on Prozac,''
said Ken Fleishman, a psychiatrist and medical director of Laurel
Heights Hospital, a mental health facility for children in Atlanta.
``I tell them the only way they're going to succeed in killing
themselves on Prozac is if they choked - which is not very
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in many cases, the new drugs are just as effective as the
older models, meaning a lot of children could benefit from new
chemistry with less risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs are like night and day,'' said Sue Smith, whose
daughter has struggled with depression for years. ``They're so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's daughter, Danielle, was so violent by the age of nine _
setting fires and hurting animals _ that doctors recommended that
she leave her child in an institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Leave her here and walk away,''' said Smith,
executive director of the Geogia Parent Support Network, a
non-profit organization that aids families in coordinating mental
health care.
</P>
<P>
   But then Danielle, now 23, stated taking Wellbutrin, a new type
of anti-depressant, as a teen and her life dramatically changed.
</P>
<P>
   She was able to come home. Her grades got better. She served on
the student council. She graduated from Grady High School and went,
for three years, to Piedmont College.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really gives our kids the chance to lead normal lives,''
Smith said. ``It's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Strode, outreach coordinator for the local chapter of the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, said such drugs are
particularly important Georgia, which like other rural southern
states has fewer mental-health treatment facilities and options
than other regions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a case of parents not being willing to seek out good
mental health services, she said, but a case of finding good mental
health services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few programs here that can help children
understand their illness,'' said Strode, whose own daughter,
diagnosed with schizophrenia, is benefitting from a drug called
Risperdal. ``So, when that's the case, parents have to be grateful
for what they get.''
</P>
<P>
   But children are different from grown-ups. And perhaps their
medication should reflect that, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Children are still growing. They have immature organs and
different metabolic and immune systems. And sometimes, they respond
differently to medication. For example, Ritalin - which can be used
to treat narcolepsy in adults - is used to treat attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child is not just half an adult,'' said Jan Stire of the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, in the May-June issue
of the FDA Consumer, the trade magazine of the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of teenagers, researchers aren't fully sure how the
anti-depressants interact with the turbulent waves of hormonal
changes during puberty. And in most cases, teenagers initially seek
treatment for different reasons than adults. While adults are
typically diagnosed with biologically-based depression, most teens
land in a doctor's office because of other problems like drinking
or bad behavior. Or they have endured a traumatic event that has
triggered the sadness, such as a divorce between their parents or a
break-up with a boyfriend or girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, it is not appropriate that teens be given a pill
and sent on their way - even if it's easier for their doctors,
insurers and relatives. ``The key here is the drugs take away the
symptoms, but they don't take away the problems,'' said Kaslow.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recognize certain medications play out differently in
teens than adults. An anti-anxiety medication might help a grown-up
hold to a job, for example, but can cause a teen to feel less guilt
and become more rebellious, Fleishman said.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say they don't see the trend abating; a combination
of drugs being safer, cheaper and too many families being more
willing to give one member a pill than haul everyone into
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep throwing more and more medications at
them,'' Fried said. ``Traditionally, children got a lot more
therapy because people were afraid to give them drugs. Now, our
kids, in some ways, are society's guinea pigs.''

   ATLANTA _ Cheer up, Sleepy Jean. There's a kind of hush all over
the world. It's still rock 'n' roll to me.
</P>
<P>
   If any of those phrases send you running to your vinyl record
collection, you're probably among the 45,000 or so people headed
for the Georgia Dome today for the Fox 97 annual Ultimate Oldies
Concert, the largest of its kind in the country. The daylong
carnival of music and wallow-in-it nostalgia features acts that
sold millions of records back when cars were big, hair was long and
skirts were really, really short.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artists on this year's bill _ including Jerry Lee
Lewis, Bobby Sherman, Mickey Dolenz (of the Monkees) and Tommy
James _ are now in their 50s and 60s. The youngest star on the
bill, Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits, is 51. Still, they'll take
the stage to sing about puppy love and petting in souped-up sports
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The day's acts, and the fans who turn, turn, turn out to see
them, will no doubt be happy together. But what concertgoers may
not realize, as they sing along, is that the oldies business has a
darker side. Behind the scenes, original artists are fighting for
the rights to their names, their music and their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody back then thought these songs would be big years
later,'' says Greg Lesher, editor of Goldmine Magazine, a
publication for record collectors. ``Most of these groups were just
happy to get a bus ride to New York. Nobody had any money. To them,
if they got paid $300 for the rights to a record, they couldn't
comprehend what that meant long-term. The artists didn't know what
they were doing, but the executives knew the ins and outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even names are lost
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the artists who wrote and recorded hits
that have become oldies staples see little if any money from their
work. Some aren't even allowed to use their stage names, or perform
under the name of their once-famous group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sold all the rights to their recordings. Take
Steppenwolf, for example,'' says Fox 97 program director Bill
Cahill. ``(Lead singer) John Kay owned the name of the band. Some
of the other members wanted to tour using the name. He said `OK'
under one condition. He wanted to own all the shares to all their
royalties on future reissues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the only Steppenwolf albums you could find sold
for 89 cents and came from the cutout bins at Woolworth's. The band
members signed their lives away,'' Cahill says. ``Kay made a
boatload of money when CDs came out. Now these guys are like, ``Oh
man, what did we do?''
</P>
<P>
   The Steppenwolfers weren't the only ones taken on a magic carpet
ride. The Turtles were another victim. When California teenagers
Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan signed with White Whale records in
the '60s, they apparently didn't read the fine print. The label not
only owned all the masters to their songs (including ``Happy
Together''), it owned the band's name as well. The contract even
forbid the guys from performing under their real names, so the duo
became Flo &AMP; Eddie. When the oldies craze hit, Volman and Kaylan
sued White Whale for royalties that had never been paid and won.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lesher and others, there are more horror stories:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ronnie Spector, lead singer with the Ronettes, can't use the
group's name or sing such hits as ``Be My Baby'' because her
ex-husband/producer Phil Spector owns the rights.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alex Chilton, the sultry blues singer behind such hits such as
``The Letter,'' can't refer to the Box Tops in any advertising or
promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dennis Edwards, who sang the scorching vocals on ``Papa Was a
Rolling Stone'' and ``Cloud Nine,'' is prohibited from even
mentioning that he was once lead singer of the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Florence Ballard, an original Supreme, died penniless in a
housing project in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more bizarre is that some of the people making
millions off classic Top 40 songs had little to do with the
original music. The world of oldies is peppered with Great
Pretenders. Cahill says one of the biggest challenges in booking
the Ultimate Oldies concert is ``finding people who are
legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were trying to investigate to see if the act we
were considering was the original Crystals,'' he says. ``I had no
idea. But we checked it out, and they were the real thing. But you
have to be careful. There's actually a Herman's Hermits out there
without Peter Noone. There's a Shangri Las out there, but I believe
most of the originals are deceased. I can't think of who could
possibly be in that group that would give it legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's like buying a box of Captain Crunch and inside
it's cornflakes,'' says Lesher. ``It's just not the same, and it's
not fair to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some artists are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Moore, wife of Sam Moore (as in Sam and Dave) has founded
a group called Artists and Others Against Impostors dedicated to
preserving ``truth in rock.'' She and a jukebox full of artists _
including members of the Platters, the Supremes, the Box Tops and
the Drifters _ have lobbied the U.S. House of Representatives to
consider legislation that would give performers the power to chase
impostor groups in the courts under federal trademark law. (The
bill is co-sponsored by Georgia Rep. Charlie Norwood.)
</P>
<P>
   Moore says she and her husband became dedicated to protecting
artists' rights after his former partner, Dave Prater, began
touring the country with another ``Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam and I had heard about this, so we decided to go see for
ourselves,'' she says. ``We went to Las Vegas, where `Sam and Dave'
were doing a show. We plopped down the money, went in, and it was
like watching a Fellini movie. It was totally surreal. It was like
watching a really bad car accident, and you know the people in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was furious, but for Sam it was worse. We had lost our house
and were living in a motel at the time. We were in really bad shape
financially, and here was Dave working for $3,000 a night. You do
the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Moore who owned the name ``Sam and Dave'' and
the rights to most of their material. But copyright laws were
rarely enforced when it came to oldies shows. Joyce Moore estimates
the couple spent close to $200,000 chasing laws that were basically
``catch me if you can'' before Prater died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make comments like, `What does it matter? It's the
music that people love.' But I don't believe that any more than
looking at a Picasso and saying, `It's just the paint,''' Moore
says.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to fool real fans
</P>
<P>
   Cahill says he goes to great pains to make sure the acts at the
Fox 97 concert are the real deal. Although some fans don't mind if
their music is delivered by someone who wasn't on the original
recording, many care passionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have two types of listeners: The ones who are keenly
interested in the music and care about it deeply, and the ones who
just like the song,'' he says. ``But the ones who do care, you
can't try to pull the wool over their eyes. We brought in Creedence
Clearwater Revisited once, and I had people calling and screaming
at me because John Fogerty (the man who sang and wrote the group's
hit songs) wasn't with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Fox 97 deejay J.J. Jackson: ``The audience wants to believe
that everything is just as they remember it, and the original is
the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to paraphrase the Stones, time isn't exactly on Fox 97's
side. While tunes such as ``I Get Around'' are timeless, the
reality is that acts are aging. The Beach Boys, who did that song,
are continuing but without any of the founding Wilson brothers.
This year, there are two versions of the Beach Boys on tour. One,
with lead singer Mike Love, plays Chastain Park Amphitheatre
tonight. The other features the somewhat marginal contributions of
bassist Al Jardine.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: How long can the Ultimate Oldies
Concert keep going? The answer: Probably until we're all in
assisted living communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be bands that go out and do these songs,''
Cahill says. ``When Mozart wrote his symphonies, he had no idea
they would go on for centuries. How do you know that `Splish
Splash' won't be around for decades? It's become a standard kids'
song.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesher says oldies acts are here to stay. ``I remember a couple
of years ago listening to a radio station, and they were taking
requests for oldies. Somebody called up and said they wanted to
hear `Like a Virgin' by Madonna. I thought `Holy Mackerel.' But,
truth is, everybody likes to identify with their growing-up days.
It's comfortable, like sleeping in your own bed at night.''
</P>
<P>
   NAME THAT TUNE
</P>
<P>
   Oldies songs never die, they just go to movies and television.
Or are remade by fresher groups. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Everyday People,'' the hit by Sly and the Family Stone, is
used to sell Toyotas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Beatles' ``Revolution'' sells Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Woodstock footage sells Tampax tampons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tommy James and the Shondells' ``Sweet Cherry Wine'' sells
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  James' ``Mony Mony'' sells Remington shavers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  James' ``Hanky Panky'' shows up in the movie ``Forrest Gump.''
His ``Draggin' the Line'' is featured in the movie ``Don't Tell Mom
the Babysitter's Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  James' ``Crimson and Clover'' was covered by Joan Jett. ``I
Think We're Alone Now'' was covered by Tiffany, and Billy Idol
burned up MTV with his version of ``Mony Mony.''

TUITION BENEFITS AID MANY WORKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debbie Cheney couldn't afford to go to college when she
graduated from high school, so she took a $4-an-hour clerical job.
</P>
<P>
   Once she got married and became a mother, her chances of going
to college seemed even more remote.
</P>
<P>
   But when her employer, Stewart &AMP; Stevenson, offered to pick up
the cost of books and tuition, Cheney jumped at the chance and
enrolled in night classes at San Jacinto College in Houston. She
has 12 credit hours under her belt and is working toward a
bachelor's degree in business management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't afford to go and get my degree without the help,''
said Cheney, a 38-year-old human resource assistant who is
reimbursed about $1,000 a year by Stewart &AMP; Stevenson. ``It takes
everything we have to pay the bills and take care of the kids and
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, especially large ones, help defray the college
expenses of their employees. It's a good way to get better-educated
employees and offer an important competitive benefit in this tight
labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress allows favorable tax treatment for
undergraduate educational expenses for both employees and their
employers. But that is set to expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   What Congress does next could greatly determine whether people
like Cheney will be able to continue improving their educations.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, employers can reimburse employees up to $5,250
each year and the money is not treated as income. That's good for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's an advantage for employers because they get a break on the
Social Security taxes they pay for employees and they can treat the
tuition like an ordinary business expense.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills in Congress _ one in the Senate sponsored by New York
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rhode Island Republican
William Roth and one in the House sponsored by Sandy Levin, D-Mich.
_ would retain that tax break and extend it to graduate school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EXPANSION DRAWS ARCHER'S IRE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, both bills are in committee and face opposition from the
powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, U.S. Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Archer supports extending the tax break for undergraduate
tuition, he opposes the proposals because they contain the break
for graduate students, says his spokesman, Sean Rushton.
</P>
<P>
   The tax benefits are expensive and the lost tax revenues have to
be made up somewhere, Rushton said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a lot of the money will go toward people earning law,
medicine and engineering degrees, he said. Those jobs pay well and
students can take out loans or save money to pay for their own
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to bear this burden on their own,'' Rushton said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said if she had to pay taxes on the $1,000 she is
reimbursed for tuition each year, she might not be able to afford
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Every penny counts, she said, worried the extra dollars would
throw her family into a higher tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help, an employee who earns $35,000 a year and
receives a $3,000 annual educational benefit would have to pay an
extra $1,249 in taxes, or $104 more a month, estimated Mike Aitken,
associate executive director of government and external relations
for the College and University Personnel Association in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EMPLOYERS ARE ALSO TROUBLED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opposition to the legislation also is troubling to
employers who offer the tuition help.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the best interests of employers to provide all the
incentives they can to encourage employees to go to school, said
Kathleen M. Fenninger, president of the Houston Human Resource
Management Association. If the tax benefits are taken away,
Fenninger said, she is worried some companies, especially small and
midsized ones, won't be able to offer the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the education help the company, it's also a strong
recruiting tool, said Fenninger, who also is senior director of
human resources for Enron Capital &AMP; Trade Resources in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For some applicants, the educational benefit is more important
than salary, she said. They want to know if the company has a
tuition reimbursement program and will compare companies based on
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a 1995 survey taken by the National Association
of Independent Colleges and Universities, the annual income of
employees receiving educational help from their employers for
undergraduate and graduate-level courses was $32,859, which is just
slightly above the national average annual wage of $30,946.

HOW TO DRAW AN ACE PICKING VIDEO CARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most interesting trends in the evolution of the
personal computer is how, occasionally, the development of a
particular component suddenly will take off. The part currently
enjoying one of these growth spurts is the video card.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of video cards long ago conquered the desktop, making
2-D Windows feel snappy and comfortable. But you can scroll through
a Web page or open a folder only so fast. The next frontier is 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The market for high-end 3-D graphics cards has heated up beyond
the boiling point. Capabilities are improving dramatically, while
prices are dropping drastically. The driver for this is 3-D gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, most of the graphics adapters found on off-the-shelf
consumer PCs leave something to be desired for games. Once users
get hooked on a game that requires lots of performance, they
realize they'll have to replace that sluggish puppy in their PC.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the replacement market has gone into high gear. You
can buy very fast cards very inexpensively, and you probably are
going to be confused by the choices. Reading the boxes or even
reviews written by hard-core techies is probably not going to help
you _ the jargon that surrounds video-card technology is incredibly
numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, I'm going to try to break through some
of the confusion, reviewing some state-of-the-art cards. For now,
let's take a look at the basic things you'll need to know when
shopping for a new video card that excels at 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   First, it helps to understand how many games work. In many
cases, objects in a 3-D game are like wire-frame models with a kind
of ``skin,'' or texture, placed over them.
</P>
<P>
   Textures can be simple or complex, depending on how the game is
designed. For example, a smooth wall or a slick road is simple. But
what about a bumpy wall covered with moss, or a dirt-and-gravel
road? Those kinds of images will use much more complicated
textures.
</P>
<P>
   A quality video card can handle these complex textures, and make
them appear on a screen quickly. When the textures are on moving
objects, the card must handle this as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all 3-D graphics cards sold today have sophisticated
features for 3-D, such as Z-buffering (where the card tracks moving
objects, even if you don't see them) and alpha blending (in which
some textures can be seen through others).
</P>
<P>
   However, other things can affect how well a game looks and plays
on a computer, including the speed of the PC's processor; the
amount of memory it has; and how fast information travels between
the processor, the video card and the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video memory. &UR;  &LR; At a minimum, you'll want eight megabytes of
video memory. Fortunately, this is not hard to find. In fact, many
midrange cards come with 16 megabytes, and higher-end cards have as
much as 32.
</P>
<P>
   With more video memory, a card can store and quickly display
more visual information. With less memory, a game will have to pull
information off files stored on a computer's hard drive, including
textures, lighting data and so on.
</P>
<P>
   More video memory also lets a card display more colors at
greater resolutions. The object is to have as many colors displayed
in as wide an area as possible. For example, it's better to have 24
million colors (often called 32-bit color) at a resolution of
1,024-by-768 pixels than to have just 16.7 million colors (or
16-bit color) at 800-by-600 pixels.
</P>
<P>
   Look for 128-bit video memory. This refers to how much
information can pass into the memory at any given time.
Older-generation cards have 32-and 64-bit memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speed. Like the processor in a PC, a video card also has a
chip that runs at a specific speed. The faster the chip, the more
information it can process in a given period of time.
</P>
<P>
   There are two measures of speed on a video card _ the clock
speed of the onboard processor, and the speed at which the image is
converted from digital to analog information and sent to the
monitor. This latter is known as the RAMDAC, and it's often much
faster than the clock speed.
</P>
<P>
   The clock speed, for game-playing, is the most important. The
higher the speed, the better. Next-generation cards run at speeds
of 100 megahertz or higher _ much higher.
</P>
<P>
   _ System bus. &UR;  &LR; Always use the fastest card connection available
in your computer for a new card.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ISA and PCI slots, use the PCI slots. If you also
have AGP slots _ often found in Pentium II-level systems and newer
_ use that connection.
</P>
<P>
   _ OpenGL and DirectX. Nearly all modern cards can display the
two most popular schemes for handling 3-D graphics _ Silicon
Graphics' OpenGL and Microsoft's DirectX.
</P>
<P>
   While almost all cards for Windows machines can work with
DirectX just fine, not all cards have drivers that handle OpenGL as
well. Check with the manufacturer of a card you're considering to
see if OpenGL drivers are available now. If they are still in
development, or have only recently been released, avoid that card.

IS THERE AN EASY WAY TO SAVE TEXT AND PHOTOS TOGETHER? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to save my son's home page to my hard
drive. He's got a lot of photos on it. When I do a File, then Save
As in Internet Explorer, I can save it as an HTML file. But the
photos don't come with it. I figured out that I can right-click on
the photos and save them separately. Is there any way to do this in
one step, and have everything saved to my hard drive at once?
</P>
<P>
   A: The File/Save As command does indeed only save the text _ not
the images _ in a Web page. But even if you use your right mouse
button to save them, you may not end up being able to see them.
</P>
<P>
   That's because some Web authors put images in a separate folder.
So, if you save the photos to the same folder as the HTML file, but
the author has written the page so the pictures are supposed to go
into a folder called IMAGES, you'll get the familiar ``broken
image'' icon. You'll need to create that IMAGES folder on your hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you save a lot of pages to your drive, this gets very old,
very fast.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say what version of Internet Explorer you're using,
but 5.0 has a very nice system for downloading and viewing Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Just add the page to your Favorites, and then click the ``Make
available offline'' checkbox. Click the Customize button to control
just how much material you end up saving to your hard drive. Be
careful here _ if you allow it to capture too much, you'll end up
grabbing much more than you need!
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like something more powerful, try Blue Squirrel's Web
Whacker, which gives you much more control over the process. A beta
version of Web Whacker 2000 is available from www.bluesquirrel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Here's a tip I'd like to share with your other readers. I
recently installed new video drivers on my computer. I couldn't get
the bootup process to complete _ it would just stop about 75
percent into it. I decided to use the Windows 98 boot-log feature
to see where it was hanging. When I did this, it started just fine,
and the BOOTLOG.TXT file showed no problems. I later had similar
problems with another program. I used the boot-log feature, and
what do you know? It started up just fine. I don't know what this
does, but it seems to ``fix'' certain problems.
</P>
<P>
   A: I, too, have noticed the strangely curative effects of making
a boot log file. It works like this: When your computer starts the
boot-up process (before you see the ``Starting Windows 98 ...''
message) hold down the CTRL key. You'll get a menu of several
different start-up options, including one that lets you set up a
log of every component that gets loaded into the system. Choose
this item and let the boot process continue.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, I've seen this feature take me past seemingly
insurmountable boot-up problems. Of course, even if it does not,
you'll still get a log file that shows where the process stopped _
look for BOOTLOG.TXT in your C:folder and read it with a text
editor _ that will help you troubleshoot your problem.

   Q: My computer has more than enough memory _ I loaded it up with
384 megabytes of RAM when I bought it! However, I find that Windows
still wants to set up a swap file on my hard drive. Why does it
need a swap file when I have so much memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: A swap file is simulated memory created on your hard drive.
Windows 95/98 expands and contracts this file as needed. Since
virtual memory on a hard drive is much slower than real memory, it
would make sense that Windows would not create this file until more
memory is needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, other programs often expect a swap file to be present,
and will call upon Windows to add more virtual memory.
</P>
<P>
   Having more memory will indeed speed up your computer's
operations, but the swap file is an unfortunate necessity.

CLINTON TAKES STEPS TO SMOOTH WAY FOR KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton took diplomatic steps Friday to
clear the way for quick deployment of U.S. ground troops into
Kosovo as the vanguard of a peacekeeping force once a truce takes
effect there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton personally apologized by telephone to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin for a mistaken U.S. bombing of China's embassy in
Belgrade _ the latest gesture to soothe Beijing and avert China's
veto of a planned U.N. Security Council resolution to authorize a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration continued working with Russia as well
to avert a possible Russian veto of the planned U.N. authorizing
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russia's envoy to
the Balkans, former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
planned to resume discussions in Helsinki Tuesday on an emerging
blueprint to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept allied conditions and halt his forces'
murderous ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in order
to win cessation of the escalating allied bombing campaign against
Yugoslav forces that has dropped more than 10,000 bombs and
missiles since March 24.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said U.S. officials are
banking that Chernomyrdin will return to Belgrade carrying ``the
clearest possible understanding of what will be necessary for
President Milosevic to agree to, and to accept, so that we can
suspend the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is prepared to suspend the bombing campaign
``only if there's a rapid and precise timetable for the withdrawal
of all Serb forces (from Kosovo) and there are verifiable and
demonstrable steps to that end,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, NATO's spokesman at headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, said allied forces are prepared to enter Kosovo within
hours of Milosevic's acceptance of NATO's conditions for suspending
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic has the good sense to do that tomorrow
... then certainly NATO would be ready,'' Shea said. ``When
Milosevic is ready, we are going to be ready because we won't allow
a vacuum to arise in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat planners at NATO headquarters and at the Pentagon are
enlarging the size of the peacekeeping ground forces targeted for
duty in Kosovo after a ceasefire goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Before seven weeks of combat operations against Yugoslav forces
began, the allies envisioned a 28,000-member peace enforcement
operation, including 4,000 American soldiers, to enter Kosovo in
conjunction with a negotiated peace agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon conceded Thursday that Pentagon
planners now believe that ``a larger force will be required to go
in as a peacekeeping force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether it will be twice as large or three times
as large or 50 percent as large as we initially planned,'' Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman at NATO headquarters said Friday that alliance
planners are examining what extra duties may be assigned to
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have to be mindful of the need to look at mines,
look at law-and-order functions, look at the need to return
refugees, perhaps the need for a winterization program so that
those refugees can be returned home before the onset of bad
weather,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want the international security force to protect the
return to their homes of some 1.4 million ethnic Albanian Muslim
refugees who have fled the Serbian onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton reiterated the allies'
commitment to protecting the return of the refugees to Kosovo
during a visit to a refugee camp in Macedonia on Friday where
23,000 Kosovar refugees are living in tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend
to let the evil which Milosevic perpetrated against these people
keep them away from their homeland and their homes,'' Mrs. Clinton
declared.

GARRY WILLS TAKES ON SEX AND THE SINGLE SAINT 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sinners have always loved Augustine, the fourth-century saint,
for he has seemed like such a great sinner himself. He was obsessed
with sex, or so it appeared in his great work ``The City of God.''
He was willing to undertake a rigorous self-analysis in writings
like his ``Confessions,'' giving him an almost contemporary
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   But now the journalist Garry Wills has written ``St. Augustine''
(in the Penguin Lives series of brief biographies), which tries to
revise the popular view of the saint, and the work may disappoint
some sinners. In the book, Wills says that Augustine wasn't
sex-obsessed at all but concerned with how sexual dysfunction
reflects man's fall from grace; and that the ``Confessions'' was
not a straight autobiography but ``mainly a theological meditation
on his own life.'' ``Revelation is not simply a text outside
life,'' he says. ``Rather it enters your life in the form of your
own experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Wills explain then, St. Augustine's relevance to the
modern world?
</P>
<P>
   But Wills will not reduce St. Augustine to ``sound bites,'' as
he puts it. His full, cherubic face often remains expressionless
when he speaks; sometimes there is a thin smile. He is 64 and lives
in a large yellow brick house in Evanston, Ill., where one of the
interviews with him were conducted. He seems impatient with people
who are not as well read as he is. ``He's sort of like a good
boxer,'' said his good friend, Studs Terkel. ``He doesn't waste any
punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he let down his guard for a moment. Perhaps there are
parallels between him and St. Augustine with respect to Augustine's
quest for self-knowledge? ``There are no parallels with my own
life. That's nonsense,'' Wills said, annoyance coloring his voice.
``Don't try to push that idea. It makes no sense. I have no
identification with him whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many books he has written, he curtly replied, ``Look
it up in `Who's Who.''' ``Who's Who'' lists 19, including one with
a co-author and one he edited. That would make ``St. Augustine''
his 20th book, and next fall he will publish another, ``A Necessary
Evil'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), about Americans' fear of government.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive than the number, however, is the range. He has
brought his talent as a scholar to everything from Italian film to
opera, from President Clinton to the Declaration of Independence.
He has a mimetic memory of obscure fourth-century North African
ecclesiastical texts in his book on Augustine, of Homeric boxing
references in an article on Muhammad Ali and of ancient Greek
rhetorical terms in his 1992 book, ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' a
study of the Gettysburg address, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Wills said he owes his retentive memory to his Catholic school
education, with its emphasis on recitation. Robert Silvers, his
editor at The New York Review of Books, says the breadth of Wills'
learning sometimes makes him ``a little speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone who combines this remarkable range of
interests and abilities,'' Silvers said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to identify the common thread in his work, Wills
responds: ``I suppose the study of culture.'' The Presidents he has
written about _ John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan
_ are what he calls ``cultural indicators.'' They ``tell you a good
deal about the America they were in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another theme that stands out in Wills' writing: the
constant interplay between myth and reality in American life. In
his first big success in 1970, ``Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the
Self-Made Man,'' he famously called Nixon a liberal trying to
resurrect ``a web of myths that have lost their magic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emersonian ideal of hard work has lost its power, Wills
argued, and Adam Smith's notion of a self-regulating market place
hasn't worked. Politicians must give up their atomistic vision for
a more communitarian ideal, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan's America: Innocents at Home,'' continued the theme of
myths. Reagan, Wills wrote, ``is the sincerest claimant to a
heritage that never existed, a perfect blend of an authentic
America he grew up in and of that America's own fables about its
past.''
</P>
<P>
   He embodied ``an American instinct to claim simplicity,'' but
his sunny nature belied a painful Depression-era childhood. He
opposed welfare, but his family received government relief during
the Depression. As president, Reagan claimed to have reduced
government spending, but he actually increased it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``John Wayne's America,'' Wills wrote that Wayne presented
himself as the awkward individualist, the brave warrior, defending
the endless frontier even though he never served in the military.
He played the cowboy but hated horses. He became for Americans ``a
conduit they used to communicate with their own desired selves or
their own imagined past.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wayne, Wills is a child of the Midwest. He was raised for
the most part in Adrian, Mich. His father, John Wills, sold
appliances. His mother, Mayno, worked for the State Department of
Unemployment. Wills parents were divorced, then remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his Jesuit high school teachers, Wills entered a
seminary. But he didn't make it as a priest. ``It was eros
specifically and generally,'' Wills said. Today he is a practicing
Catholic who regularly attends church but says he believes in a
right to abortion, marriage for priests and the ordination of
women.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to get his doctorate in classics from Yale, writing
his dissertation on Aeschylus. While at Yale he sent an unsolicited
article attacking what he called the glib style of Time magazine to
William F. Buckley Jr., the editor of the conservative National
Review. Buckley printed it and began giving him assignments.
</P>
<P>
   When they met, ``he asked me if I was a conservative,'' Wills
said. Wills told him: ``I'm a distributist, like G.K. Chesterton.
Communitarian. Anti-capitalist. Anti-government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a conservative?'' Wills asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid not,'' Buckley replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wills became one of the young writers of National
Review's golden age, among them Joan Didion, Renata Adler, John
Leonard and Arlene Croce.
</P>
<P>
   But during the Vietnam War his politics began to change. He was
arrested twice in antiwar demonstrations. When Buckley rejected one
of his articles on Vietnam, they parted ways amicably, Wills said.
Today Wills describes himself as a cultural conservative, but when
it comes to politics, ``I'm more a Democrat than a Republican.''

Undated: than a Republican.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1957 Wills covered the Senate hearings on Jimmy Hoffa for the
National Review. He was on the shuttle from Washington when a
stewardess with ``big and mocking Italian eyes'' noticed he was
reading Henri Bergson's ``Two Sources,'' Wills wrote in
``Confessions of a Conservative.'' ``She said, `Aren't you a little
too young to be reading that?' '' The stewardess was Natalie
Cavallo, and Wills married her.
</P>
<P>
   Even on their honeymoon in England, Wills wasted no time, doing
research for his first book, ``Chesterton: Man and Mask,''
published in 1961. Today Natalie Wills is her husband's first
reader. She takes photographs to aid his memory. She handles the
financial aspects of his career, leaving him time to write in the
mornings at home and in the afternoon to do research at the
library. They have three children, Lydia, 35, a literary agent;
Garry Jr., 38, a film maker, and John, 39, a programmer.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his adult life, Wills has been an academic. At times
he has been accused of having an academic style. ``Garry Wills is a
bright young man who left his Yale doctorate in classics behind him
only to bring the academic vices of preciosity and obfuscation to
his new career as a political journalist,'' one Newsweek critic
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Wills gave up tenure at Northwestern University, though
he has remained in Evanston, teaching one course annually. He
prefers living far from Washington and New York, he said. ``I'd
rather be remote. I get more work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills said he had long been preoccupied with St. Augustine.
Augustine was born in what is now Algeria in 354. From age 16 to 31
he lived with a woman who bore him a son. He converted to
Christianity and eventually became bishop of Hippo. His doctrines
on original sin, divine grace and free will have influenced every
branch of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine wrote frankly about sex in ``The City of God:'' ``At
times, without intention, the body stirs on its own insistent,''
Augustine wrote. ``At other times, it leaves a straining lover in
the lurch.'' At another point he describes the Stoics' wanting to
defy social codes by having public intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   But because they couldn't respond on command, they used clubs to
simulate an erection. Still, despite the almost graphic nature of
some of his writings, Wills said, for Augustine sexual turmoil is
``one sign of the inner dividedness of the human being. Your body
doesn't respond the way you want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed, violence and deception were greater concerns in his
sermons,'' Wills writes.
</P>
<P>
   Wills is translating ``Confessions'' from the Latin and writing
a commentary on it. He said he was drawn to Augustine because ``he
has such a questioning mind, such a fresh way of going at
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way the quest for God is a quest into himself,'' Wills
said. ``He's also just a great writer.''

NEW THINK TANK REPRESENTS `RADICAL CENTER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Thinktankland, the main attractions are by now
wearyingly familiar. The conservative Heritage Foundation and the
American Enterprise Institute and the liberal Brookings Institution
along with several others have for years competed to convert their
ideas about taxes, foreign policy, the environment or whatever into
policy in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   But since the beginning of this year, a new entry in the
public-policy community, the New America Foundation, has been
trying to provide something different.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ted Halstead, its president, New America has ensconced
itself in handsome quarters near Dupont Circle and hopes to change
the think-tank landscape. Halstead boasts that New America will
introduce younger voices, break out of the trditional liberal and
conservative categories and produce unconventional ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how many innovations New America offers, none may
be as brilliant as the one associated with its founding: getting
money from the cyberbarons of Silicon Valley. New America's board
includes Eric Schmidt, the chairman and chief executive of Novell,
and Eric Benhamou, chairman and chief executive of 3Com Corp.
Halstead and James Fallows, the chairman of New America, are
courting other leaders in Silicon Valley, most notably Andrew
Grove, the head of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt of Novell said in an interview that New America was
attractive to him and his fellow high-tech entrepreneurs because it
was trying to escape the classic liberal vs. conservative divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that here is a place in which new ideas can flourish
which are not aligned with any partisan view,'' he said. ``A large
number of people out here are tired of the left-right debate, which
exists largely because it makes for good television.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech entrepreneurs have been so busy making money, he said,
that they have ignored government and public-policy issues. ``But
the government is no longer ignoring us,'' he said, ``so we have to
get organized, to have vehicles for this, and this _ New America _
is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said that typically when a corporate leader in Silicon
Valley meets with a member of Congress, the talk invariably ends
with the congressman's disingenuous interest in the businessman's
ideas and a naked pitch for campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   New America, he said, will not be obliged to champion the broad
tenets of Silicon Valley, which some loosely define as meritocracy,
individual incentives and as little government interference as is
feasible. ``The ideas that come out may well include some I might
not agree with,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, the center of gravity in Thinktankland
has tilted to the right. The Heritage Foundation, brash and
aggressive, and the American Enterprise Institute, its more staid
cousin, have been able to wield influence in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and more recently in the Republican-dominated
Congress. They have outpaced their counterparts on the left in both
influence and money.
</P>
<P>
   The success of places like Heritage _ and perhaps New America _
also underlines the remoteness of universities from real
policy-making, which has stirred some ambivalence in the academic
world about whether this should change.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Silicon Valley has embraced a youth culture, so does the
New America Foundation. Halstead, who thought up the idea for New
America with a few friends, is 30 years old and already on his
second think tank. When he was 25 he founded Redefining America, a
San Francisco-based foundation that specializes in environmental
and economic programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming article in The Atlantic Monthly, Halstead
argues that people his age have removed themselves from politics
and policy in overwhelming numbers, largely out of distrust of
political leaders and institutions as well as impatience with the
constricting right and left labels.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Enterprise Institute, the term ``senior fellow''
applies to people like Jeane Kirkpatrick, the chief U.S. delegate
to the United Nations in the Reagan administration, and Herbert
Stein, the chairman of economic advisers in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   At New America, senior fellows are in their 30s and mere fellows
are in their 20s because, as Halstead said in an interview, they
have not acquired the seasoning to have made a name for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Heritage Foundation's strategies has been to produce
a report to promote an idea and hold a news conference or
distribute the report to the press, but New America's approach is
to subsidize the journalists directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new way, we think, is to get people to write and place
their ideas in newspapers, magazines, and to discuss them on talk
shows,'' Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior fellows this year, Debra Dickerson, Michael Lind and
Margaret Talbot, are being given annual grants of $50,000 apiece,
health benefits and an office, plus whatever fees they earn from
publishing their writings. Five fellows are given $25,000 each plus
an office and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In return, they are expected to identify themselves as fellows
at the New America Foundation when they write. Lind and Ms. Talbot
have each written two articles for The New York Times in which they
were identified as senior fellows of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the working philosophy of the New America Foundation?
</P>
<P>
   The question produces a series of agonized answers from Halstead
and just about everybody else connected with New America. New
America, it seems, has defined itself more by what it isn't than by
what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young person who is not a conservative and who wants to
comment on public affairs, there is an intellectual loneliness,''
Halstead said. ``There are not enough partners on the ideological
center.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Halstead said he favors the description ``radical
center,'' a term that neatly combines the notion of ferment
(radical) with steadiness and a sensible avoidance of fringe ideas
(center).
</P>
<P>
   To Halstead, a shorthand definition of the radical center
includes economic populism (as in, say, support for higher minimum
wages) and skepticism about social programs (including an unease
with many forms of affirmative action).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to subsidizing fellows, New America plans specific
projects, Halstead said, like one investigating whether it makes
sense for the United States to sell assets like mineral rights or
polluting permits to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for the next New Deal,'' he said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16)  
 (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly half a century ago, on Feb. 21, 1952, the front page of
The New York Times hailed a ``revolutionary process'' for turning
sea water into drinkable drops. The process was complicated and
expensive, requiring lots of energy to push water through membranes
that filtered out salt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the article predicted that desalting would ``open vast
new reservoirs of fresh water'' for use ``wherever water is now
scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. People drink desalted ocean water in some
Caribbean hotels and in big swaths of Saudi Arabia, and local
authorities in Santa Barbara, Calif., and Key West, Fla., have
toyed with the process at times. But desalting plants do not dot
the world's coasts, and water shortages have not been consigned to
history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those rosy predictions from 1952 may have only been
premature. Years of gradual improvements in membranes, declining
energy costs, growing water demand and fears about groundwater
contamination are combining to make widespread commercial-scale
desalting viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people spent decades sweating the details of bringing
costs down and reliability up, and it's finally paying off,'' said
James D. Birkett, director of the International Desalination
Association.
</P>
<P>
   And Arthur L. Goldstein, the chairman of Ionics, a desalting
pioneer in Watertown, Mass., has taken to comparing the industry's
time line to that of aviation. It took decades from the Wright
Brothers' first plane ``for airline transportation to become
commercial,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-water desalting still isn't cheap. Even at the most
efficient plants, a thousand gallons of desalted water costs around
$2 to produce, twice the typical cost of water pumped from
underground aquifers or other freshwater sources.
</P>
<P>
   But in many places, those sources are contaminated, overused or
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desalination is always more expensive than getting water from
a lake or river, but those aren't always options,'' said Larry
Pelegrin, vice president of sales for Hydranautics, the Oceanside,
Calif.-based membrane technology subsidiary of the Nitto Denko
Corp. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of California, for example, the options have
narrowed to desalting ocean water or treating waste water, a choice
that often brings the local citizenry into the desalting camp,
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot cheaper to treat waste water, and it yields
perfectly clean water, but the idea just disgusts people,''
observed Karen G. Rasmussen, a water industry analyst at Frost &AMP;
Sullivan, a research firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So ocean desalting is moving to the fore when cities need to
shore up water supplies _ and not just coastal cities. ``As
desalination prices keep going down, it could make economic sense
for a desalting plant in California to pipe clean water to inland
cities hundreds of miles away,'' said Robert W. McIlvaine,
president of the McIlvaine Co., a research firm in Northbrook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering and construction companies, membrane manufacturers
and water treatment specialists say they are swamped with requests
for information and are increasingly asked to bid on projects.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Johnson, who runs global marketing for the water treatment
business of Dow Chemical, called sea-water desalination ``one of
our biggest growth areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon Resources, based in Stamford, Conn., until recently a
wholesale provider of electricity, has sold its power plants to
concentrate on providing water, particularly through desalting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale power is mature, but this water industry is in its
infancy,'' said Walter Q. Howard, Poseidon's president. And a
recent McIlvaine study found desalting to be one of the
fastest-growing markets for membrane makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East, Spain and other arid places are eager buyers of
desalting plants. Singapore, tired of relying on Malaysia for
drinking water, plans a 36 million-gallon-a-day plant. Even
Britain, whose reputation as a dank, wet place ignores large areas
on its eastern coast where fresh water is scarce, has a desalting
plant under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, North American corporations want to capitalize
on the growth. Hydranautics just relocated an executive to Abu
Dhabi, and Zenon Environmental, a water treatment company in
Burlington, Ontario, recently set up a subsidiary in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desalination is a really healthy global industry that is going
to grow at a significant rate,'' said James W. Hotchkies, a manager
of business development for Zenon.
</P>
<P>
   It already has for Osmonics, a membrane and pump company in
Minnetonka, Minn. In three years, desalting has quintupled to 10
percent of Osmonics sales, ``and I wouldn't be surprised if it
becomes a third of our business,'' said D. Dean Spatz, the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Desalting's prospects in the United States may rest heavily on a
closely watched project in Florida, where depletion of ground water
threatens vital wetlands. Tampa Bay Water, the water utility
serving Tampa, St. Petersburg and New Port Richey, recently hired a
consortium led by Poseidon and Stone &AMP; Webster to build a plant
that will yield 25 million gallons a day, or 10 percent of the
area's water usage, at a cost that will average $2 for every 1,000
gallons over 10 years. The plant is scheduled to begin production
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium will design, build and run the plant for the
utility under a single contract, an approach that allows it to make
advantageous trade-offs like installing automation equipment to
save on operating labor and using more expensive but more efficient
pumps. Such combinations would be impossible if Tampa Bay followed
the traditional route of seeking competitive bids for each facet of
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Even the consortium's competitors wish the project well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desalination has never had a lot of public support in the
United States,'' said Fared Salem, the desalination industry
manager for the DuPont Co., a major supplier of membranes and a
losing bidder on the Tampa project. ``But maybe Tampa will cause
renewed interest in a technology that can really address the 21st
century's water problems.''

`JOAN OF ARC': A FUTURE SAINT TAKES IT A DAY AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a drama, and maybe even as a history lesson, ``Joan of Arc''
works. This CBS mini-series, which begins Sunday night, manages to
present its 15th-century heroine as a real and fallible young woman
without robbing her story of the required patina of legend. From
Joan's sad little village to her devastating battles to the
inquisition that condemns her, the film follows a course of
emotional authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   There are virtually no laughs, not even many smiles, in these
four hours. But it is a measure of the film's success that it is
never grim. It is, as it must be, the tale of a destiny followed
with courage to its inevitable end.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which concludes Tuesday, manages to fulfill its own
destiny despite some obvious shortcomings of both conception and
casting. While concentrating all its narrative energy on
16-year-old Leelee Sobieski as Joan, the illiterate French peasant
girl who says heavenly voices command her to lead the King's army,
the drama never makes clear the complex political forces that drive
such actions.
</P>
<P>
   You have the competing interests of the French, not to be
confused with the people of Burgundy, both of them slipping in and
out of treacherous alliances with each other and the English. No
wonder the Hundred Years' War took so long to sort out. Viewers of
this Two Nights' War may be a bit baffled.
</P>
<P>
   As for the featured performers, well, this is a mini-series. So
familiar names and faces are more important than a unified
approach. The names and faces include those of Robert Loggia,
Olympia Dukakis, Maximilian Schell, Jacqueline Bisset and Shirley
MacLaine. And while their performances never seem phoned in, as in
some hastily assembled television productions, their styles and
levels of intensity do not always mesh.
</P>
<P>
   To find a harmony of approach in a pivotal encounter between
Neil Patrick Harris, as the Dauphin Charles, and Peter O'Toole, as
the manipulative Bishop Cauchon, may have taken more divine
intervention than the director, Christian Duguay, could call upon.
(Doogie Howser meets Lawrence of Arabia? Nah.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of the blame must be borne by the writers, Ronald
Parker and Michael Miller. They're the ones who expected O'Toole to
tell Harris with rheumy-eyed conviction, ``As His Majesty's
church-appointed spiritual adviser, I advise His Majesty not to
take lightly the advice of his spiritual adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Sobieski, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Helen
Hunt, she makes a swell-looking Joan of Arc. She looks terrific in
armor, up on that proud white steed. You'll understand in a second
why thousands gladly follow her to war. And she has a whole array
of facial expressions at her disposal. She can pout. She can
grimace. She can glow with the purest piety.
</P>
<P>
   But when she is called upon to speak, the illusion slips a bit.
Her voice cannot manage the conviction of her eyes. Maybe the
script is letting her down, too. But when, early in her quest, a
nasty nobleman derisively asks whether it's true that Joan wants to
unite ``the poor wretches of France,'' she replies, ``Uh-huh.'' He
finds that funny. Wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Later, when her trusted friend Jean (sensitively played by Chad
Willett) asks Joan, ``Where's all this going?,'' she replies: ``I
dunno. I just take it as it comes.'' Like, that is so not heroic,
y'know?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film displays strengths enough to ride past these
rough spots. It carries Joan convincingly from her first encounters
with the saints to her willing martyrdom. Along the way it is ably
served by many in the cast, including Loggia, as a kindly priest;
Ms. Dukakis, as a sprightly nun, and Peter Strauss as a grizzled
soldier whose resentment of Joan gives way, gradually but totally,
to respectful affection.
</P>
<P>
   The director and writers must share some of the credit, too.
Their film is bathed in a dull, muddy light that reinforces its
long-ago quality, as if it were written on faded parchment.
</P>
<P>
   Like its heroine, the film is flawed, and perhaps it is not
quite worthy of its lofty ambitions. But like her, the drama knows
where it's going and succeeds merely by getting there.

PROGRAM PROVIDES PARTY DECORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer, with graduations, weddings and holidays, is a party
season. To help put parties together, American Greetings offers
CreataParty!, with more than 100,000 project possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows-based program (about $25-$30) makes all sorts of
party goodies: invitations and envelopes, banners, place cards,
hats, party favors, T-shirts and napkin rings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike going to a party store, where items are packaged in sets
that have more items than guests, party throwers can make as many
items as they want. They can also customize party materials with
the names of featured guests or sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of party themes ranging from birthdays (with 20
subcategories including dinosaurs, money and baseball fun) to
special occasions and engagements. Additional art packages can be
purchased online as well, and if there's absolutely nothing that
pleases, users can start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, will find that the best way is to call up a
ready-made party set and use the program's various photo and
text-editing tools to customize what's already in place.
</P>
<P>
   Also included: Forget-Me-Not reminders, which pop up should
there be any important dates in the near future; cropping and
drawing tools; twain support for scanners and digital cameras; the
ability to create borders from ready-made art or photos; and ``year
you were born'' information.
</P>
<P>
   Creating party decorations takes time, and if the party will
include more than a few people, help will be welcome.

<P>
   WATCH YOUR BACK
</P>
<P>
   The PC Mirror isn't much of a gadget in the way of high tech.
It's a 4-by-4-inch mirror in a computer-beige frame that attaches
to the side of a computer monitor. It's on a hinge, and can swing
so you see yourself _ should you be particularly vain or curious if
lunch may still be on your chin.
</P>
<P>
   If you're somewhat paranoid, or a former fighter pilot familiar
with the term ``watch your six,'' you can swing it so the rearview
is covered.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Newman, the inventor of PC Mirror and president of Assist
Technologies Inc., said he noticed the need for a high-quality
mirror when he was visiting computer-based clients.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about it is that it's a flat-surfaced glass
mirror. It's not one of the cheap convex kind, a little bigger than
a matchbox, that sticks on the monitor, makes objects look like
they're in a fun house, and has an image so small that it's
difficult to determine who _ or what _ is reflected in them.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of like eyes in the back of your head.
</P>
<P>
   The mirrors are $9.95 each, plus $3 shipping for the first
mirror; $1 for each additional. There are four ways to order the
mirror: tollfree, 1-800-655-2911, anytime; fax, 914-228-1765; by
mailing a check or money order to Assist Technologies Inc., 533
Route 52, Carmel Business Center, Lake Carmel, NY 10512; or through
the Web, www.pcmirror.com using Visa or MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC COMPRESSION
</P>
<P>
   Music on the Internet is often found in an MP3 file. It's a file
that compresses music, allowing a 30 megabyte song (about three
minutes of music) to be reduced to less than three megabytes with
little, if any, reduction in sound quality. A WinAmp player
(www.winamp.com) is the best way to compress or play such files.
</P>
<P>
   The size reduction is remarkable, but it may become even more
so. A new technology developed by AT&AMP;T offers 16-to-1 compression,
bringing the 30 megabtye file mentioned earlier down to less than
two megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   ShadowMan Entertainment is an Internet record-label based in
West Hollywood. The company uses this new technology in its
Internet marketing, which includes a proprietary e-mail delivery
system, a proprietary entertainment database, and electronic
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   ShadowMan Entertainment is using Kelli Lidell, an urban-country
singer, as its beta-test artist. Her ``Here Today Gone Tomorrow''
was in the Top Five on British recording charts and No. 1 in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Although the music format is labeled MP4, the designation is not
connected with MP3, the computer shorthand for ``open source MPEG 1
Layer 3,'' a company spokesman said. It is based on AT&AMP;T's audio
compression method, a2b.
</P>
<P>
   The music format allows Web surfers to play a 20-second sample
of a song with little waiting for download. It also allows users to
send audio ``postcards'' to friends so artists who can't afford
other promotional methods can have their music heard around the
country.

NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. The Tanjug
state-controlled news agency, reported 100 civilians in a column of
500 ethnic Albanian refugees heading toward the Albanian border
were killed in a NATO aerial attack. The allies said they could not
immediately confirm or deny the report. Meanwhile, Apache attack
helicopters held their first ``live fire'' exercise. Developing.

   ISRAEL-VOTE _ El Al (the Israeli Airline) is offering charter
flights at cut rates, and several Israeli political parties are
sponsoring trips to Israel to bring back Israelis living in America
so they can vote in the May 17 election. Election turnout is
already about 80 percent in Israel and the last election was
decided by less than 30,000 votes of about 2 million cast. There
are around 100,000 Israelis living in America; none can vote by
mail except diplomats so the effort to get them back is intense. We
will speak to at least one Israeli living in Boca Raton about why
he feels it is important to go back, as well as Israeli political
analysts and political organizers in the Miami area. (Belkin, Palm

   VONNEGUT-GRADS _ ATLANTA _ Sure, there was pomp. To say nothing
of circumstance. With 140 graduates receiving their diplomas this
morning, Agnes Scott College may have one of the smaller
commencements going. But look at the big fish they reeled in as
their speaker. Born-again pop culture touchstone Kurt Vonnegut, who
set off a flurry of Internet activity two years ago and spawned a
current Top 40 record _ all because of a commencement address he
never gave, delivered his only such speech of the year at the
Decatur college. Senior class President Sandy Miller said the
students selected Vonnegut long before the song, ``Everybody's Free
(To Wear Sunscreen),'' became a hit. No matter, said the author of
the anti-war classic ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and numerous other
novels: ``It's probably made me more famous than anything I've ever
done.'' (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ It had been two decades since Rodrianne
Croisdale dipped her toes in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to walk on the beach all the time,'' said Croisdale,
48, who has multiple sclerosis. She uses a wheelchair and sidewalk
scooter to get around.
</P>
<P>
   From a beachfront office, she advises the city on issues
affecting disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out these windows and I see people walking up and down
the beach all the time, and I'm terribly jealous,'' Croisdale said.
</P>
<P>
   But her envy ended this week, when Croisdale crossed the sand
and splashed in the sea while seated in one of two new all-terrain
wheelchairs recently purchased by the city of Santa Barbara's
recreation department.
</P>
<P>
   The splashy green chairs with their giant, green,
doughnut-shaped tires are wider, lighter and lower to the ground
than typical wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   They are being loaned out for free to the city's 3,000 disabled
residents, as well as to seniors and others who have trouble
trekking across the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 20 years, I've been wishing that I could get down
by the water,'' said Croisdale, ``but there's no way unless my
brother would carry me, and that's not really the way I'd want to
arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she can arrive in style. The chairs cost $2,500 each and
were purchased from a New Jersey-based company called Natural
Access, which manufactures various recreational vehicles for people
with disabilities. The city used grant money to buy the chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The beach buggies are constructed of waterproof nylon and
stainless steel, so they can be safely wheeled through the small
waves that lap at the shore. The leg rest can even be brought up
parallel to the ground, like a lounge chair, so sun-worshipping
passengers can put their feet up and catch some rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a ball,'' said Croisdale moments after her first ride
through the shallow surf. ``A wave actually had the nerve to come
up and get me good.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairs, which require someone to push them, can be checked
out free of charge for two hours at a time. Users are welcome to
wheel it to any city beach, but they may not want to go too far.
Riding across the sand can be wildly bumpy, and pushing someone
across the sand can be downright tiring.
</P>
<P>
   If the chairs prove popular, the recreation department will
consider buying another. Until then, Croisdale hopes to use the
chairs as often as she can find someone to push her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what we need,'' she said, ``is a little booth where strong
men hang out.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Ellison will not have it easy in death, just as he did not
have it easy in life. In a 1982 letter recently published in The
New Republic, he complained about the harsh treatment he received
``from some of the so-called black radicals during the late '60s
and most of the '30s.'' That included accusations that the author
of ``Invisible Man'' (1952) was an ``Uncle Tom,'' a careerist
producing ``obsequious bleatings of white appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations have faded, but there are still rumblings of
discontent about Ellison's persistent defense of American ideals
and his ``elitist'' esthetic demands. And matters are bound to
become still more complicated when Random House publishes
``Juneteenth'' next month _ a novel posthumously constructed from
40 years' accumulation of notes and excerpts. It simmers with
portentous racial themes; its elaborate miscegenation of ideas and
identities includes a stirring speech about the intricacies of
American identity delivered, eerily, by a racist senator.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month a conference on ``Ellison and American
Culture'' organized by Morris Dickstein, director of the Center for
the Humanities at the City University of New York, raised yet
another set of opposing categories for classifying Ellison: was he
a parvenu or a pariah? Was he, in other words, a social climber
clamoring for the acclaim of white society, willing to sacrifice
his distinctiveness by adopting the values of the majority, or was
he a dissenter whose perspective from the outskirts of society
allowed him to champion its greatest ideals while grieving over its
greatest failures?
</P>
<P>
   The terms parvenu and pariah were introduced at the conference
by Ross Posnock, a professor of English at the University of
Washington. Hannah Arendt had used them to discuss the nature of
Jewish identity in Germany. The parvenu yearned for acceptance; the
pariah accepted a distinction. The notion of parvenu has an aura of
phoniness; being a pariah has come to seem proudly authentic.
</P>
<P>
   These concepts have broad implications because the
parvenu/pariah distinction is at the heart of most contemporary
debates about racial and ethnic identity and American culture. How
much should any group sacrifice for the sake of a hyphenated
identity? Is it necessary to become a parvenu to become American?
Can one remain a pariah and be American?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions haunted Ellison throughout his career. In his
essay ``The World and the Jug'' (1963), he chastised Irving Howe
for suggesting that he was being less true to his racial identity
than Richard Wright or James Baldwin were in their angry attempts
to make literature serve a political purpose. Ellison countered
that this was presumptuous, that individuality and character were
far more important in literature than allegiance to a set of
doctrines. Far from there being a required mode of racial anger,
there are many possible responses; there was even, he wrote, ``an
American Negro tradition ... which abhors as obscene any trading on
one's own anguish for gain or sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   But similar criticisms are still being made of Ellison and the
acclaim accorded his work. At the City University conference, Jerry
Watts, a professor of American studies at Trinity College, said he
thought there had been excessive veneration of Ellison, that the
work had been treated by black critics and readers as part of a
``quest for respectability'' to be granted by white society.
Barbara Foley, an English professor at Rutgers University, proposed
that Ellison may really have been a parvenu, turning ``Invisible
Man'' into an anti-Communist novel to court acceptance in the
McCarthy era: ``That is a lot of what remains behind Ellison's
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views suggest that there is a clear definition of what the
authentic American black should do: reject white ``respectability''
and adopt political radicalism. Ellison passionately objected to
such demands. He even objected to being treated as a black-American
writer, just as Saul Bellow bristled at the label of
Jewish-American novelist. The hyphens may be suggestive of shared
experience, but they do not bind or obligate; they serve to
liberate. They provide the particular perspective from which a
broad vision of human life can be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be that the best literary comparison with
``Invisible Man'' is not a book in the black-American canon like
Wright's ``Native Son'' but Bellow's ``Adventures of Augie March,''
which appeared around the same time as Ellison's novel. The tempers
of the books, of course, are quite different, and Augie March's
identity, while unmistakably Jewish, is far less central to his
picaresque journey. But in both the characters are swept up in an
American maelstrom. In both the issues of self-definition loom
large; in both the characters struggle for an elusive autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the problem for the main character of ``Invisible Man''
is that he is only seen as an incarnation of his race, being
battered about by both blacks and whites who impose their visions
of racial identity on him. This is just what Ellison himself was
objecting to when answering his critics. In his 1981 introduction
to ``Invisible Man,'' Ellison argued that ``the interests of art
and democracy converge.'' Democracy values the ``development of
conscious, articulate citizens''; art values ``the creation of
conscious, articulate characters.'' Such individuality was for
Ellison a mark of freedom, and it could be earned only outside
politics. Art combines the perspective of the parvenu and the
pariah.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Ellison may have struggled through 40 years of
desertlike wandering without ever finishing his second novel was
that he was seeking some way to reveal the nature of America's
racial trauma without being either political or prescriptive. He
never fully emerged from the racial heart of darkness, but
``Juneteenth'' will be one incomplete trace of his attempt to leave
the parvenu and pariah behind.

 &HT;    Watching a dope deal
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I saw a dope deal last week.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll admit, I'm not 100 percent sure it was a dope deal.
Never having been involved in such a thing myself (regular readers
of this column may have some doubts about that), I could be wrong.
I only see dope deals on
</P>
<P>
   television and in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   So read this story knowing it is possible that the four people
who were walking down Jefferson Road the other day were just out
for a stroll, hoping to commune with nature.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not even sure what caught my eye about the whole situation.
Maybe it was the bright red hair and beard sported by one of the
three white people walking down Jefferson Road in a group. Maybe it
was the singular black man walking toward them. Maybe it was the
look on the faces of the three white people.
</P>
<P>
   Because, at the time, I thought the look was one of anger. I had
the queasy feeling that I was about to see a fight and a
three-on-one fight at that. To be sure, one of the white people was
a woman, but it was one mean looking
</P>
<P>
   woman.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on that look, I have the feeling now that it might
have been one of determination or maybe even hunger. The look on
the black man's face when he glanced at me as I passed was
unmistakable: Nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   I slowed my car after passing the white group and watched the
scene in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   As the white group passed the black man, an exchange was made _
item for item, I was too far away to tell what the items were, but
they were small. The exchange itself was done with an amazing
smoothness. The two people
</P>
<P>
   handing off the ``batons'' _ Mr. Red Beard and the black man _
did not once look at each other. Eyes straight ahead, they slipped
the items to one another and just kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I have it all wrong. It could be that these people were
exchanging business cards. Maybe they were giving each other a list
of their favorite authors and books. They could be members of a
literary club.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe in broad daylight I witnessed dope being bought and
sold on the mean streets of Marshall, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It does not surprise me that such a thing occurs, even during
the day and in public, but perhaps it surprises some.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer in the health field asked me the other day if people
here understood that Marshall had a drug problem. I told him I
thought so, but perhaps that was the wrong answer. He has an
occasion to see drug testing
</P>
<P>
   and said he sees up to 30 percent of the people with positive
results.
</P>
<P>
   But furthermore, I think there is an incredibly mistaken belief
that drug use is a problem of one particular race or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   It simply isn't so. Drug use may be the most fully integrated
activity in the United States. If what I saw was a drug deal,
somebody was the buyer and somebody was the user. Of course, it is
even possible that the buyers were also sellers, or that they also
do that.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way that we can expect the police to stop the kind
of thing that I saw last week. What could they do, stake out
Jefferson Street, stake out every street in Marshall?
</P>
<P>
   No, the drug problem is not just a matter for police, but for
all of us. We have to get involved in saying ``no'' in the first
place, then we have to get involved in reporting what we know is
going on.

   POST-COLDWAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ For 10 years, the U.S., Russia
and China have agreed that their most vital interests were
economic, and that global cooperation in the pursuit of prosperity
was their paramount goal. That, at least, was how Americans had
understood the new world. But in Russia and China, as events last
week showed, the picture was not quite so straightforward. Whatever
their interests in building new markets alongside the U.S., the
Kosovo crisis has revealed the blinders Americans wear as they
imagine how other countries perceive their own vital interests and
the degree to which former enemies have come to trust Americans. By
Erik Eckholm. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   AMY-FISHER-REVIEW (Undated) _ The once-and-future queen of our
tabloid domain was released from a prison last week. After a
seven-year hiatus, Amy Fisher is among us again, and it seems that
since we cannot escape her, we may have no recourse but to pursue,
analyze and perhaps even worship her. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ENLIST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Notable numbers of young
Americans enlisted to fight Iraq in the gulf war. So far they have
been sitting out the conflict in Yugoslavia. For a few years, the
gulf war stemmed a steady decline in enlistment, in a way that
ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia has so far failed to do. The dearth
of enlistees raises intriguing questions about attitudes toward
military service and modern warfare, and about the lessons of World
War II. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Many consumer advocates think
antitrust regulation has been futile. But even supporters of the
AT&AMP;T's cable takeovers can agree that existing antitrust standards
are not well suited to handle telecommunications mergers where
threats to diverse expression trump in importance threats of higher
prices, the ordinary province of antitrust enforcement. Regulatory
authorities are groping for answers. The AT&AMP;T-MediaOne case may
force them to find some before they are ready. By Michael M.
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-ARTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans are getting more and
more facts, not only in the traditional venue of newspapers and TV
but also in the arts _ `a kind of headlong rush toward more and
more reality,'' says Mark Rosenthal, curator of 20th-century art at
the Guggenheim Museum. The arts are not just imitating reality _
they are appropriating it. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-MOVIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the Colorado school
shootings and the ensuing debate over media violence, a movement
has been formed among parents and educators to persuade airlines
that young children should not be casually exposed to lurid movie
imagery of guns, bombs and mayhem. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   CIVILWAR-REENACT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Tips for Civil War
re-enactors. There is a large and growing body books, magazines,
Web sites treating the war and its landscape not only as hallowed
ground but also as fertile soil for levity, fantasy, fringe
scholarship, even romance.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-DESIGN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Auto historians and designers
wonder why today's models have a more masculine, brawny, tougher
look than the more delicate, feminine cars of earlier decades.
Perhaps it's because more women are buying cars. Maybe people feel
less safe, causing them to look to their cars for protection.
Whatever the cause, it is as if Detroit's metal has had a sex
change operation. By Robyn Meredith.

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ To avert another mishap such
as the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, the Pentagon has
announced corrective steps, including speedier updates from
government analysts to the military's so-called `no strike'' list.
But unlike the billions poured into building B-2 bombers or
launching spy satellites, the art of military mapmaking and
analyzing reconnaissance photos has been given short shrift in the
post-Cold War budget battles. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-U.S.-REVIEW (New York) _ There is a five-way contest
going on for prime minister of Israel, and it could end with the
ouster of Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet with the exception of religious
Jews in the U.S. who have long kept closer tabs on Jerusalem than
on Washington, there is surprisingly little interest among many
American Jews about what is taking place in Israel. By Adam

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not usually a
politician on the defensive, spent much of the final week leading
up to Israel's elections looking like a man scrambling to hold on
to votes.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual plea delivered in the closing days of the
campaign, he broadcast an appeal to voters who have deserted him to
``come back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he took to the radio waves to deny that a spirit of
defeatism hangs over his Likud Party. ``These are false reports
aimed at demoralizing Likud voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to Monday's elections in which Israel's prime
minister will be directly elected by the voters, political analysts
say Netanyahu's words and deeds reflect a mood of desperation in
his camp brought on by a slip in poll after poll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Netanyahu, who claims in public that the polls are wrong,
denies his main challenger, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
majority of the votes and forces him into a runoff June 1, he would
buy two additional weeks to turn his campaign around.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political analysts and pollsters suspect that
Netanyahu is leading a losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   He ``is a victim of his own success in putting down terror,''
says Efraim Inbar, an analyst at Tel Aviv's Bar Ilan University who
specializes in Israeli domestic politics. ``People take (their own
safety) for granted now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race that holds the fate of the stalled Arab-Israeli peace
process in the balance, Netanyahu has been trying to remind
Israelis of the acts of terror that followed the original peace
pact negotiated with the Palestinians in 1993 by the previous Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
   One of his campaign commercials, which was later withdrawn after
outcries from his opponents, showed grisly news footage of a bus
explosion by a Palestinian suicide bomber that occurred during the
term of Netanyahu's predecessor, Labor Party Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot compared the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement to the appeasement of the 1938 Munich accord _ an
agreement that many Israelis believe led to World War II and the
Holocaust, the systematic destruction of 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to evoke emotions,'' said Inbar, the Bar Ilan
University analyst. ``He was trailing in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the ``security'' strategy worked for Netanyahu:
Israelis weary of a string of bus bombings in the weeks before
elections ushered the right-wing Netanyahu into office, choosing
his promises of ``security'' over Peres' ``peace'' platform.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu took office, the peace process with Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority stalled, with his government pushing
ahead with new settlements in the West Bank and Arab-dominated east
Jerusalem and provoking public disapproval from the United States
and others.
</P>
<P>
   But if the polls are any indication this time around,
Netanyahu's appeal to Israelis' sense of security has not been as
effective. For weeks now, the polls have consistently given Barak
about 45 percent of the vote to Netanyahu's 38 percent in a
five-man race for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates _ former Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, ex-Likud Party stalwart Benny Begin and Arab politician
Azmi Bishara _ are fading or did not catch on, according to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the incumbent's defensive campaign, the
challenger's has gone on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu tries to scare you because he is going nowhere,''
Barak said in one campaign ad that was aired last week. ``We must
take Israel forward without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Barak's ads have concentrated on
people's growing frustrations over the freeze in the peace process,
a downturn in the economy and a cultural rift between religious and
secular Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Barka has gained a broad appeal, building a coalition called
``One Israel,'' which includes a moderate religious party, a party
of Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern background and the Labor
Party's traditional supporters, the Ashkenazi Jews of European
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, his popularity among new Russian immigrants has gone
up. And last week, two of the country's four Arab parties endorsed
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say credit for Barak's success should go to James
Carville, the U.S. political consultant who, along with three other
well-known American strategists, formed the brains behind Barak's
new image and muscular campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, political observers chided Barak for being too stiff
and something of a political blockhead who tended to stumble in
public. In a radio interview, for instance, he told listeners that
if he had been a Palestinian, he ``would have been a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   After hiring Carville and Co., Barak's image took on a shine. He
became an amicable, well-spoken and decorated military man flanked
at campaign events by army generals who approved of his strategy of
peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He became a champion of a new economic policy that he said would
pull Israel out of its slump and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he became a pragmatic centrist whose left-wing Labor
allies _ namely, Peres and Oslo accord architect Yossi Beilin, who
many Israelis in the political center associate with capitulation
in negotiations with Palestinians _ were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``He camouflaged Labor. He moved his headquarters out, changed
the name (of the party) to One Israel and added religious and
Sephardic parties'' said Shmuel Sandler, a political analyst at Bar
Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's hiding many of his best supporters, like Peres and
Beilin,`` Sandler said. ``The Israeli electorate is not to the
left. It is center-right, so by hiding them, he attracts supporters
of (Netanyahu) who would reject him if they saw Peres and Beilin at
the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler, though, cautions against giving too much credit to the
American strategists. Netanyahu also brought in Aurthur
Finkelstein, the Republican campaign adviser, to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any adviser who comes from the outside doesn't understand what
makes a country tick,'' Sandler said. ``They can advise him how to
put the message forward, but they can't tell him what the message
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Netanyahu's lag in the polls reflects not so much
Barak's success at attracting new votes as Netanyahu's failure to
keep the ones he had. Netanyahu, they say, created many political
enemies during his three years in office. Both Mordechai's and
Begin's candidacies split the right wing and take votes away from
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Barak leading. It's Netanyahu trailing,'' said Inbar,
who explained: ``Basically, he doesn't have a very good record.
He's made a lot of political mistakes. His allies left him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu made a bold pitch
for support from traditional Likud voters who had abandoned him.
One television spot showed a young Likud voter talking about his
decision to dump Netanyahu for Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I would be voting for the Left,'' the voter says,
``so I went back to Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy still might work. In 1996, Netanyahu stayed behind
Peres in the polls right up to Election Day, and then beat the
Labor leader by just 30,000 votes _ a fact Netanyahu keeps
reminding voters today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always lose in the polls and win the election,'' Netanyahu
said with characteristic confidence last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts cautioned against writing Netanyahu off.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis don't always tell the truth to pollsters. Almost 10
percent of the electorate is still undecided. And the race has
shaped up to be hair-splittingly close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't count Netanyahu out,'' said Inbar. ``The surprising
thing is he still has a chance.``
</P>

for Sunday, May 16, will move Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POST-COLDWAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ For 10 years, the U.S., Russia
and China have agreed that their most vital interests were
economic, and that global cooperation in the pursuit of prosperity
was their paramount goal. That, at least, was how Americans had
understood the new world. But in Russia and China, as events last
week showed, the picture was not quite so straightforward. Whatever
their interests in building new markets alongside the U.S., the
Kosovo crisis has revealed the blinders Americans wear as they
imagine how other countries perceive their own vital interests and
the degree to which former enemies have come to trust Americans. By
Erik Eckholm. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   AMY-FISHER-REVIEW (Undated) _ The once-and-future queen of our
tabloid domain was released from a prison last week. After a
seven-year hiatus, Amy Fisher is among us again, and it seems that
since we cannot escape her, we may have no recourse but to pursue,
analyze and perhaps even worship her. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ENLIST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Notable numbers of young
Americans enlisted to fight Iraq in the gulf war. So far they have
been sitting out the conflict in Yugoslavia. For a few years, the
gulf war stemmed a steady decline in enlistment, in a way that
ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia has so far failed to do. The dearth
of enlistees raises intriguing questions about attitudes toward
military service and modern warfare, and about the lessons of World
War II. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Many consumer advocates think
antitrust regulation has been futile. But even supporters of the
AT&AMP;T's cable takeovers can agree that existing antitrust standards
are not well suited to handle telecommunications mergers where
threats to diverse expression trump in importance threats of higher
prices, the ordinary province of antitrust enforcement. Regulatory
authorities are groping for answers. The AT&AMP;T-MediaOne case may
force them to find some before they are ready. By Michael M.
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-ARTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans are getting more and
more facts, not only in the traditional venue of newspapers and TV
but also in the arts _ `a kind of headlong rush toward more and
more reality,'' says Mark Rosenthal, curator of 20th-century art at
the Guggenheim Museum. The arts are not just imitating reality _
they are appropriating it. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-MOVIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the Colorado school
shootings and the ensuing debate over media violence, a movement
has been formed among parents and educators to persuade airlines
that young children should not be casually exposed to lurid movie
imagery of guns, bombs and mayhem. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   CIVILWAR-REENACT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Tips for Civil War
re-enactors. There is a large and growing body books, magazines,
Web sites treating the war and its landscape not only as hallowed
ground but also as fertile soil for levity, fantasy, fringe
scholarship, even romance.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-DESIGN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Auto historians and designers
wonder why today's models have a more masculine, brawny, tougher
look than the more delicate, feminine cars of earlier decades.
Perhaps it's because more women are buying cars. Maybe people feel
less safe, causing them to look to their cars for protection.
Whatever the cause, it is as if Detroit's metal has had a sex
change operation. By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ To avert another mishap such
as the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, the Pentagon has
announced corrective steps, including speedier updates from
government analysts to the military's so-called `no strike'' list.
But unlike the billions poured into building B-2 bombers or
launching spy satellites, the art of military mapmaking and
analyzing reconnaissance photos has been given short shrift in the
post-Cold War budget battles. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-U.S.-REVIEW (New York) _ There is a five-way contest
going on for prime minister of Israel, and it could end with the
ouster of Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet with the exception of religious
Jews in the U.S. who have long kept closer tabs on Jerusalem than
on Washington, there is surprisingly little interest among many
American Jews about what is taking place in Israel. By Adam
Nagourney.

SURVEY SHOWS PUBLIC VIEWS STATE COURTS AS `JUST OK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State courts received middling grades in a
nationwide public opinion survey released Friday, with the majority
of respondents giving judges and court systems high marks for
fairness while expressing qualms about delays and the cost of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,826 respondents yielded widespread concern that
courts fail to treat diverse racial and economic groups equally.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of respondents said the wealthy get better
treatment than most while 47 percent said African-Americans and
Hispanics are treated worse.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 49 percent of non-Hispanic whites believe juries are
representative of their communities while only 29 percent of
African-Americans and 33 percent of Hispanics agree.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent said the courts generally favor corporations
when they are sued by individuals. And 81 percent said judges'
decisions in some degree are influenced by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was sponsored by The Hearst Corporation and the
findings were presented by Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and
chief executive officer, at the National Conference on Public Trust
and Confidence in the Judicial System.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``an overwhelming belief that equal justice under the
law is more equal to some than to others,'' Bennack told the
gathering of 460 judges, court administrators, bar officials, and
members of the League of Women Voters. Overall, ``when all the
(survey's) figures were totaled and all the comments considered,
the courts came out just OK on average,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association, the Conference of Chief Justices,
the Conference of State Court Administrators and the League of
Women Voters sponsored the conference, described as the first-ever
examination of the degree of public trust of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said the public wasn't likely to invest political
institutions or the communications media with high degrees of
trust. But trust in courts is essential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, society and institution come together in ways that
really define who we would like to think we are as a society _
fair, open and protective of the rights of every individual,'' he
said. ``Politicians can advocate it, the media can comment on it _
but only the courts actually make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennack noted that Hearst sponsored a public opinion survey in
1983 that was designed to assess public attitudes toward courts.
That survey found a similar pattern of strengths, weaknesses and
inconsistencies _ and what Bennack termed ``a worrisome disconnect
between the courts and the people they are sworn to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 survey was overseen by the National Center for State
Courts, based in Williamsburg, Va. Interviews were conducted in
January and February by the Indiana University Public Opinion
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers questioned 1,200 respondents at random, as well as
300 African-Americans and 300 Hispanics to insure the views of
minorities were represented. The final sample from which results
were drawn was weighted according to national population statistics
for non-Hipsanic whites (72.1 percent), Hispanics (13.4 percent)
and African-Americans (12.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, judges won praise in the survey. A total of 61
percent said judges do not give cases adequate time and attention,
but 79 percent said they are generally honest and fair. Among
Hispanics, 75 percent agreed; 68 percent for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 85 percent said the courts protect defendants'
rights. Seventy-four percent of African-Americans and 82 percent of
Hispanics agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But all respondents expressed concern over the slow pace of
justice. Eighty percent said cases are not resolved in a timely
manner and only 49 percent said courts don't do a good job of
monitoring the progress of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack noted one respondent who commented: ``I think they're
just so overworked and backlogged that they can't get anything
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of litigation was cited as another cause for
concern. Sixty-eight percent said the cost of bringing a case to
court is not affordable, with 87 percent saying lawyers' fees
contribute ``a lot'' to the high cost of litigation. By contrast,
41.5 percent blamed court fees and 51 percent cited the complexity
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents did not have a high opinion of media coverage of the
courts. Fifty-three percent expressed some degree of skepticism
over the accuracy of news reporting of court cases. And only 10
percent expressed a ``great deal'' of confidence in the media
overall as an American institutions.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 23 percent expressed a similarly high level of
confidence in courts while 43 percent gave high marks to the local
police and 45 percent gave them to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Discontent with courts is an inevitable byproduct of its
adversarial format, Chief Justice William Rehnquist told the
audience. ``In the prototypical lawsuit, one party will win and one
party will lose,'' Rehnquist said. ``Many of the losers will
understandably be disappointed and some may feel they got a raw
deal from the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much the courts can do to change this perception,
but forcing judges to reconsider decisions simply because they are
unpopular would undermine the nation's tradition of an independent
judiciary, Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recall of judicial decisions by some sort of a popular mandate
... is too high a price to pay for public approval,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Panels of lawyers and judges later told the conference that the
public's view of courts might improve if judges became more
involved in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the basic reasons we have a lack of public trust and
confidence...is because judges have isolated themselves from the
community,'' said Veronica McBeth, presiding judge of the Los
Angeles municipal court.
</P>
<P>
   McBeth said she has spoken to several community groups and
attended several meetings in and around Los Angeles in an effort to
educate the public about the court system.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, McBeth said, is that many judges are reluctant to
make public speeches because they are concerned the public won't
view them as able to make impartial decisions in the court room.
</P>
<P>
   Other panelists said judges need to make themselves more
accessible to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   W. Seaborn Jones, an Atlanta lawyer and president-elect of the
National Conference of Bar Presidents, said a 10-minute phone call
between lawyers and a judge can save reams of paperwork and time,
helping to more speedily move cases through the court system.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees early Friday at Winnemucca,
Nev., setting a new record minimum for the date. The reading was
symptomatic of the cool air mass covering much of the West this
week. With the cool air mass holding steady Saturday, snow will
fall at elevations as low as 5,000 feet in the mountains of Montana
and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, very warm and humid air will expand northward from
the southern Plains, with afternoon temperatures possibly exceeding
85 degrees as far north as Nebraska. Humidity will also soar as
tropical air streams northward from the Gulf of Mexico. As a
result, the stage will be set for winter in the Rockies to clash
with summer in the Plains, a volatile meeting that will likely
result in severe thunderstorms over the Midwest later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With warm, humid air acting as volatile fuel and a cold
upper-level disturbance acting as a match, explosive thunderstorms
will erupt Saturday across Nebraska and northern Kansas. Large hail
and damaging straight-line winds will lash some areas. Tornadoes
are also possible, particularly near the warm front in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, widely separated potent thunderstorms will erupt
from western Kansas to western Texas along a line marking the
boundary between tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry air
from the southern Rockies and northern Old Mexico. Some storms may
reach severe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will develop in parts of
the Middle Atlantic States in the vicinity of a stalled low off the
Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Atypical Snowfall
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, two-tenths of an inch of snow fell at Spokane,
Wash., as a cold and moist flow of air from the northwest blew
across the Pacific Northwest. The tiny accumulation of snow was
large enough, however, to set a daily snowfall record in the
eastern Washington city. But more impressive than the amount of
snow has been the recent frequency of snowfall in Spokane. Since
climate records began in 1881, only nine May days have registered
measurable snow, three of which have occurred during this current
May. The latest date of measurable snow in Spokane is May 14.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Tuesday's guide at Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art was a lively lady with a short gray
flip, a pony-print purse and black-framed glasses, which she
regularly removed to emphasize pronouncements like, ``I've always
been enamored of Cinderella and rags and shredding!''
</P>
<P>
   Polly Mellen, a fixture in fashion journalism for some 40 years,
a woman known for her forceful opinions and eccentric personality,
was, at the behest of the institute, giving a one-shot tour as an
outside expert with inside information. Ms. Mellen, who brightened
``Unzipped,'' the 1995 documentary about Isaac Mizrahi, with
operatic exclamations on the order of ``This outfit says hello to
me very distinctly!'' promised not to be a tour guide who would
lull her listeners to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   At seventysomething, Ms. Mellen is branching out. For the past
seven years she has been the creative director of Allure magazine,
but Ms. Mellen will leave at the end of August to free-lance, write
a book and presumably have time for new larks like this one. As she
put it: ``I'm very interested in spreading my wings. I want to go
out on my own and see what I get from it. I'm not a negative
thinker!''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement; the woman could look at a pile of
provocatively placed dishrags and shriek ``Divine!''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't dismayed that no one was there for her unheralded
tour at first. At 11:45 in the morning, the institute's director,
Richard Martin, stood with Ms. Mellen at a meeting area on the
museum's main floor and announced ``This is the 11:45 tour'' to no
one in particular. Only the crew for ``Polly Mellen's World Tour,''
a documentary being made about her by Douglas Keeve, the director
of ``Unzipped,'' was there. Undaunted, Ms. Mellen marched
downstairs to the first window of ``Our New Clothes: Acquisitions
of the 1990s,'' an exhibit of clothing ranging from Victorian
summer laces to Hollywood dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a rare bird,'' Keeve said. ``There's no one who gets
that excited about fashion every time.'' As Ms. Mellen said in an
earlier interview: ``I'm a realist, but I'm considered in a fantasy
world because I'm enthusiastic. Enthusiastic people can throw
people off. But along with that energy, I promise you there's a
certain knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour was not for no one, as it turned out. As Ms. Mellen
held forth, speaking in her signature manner, in which every other
word sounds italicized, a growing group _ mostly women, tourists,
fashionistas and the simply curious _ began to follow her around
the Costume Institute's show as if she were some Pied Piper of
Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mellen, who apprenticed with the legendary fashion editor
Diana Vreeland at Harper's Bazaar in the '50s, talked
extemporaneously for the whole hour, commenting on outfits as they
caught her eye in a selective, semichronological manner. Her
commentary provided a rare mix of history, observation, gossip and
riff, although she spoke more to the glassed-in displays and the
camera crew than to the tour group itself. Gesturing toward a
window filled with flowing white gowns and robes from the 18th
century, she declared: ``White has to do with pristine, silence, a
certain modesty. And yet you feel that inside these women is a
hothouse!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were these clothes uncomfortable?'' Keeve asked. Ms. Mellen
explained that the women who wore them knew how to co-exist with
corsets.
</P>
<P>
   But her remarks seemed a little halfhearted; she was clearly
more comfortable with contemporary designers, the ones she has
known personally and cheered from the front row for years.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour moved to a display case filled with dazzling outfits
from the mod '60s to the present, Ms. Mellen went into such
absolute rapture at least one listener didn't know whether to hug
her or douse her with water.
</P>
<P>
   She gushed over a Todd Oldham beaded halter top. ``There's a
feeling of Cleopatra, a feeling of the American Indian, and he puts
her in pinstriped pants that belong to a man!'' She paused,
meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an elaborate Rei Kawakubo dress, Ms. Mellen beamed.
``She dares, she stretches, she cares,'' she said. ``Oh, my. I have
been moved to tears when I look at Rei's collections.''
</P>
<P>
   Of a Charles James design she said: ``His clothes are timeless.
I couldn't afford them, so I used to have them copied.''
</P>
<P>
   And she pointed with her glasses to a pale pink wool Pierre
Cardin coat from 1965 and said: ``It took real adjustment to
understand his clothes at first for me, but once you got it, it was
a springboard to Courreges and Gernreich!''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Doonan, the creative director for Barneys New York, which
sponsored the show, interjected, ``Cardin was what you were going
to wear if you went to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mellen kept charging ahead, hardly noticing that when she
said, ``Mme. Gres designed a great deal in jersey,'' a few of the
touristy types seemed to think she meant Passaic. Her enthusiasm
clearly rendered her unfazed, and you could practically hear her
gasp in between analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like plaid?'' one of Keeve's companions blurted out in
a real-life ``Absolutely Fabulous'' moment. ``I love plaid!'' Ms.
Mellen said. She alerted everyone to a beaded James Galanos
ensemble that looked positively Nancy Reagan. The designer, she
said, always knew who his clients' friends were ``so you wouldn't
show up in the same dress.'' More excitedly, she spotted an Issey
Miyake dress, a multicolored number with accordion shapes, and
said: ``When I squint, I see a Japanese lantern or Punch and Judy.
If you wear that, you have to really feel for that.''
</P>
<P>
   She clearly felt for it. But suddenly she looked a little lost
in thought, staring at the mannequins' faces instead of their
outfits. ``We're starting to see much less makeup,'' she declared.
``Blue eye shadow _ finished! Women today are more confident in
constructing their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple of tour members who were wearing blue eye shadow
quietly lowered their heads.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As if to make sure she didn't lose the crowd, Ms. Mellen
immediately segued to the flowing black Versace dress Madonna wore
to a charity ball last year. At the word ``Madonna,'' their ears
perked up. ``I'll never forget Madonna in this dress,'' Ms. Mellen
said, letting the clothes act as memory springboards.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of a Claire McCardell design reminded her of the time
in the 1940s _ on the beach at Fishers Island _ when Miss McCardell
pulled off her dress to demonstrate a new bathing suit right in
front of her: ``She was in a diaper _ a diaper! Shocking, but she
didn't care!''
</P>
<P>
   Two preteen girls tittered, than darted away. They missed the
even racier spectacle of Ms. Mellen pointing out a 1996 Gaultier
jacket with a naked male frame silk-screened on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body is raised a bit,'' she said, ``and I think that's
because Mr. Gaultier wants you to see the penis.'' Everyone
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   She could probably have gone on all day, but time was up. Ms.
Mellen thanked the crowd, then quickly disappeared into a private
room. Doonan was left to fend off two women. ``Who was she?'' one
of them asked. ``Did you say she was Molly or Polly Mellen?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained, and one of them, casually dressed with
close-cropped hair, balked, ``I've been on many tours,'' she said,
``and this is the first one that wasn't addressed to us. She talked
only to the press. I resent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's always the movie.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I can't really believe I'm here,'' said Richard
Mason, a novelist and Oxford University student, as he toured the
book party thrown for him at the offices of The New Yorker magazine
last Monday night. ``I keep expecting that at some point I'm going
to wake up and be a 12-year-old back at boarding school.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 21 and not that far removed from a daydreaming Eton
schoolboy, has landed inside New York's velvet ropes. His debut
novel, ``The Drowning People,'' written when he was 18, has just
been published with all the promotional muscle of Warner Books,
which acquired the novel in a two-book deal for more than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, born in South Africa, wrote the novel of murder and
revenge among the English upper class just after graduating from
Eton. It hit the best-seller list of The Times of London in its
first week of release last month, and foreign rights have gone to
21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Though his Hugh Grant-meets-Rupert Everett look, extreme youth
and overnight success may have some book reviewers sharpening their
knives, at his party Mason stepped into the role of lit-world
it-boy with casual ease.
</P>
<P>
   In a white V-neck T-shirt and black velvet suit, hand-tailored
for him by a London clothier, Favourbrook, Mason sauntered through
the cocktail party unrattled by the CNN camera crew that has been
documenting his American tour.
</P>
<P>
   He was chaperoned by Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chairman of Time
Warner Trade Publishing, who whisked his author around the room
like a proud father.
</P>
<P>
   Mason is being lavished with a red-carpet treatment reserved for
celebrity authors. But these are strange times in the book business
as publishers prize authors with youth and photogenic appeal who
can look as natural in Publisher's Weekly as in a glossy fashion
magazine (Mason appeared lounging in the April issue of Vogue).
</P>
<P>
   One editor confided that Mason's precocious, if sometimes naive,
charm opens doors for him. She cited the time he came to a sales
luncheon and breezily ordered a gin and tonic though he was under
age and no one else was drinking. ``Everyone fell in love with
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 p.m., the party had migrated to the White Horse Tavern in
Greenwich Village. In the taxi ride, Mason showed his
self-deprecating side, describing how his outsider status at Eton
inspired him to write his novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a barbarian colonial, I was very taken by all the
traditions and history,'' he said. ``It's no accident that
foreigners enjoy writing about the closed, rarefied world of the
English upper class.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seated at a sidewalk table at the White Horse, he
found himself at the center of a circle of English transplants to
New York, like Clementine Hambro, an acting student who is Sir
Winston Churchill's great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mason regaled them with his impression of a flat California
accent, acquired at the Sky Bar in Los Angeles. He made knowing
references to the New York scene, to Lot 61, where his troupe had
been a few nights earlier, and to the Hamptons, where he would be
having his farewell party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I'm being terribly rude to the rest of my party,''
he said, then returned inside to where Kirshbaum was on his
cellular phone, telling his daughter to hurry over and join the
party.

`BEHIND THE MUSIC': A LOOK AT TOM PETTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL DEYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The story of Tom Petty's exodus from Florida
into the belly of the music business beast has been recited over
and over again. Sunday's edition of VH1's rock documentary ``Behind
the Music'' attempts, with mixed results, to tell the tale
definitively.
</P>
<P>
   Petty formed the original Heartbreakers in Los Angeles in 1975,
more than a year after all five of the musicians had left
Gainesville, which was the hometown of Petty and keyboardist
Benmont Tench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to tell anybody what you've been through, and
what your eyes have seen,'' Petty, 48, tells VH1. Referring to the
Heartbreakers he says, ``but they were there, and they went through
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, Tench and guitarist Mike Campbell are extensively
interviewed, along with bassist Ron Blair, who left the band in
1982, and drummer Stan Lynch, who departed in 1994. The producers
also talk to Howie Epstein, Blair's replacement and still a member
of the group, Petty's manager, and various musical collaborators
and record producers.
</P>
<P>
   In Gainesville, the interview subjects include Petty's father
and his cousin, Sadie Darnell, who is commander of operations at
the Gainesville Police Department. ``He was a long-haired person in
a short-haired world,'' Darnell says.
</P>
<P>
   Petty's rebellion against all kinds of conformity forms the
backbone of this 60-minute program. The familiar stories are
trotted out: His refusal to work until a record company gave the
band a better deal, bankruptcy, legal wranglings, the studio
frustration that led to his smashing his left hand against a wall.
``Pulverized it,'' Petty says. ``Broke it to powder.'' A lengthy
segment documents the 1987 fire that destroyed his Encino, Calif.
home.
</P>
<P>
   Old photos and home movies race by: There's the Mudcrutch farm
in Gainesville, where the musicians played for thousands of friends
and fans; there's Gainesville High School, from which Petty
graduated in 1968. The musicians are shown with long hair and short
hair, with beards and without, with girlfriends, wives and
ex-wives. Clips from television shows _ particularly from the '70s,
when the band was young and still hungry _ are riveting.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 25 years, however, there's no hunger left in Tom
Petty or the remains of his band. His music today is the polished
work of a craftsman, but it hasn't been sharp-edged, or
particularly challenging, for a long time. The first 45 minutes of
VH1's documentary seem designed as a lead-in to the last quarter,
which is nothing more than a celebratory plug for Petty's new
album.
</P>
<P>
   This series' style: quick-cut editing, music bites and
choppily-edited quotes never longer than 10 or 12 seconds, grows
irritating after a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music: Tom Petty &AMP; the Heartbreakers'' is woefully
short on personal insight _ there's no mention of Petty's recent
divorce, which doubtless had a great impact on his writing _ and
the viewer never gets a sense of the Heartbreakers as friends, or
as individuals. If the producers intended to achieve anything more
than a quick gloss of ancient history, they blew it.

HOPEFULS FROM 32 PARTIES ADD SPICE TO VOTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 16) 
 
DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ This year, Israelis who think peace in the Middle
East can be achieved through transcendental meditation have a shot
at sending a representative to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   So do those who want to protect the rights of battered husbands,
light up a marijuana cigarette in the open, protect the environment
or play blackjack for money without breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   And if none of those sounds appealing, most voters need not
worry about finding their political niches: No fewer than 32
separate parties have signed up to run in Monday's elections, when
voters will choose 120 members to the Knesset as well as a prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   While most of them are not expected to get the approximately
45,000 votes needed to win a parliamentary seat, their inclusion in
this year's election has added spice to campaigns that in past
elections have centered mostly on issues of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been one-issue parties in Israel. But a new
electoral law that gives each voter two ballots _ one for prime
minister and one for a party _ has prompted them to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one ballot, they can vote with their brains,'' said
Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
``With the other, they can vote with their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   And so there are parties for the environment, for senior
citizens, for feminists and for men. One party promises to promote
development of the Negev Desert. Another wants to commemorate
Romanian-Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   The Casino Party hopes to legalize gambling, while the Green
Leaf Party wants to decriminalize marijuana. And for those into
unconventional ways to bring about world peace, there is the
Natural Law Party. They believe that if the square root of one
percent of the population of the Middle East _ approximately 1,500
people, by their reckoning _ practices yogic flying twice a day,
they will usher in regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Surprisingly, most Israelis aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli voters are experts in this,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a
political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``We never had
a choice between two parties only.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say most voters will stick to the parties _ all 11 of
them _ that already hold seats in parliament. But of the newcomers,
polls suggest Pnina Rosenblum's feminist party and Tommy Lapid's
anti-religious party stand a decent chance at capturing a seat.
</P>
<P>
   So does one of the new parties appealing to new Russian
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   And the others?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them only have a few thousand people behind them,''
Hazan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically? They don't stand a chance.''
</P>

THE PRINCETON IVY CLUB, WHERE TOMORROW'S ELITE MEETS TO EAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Should the members of the Ivy Club ever face the withering
scrutiny of a Fifth Avenue co-op board or a Fairfield County
country club, they will be well prepared.
</P>
<P>
   To get into Ivy, the oldest, most expensive and most patrician
eating club at Princeton University, candidates must sit for 10
one-on-one interviews with members, whose attempts to plumb their
souls touch on what their parents do, where they spend summers and
who their friends are.
</P>
<P>
   Then the entire century-old club votes on prospects in all-night
sessions. Like an English men's club, there is a blackball rule: if
one of 130 members vetoes a candidate, he or she is rejected _
``hosed'' in the tart campus vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, more and more students are being hosed who don't fit
Ivy's image as a haven for Eastern establishment, Social Register
types, what one former member called ``a club full of sons and
daughters of CEO's.''
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, where more than 80 percent of juniors and seniors
eat meals in one of 11 privately owned clubs on Prospect Avenue,
known as ``the Street,'' the eating clubs dominate social life.
They determine not only the students' dinner partners but also whom
they socialize with on Thursday and Saturday party nights.
Membership can shape a person's social identity for life.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, in the wake of a widely reported 1990 court
decision that forced Princeton's eating clubs to admit women, Ivy
became more democratic and socially open. Not only women, but
students of different races and more diverse social backgrounds
were welcomed during ``bicker,'' the yearly selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember meetings, open discussions about changing the
perception of the club,'' said Sophie Glenn of Princeton's class of
1992, who was one of the first women admitted to Ivy. ``It was
brought up that it would be in the club's interest to be more
diverse, especially in the backgrounds of people, because it was
always perceived as a snotty place for rich white kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a conscious effort to diversify,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But now the pendulum is swinging back, in part a reflection of
increasingly status-conscious, money-conscious times. The race for
credentials and connections like an Ivy membership begins, at least
in places like New York and Los Angeles, with selective nursery
schools, and is egged on by a culture that makes popular heroes out
of Wall Street bonus babies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ivy has fewer members from minority groups and public
schools than in the early '90s, present and past members say. Atu
Darko, a senior who dropped out of Ivy in February, was one of four
of seven black members who left the eating club in the last
academic year, citing their discomfort. ``When I first got there,
it was more international, but over the years it became very
WASP,'' said Darko, who is the son of Ghanaian immigrants and
graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. ``It had to do
with the membership's choosing new members. I think less
international kids bickered, or less minorities bickered because
they felt uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ivy swings back to what F. Scott Fitzgerald called a
``detached and breathlessly aristocratic'' club, present and former
Princeton students and faculty members are not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way the Ivy Club is certainly in tune with current
trends, if not even ahead of the curve,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt,
the James Madison professor of political economy at Princeton. ``If
you look at American society, in certainly the world Fitzgerald
wrote about, we are divided by class. We are sliding back toward a
society dominated by a corporate society. I think in our corporate
elite, there is a Marie Antoinette complex, and that percolates
down to Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy Club, where membership costs $5,660 a year, is a
three-story brick mansion set behind iron gates. The dining room,
billiard room and library are a procession of red leather club
chairs, mahogany walls and oil paintings of Fitzgerald-era
``lacrosse gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Members eat at long tables covered with white linens and set
with 19th-century Sheffield sterling candelabra, which are lighted
even when daylight streams in the windows.
</P>
<P>
   The formality can unnerve some not to the manner born. Heyman
said that though he is a product of private schools and
professional parents (a lawyer and a doctor), he would have been
mortified a year ago at dropping his knife, as he did at dinner the
other night. He studied the faces around him to see if anyone had
noticed. Luckily, no one had. ``That would have made me more
nervous a year ago,'' he said, quickly retrieving the knife. ``But
I'm much better now.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nat Zilkha, who grew up in Portland, Me., and went to
boarding school at Andover, was accepted by Ivy, his older sister
had one piece of advice: ``Get a tux.'' The club sponsors nearly a
dozen black-tie parties a year, including one during February's
initiation week for new members (which also includes the tradition
of passing newcomers naked down a staircase, modified in the 90s to
allow women to keep their underwear on).
</P>
<P>
   A woman who dropped out of Ivy last winter, because she felt she
was not from a grand enough background, said the club is full of
``people who don't have any concept of money.'' Raised in Atlanta,
she felt uneasy being served four-course dinners by a uniformed
staff. ``If you're not flying off to London on spring weekends,
you'll end up feeling left out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy's current membership of 130 includes Mary Bonner Baker, a
daughter of James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state;
Moira Forbes, a daughter of Steve Forbes, the one-time presidential
candidate, and Mary Firestone, a descendant of the founder of the
tire company.
</P>
<P>
   James Q. Griffin, a 1955 Princeton graduate and president of the
alumni board that governs Ivy, said that in membership, ``I can't
see any difference between the way it is now and 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a Jeffersonian democracy, taking the natural
aristocracy, as you were. There's no social pyramid.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that interest in joining the club was at an
all-time high, and ``by that very definition, there is something
that seems attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest bicker, 130 sophomores and juniors applied to Ivy,
and 67 were accepted. All along the Street, the five clubs that
select their members attracted the most sophomore applicants since
1994, and the six eating clubs that accept anyone wishing to join
attracted the fewest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the bicker clubs frustrates some Princeton
administrators, who have never been entirely happy with the system.
``I think there are problems with selectivity of any kind on the
college campus, because selectivity excludes people,'' said Janina
Montero, dean of student life.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration and the clubs, whose relations have swung
between hostility and accommodation over the years, are in a period
of relative truce in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged alumni in New York say that for the first time
friends are seeking their help in getting children who are in
private secondary schools into Ivy. ``It's absurd,'' said one
alumnus who was asked to provide references. ``Why don't they worry
about getting their kid into Princeton first?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not want to be identified because he thought it might
spoil the chances for his own son, 16, to get into Ivy one day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Princeton students are more racially and
ethnically diverse than in the past, and as a dress code, the L.L.
Bean styles of a generation ago have been replaced by T-shirts and
baseball caps, a generic geek chic. Ivy, however, is a last bastion
of traditional dress and etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a movie about Princeton _ proper, WASP, preppy,
they dress nice and they are smart and tell you how smart they are
_ that's Ivy,'' said Joe Juliano, a senior, who worked as a bouncer
during Ivy parties, but is not a member. ``Princeton doesn't look
like that anymore, but Ivy does.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question of members' ethnic and economic backgrounds
is more complex. The membership seems calculated to be a mix of
old-line families, new-money heirs and even a group on financial
aid. ``Of course, there's still diversity,'' one Ivy alumnus said.
``About 20 percent. They are there to make the other 80 percent
show they are democratic and feel more superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivy members invariably maintain that the club is diverse. ``We
pick people who are diverse,'' said Zilkha, the social chairman. He
spoke of members who perform in an a capella singing group, play
the guitar and are active in the arts and drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' responded Darko, one of the four black students who
resigned from Ivy this year. He said the club interprets diversity
to mean members with broad interests, rather than with broad ethnic
and economic backgrounds. ``Diversity to me means seeing different
faces, people with different income brackets and different clothing
styles,'' Darko said.
</P>
<P>
   Darko, a senior classics major who won a Fulbright fellowship
for study abroad after graduation, said that he did not feel racial
bias at Ivy; he simply grew tired of the homogeneity and
closed-mindedness. ``I couldn't identify with the people in the
club,'' he said. ``Everything was the same old same old. Same old
music. Same bad beer. The club is not open to change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivy would never play Motown,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Manhattan by parents from Ghana _ his mother is a
psychotherapist, his father a probation officer _ Darko said that
when Ivy does select blacks, they tend to be from immigrant or
foreign families. ``Being black to the club means being an
international black,'' he said. ``They aren't African-American from
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment about the high number of black dropouts,
Griffin, the graduate board president, said: ``There are plenty of
blacks that do feel comfortable. It's just an individual decision.
The very fact that the people who dropped out were taken in the
first place means what they are implying is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the profile of each new class of Ivy members is
determined by the undergraduates in the club. Current officers did
not respond to repeated requests to comment on their criteria for
admission. ``There is no pattern except the quality of the people
is very high,'' Griffin said. ``The undergraduates have a geometry.
Just because they are young doesn't mean the sociology is any less
complex.''

SIGNS OF RUSSIAN ECONOMIC RECOVERY ARE REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Against the backdrop of Russia's political turmoil, the
economy seems to be gradually reviving from its collapse last
summer, with increased consumer spending and industrial production,
a Moscow research group said Friday in a widely followed monthly
report.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer expenditures rose 1.5 percent in March from February,
the second consecutive month of growth, according to the report,
Russian Economic Trends. Industrial production returned to its
level in December 1997, the highest since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But a government economist and the report's authors at the
Russian European Center for Economic Policy warned that such growth
might be short-lived if a new Cabinet was not installed soon and if
it failed to carry out important systemic changes to encourage
long-term economic development. ``It's very important to have a
Cabinet in place quickly,'' said Peter Westin, an economist with
the Russian European Center, ``because any long, drawn-out process
has a negative effect on the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in production and spending is the unlikely
side-benefit of the government's decision last August to devalue
the ruble, which has fallen from about 15 cents to the dollar to
approximately 4 cents. As a result, imports that were bought for
dollars and other hard currency became too expensive for most
Russians. Over the last few months, as the flow of imports to
Russia has shrunk, domestic producers have made more to meet
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen is that not so much investment as demand was
needed to get the economy to grow,'' said Vladimir Mau, head of the
Russian government's Center for Economic Reforms, an analytical
agency. He said the data showed that higher consumer demand had
helped to invigorate the economy, at least in the short term. ``But
investment is needed over the long term. This kind of growth can be
exhausted quickly. It's not stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The economists maintain that sustainable growth does not hinge
on one-time events such as a currency devaluation but on the
creation of conditions that allow businesses to thrive and the
government to function efficiently, so-called structural changes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia for years has worked on the edges of such changes without
mustering the political will or momentum to fully proceed with
them, partly because they are sure to alienate various interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Structural changes include a new tax code, an effective
bankruptcy procedure, pension reform and banking reform after the
collapse of the banking system last summer.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin said he had dismissed Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov because his government refused to push ahead with
such reforms. But any new government may face the same temptation,
especially because parliamentary and presidential elections are
scheduled over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that political stability will be bought with
economic instability and giving in to demands of this lobby or
another,'' Mau said.

GOP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE THE WAR, BUT NOT THE SPENDING ON IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of House Republicans want to stop the war in
Yugoslavia, but they evidently don't want to stop the war spending.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same conservatives who shocked the White House by
voting to halt the ongoing air campaign and withdraw troops from
the region rallied behind the emergency appropriations measure
providing $11.7 billion for defense _ twice what the president
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this seeming contradiction? The lawmakers argued
the Clinton White House will fund the conflict regardless of their
opposition to it. They say they want to make certain the Pentagon
bank account is not depleted to the point where the military's
overall capability is sacrificed to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is going to be spent,'' said Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla. ``The question is whether it is going to come out of the
hide of the Defense Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., noted the emergency spending measure
contained more than $1 billion for spare military parts, $1.8
billion for military pay hikes and millions more for recruiting and
readiness training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for us to rebuild the strength and dignity of our
military,'' declared DeMint.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and other critics, however, said the disconnect
between the GOP positions against the conflict and for the funding
shows that Republicans are taking advantage of the conflict to
shower money on the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans were on board. Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,
said he couldn't support the military spending bill when he doesn't
approve of the administration's policy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vote against the defense bill was difficult, but he
wanted to encourage a swift resolution to the crisis. ``The quicker
we get out, the better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE SHOOTOUT
</P>
<P>
   The changing culture on gun control in the wake of the Columbine
shootings is becoming evident. The Senate's Southern Democrats, who
tend to be more cautious than other Democrats on the issue due to
the popularity of hunting and shooting in the region, nonetheless
gave their full support to the latest efforts at gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, John
Edwards of North Carolina, Bob Graham of Florida and Fritz Hollings
of South Carolina all supported expanding background checks at gun
shows to include sales by unlicensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposal initially failed due to GOP opposition.
Republicans Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and
Connie Mack of Florida all fought it.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a misstep, the GOP retreated and pushed through its own
approach to tightening restrictions on gun show sales. But
Democrats said the proposal left loopholes and they vowed to hold
Republicans accountable for the initial vote.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Hollings took to the Senate floor to denounce
the ``stonewalling and influence'' of the NRA, saying the gun
industry had lobbied to defeat a measure that could have helped
keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   JURIS IMPRUDENCE?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., is a liberal member of the House
Judiciary Committee who earned a reputation as President Clinton's
fierce defender during impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But his tolerance doesn't extend to President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia. During a recent television interview, Wexler offered
his legal prescription for dealing with the strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to go in and get him, try him and hang him,'' said
Wexler.
</P>
<P>
   MAMA'S BOY
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to win support for bills, lawmakers often invoke
the names of powerful allies or celebrities to make their point.
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., cited family ties as he called for
cutting taxes and fees on telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin said many consumers are unhappy about the expanding
charges ``including my poor 80-year-old mama in Chackbay,'' Tauzin
said, referring to his mother's hometown. In case you missed the
point, Tauzin asked that his colleagues in Congress give this
``sweet old lady'' a break by going along with his bill.
</P>
<P>
   To give consumers a break, Tauzin's bill would slash a 3 percent
federal communications excise tax by two-thirds, a tax that he said
was first imposed by Congress in 1913 to help pay for World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``If history serves me, that war is over and I think we won it,
but that tax remains,'' said Tauzin, who also wants to prevent the
Federal Communications Commission from imposing other new fees on
consumers.

<P>
   Shareholders of Go2Net Inc., a network of Web sites that
includes the Silicon Investor bulletin boards, the Metacrawler
search service and the Haggle auction site, might have thought they
were imagining things when they saw the company's most recent
earnings announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go2Net Reports Profitable Second Quarter,'' the headline
announced, while a second line touted ``Pro Forma Net Income of
$.07 Per Share.''
</P>
<P>
   A profitable Internet company? Hardly. Only well into the April
21 news release would a reader find that Go2Net actually lost $52
million, or $4.07 a diluted share, in its second quarter, which
ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   And only after reading far, far down does one come across an
astounding disclaimer about the financial statements: ``They do not
purport to be financial statements prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts and investors say they have never seen
anything like what Go2Net and other Internet companies are doing:
being as loose with their financial reporting as some investors are
about buying the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them IAAP _ Inter-nut Accepted Accounting Principles,''
said Michael Murphy, an investor in Half Moon Bay, Calif., who
specializes in technology companies and, with his Overpriced Stock
Service publication, in shorting stocks, or betting that their
prices will decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to go around traditional accounting standards
with the hope that everyone buys into it,'' Murphy said. ``And the
investment banks that forecast earnings buy into it, because they
are not going to kill the golden goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell C. Horowitz, chief executive of Go2Net, said the company
``is following standard protocols for reporting, both for Internet
companies and for other industries.'' In addition, he said, ``the
Wall Street analysts do their models this way. In the absence of
that, I think people would have an unbelievably hard time
understanding what is going on under the hood.''
</P>
<P>
   What the companies are doing is not illegal, as long as they use
standard accounting in their reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Indeed, Wall Street has long looked differently at the
financial results of cable television, cellular phone and outdoor
advertising companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies, which must make huge infrastructure
investments, also incur big expenses to deduct the deteriorating
value of their assets from revenues. To clear the picture, analysts
examine earnings before deducting those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, however, rarely have those fixed
investments. Their amortization charges usually are writing off
high-priced acquisitions of other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a good way of looking at it in most cases,''
said Henry Blodget, who follows Internet companies at Merrill
Lynch. ``But in some, it is being abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Excite Inc., which operates a popular Web portal. Its
news release on April 15, announcing first-quarter earnings,
reported that ``on a pro forma basis,'' the company earned a net
profit of $2.5 million, or 4 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Pro forma results usually are reported to show the results of a
company's continiung business, independent of some major event like
a merger or divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   But in Excite's case, the pro forma results excluded $7.5
million of costs related to its joint marketing venture with
Netscape Communications, as well as acquisition-related expenses of
$2.4 million. As Excite noted in its release, on the basis of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, the company lost
$7.4 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Excite reported earnings before marketing
expenses,'' Blodget said.
</P>
<P>
   Excite declined to comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack T. Ciesielski, publisher of the Analyst's Accounting
Observer, an accounting research newsletter in Baltimore, put the
broader issue this way: ``Now companies seem to use `pro forma' as
meaning `without the things that we don't like.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Cnet Inc., which operates several Internet news and
entertainment sites, topped its April 21 first-quarter earnings
announcement with the headline, ``Proforma EPS Equals $0.09.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro forma number excludes the expenses related to Cnet's
recent acquisition of Winfiles.com _ a recurring item, because it
will be stretched over several years _ and the one-time gain on a
sale of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Doog Woodrum, chief financial officer for CNET, said, ``I think
we report earnings in a way that we hope provides investors with
the best way to analyze our company.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro forma numbers that some companies announce in their news
releases do not show up in their reports to the SEC. Go2Net's most
recent quarterly report did not include any mention of the 7 cents
a share that the company put in the headline of its news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because the 10-Q is filed in accordance with SEC
guidelines, which require GAAP accounting,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Ciesielski, the accounting expert, noted, while
regulatory filings must follow precise accounting rules, ``press
releases are still essentially free speech.''

`BLACK MASK': NONSTOP ACTION, RIDICULOUS PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone whose lips are exhausted from puzzling through the
nearest comic book can take a respite by eyeing ``Black Mask,'' one
of those dubbed action imports from Hong Kong that is long on
flying bodies, bullets and blood and short on credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Educational Testing Service may want to winnow the
Harvard-bound from lesser college candidates by using the plot as
the basis for one of its soporific exercises in textual analysis.
But in brief form the story has something to do with Project 701, a
Chinese operation that created a commando force of biologically
enhanced humans, fearless and impervious to pain.
</P>
<P>
   When they got a bit out of hand, efforts were made to obliterate
them. One of their number, in the person of Jet Li, resurfaces in
Hong Kong as a peaceful librarian whose best friend, Rock (Lau
Ching Wan), happens to be a police detective.
</P>
<P>
   When Hong Kong's drug lords begin to meet death in vast, ghastly
numbers, the trail leads to the survivors of 701, led by the
Commander, who resembles a hybrid of Darth Vader, Dr. No and Yoko
Ono. It seems that the Commander and his men are in league with the
Colombian drug cartel in a deal intended to force the Chinese
government to give the survivors an antidote to a blood component
that will kill them all within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a while passes before Rock realizes that the valorous
interloper in various shootouts is his pal, wearing a black eye
mask like Kato in the old ``Green Hornet.'' The resemblance does
not go unremarked. In its inane way, ``Black Mask'' packs enough
action to have nourished a couple of years' worth of yesteryear's
Saturday afternoon serials.
</P>
<P>
   Francoise Yip, as a deadly old friend from the 701 days, lends
glamour to the proceedings, and Karen Mok, as a love-hungry
librarian, furnishes a healthy dose of action comedy.
</P>
<P>
   With its shallow, time-worn characters, ``Black Mask'' doesn't
have anything on its mind besides action. It delivers that in
abundance for those whose tastes run to burned faces, severed
children's limbs and freshets of blood.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

COURTING THE RUSSIANS: 680,000 IMMIGRANT VOTERS BEING WOOED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 16) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHDOD, Israel _ As the clock winds down toward Israel's
elections, the candidates for prime minister are busily wooing
voters like Yevgeny Derimian, a 22-year-old immigrant from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in the country six months ago and, like many Jews
from the former Soviet Union, still doesn't know which candidate to
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Barak,'' he says with a shrug while enjoying the
afternoon at a cafe, referring to the opposition Labor Party
candidate Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I know who know the situation, they say Barak is
better. But I'm not sure. I don't have enough information.''
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to Monday's elections, Israeli candidates are
courting no group more fervently than the 680,000 voters from the
former Soviet Union, known here simply as ``the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   New to Israel's rough-and-tumble politics and not yet set in
their political beliefs, they are the swing voters who political
analysts predict largely will decide who is the next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has illustrated this better than the courtship of Natan
Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident who heads the Immigrants Party
and who has yet to throw his political weight behind any of the
five candidates competing for Israel's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the two
front-runners, have bent over backward to woo him.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have said they are considering offering Sharansky the
coveted finance ministry post in the next government. Both have
announced plans for subsidizing Russian immigrants. Both have added
Russian subtitles to their television campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Short, stocky and balding, Sharansky quipped recently that his
political suitors had ``finally understood that I'm a good-looking
man with a full head of curls.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far he has left it up to his followers to choose which
candidate best suits them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they overwhelmingly went for Netanyahu. Right-wing when
it comes to questions of peace with the Palestinians, most Russians
believed then that Netanyahu would succeed where Israel's left-wing
had failed on personal-security issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, they voted overwhelmingly for Labor because the party
was perceived as the best equipped to help them get settled in
their new land.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, polls indicate that Barak has succeeded in
persuading many to swing back and support a Labor candidate. When
the race for prime minister began this year, polls indicated that
Netanyahu had the support of 70 percent of the Russian vote, while
Barak had only 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By May 5, support for Netanyahu had plummeted to 55 percent, the
polls said, and Barak's popularity had skyrocketed to 40 percent.
In the week leading up to the election, those numbers held
constant.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that, say analysts, is because of the way Barak's staff
packaged the Labor leader. In campaign ads, they emphasized that he
is a classical pianist and former army chief of staff with a degree
in systems analysis from Stanford _ qualities most Russians
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have published many materials portraying Barak as a
soldier of Israel, Barak as an intellectual,'' says Marina
Solodkin, a sociologist and Russian member of parliament who has
written a book called ``Civilization Discomfort: the Soviet Jewry
in Israel in the Last Ten Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he plays the piano is important,'' she says.
``It makes him more human.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate the decrease in Russian support for Netanyahu has
contributed to the lag behind Barak. If the Russian trend toward
Barak continues, Netanyahu may be in trouble _ even if he keeps a
slight majority of Russian voters in his camp, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russian vote will be 55 percent for Netanyahu and 45
percent for Barak, then Barak will win,'' says Solodkin.
</P>
<P>
   But at least 15 percent, and maybe as much as 35 percent, of
these immigrants haven't yet made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Netanyahu still appeals to many Russians who believe
that security should come first. And his right-wing emphasis on
Jewish heritage and nationalism resonates among immigrants who
traded a life in Russia for one in Israel for precisely those
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about Jewish heritage,'' says Boris Yentin, editor of
Vesty, one of four Russian-language newspapers published in Israel.
``He is perceived as strong, as stable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu seems to have lost points with Russian voters each
time a political ally deserted him, which has happened often during
his tumultuous three-year rule, usually after a nasty public round
of name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians who will not vote for Netanyahu cite what they say
has been a string of lies from his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't trust him,'' says Israel Lerner, a Russian from
Moldova who lives in a posh area north of Tel Aviv. ``He's
arrogant. When you see him he has a little smile in the corner of
his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, more than Netanyahu, seems to have capitalized on a
cultural rift that has pitted Russians, who are typically secular,
against the religious supporters of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under Netanyahu, Shas controlled the Interior Ministry _ a
portfolio the Russians' political leaders desperately want. The
ministry has kept many Russians from obtaining Israeli citizenship,
getting married here or bringing relatives to the country by
questioning their Jewishness.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials estimate that some 30 percent are not Jewish
according to Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's interior minister, Shas member Eli Suissa, accused
Russians of coveting the ministry because they know the Shas will
prevent ``counterfeiters, con men and call girls'' from staying in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, the Immigrants Party ran TV commercials
that showed ordinary Russians demanding that Suissa apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Barak scored big among Russian voters, apparently without losing
others, when he hinted he would wrest the Interior Ministry away
from Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Because he favors forcing ultra-Orthodox Jews to serve in the
army, Shas voters are unlikely to vote for Barak anyway. Last week,
the party's spiritual council endorsed Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that Shas may be a part of Netanyahu's next
government pushes Russian voters toward Barak, said Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want a government that is controlled by the
ultra-Orthodox,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Russians' immense political clout gained so soon
after their arrival has irked many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Some 900,000 Russians have immigrated to Israel since 1989, and
they have established their own subculture in this nation of 5.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Ashdod, 30 miles south of Tel Aviv, people line up
for Russian-language theaters, dine at restaurants that use
Russian-language menus and attend concerts by Russian musicians on
tour from Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Israel's Russians dislike what they consider the
simplistic political categories such as ``religious'' or
``secular'' that other Israelis tend to use to describe themselves.
They believe they are more politically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they don't have time to worry about politics because
they have everyday problems. Unemployment among Russians is higher
than the Israeli average and many others are underemployed or
working at menial jobs despite their higher educations.
</P>
<P>
   Derimian, the 22-year-old Russian who moved to Israel six months
ago, is in many ways typical of the Russian predicament. He studies
Hebrew at a communal farm in the Negev desert and supplements a
$325 monthly stipend for new refugees from the Jewish Agency by
working part time as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own problems,'' he says. ``Of course I think what
will happen in terms of politics, war or not war, is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have more important things to think about than the
elections.''

   KOSOVO-ATTACK (Belgrade) _ More than 60 ethnic Albanians were

bombs blew apart a village in southwest Kosovo, near Prizren,
Yugoslav officials and journalists at the scene said. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>

   CONGRESS-GUNS (Washington) _ By a squeaker of a vote, Senate
Republicans on Friday passed a measure to promote background checks
at gun shows. Democrats, preferring a more stringent proposal of
their own, almost solidly opposed the measure. By Frank Bruni.

   EPA-POLLUTE (Washington) _ A federal appeals court on Friday set
aside new air quality standards issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency in 1997, handing the Clinton administration a
major environmental defeat. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   WELFARE-MILWAUKEE (Milwaukee) _ A decade ago, an eccentric band
of reformers here set out to guarantee every poor person a path
from poverty _ an assured job at a sufficient wage with child care
and health care. But as the program closes its offices this week,
an exhaustive volume of new research offers some disquieting
conclusions. Among the adults, only 27 percent managed to stick
with their subsidized jobs long enough to escape poverty. Their
average annual earnings were just $6,600. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   ASSASSIN-GAME (Westport, Conn.) _ Beginning next week, 35 elite
college-bound students from Staples High School plan to arm
themselves with plastic guns with names like Lock `n' Load, Secret
Shot II, and Expand-a-Blast, then stalk classmates through town.
The students, who call the game Assassinations, have elaborate
plans for staying alive, and so expect the contest to last three
weeks. The final two survivors will shoot it out in a town park,
then collect cash prizes. Although life has not completely imitated
art in the students' game, some students have begun to worry about
the issue of real bullets. A handful of Staples students are bowing
out this year, deciding that four weeks after the killings in a
Colorado high school might not be the best time to lurk in bushes
and hide under cars in hopes of knocking off a target, even if it
is with a foam dart. By Mike Allen.

   HAWAII-TRUST (Honolulu) _ Developments concerning the Bishop
Estate. The estate, an institution of almost medieval power, was
long been a source of intense native pride, but in recent years it
had come to be seen as the embodiment of Hawaii's brand of inbred,
closed-door politics, as secretive and suspect as it was
impregnable. Most of the trustees were closely connected to the
state's ruling political establishment, so their dramatic ouster _
and the long fight that led up to it _ has led to predictions of a
shakeup in institutions from the Legislature to the state Supreme
Court, whose members used to select the Bishop trustees. By Todd S.
Purdum.

A VOICE OF CAUTION IN A CHORUS OF GAMBLERS 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robert Rubin went to Washington in 1993 as chairman of
President Clinton's National Economic Council, the Dow Jones
industrial average was under 4,000, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index was trading at less than 500 and the federal budget was $255
billion in the red.
</P>
<P>
   As he leaves as treasury secretary, the budget is in surplus.
The decline in interest rates as the budget deficit receded has
allowed an estimated 19 million mortgages to be refinanced, saving
homeowners $23.4 billion, according to the Mortgage Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of that money has found its way into the stock
market, which has done stupefyingly well.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin isn't uniquely responsible for all these good things, of
course. But he will be a tough act to follow. And he couldn't have
picked a much better time to cash out.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that all good things must end, a fact that
worries Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset
Management. Biggs took time last week to discuss Rubin's years at
the Treasury and the markets he is leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The sense seems to be that Rubin would not be leaving
Treasury if he wasn't confident the worst of last fall's financial
crisis had passed. Do you share that view?
</P>
<P>
   A. I am not necessarily convinced Rubin thinks that things are
improving. At a small reception about two weeks ago, Larry Summers,
his likely successor, cautioned people against being overly
optimistic about global economic recovery. There are a lot of
trouble spots, particularly Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you consider Rubin's most important contributions to
the country?
</P>
<P>
   A. We all had the confidence he was a steady hand, that if the
markets and the global financial system got in trouble, he knew
what to do. He did it with Mexico in 1994 and 1995 and again last
summer. He understood markets and had great intuition. The fact
that he decided to announce his departure now is because he felt
the market was stable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has this view influenced your investment strategy? Worry
about the future doesn't seem to be priced into too many of the
world's equity markets just now.
</P>
<P>
   A. I am scared but fully invested, and we are hugging our
benchmarks because we are scared about the tremendous excesses we
see in these markets. There are literally no cheap markets in the
world right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How have you weighted your portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are slightly overweight in equities, underweighted in the
United States and Europe but overweighted in the United Kingdom and
Japan by about 10 percent in each case. We are overweighted in
non-Japan Asia and in the emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   About 62 or 63 percent of our portfolio is in equities. The
remainder is in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given the performance of Japanese stocks the last decade, how
can you say that market is expensive?
</P>
<P>
   A. Compared with the United States or Europe, Japan is not
expensive. But compared with important market bottoms in the past,
it is. Here is a country that is in a depression, and its market is
selling at 75 times earnings and two times book value. In the
1930s, the U.S. stock market sold at half of book value. So, Japan
is not exactly cheap by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the emerging markets?
</P>
<P>
   A. Japan, other Asian markets and the emerging markets are
coming out of long bear markets. They will be the best place to
invest after the next bear market and will be the best places to be
in the short run as long as this bull market lasts because they are
going to go up more and come down less. But I can't say they're
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for small and mid-cap stocks in this country.
They are as cheap as they have been in a long time relative to the
S&AMP;P 500, but at about 15 times to 17 times earnings, they are not
historically cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On what is your worry about a looming sell-off based?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our economics people are looking for a recovery, but I think
the United States is going to lose some momentum, that the Japanese
are going sideways at best and that the Germans are bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a great deal of overcapacity in the world. I was
in Europe last week talking to businessmen and industrialists, and
I didn't meet anyone who said economic activity was picking up,
either from orders abroad or within Europe itself.
</P>
<P>
   These markets are priced for perfection, and if something bad
happens, the market has the potential to go down a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In this environment, what advice would you give to individual
investors?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would say they should not be deluded by advertisements that
suggest any amateur can make money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   We are perpetuating a gambling mentality that is similar to the
1920s. I read somewhere recently that 15,000 new Internet trading
accounts are being opened every week. That is frightening.

WILD ANIMAL KEEPER FACES PENALTIES AFTER DEATHS OF BIG CATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUSSELL GOLD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When a zoo in Spokane, Wash., lost its lease in
1996, the board of directors had to scramble to find new homes for
the animals. Two tigers and two cougars were among the hardest to
place.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Animal Orphanage, a San Antonio animal sanctuary, agreed to
take them, sparing the large cats from euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Relief quickly turned to grief, however. By the time the charter
plane returned to San Antonio, both tigers and one of the cougars
had died.
</P>
<P>
   The fiasco raised enough eyebrows that the United States
Department of Agriculture decided to open an investigation. Two
months ago, the government brought charges against Wild Animal
Orphanage, citing numerous willful violations of the Animal Welfare
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has proposed a $12,000 fine and a 90-day suspension
of WAO's exhibitor license.
</P>
<P>
   WAO director Carol Asvestas called the charges ``ridiculous,''
but said she wouldn't take her fight to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend money on an attorney and go to a hearing
and take away from the animals that I have in my care. I'm not
about to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas said she wrote to the USDA explaining how deficiencies
have been remedied.
</P>
<P>
   The charges come as WAO is expecting a shipment of 60 sooty
mangabeys and 40 stump-tailed macaques from the Yerkes Regional
Primate Research Center near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any tiny deviation from a perfect world and you are going to
get a citation,'' Yerkes spokeswoman Kate Egan said. ``It is not
going to change our relations with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA brought charges against 39 organizations in fiscal year
1998 for animal-welfare violations, said agency spokesman Jim
Rogers. Based on a review of recent actions, complaints are usually
against animal dealers and circuses, not animal sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against WAO claim the sanctuary used crates that
were either too small or had too little ventilation to move the
tigers and cougars.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of follow-up visits to the sanctuary, inspectors
cited WAO for improper cages, failing to remove animal waste and
not maintaining a distance between the public and animals.
</P>
<P>
   WAO houses more than 200 animals, including chimpanzees, tigers,
brown bears, foxes and a large collection of domestic cats.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas said the charges were all minor infractions. ``We are
not guilty of anything that literally affected the animal's
welfare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why the tigers and cougar died is not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas brought three crates to Spokane _ two metal military
surplus crates used by the Army to move German Shepherds and a
wooden box built by WAO. She placed both cougars in one of the
crates. Each full-grown tiger had its own crate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did I feel the crates used were so small as to
cause the deaths of the animals, even though they were slightly
cramped,'' Asvestas stated in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rogers, a veterinarian from Spokane, has a different
recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about one of the tigers, Brown said, ``His head was
cricked around and he was basically stuffed in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The other tiger also did not fit. ``The crate had to be stood on
its end and shaken to get the cat in there enough to close the
door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the crates were secured, they were placed on a 19-seat
twin engine turbo-prop plane. One of the cougars was sitting up
during the flight, said Ron Stotz, the pilot. The three other cats
did not budge an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw any motion. They were zonked, maybe too zonked,''
Stotz said. ``They were laying there with their tongues hanging
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The two tigers and one of the cougars were dead upon arrival in
San Antonio, eight hours after leaving Spokane. An 8-year-old
female cougar named Dandi survived the trip.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy by local veterinarian Larry Ehrlund was inconclusive,
but in his necropsy report he said his findings suggested the
animals had died of respiratory failure related to sedation and
obesity. He also found ``a blood tinge discharge from the mouth and
nares (nostrils).''
</P>
<P>
   Asvestas brought ketamine and other anesthetics to Spokane to
sedate the animals. She injected Dandi before Rogers arrived. Who
injected the other three animals is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said Asvestas and another WAO employee determined the
dosage. Asvestas blames Rogers for giving the two tigers and the
cougar a lethal dose.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was dumbfounded when he learned there would not
be a veterinarian on the plane trip back to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all devastated by the incident,'' said Carol Snyder,
former director of the Spokane zoo.

<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. _ Beginning next week, 35 elite college-bound
students from Staples High School plan to arm themselves with
plastic guns with names like Lock `n' Load, Secret Shot II and
Expand-a-Blast, then stalk classmates through town.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who call the game A.P. Assassination, have
elaborate plans for staying alive, and so expect the contest to
last three weeks. The final two survivors will shoot it out in a
town park, then collect cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The game and others like it have become a rite of spring at high
schools and colleges across the country, apparently inspired by a
1982 movie ``T.A.G.: The Assassination Game.'' In the film, college
students shoot each other with rubber darts, and it's all great fun
until one player begins using real bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Although life has not completely imitated art in the students'
game, some students have begun to worry about the issue of real
bullets in the aftermath of the bloodbath at a Colorado high school
in April. A handful of Staples students are bowing out this year,
deciding that four weeks after the Colorado shootings might not be
the best time to lurk in bushes and hide under cars in hopes of
knocking off a target, even if it is with a foam dart.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic of bomb scares and copycat threats that followed
the Littleton killings has added to the tension over the toy-gun
sprees.
</P>
<P>
   At a parent-teacher meeting this week, principal Gloria Rakovic
urged parents to try to dissuade their seniors from participating.
``They're symbolically hurting each other, and we have seen that
the discrimination between what's real and what's not can get
fuzzy,'' she said. ``This is a teachable moment to talk to kids
about how their behavior is perceived by others, and whether they
care how people perceive them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the games vary somewhat from school to school, the
basic elements are these: students draw names of classmates and
then try to shoot their prey without getting shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Secret Santa, with squirt guns and Nerf assault rifles.
Phony pizza deliveries, pre-dawn stakeouts and after-work ambushes
are all part of the game. Underclassmen sometimes serve as body
guards. Siblings are enlisted as lookouts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns about Littleton, Colo., the games are to go
on at many schools from California to Virginia, school officials
say. But in a number of cases, the students themselves have altered
or curtailed this year's edition out of a sense of duty and a
precocious instinct for public relations. At Staples, for instance,
a rebel group of seniors is boycotting the game and plans a
barbecue instead. For entertainment, there will be Capture the
Flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have 90 kids running around town with toy guns - not that I
wouldn't have fun doing it, but I can't make that sound right in my
head right now,'' said Alex Williams-Resnick, captain of the ski
team and president of the drama club. ``I've never had to deal with
having a gun pulled on me. I asked myself, Am I throwing it in
someone else's face? To do this in the name of fun, am I belittling
the actual violence that goes on in the world?''
</P>
<P>
   For authorities on violence who have argued that society can
stimulate violent outbursts by troubled young people, the
proliferation of assassination games _ and their continuation
despite the Colorado tragedy _ is alarming and even dangerous. Dr.
Robert Butterworth, a child psychologist in Los Angeles who studies
trauma, said he was astonished to hear of the practice, given the
current climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they wear trench coats?'' he asked. Butterworth said such
games could help desensitize students to violence. ``We're not
going to change the culture for these deviant kids, but we have to
be careful that we don't make it too easy for them to be ignited,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many kids scoff at that idea. Jay Liner, a senior who is in the
third week of an assassination game at Northwest Catholic High
School in West Hartford, said it was patronizing to suggest that
18-year-olds cannot differentiate between a squirt gun and an Uzi.
``Nothing has changed from the week before Littleton,'' he said.
``I don't want to sound un-whatever, but that's the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes being made to the games appear to be token
reactions, while others have been major. At Harvard University,
students called a 19-hour truce in an assassination game that ended
in a furious foam-dart shootout in the courtyard of Quincy House.
``Due to the extraordinary tragedy that occurred,'' organizers told
players in an e-mail message the night after the Littleton
shootings, ``we would ask that people don't carry guns tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   At Conard High School in West Hartford, students officially
changed the name of this year's game from ``Assassins'' to ``The
Game'' (after ``Water Wars'' and ``Soak'' were vetoed as too
corny). Like Westport's, the Conard game is not sanctioned by the
school and is completely run by students. The rules for the games
prohibit shootings on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Conard principal Chuck Landroche made a rare special
announcement over the public-address system to encourage students
to discontinue the game in light of Littleton, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   After a heated assembly at Sharon High School, about 30 miles
south of Boston, seniors canceled their squirt-gun Assassination
game and are thinking about holding a class cookout or taking a
trip to a water park. Students there admit that the game had been
getting out of hand, anyway. Michael Schindelar, the senior class
president, said that one year the game resulted in five car
accidents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And at the University of Nevada-Reno, students wore purple
ribbons in tribute to the fallen of Columbine High School during
``The Assassination Game,'' which this year was played not with the
usual squirt guns but with labels showing the university seal. The
students called it ``Sticker Tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Trenton Johnson, the senior class president, said that although
some students complained that ``we've become even more politically
correct, he believes that the campus will remain more wary of mock
violence and that the Assassination game is dead for good.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's most furious debates over the game unfolded
this week here in Westport, a town of 25,000 built around the mouth
of the Saugatuck River, where stone mansions with ``Private
Residence'' signs are surrounded by bright boutiques and trendy
galleries that evoke a Yankee Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   In this haven for overachievers, even Assassination is
exclusive. By tradition at Staples, the town's lone public high
school, the game is played only by seniors who have taken
advanced-placement courses, which is college-level work offered in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.P. Assassination'' begins at midnight after the final
Advanced Placement examination and continues for several weeks _ a
chance for the top pupils, most of whom have already been admitted
to good colleges, to bond and blow off steam in the month left
until graduation.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Nerf war, which is to begin May 22, carries a $7
entry fee. The rules require that the guns fire ``non-spherical
objects,'' such as darts tipped with suction cups.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the game say they expect their protest cookout to
attract about 40 of the roughly 90 students who were eligible for
the game. Matt Cass, a senior, said students were concerned about
their image if they were seen popping out of bushes with toy guns.
But more than that, he said, ``We can see that violence is
society's problem, and not just an individual's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Cohen, a family therapist who hosts a radio program,
``Kids Are Talking,'' on the high school's station, said students
here have reacted very emotionally to the Colorado shootings, in
part because of the demographics of Littleton and Westport are
similarly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the game think the boycott barbecue represents
a ridiculous overreaction. ``We try to put a little intrigue into
it, but this is basically tag,'' said Dan Lascar, 18, who hopes to
become a physics professor. ``How long have people been playing
cowboys and Indians? If we choose to turn our lives completely
around and upside down because of the gunmen, they truly have
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Yearbook editor Alison Cooke, who organized this year's game,
said that although ``it can look, I guess, somewhat disturbing,
possibly,'' it is, in fact, ``a way to relax and get to know
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She quibbled with the numbers offered by opponents to the game
and said that only 10 people had dropped out after Littleton. But
catching the sociable spirit of the year, she said the assassins,
too, plan a cookout after just one of them is left standing.

ARAB WORLD'S NEUTRALITY ON ISRAEL'S ELECTION MASKS THEIR REAL
PREFERENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ With just days to go before the Israeli election,
the Arab world is watching with a pretense of neutrality, although
Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, is plainly the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent reason for the caution is concern that overt Arab
cheerleading for Barak or criticism of the current prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has long been seen around the Arab world as a major
obstacle to a broader peace between Israel and the Arabs. In
private conversations most Arab officials do not disguise their
hope that his tenure may come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks against him that are a usual staple of the Arab
press have been muffled lately, apparently out of an aversion to
handing Netanyahu anything he might use as ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to be seen as standing tough against the Arabs, so
the last thing we want to do is to reinforce that view,'' a
Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an odd period of politesse. In the past
Netanyahu has routinely been vilified in the Arab press with titles
like ``Netanyahu, enemy of peace.'' Suddenly, even in newspapers
that have been among his fiercest critics, he is ``Mr. Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu's attempt this week to shut down Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem was mildly described in an editorial in
The Jordan Times as an ``election gimmick,'' even though similar
attempts have prompted cries of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, now
leading in opinion polls before the voting on Monday, a faint sense
of excitement can be felt among Arab officials and commentators who
have begun to suggest that the election may well prove to be a
watershed that will give way to broader peace.
</P>
<P>
   While governments are feigning neutrality, a Jordanian
columnist, Fahed Fanek, wrote recently in the newspaper Al Rai that
only the ``mentally lazy'' would say there was no difference
between Labor and Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabs will interpret the result as whether the Jewish state
wants peace or not,'' wrote Fanek, who remained careful not to
state a preference of his own.
</P>
<P>
   A television program broadcast in Egypt last week stoked the
sense of hopefulness, with Netanyahu's opponents emphasizing their
determination to reinvigorate the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, a top adviser to Barak, said on the broadcast that
the Labor Party leader was determined to make peace with all of the
Arabs within a year, while Yitzhak Mordechai, the third main
candidate, said he had left Likud in part because he wanted ``to
develop cooperation with neighbors of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tone of coverage across the Arab world has remained
mild. Likud representatives were invited to appear on the Egyptian
broadcast but declined. With most election news relegated to the
inside pages, some commentators have accused governments of being
too cautious, saying it is important to drive home to Israelis the
message of just how much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arab countries seem determined to win ``an American
certificate of good manners,'' a commentator, Abdel Wahab Badran,
wrote recently in the London-based Arabic newspaper Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   In steering around the question of what candidate they prefer,
those Arab leaders who have addressed the issue have tried to turn
the focus on what may lie beyond the election.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah of Jordan, the new leader of a country whose peace
with Israel remains unpopular among its citizens, called last week
for the next Israeli government to show ``a sense of urgency'' in
tackling stalled peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to move forward _ the Israelis and the
Palestinians _ I think it will have a cascade effect throughout the
Middle East,'' the king told reporters in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, most Arab commentators are counseling
against the belief that a new day may be at hand. Not only might
Netanyahu hold on to power, they say, but Barak, if elected, might
prove an equally tough adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arabs ``expect miracles from Barak, as if he is the savior
of peace process, and that is mere imagination based on unrealistic
wishes,'' Badran wrote in Al Hayat. He reminded readers that
current peace agreements would remain the same whether under Labor
or Likud rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same peace,'' Badran wrote, ``but with Labor it
smells better!''

BABBITT UNVEILS CONTROVERSIAL SYSTEM TO FIX INDIAN TRUST FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure to find more than $3 billion in
missing or unaccounted-for money in Indian trust funds, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt unveiled a new $60 million computer
accounting system Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a new way of doing business,''
Babbitt said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds were set up in the 19th century when it was
national policy to break up reservations and parcel out tracts of
80 or 160 acres to individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those lands were rich in timber, minerals or
agricultural products. The government, acting as a trustee for the
Indian owners, negotiated with individuals and companies seeking to
buy or lease the lands or their mineral rights.
</P>
<P>
   The government would set prices for tree sales or mining or farm
leases and then collect the money on behalf of the Indian property
owners. The government was supposed to manage this task like a
trust officer at a local bank, always acting on behalf of the
landholder.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Interior Department reports showed there are now more
than 340,000 individual Indian trust fund accounts, and more than
$300 million passes through the accounts each year.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 123,000 accounts lack a Social Security number or
taxpayer ID number, and at least 46,000 accounts are for Indians
whose whereabouts are unknown. In addition, Indian account holders
generally find it impossible to check on the value of their
holdings. Often they don't receive regular account statements, and
typically they are required to get permission from Interior's
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to lease their lands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several billion dollars may have been lost over the
years in undervalued and uncollected lease payments and in
destroyed or lost checks for Indian beneficiaries. A 1992
congressional report concluded that ``the Indian trust fund is
equivalent to a bank that doesn't know how much money it has.''
</P>
<P>
   The new computer system is supposed to link the accounts held by
the Indians with Interior's land records and to give account
holders a way to check their funds at any time. The system is
scheduled to be installed first in the BIA's Billings, Mont.,
regional office next month and to be fully operating throughout BIA
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Babbitt has promised that the system will succeed,
critics have charged the project has little chance of working
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the General Accounting Office, a key investigative
arm of Congress, concluded that the Interior Department could not
``realistically'' expect its system to work. The report, released
April 28, said Interior officials had failed to analyze whether the
new computer project could handle trust fund information, which
requires linking data from several different systems.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the department is making the same mistakes as
other agencies that have been forced to spend millions of dollars
in cost overruns on computer projects.
</P>
<P>
   Without adequate planning, the ``agency is at risk of building
and buying a system that is duplicative, incompatible and
unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several current and former top-ranking Interior
Department officials, including Paul Homan, who ran a special
division created to clean up the trust funds before quitting in
January, and his successor, Thomas Thompson, have said the computer
system will not work. But Thompson has since reversed his position,
saying the system will work.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the GAO report, Interior officials said that an
overall analysis similar to what the GAO recommended would have
taken too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get this fixed now rather than spending another two
or three years studying it,'' BIA spokesman Rex Hackler said after
the report was released. ``The BIA is going to incredible lengths
to make sure this system is working by the deadlines set by the
secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   Homan and others, citing BIA's long history of mismanagement,
have said that fixing and running the trust funds should be turned
over to a private financial company.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday Babbitt again defended the system, saying, ``It's
going to work, and we're going to show it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that many of the BIA's critics are being
motivated by racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amounts to a belief that any organization run by Indians is
incompetent,'' Babbitt said. ``Saying that outside consultants
should run this is part of a condescending approach people use when
talking to Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Keith Harper, a lawyer for the Native Americans Rights
Fund, which is suing the department over the trust funds issue,
said the secretary's comments were the ``last, desperate gasp of a
man who knows he and his department are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth held Babbitt
and outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt of court
for failing to turn over Indian trust funds records at issue in the
suit brought by the NARF.

 &HT;    Hyundai rolls out a new image
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although Korean automaker Hyundai has totally rebuilt
its Sonata, it's possible to argue that the front-drive sedan's
most appealing and striking features are the papers that come with
it. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   _ The window sticker shows a base price of $15,799, which
includes air conditioning, a cassette-playing stereo, an automatic
transmission and power locks, windows and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   _ A warranty good for five years/60,000 miles, bumper to bumper.
It covers the drivetrain for 10 years/100,000 miles and provides
unlimited-mileage roadside assistance for five years.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a catch, right? Well, it's this: Hyundai is trying
to overcome a shaky reputation acquired when the cars it imported
to the United States starting in 1988 proved to have
less-than-ideal reliability and quality.
</P>
<P>
   The monochromatic ``lime moss'' test car, a $15,799 base model
with 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and four-speed automatic
transmission, seems proof that Hyundai has made progress in one of
its two problem areas. The quality seemed solid, with things inside
and out fitted nicely, although the Sonata can produce tinny
noises.
</P>
<P>
   But the reliability remains a question mark because both the
2.4-liter four-cylinder in the base car and the 170-horsepower,
2.5-liter V-6 engine in the $16,999 Sonata GLS are new.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however, remain the same. The Sonata is noisy, with
its engine, suspension and the road all to blame. The ride is
totally acceptable most of the time, but the handling is awkward
and the acceleration sluggish for the 3,000-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   The interior _ in terms of space _ is a definite plus. While its
price says ``compact car,'' the numbers and feel declare it's a
midsize sedan. Total length is 185.4 inches _ nearly 16 feet _ and
the new Sonata is about 2 inches wider this year for a total width
of 71.6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The rounded body and cabin provide family-size room with 39.3
inches of front headroom and 43.3 inches of legroom. Can't stretch
out as much in the rear, though, because legroom drops to 36.2
inches and headroom to 37.6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, this Sonata is big on plastic. There's
lots of it _ oodles, if not acres _ surrounding the occupants, and
it's not particularly pretty. The patterned cloth seats, though,
are OK visually and physically, with good adjustments and a form
that encourages an upright driving position.
</P>
<P>
   The center console has storage and a handy lidded two-drink
holder. Controls are basic and simple, with the only real irritant
a console-mounted shifter that seemed determined to slide past
``D'' to ``3'' every time it was pulled into gear. Be inattentive,
and it's possible to drive for a while in third gear (makes for
better expressway performance, however).
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is that while notably improved and attractive on
paper, the Sonata hasn't caught the targeted Camrys, Accords,
Malibus and other midsize cars. But what used to be a Grand
Canyon-ish gulf is now a gap that's closable.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Hyundai Sonata front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $17,052 (base: $15,799)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and side air bags, side-impact
beams, height-adjustable front shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Powertrain: 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (149
horsepower), four-speed automatic overdrive transmission with
winter and power shift modes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: package with cruise control, 120-watt
stereo with CD player, power moonroof, $1,175; carpeted floor mats,
$78
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jonathan Hoenig, 23, the founder of Capitalist Pig
LLC, has just finished broadcasting his morning radio financial
report for WNEW, an FM rock station in New York, and already he is
showing why he is a hit with the MTV generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you just love Maria Bartiromo?'' he says, eyeing the
CNBC anchor on his television set while taking a drag on a Lucky
Strike cigarette at his makeshift broadcast studio in downtown
Chicago. ``I love what she represents: sexy finance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way he sells young people on investing. For him, it's
hard-core. It's sexy. And it's entertaining, or should be. That is
precisely why he once booked an exotic dancer on his radio show:
sort of Howard Stern meets Louis Rukeyser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a stripper on with a mutual fund manager to talk about
her needs,'' he said over lunch the other day. ``He put her into a
short-term bond fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous? Sure. But just a few short years after he began
broadcasting a financial program called ``Capitalist Pig'' on
Northwestern University's radio station, Hoenig has burst onto the
scene as a journalist, financial commentator and author of ``Greed
Is Good,'' an investment guide for people under 35, to be published
later this month by HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   He was named one of the top 30 financial journalists under 30 by
TJFR, a newsletter for public relations professionals. He made the
cover of Institutional Investor. (``It's Personal Finance, Dude!''
blared the headline.) He is also a regular contributor to P.O.V.
magazine and is a financial commentator on ``Market Place,'' the
public radio program.
</P>
<P>
   It was bound to happen. Wall Street is hot. Financial programs
are multiplying like rabbits and even Grandma is pointing and
clicking on E-Trade. So why not the rise of a young man with slick
hair and raging blue eyes who finds a way to worship Michael Milken
and Hugh Hefner in the same breath as Malcolm X?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hard sell,'' Hoenig says of his Capitalist Pig
media operation, which now consists of a monthly newsletter,
Capitalist Pig Report; T-shirts; a Web site; syndicated columns;
television and radio programming, and even his mom's pig-shaped
cookies. ``Somehow, the `Antiques Road Show' on PBS sounds like a
lot harder sell than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoenig, who flops around in unlaced Doc Martens and a tie
studded with pigs, doesn't find anything unusual about the way his
often racy conversations veer from rising interest rates to the
movie ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he simply wants to soak up all the good things in life
as soon as possible _ an urge he ascribes in part to the deaths of
his father and his older brother when he was still in his teens.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Glencoe, Ill., a Chicago suburb, in the 1980s,
when greed was in style, he said. When he was 9, his father gave
him two shares of Boeing stock, and he promptly fell in love with
investing. He borrowed his mantra, ``Greed is good,'' from Gordon
Gekko, the ruthless financier played by Michael Douglas in the film
``Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time he got a public affairs radio program at
Northwestern, he took a job clerking at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Before long, his interests converged and he turned his
radio program into Capitalist Pig.
</P>
<P>
   Investment advice, often emphasized with profanities, was
delivered against a backbeat of music from bands like Guns 'N
Roses. A highlight of each program was his naming the ``finance
babe of the week'' and running an advice segment called ``Ask the
Pig.''
</P>
<P>
   As for financial wisdom, this self-taught Wunderkind of Wall
Street (``I just started on the Barnes &AMP; Noble bookshelf and read
everything from Benjamin Graham to Marty Zweig'') has a very
common-sense approach to investing. He preaches diversification,
the benefits of compound interest and the debilitating effects of
credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   And while he doesn't have a track record as a stock picker, he
simply advises young people to educate themselves about the market
and start investing.
</P>
<P>
   Making $5.50 an hour just doesn't kick it. ``That's good money,
if you're 15, Amish or inhabiting a corrugated cardboard box,'' he
says in his new book. And for him: ``The notion of being able to
make money without actually doing much of anything jazzed me to no
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the campus radio program led to appearances on
CNN and MTV. He has also helped write a college textbook,
``Personal Finance'' (Irwin/McGraw Hill, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of Northwestern in 1998 (he says his mother wants
him to think of it as a leave of absence) to focus on trading his
own money in the futures pits of the Chicago Board of Trade and to
begin branding himself and his company under the Capitalist Pig
logo, which features a cigar-puffing pig. He even hired the same
agent who represents Phil Jackson, the former coach of the Chicago
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak the language of brands,'' Hoenig said of his target
audience, 18- to 35-year-olds. ``Since Day 1, we've been affixing
logos and marketing slogans. What I want to do is start a lifestyle
brand and tie it to something that is central to all of our lives:
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoenig _ a tireless self-promoter whose press kit arrives as a
stuffed suitcase _ is trying to create a brand that delivers
financial advice with wacky wit and an unapologetic philosophy that
money is everything.
</P>
<P>
   He boasts of having a unique voice. Well, how often does
Rukeyser mock day traders by coining a phrase like, ``Just buy
after Regis and sell after Rosie''?
</P>
<P>
   Talking about stocks, after all, is just like talking about
sports, he says. ``Instead of talking about ERAs, you're talking
about P/E ratios.''
</P>
<P>
   He counts James J. Cramer of Thestreet.com and Alan Abelson of
Barron's among his heroes. In his office, just above his desk, is a
large photocopied portrait of Lou Dobbs, the CNN financial news
anchor. Is he another hero?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Hoenig said, flashing a sly grin, ``We just used that as
a dartboard at my book party.''

   Comparing Old and New In Electronic Publishing
</P>
<P>
   Exercises in valuing Internet-based businesses by traditional
means can end in snapped pencils and thrown-up hands. New
companies, new business models, no profits, no track record, no
equivalent firm for comparison: the litany usually leads back to
``it's worth whatever people will pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every Internet company is operating in uncharted
terrain. The Net stock enthusiasts who greeted its offering last
week may not like being told so, but TheStreet.com is in just about
the same business as Dow Jones &AMP; Co., or at least its
electronic-publishing wing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that each operates a financial-information Web site
with original journalistic content; each site generates revenue by
selling advertising and charging users a subscription fee for
access to the best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So, stacked up against Dow Jones and its electronic publishing
operation (which also includes the Dow Jones Newswires and some
other data services), how does TheStreet.com (in which The New York
Times Co. owns a minority stake) compare?
</P>
<P>
   Taken just as an Internet play, the whole of Dow Jones is more
attractively priced _ and you get The Wall Street Journal for
free. &QL;

WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 91-8, a bill that will raise
military pay by 4.8 percent starting Jan. 1. It would be the
largest pay raise the military has seen since 1982. The bill also
provides military personnel with more pension options, access to
tax-favored saving accounts and special aid to personnel who
qualify for food stamps. Supporters said that military personnel
deserve more benefits and a raise in pay. Opponents said they
wanted to offset the costs before passing the bill because it could
exceed preset budget limits. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   Temptation, Temptation at Auction Houses
</P>
<P>
   Auction houses _ especially their wine departments _ are
outdoing Las Vegas casinos in coddling customers.
</P>
<P>
   To stir interest in its wine sale on Saturday, Sotheby's is
offering a chance to taste some of the best offerings on Friday
night. Similarly, its rival, Christie's, held a dinner at its new
Rockefeller Center quarters the night before its May 6 and 7 wine
sales; according to one executive, the dinner cost about $50,000,
or more than $700 for each of 68 guests.
</P>
<P>
   For Christie's, Charlie Trotter _ the Chicago chef who says ``we
fire customers'' unworthy of dining at the restaurant that bears
his name _ flew in with dozens of assistants. Sellers including
William I. Koch, of the Wichita, Kan., family that owns Koch
Industries, provided the sort of wines usually considered too
costly for anything but auctioning.
</P>
<P>
   As he swirled and sniffed the 1970 Chateau Latour, Christopher
S. Burr, director of the Christie's wine department, said, ``We're
just bringing together willing buyers and willing sellers.''
Bidders, expected to spend about $2.9 million at the sales, offered
$3.4 million instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Burr said later of the dinner, ``it had some
effect.'' Now other Christie's departments want his help in
entertaining their own bidders.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALLEN MYERSON
</P>
<P>
   That Take-Charge Style
</P>
<P>
   The oppressed secretaries in the movie ``9 to 5'' took the sharp
edges off their autocratic workplace by tying up their
fire-breathing male boss and putting their womanly instincts in
charge. But despite the popular image of women as collegial and
democratic at work, the real-life Boss Who Rules may more likely be
a woman than a man.
</P>
<P>
   Management Research Group, a career planning and consulting firm
in Portland, Maine, asked bosses, peers and subordinates to rate
900 men and 900 women as managers. Robert I. Kabacoff, the
company's director of research, said the results showed that ``men
are more inclined to delegate tasks to others and cooperate with
colleagues'' and that women ``come across as more assertive and
competitive in achieving their goals, while maintaining more
control of their projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said that men had greater business skills but that
women excelled at people skills like willingness to listen.
</P>
<P>
   If the people who take the orders are correct, democratic habits
may not be so important anyway. Asked who makes the best leader
overall, bosses found the sexes equal, but subordinates and peers
rated women slightly higher. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ In a raffish waterfront bar in a warehouse district,
an unlikely band of allies gathered here this week to toast what
they hope will prove a watershed victory in Hawaii's feudal world
of one-party politics.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrants included a senior federal judge, an outspoken law
professor, the head of the state's Democratic Party and its former
attorney general _ plus scores of alumni, faculty and friends of
the world's richest private school.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, a state probate court judge had ordered the
ouster of four of the five trustees of the mighty Bishop Estate, a
charitable trust that owns 8 percent of the land in Hawaii and
investments from China to Wall Street _over $6 billion total _ all
for the benefit of the Kamehameha Schools, a 3,000-student
institution for boys and girls in the green hills above the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the removals _ and accepted the resignation of
the fifth trustee _ after the Internal Revenue Service threatened
to revoke the tax-exempt status of the trust, the cherished legacy
of a childless 19th-century Hawaiian princess, amid an
investigation into financial mismanagement and self-dealing by
trustees, each of whom was paid about $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The estate, an institution of almost medieval power, was long a
source of intense native pride, but in recent years had come to be
seen as the embodiment of Hawaii's brand of inbred, closed-door
politics, as secretive and suspect as it was impregnable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trustees were closely connected to the state's
ruling political establishment, so their dramatic ouster _ and the
long fight that led up to it _has led to predictions of a shakeup
in institutions from the Legislature to the state Supreme Court,
whose members used to select the Bishop trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an important message here that the system does
work,'' said Randall Roth, a professor at the University of Hawaii
Law School and president of the State Bar Association, and
co-author of ``Broken Trust,'' a scathing manifesto published in
the Honolulu Star-Bulletin by a group of five Hawaiian elders in
1997 that called for the removal of the four trustees ousted last
week. ``I think a lot of people in Hawaii have a lot more
confidence in the system than they did a week ago. There really is
an uplifting side.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roth's group came together with friends and faculty of
Kamehameha Schools at the La Mariana Sailing Club the other night,
tears flowed, cheers went up and heartfelt cries of ``Mission
accomplished!'' rang out.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy took a terrible toll. One trustee attempted
suicide after being caught in a sexual tryst in a hotel restroom
with a lawyer for the trust, who succeeded in killing herself with
carbon monoxide. Barely a week before the probate court's ruling
ousting the trustees, the state Senate retaliated against the state
attorney general who had headed the investigation, Margery
Bronster, by declining to confirm her for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends were pitted against each other in a state where the
Democrats have ruled supreme since the beginning of statehood,
including Gov. Benjamin Cayetano, who served in the legislature
with two of the trustees but ordered the attorney general's inquiry
that helped lead to their removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it started, of course, no one knew the scope of what
would be discovered,'' Cayetano said in an interview. ``But I was
troubled enough to realize there should be an investigation. What's
happened is sad and tragic for their families, and I feel badly
about it. But in a job like this, you do what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote against Ms. Bronster so embarrassed the state
establishment that Walter Heen, retired appellate judge who is also
head of the state Democratic Party and one of the group that had
pressed for the trustees' ouster, issued a statement saying that
the 13 Democratic senators who voted against the attorney general
``contravened the philosophy and principles of Democratic
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Bishop Estate is a telling reminder of how
much Hawaii still stands apart from the other 49 states. It was
created, under conditions that could never be equaled in the modern
world, by Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the last direct
descendant of King Kamehameha I, the 18th-century king who unified
the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Against her family's wishes, the princess married an American
adventurer and banker named Charles Bishop, and when she died
childless in 1884, left over 400,000 acres of royal lands in trust
to create a school.
</P>
<P>
   The princess wanted her bequest to benefit native Hawaiians,
whose population had been decimated by diseases brought by white
settlers. She did not specify that the school should give
preference to native Hawaiian children, but that has been its
policy in practice over the years, and this has itself sparked
controversy and drawn the attention of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 115 years, the estate was land-rich and
cash-poor, but in the early 1980s, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
state law that forced the trust to sell off land to homeowners who
had leased it for years, generating a huge cash windfall for
investment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the estate has been dominated by the state's
all-Democratic political establishment. One of the ousted trustees,
Henry Peters, is the former speaker of the state House of
Representatives, while another, Richard Wong, is the former
president of the state Senate. A third, Lokelani Lindsey, is a
former public school official and mayoral candidate from Maui,
while Gerard Jervis, who tried to take an overdose of sleeping
pills, is a close friend of former Gov. John Waihee.
</P>
<P>
   Only Oswald Stender, the trustee who secretly helped the
attorney general fight his colleagues and resigned voluntarily, had
experience managing another large, for-profit land trust here _ and
only he is a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools.
</P>
<P>
   The bill of particulars against the majority trustees is
extensive, and ranges from a lack of a coherent professional
management system to accusations of irresponsible and self-dealing
investments that shortchanged the school, while enriching the
trustees and passing lucrative business to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   That is a particularly sensitive charge since native Hawaiian
children are often underprivileged and lack access to adequate
education.
</P>
<P>
   Peters and Wong both face criminal charges related to an alleged
kickback scheme involving estate land. Mrs. Lindsey was permanently
removed from her trustee post by a state judge in a mismanagement
suit brought by Stender and Jervis just one day before Probate
Court Judge Kevin Chang ordered the interim removal of the trustees
in favor of a special panel he had named earlier when the IRS
refused to conduct negotiations with the incumbent trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The majority trustees contend that they have managed the
estate's investments wisely, and point to the $600 million the
trust made last week, just days before their ouster, as a result of
the initial public stock offering of Goldman, Sachs, the Wall
Street investment partnership, in which the estate had held a 10
percent stake. They also accuse the IRS, which has been auditing
the estate for nine years, of prejudgment without due process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was living in Russia,'' Mrs. Lindsey said in a
telephone interview. ``I'm just completely floored by the
heavy-handedness of the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   But the implications of the controversy reach well beyond the
trustees themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the trust that's broken,'' said Ms. Bronster,
the former attorney general, who since her ouster has been stopped
on the street and thanked by strangers and even received a $25
Neiman-Marcus gift certificate of gratitude from a woman she had
never met. ``I think it's the whole political culture of the
island. It takes people a long time to anger here, but I'm hopeful
that this will be the beginning of something important, that people
will not stand for disconnection and arrogance in their
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Beadie Kanahele Dawson, a longtime local lawyer who helped a
Kamehameha alumni group organize its campaign against the trustees
two years ago after Mrs. Lindsey angered school officials by
interceding in day-to-day school affairs, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This political disease that has permeated the boardroom of the
Bishop Estate also permeates our government,'' Mrs. Dawson said.
``And most of us know this, but we have been absolutely unable to
do anything about it. But I believe that the Bishop Estate
controversy _ a small in-group being benefited at the expense of
the larger group _ I believe that you're going to find in Hawaii a
much more passionate electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all local experts are so sure. Cayetano noted that it was
his Democratic administration that began the investigation, though
he readily acknowledged, ``This cannot endear anyone to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Boylan, a professor of history at the University of
Hawaii-West Oahu, said that he thought the current controversy was
mainly the result ``of a particularly bad board of trustees,'' and
that he was ``loath to make large predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may be harder to draw any bigger lessons,'' Boylan
said. ``I think only time is going to tell. I hope that what at
least comes out of this is that the estate goes to a professional
CEO form of governance and the trustees are paid a relative
pittance.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems assured. A special court-appointed master has already
recommended such a course, and last week the probate court judge
scolded the ousted trustees for failing to follow through.
Similarly, the process of selecting trustees, long a focus of
controversy, seems certain to change.
</P>
<P>
   In her will, the princess stipulated that the trustees should be
chosen by a majority of the justices of the state Supreme Court,
which at the time was also the probate court. But in recent years,
that practice has led to the appointment of politically connected
insiders like Peters and Wong, and since the controversy erupted, a
majority of the current justices have said they will no longer
participate in selecting trustees.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the probate court in charge. Chang's order last
week gave the interim trustees _ a group of respected citizens
including a retired admiral and the former Honolulu police chief _
or the attorney general's office 90 days to seek permanent removal
of the ousted trustees, and that is expected to happen. The IRS has
already told the interim trustees that permanent removal is a
non-negotiable condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter,'' Roth said, ``the five trustees are
out for good. They're never, ever going to be back in their
offices.''

PATAGONIA: WEDDED TO ITS MORAL IMPERATIVES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLEN LEAF LAKE, Calif. _ Here amid the snow-covered pines near
Lake Tahoe, Patagonia Inc. held its fourth annual weekend training
conference last month. In what one participant called a ``summer
camp for tree-huggers,'' community organizers in various
environmental causes came from far and wide to learn how to be more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   David Olsen, chief executive of Patagonia, the trendsetter in
specialty outdoor clothing, told the 70 or so participants, ``We've
invited you here because we want you to raise hell and we support
you in raising hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for elegantly simple product design, Patagonia, based in
Ventura, Calif., has long practiced environmental responsibility
quietly, converting its buildings to wind power, eliminating toxic
dyes from its products and making baby clothes from fabric scraps
left over from the adult line. But now the privately-held company's
owners have renounced that reticence. It's their business, and
they've decided to use it as their soapbox, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out of the closet,'' said Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia's
president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spring catalog, mailed to 725,000 people
worldwide, takes a stand on an issue way beyond the clothing realm:
removal of dams in five areas around the country, including the
Snake River of Washington. All six of its board members recently
demonstrated to save an ancient redwood forest in Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Patagonia is risking its brand name and reputation on
an unusual brand of corporate philanthropy. Rather than just
writing checks to local charities, it is training activists and
taking bold positions.
</P>
<P>
   That can alienate customers, of course. Patagonia's latest
crusade was criticized as a ``biased and misleading diatribe'' by
Francois X. Forgette, an official of the Tri-City Area Chamber of
Commerce in Kennewick, Wash., which could suffer economically if
four dams on the lower Snake River were razed. Forgette called for
a boycott of Patagonia and suggested that the company ``stick to
its knitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard says it is. He considers environmentalism a
fundamental part of the company's image, and when he saw that
reputation shifting toward rivals, he decided to increase company
efforts. This comes even as some of Patagonia's early innovations,
like spinning fleece from recycled soda bottles, are being
jettisoned by others that had copied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Patagonia gets out there and talks about it, they won't
be an exemplar,'' said Chris L. Desser, a Patagonia board member
and a recent appointee to the California agency that regulates
coastal development. ``Most companies are wholly driven by the
bottom line, but Patagonia is not going to sacrifice the
environment for the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Although environmental good deeds would seem to burnish a
company's image with many potential customers, donations to
environmental causes may not rank very high. Among foundations,
grants to such causes make up just 2 percent of all financing,
according to the Foundation Center.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable soul-searching among Patagonia's managers
over whether the company should seek to use its environmental ethic
as a corporate guide, Chouinard said. ``We don't want to be accused
of green marketing'' _ trying to profit from the appearance of
doing the right thing _ Chouinard said. But a big change swept in a
year ago, after Patagonia commissioned its first customer survey.
Executives were appalled to find Patagonia was seen as dead last
among outdoor companies considered environmental leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company's environmentalism may not be helping. The
privately held company had sales of $165 million in the fiscal year
ended April 1998. It does not report profits, but there are signs
that they have been flat. The company donates 1 percent of revenue,
or 10 percent of pretax profits, whichever is higher, to local
environmental groups, and that figure has held steady at about $1.2
million for the last three years. The company may also have been
hurt because it failed to capitalize on two popular sports, indoor
rock climbing and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   But Olsen, Patagonia's chief, is unconcerned. ``A lot of
environmental things we're going to do whether they give us a
benefit in the market or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the company is committed to is the ``tree hugger''
camps. The youthful local organizers paid their own way to the
three-day event, which cost Patagonia about $60,000. Seasoned
organizers shared secrets of fund-raising, marketing and building
membership. Their environmental causes ranged from buffalo herds to
logging.
</P>
<P>
   Patagonia suppliers are also subject to environmental
evangelism, pressed by the company to show ecological gains or risk
losing Patagonia's business.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has met with some resistance from suppliers who
``thought it wasn't a level playing field,'' said Rob C. Koeppel,
vice president of Shawmut Mills, a division of R.H. Wyner
Associates, a maker of laminated fabrics. He said offshore
suppliers could more easily show environmental progress because of
lower standards.
</P>
<P>
   A private company, though, can afford to pursue moral
imperatives since it need not cater to shareholders, an argument
Chouinard said he's heard numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced everything we do does benefit the
company,'' Chouinard said, before leaving for mountain climbing in
Tibet. ``Most companies give money to the symphony. It's safe. When
other companies see nothing bad comes of it,'' he said of
Patagonia's advocacy, ``they'll be emboldened. It's not going to
come back to bite us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Loretta Lynn's concert Thursday night at Town Hall,
her first show here in more than a decade, was a reminder of what
country music was like before it embraced video clips, smoke bombs,
power chords and line dancing. It was a homey concert: part shtick,
part spontaneity, trusting in personality rather than spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynn chatted with the audience, and she built her set from
whims and requests. ``Anything you want me to sing,'' she
announced. ``Just tell me the first line.''
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1960s through the '70s, Ms. Lynn was a queen of
country music. With her Kentucky drawl, her tightly wound vibrato
and a way of letting a dramatic crescendo leap out of lines that
start casually, Ms. Lynn sang above all about not being taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Her songs, including many that she wrote, were about fighting
for her man and about a neglected woman's temptation to stray; she
demanded respect in songs like ``Don't Come Home a-Drinkin' (With
Lovin' on Your Mind).'' And when ``women's lib'' arrived, she
hitched her inborn feistiness to a broader social current. ``Time
to change and I'm demanding satisfaction, too,'' she declared in
``We've Come a Long Way Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynn quickly sized up the audience, which was calling for
songs like ``Fist City'' and ``You Ain't Woman Enough.'' This
wasn't a crowd that wanted homilies about true love. Ms. Lynn
followed ``One's on the Way,'' about a pregnant housewife watching
big-city glitter from afar, with ``The Pill,'' about ``tearing down
your brooder house.'' She sang ``Red, White and Blue,'' about a
scorned half-Indian ``half-breed,'' and ``Your Squaw's on the
Warpath,'' about a wife who was fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Not all men were bad in her songs; there was always her father,
celebrated in ``Coal Miner's Daughter.'' And she sang about a
woman's loneliness in ``Somebody Somewhere,'' ``Blue Kentucky
Girl'' and ``When the Tingle Becomes a Chill.'' In her first hit,
``I'm a Honky-Tonk Girl,'' lines like ``I've lost everything in the
world'' sounded utterly bereft, ringing with the sound of a woman
whose broken heart had led her into a hopeless downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynn's voice is still strong; it's less girlish than it is
on her old recordings, yet rich with wounded longing. Her band, the
Coal Miners, seemed ready to cruise through any song in her
repertory; it played with the restrained aplomb of Nashville,
Tenn., professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Between songs Ms. Lynn explained that she was off the road for
five years during her husband's long final illness, but has been
working on a new album. She tried some cornball banter with her son
Ernest Ray. And like the character based on her in Robert Altman's
``Nashville,'' she rambled, taking on subjects like her Las Vegas
years and Sinead O'Connor's shaven head. From an era when country
prided itself on being regular folks' music, Ms. Lynn didn't put on
airs; she just let her songs tell their stories of pride and
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the concert was Brad Paisley, a 26-year-old songwriter,
singer and skillful lead guitarist who shows the smarter, less
bombastic side of current Nashville. His specialty is spurned-lover
songs, from the singles-bar rejection of ``Me Neither'' to the
stalker mentality of ``It Never Would've Worked Out Anyway'' to his
self-pitying hit ``Who Needs Pictures.'' Even his inevitable
soft-rock ballad, ``He Didn't Have to Be,'' had a modern twist: it
was a thank-you song from a single mother's son to his stepfather.

FROM ADDICT TO EDUCATOR IN HARLEM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blossom Martin was once bound for college and career. But by
1991, she said, she had become so consumed by alcohol and drugs
that she lost her job, was evicted from her apartment and landed on
welfare. And her two children had been living in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back was no snap. The course she has followed to
establish a new career, earn a college degree and win back her
children demonstrates both the difficulties and rewards of
recovery. Now, as director of a privately financed after-school
program in Manhattan, her purpose is to help others who are down
and out _ or could become so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blossom has a lot of valuable skills gained from her life
experience that can help her students,'' said the Rev. Leroy
Ricksy, director of the East Harlem Urban Center, the parent
organization for Ms. Martin's employer, the Booker T. Washington
Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Martin graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in
East Harlem in 1974, she wanted to be a doctor. She was accepted by
City College, but, discouraged by what she called bureaucracy and
administrative foul-ups, she never enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   A job as a bookkeeper for an after-hours bar eventually spiraled
into a life of drug and alcohol abuse, she said. The city's Bureau
of Child Welfare placed her two small children in foster care in
1985. Six years later, she had hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It was then, at the age of 35, that Ms. Martin decided to
reclaim her life. ``It just gradually occurred to me that I'd
rather spend my money on things other than drugs _ for instance,
paying the rent and buying clothes for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She enrolled at Touro College on East 123d Street and entered a
substance abuse program, taking almost two years to fully beat her
addictions. ``Many people still think that addiction can be
overcome in a few weeks or months,'' she said. ``It takes years.
It's a struggle every day.'' After Ms. Martin's second year at
Touro, her children, who had been in foster care for eight years,
were returned to her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she earned a bachelor's degree in human services. She
moved from welfare to workfare as a groundskeeper for the city's
Housing Department. Having met and impressed Ricksy, whose agency
ran her drug rehabilitation program, with her work as a volunteer
student counselor, she was hired a year later at the Booker T.
Washington center, on East 101st Street, and left public assistance
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The center operates a private, all-day preschool, an
after-school educational program for children in nearby public
schools and a full-time summer program. Most of the center's
support comes from New York City businesses like the Dover Corp.
and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   All the children receive a big helping of Ms. Martin's tough
love. ``Every child in this community has been affected in some way
by drugs, and as a result they thrive on consistency and
structure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the summer program as well, several months
after her hiring, Ms. Martin informed administrators and students
that its emphasis would be on education, not just supervised play.
</P>
<P>
   ``By coming here for the summer, these children are essentially
going to school all year, and I assure you that they're very happy
to learn every day,'' she said. ``There's plenty of time for fun
and games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, who is also a volunteer tutor at Public School 50,
visits her learning-center students' parents or other care
providers regularly, to seek their involvement. ``I truly believe
we can turn the public school system around with a more organized
coalition of parents, community organizations and the private
sector,'' she said. ``The school has computers. It has money. What
they need is more community involvement _ not something you get by
shuffling students around.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers her mother's volunteer work for the Head Start
program in 1968. ``They would go into the homes and see what was
going on and so were able to connect the family with outside
resources and community services,'' Ms. Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   She argues for smaller classes, organized after-school
supervision until 6 p.m. for all students, and year-round
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Martin's own children are proud of her, she is just as
proud of them. Last month her son, Matthew, 15, took part in a
school project, a Web site called ``Harlem Live,'' which recently
became part of a permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution.
Her daughter, Jamilla, 18, is completing the learning center's
computer course.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin's next step is to earn her master's degree in
education. She hopes to work eventually as a teacher or an
administrator in the public school system _ as an agent of change. &QL;

DUKE CLEARED TO CONTINUE FEDERALLY FUNDED HUMAN EXPERIMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A four-day-old ban on federally financed human experiments at
Duke University Medical Center was lifted Friday after Duke
officials agreed to overhaul its protections for human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's license to conduct research on humans was suspended late
Monday, after the federal Office of Protection from Research Risks
found 20 violations of ethics and safety rules at the university
and said that Duke had failed to correct them over a period of
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ellis, chief of the ethics office, said in a telephone
interview Friday that Duke officials, who flew to Washington on
Thursday to meet with him, had presented a ``satisfactory
corrective action plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will monitor Duke closely over the next year or so to make
sure the plan is fully implemented,'' he said. ``This is the
beginning for Duke, not an ending.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they were pleased with the decision
and promised to strengthen its protections of human subjects,
starting with an overhaul of its Institutional Review Board, the
body that reviews each proposed human experiment at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know action is required of us now, but we are now committed
to developing a model IRB program,'' Dr. Edward W. Holmes, dean of
the School of Medicine at Duke, said in a telephone interview. ``It
will make the university stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the resolution produced Friday could and
should have come months earlier, but ``the important point now is
to look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Duke's plan, the university will have to make a complete
review of at least 274 experiments that had been approved by the
IRB, Holmes said, and possibly more. The university will also have
to retrain and educate each member of the review board, called the
Institutional Review Board, and put all experimenters who work with
human subjects through additional training as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis expressed relief that the negotiations went well and that
Duke's proposed plan is ``very good.'' He added that ``four months
of denial by Duke University Medical Center of inadequacies in
human subject protections finally ended this week. It is our
experience that some programs that have had problems like this in
the past have later become the best centers in terms of protection.
That could well be the case with Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Puglisi, at OPRR, said he believed that the most
important part of Duke's new plan is the extensive plans to educate
review board members and scientists. They will not only take
courses, but attended national conferences on human
experimentation, and have regular lectures on human experimentation
and the federal rules that govern it.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began for Duke late last year when the OPRR decided
to visit Duke University and conduct a routine examination of its
system for reviewing and approving human experiments. There are
about 2,000 such experiments there now, ranging from the testing of
new drugs and medical devices to behavioral research aimed at
improving patients' abilities to deal with illness.
</P>
<P>
   The OPRR, an agency of the Department of Health and Human
Services, monitors all human experiments carried out with federal
financing around the nation. They visited Duke at least partly
because Duke was the only one of the top 15 research universities
that they had not heard from for years. Most universities
periodically call with questions or to ask for advice.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators visited Duke in December 1998, they found an
array of irregular practices, most of them failures of Duke's
review board. The membership of the board was short on citizen
representation, meetings were apparently held and research approved
without most board members present, strict rules were apparently
waived with little discussion. There was no full-time employee at
the university to handle human experiment review. Informed consent
for the patients appeared to be less than the law requires,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But what was most startling to the investigators was that after
a long list of violations were given to Duke, Duke's response
seemed to be less than serious. Investigators pressed the
university several more times, but still got only limited attempts
to come into compliance with the law, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on Monday evening, OPRR notified the university that it
was going to suspend the federal government's permission to carry
on research with humans.

CLINTON EXPRESSES `SINCERE REGRETS' TO CHINESE PRESIDENT OVER
BOMBING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to mend damaged relations with China,
President Clinton expressed his ``sincere regrets'' Friday to
President Jiang Zemin for the accidental U.S. bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang finally accepted a telephone call from Clinton after a
week of refusing to speak to the president. The mistake, made
because intelligence officials used an outdated map, sparked four
days of rock-throwing protests outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
in orchestrated demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president once again expressed his sincere regrets and
condolences to President Jiang and the Chinese people concerning
the tragic accident of last week. The president expressed his
desire that we move beyond this tragic accident in our
relationship,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and China became strained
when a B-2 Stealth bomber fired three missiles into the Chinese
Embassy on May 7, killing three Chinese journalists and injuring 20
people. The CIA used an old map that failed to identify the
three-year-old embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Jiang took the opportunity to express his views. I
will, obviously, leave it to him to do that,'' Lockhart said,
declining to review Jiang's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart termed the conversation ``constructive.'' The two also
briefly discussed the status of China's request to join the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of furious Chinese, throwing rocks and paint,
pelted the U.S. embassy this week, trapping U.S. Ambassador James
Sasser, two aides and eight Marine guards inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government repeatedly suggested the bombing of their
embassy was intentional and demanded an investigation by the United
States. The Chinese government also delayed reports of apologies
from the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Sunday sent a private letter to Jiang to apologize
for the incident and requested a telephone conversation. Clinton
met with the Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing on Thursday. Li brought
a condolence book for Clinton to sign and told Clinton Jiang would
accept a telephone call.

MITCHELL DESERVES A SHOT AT SOMETHING BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ In ten months or less, we'll almost certainly
know who'll be the Democrats' next presidential nominee, and very
likely have the GOP nominee in our sights.
</P>
<P>
   The frontloading of delegate-selection and the vast cost of
mounting TV ad campaigns will slaughter or starve all but the most
robust of candidacies. To remain viable, Bill Bradley, the lone
Democrat challenging Vice President Al Gore, will probably have to
win either the Iowa caucuses or New Hampshire's early-February
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Because if the former New Jersey senator _ a sort of taller Paul
Tsongas with a hook shot, with his pro-business, anti-interest
group politics _ cannot win somewhere early, he probably cannot win
anywhere. Then his money evaporates. Gore, so well-heeled an
incumbent VP, so bolstered by unions and Democratic party interest
groups, can survive an early loss or two; Bradley cannot.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11-candidate GOP side, Texas Governor George Bush is as
lopsided an early favorite as Gore, but questions will be raised
about his mettle and staying power until he wins some big-state
primaries and puts the crowded field behind him. But if you had to
pick the likely nominees now, you'd have to say Gore and Bush. So:
who runs with them?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond having suggested previously that Mrs. Elizabeth Dole has
more of a political future as someone else's running mate than she
does as a 62-year old first-time candidate in a party that hasn't
nominated a rookie for the top spot since Eisenhower in '52,
there's no way to get a handle on the GOP second spot.
</P>
<P>
   But I do have a notion for either Gore or Bradley. And that is
to go beyond the traditional ticket-balancing act that tries to
split the difference within your own party's competing interest
groups. There are the traditional yardsticks _ number of electoral
votes in the running mate's home state, acceptance to broad swaths
of the electorate, past positions that do not alienate deep pools
of independent or swing voters, and compatability with the top dog,
and, increasingly important, with the Top Dog's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly conceivable that Gore could wind up offering the
No. 2 spot to Bradley, particularly if Bradley departs on a high
note after a gentlemanly campaign of lofty issue-oriented debate
without snotty asides or savage TV spots. But if either Gore or
Bradley cannot stand the other after their mano-a-mano primary
bout, the victor would do well to consider:
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell of Maine. The former Senate Majority Leader
comes from the wrong end of the electoral vote scale; Maine has but
4, to 54 for the colossus of the west, California, whose senior
senator, Diane Feinstein, is lobbying hard for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But having raised that, Mitchell has few negatives, and a
hatfull of positives. First and foremost, he is an experienced and
reassuring figure, known to everyone in politics at the national
level, and generally admired by all but the most embittered
Republican insiders, who still blame him for forcing President
George (``Read my lips!'') Bush to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's role in brokering three years of peace talks in
Northern Ireland put him on the world stage, in Nobel Peace Prize
territory. Mitchell is broadly acceptable to virtually all
Democrats and most independents _ and not a few Republican voters.
The journalism community, save the usual right-wing suspects, has
high regard for his probity and judgment. His moral character is
unquestioned. He's divorced and remarried, with a young son, but
without any hint of tarnish.
</P>
<P>
   Since he has an affiliation with a Maine law firm where one of
my brothers is a partner, I won't rattle on about his career after
15 years in the Senate. But there is one more thing to say before
this letter of recommendation goes into the data base: Mitchell
knows how to run for vice president. He's been there. In 1968, a
disastrous campaign year for Democrats, Mitchell was a young lawyer
who carried the issues briefcase for Edmund Muskie, his political
mentor, a former Senator and later Secretary of State to Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Muskie was Hubert Humphrey's sane and sensible choice for
running mate in the year LBJ resigned, Bobby Kennedy died, Gene
McCarthy flamed out and Nixon won. Paired against Spiro Agnew, the
godfather to Pat Buchanan and William Safire, among others, Muskie
beat the bushes, hitting all the secondary cities that are the
obligatory stops of running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching his man in hotel rooms and on plane and bus rides,
Mitchell barnstormed the nation in a manner known only to national
political candidates and old-line vaudevillians.
</P>
<P>
   I covered that campaign for the Associated Press, as Mitchell
discovered firsthand how a Maine accent, some Down Home jokes, wry
self-deprecation, and a shrewd assessment of the local political
winds can make for a savvy and successful campaign as running mate.
Gore or Bradley could do a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell spoke here at the Portland Library recently about
his new book on the Irish peace process, he assured the crowd that
after 15 years in the Senate, ``I can speak at any length, on
almost any topic,'' but the ensuing laughter does not erase the
fact that at the level of running for national office, the ability
to project intelligent and articulate political rhetoric is a
godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle didn't have it; Jack Kemp barely managed it;
Geraldine Ferraro never mastered the art. Spiro Agnew was never an
asset. Running mates can't win you many votes, but they can lose
you a ton. When I mentioned to a leading Democratic congressional
figure the possibility of a Mitchell-for-Vice President gambit, he
said: ``I've heard people in Washington talking about George as a
possible Secretary of State.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the right kind of neighborhood from which to pluck a
running mate.

ONE BIG WAVE, COME AND GONE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Internet mania in full bloom, stock markets hitting
record levels, and the economic expansion in its ninth year, there
is a lot of talk of a ``new economy.'' Nor is it only talk. Last
week the US economy posted its second consecutive quarterly
productivity gain of 4 percent _ highly welcome after a couple of
decades of much slower growth, and virtually unprecedented for so
late in a business cycle. No wonder central bankers are worriedly
wondering whether the rules of sound monetary policy have changed.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Federal Reserve Board chairman as much as told
an audience of bankers in Chicago earlier this month that he
thought the rules (itals)had(unitals) changed, somewhat. The Fed's
forecasts of inflation and growth in business activity had been
``generaly off'' in recent years, said Greenspan, inflation on the
high side, growth on the low, apparently because of increasing
efficiency throughout the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected productivity growth ``reflects _ at least in part
_ a more deep-seated, still-developing shift in our economic
landscape,'' said Greenspan. The rest of the speech is a
fascinating review of the evidence _ ``compelling, if not
conclusive,'' according to the chairman _ ``for a technology-driven
rise in the prospective rate of return on new capital and an
associated acceleration in labor productivity.'
</P>
<P>
   No central banker likes to be understood to say ``it's different
this time'' _ especially one who barely two years ago counselled
against the ``irrational exuberance'' in the markets, when the Dow
was at 6500. So two weeks before his Chicago speech, Greenspan
summoned a couple dozen of the nation's top productivity experts to
Washington to air the issue before the Board of Governors of the
Fed. A lively exchange of views was the result.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that the expert he most needed to hear wasn't there _
and that the most provocative overview of the productivity puzzle
in a decade wasn't on the Fed's great table.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Gordon, professor of economics at Nortwestern
University, is a leading authority on macroeconomics and quality
change _ an expert on, among other things, teasing out of the
Sears, Roebuck catalog over the years fascinating insights into
nature of economic change.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Gordon has been doodling a hand-drawn chart on
whatever page came to hand to make the argument that increased
productivity percolated through the US economy in ``one big wave,''
starting in the first years of the 20th century and petering out at
the end of the 1960s. In a pair of papers written last year,
summarized in a short article in the May issue of the American
Economic Review, Gordon has written down the argument and
illustrated it with a new appeal to the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to explain,'' says Gordon, ``is not why
productivity growth has been slow over the last 25 years, but why
it was so fast between 1915 and 1965.'' The answer, he thinks, is
that there was a ``golden age'' of growth in those years, in
contrast to a slower, more normal situation before and since.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Gordon believes the inventions of the late 19th and early
20th century were ``more fundamental creators of productivity''
than are the devices of the electronic-Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   He classifies these inventions in four clusters, or possibly
five, following his Northwestern colleague Joel Mokyr's argument
that the public health movement (sanitation, vaccination,
cleanliness) had far-reaching economic effects. Gordon also cites
the development of:
</P>
<P>
   _ Electricity (including electric motors, electric light,
consumer appliances);
</P>
<P>
   _ Internal combustion engines (motor transport, air transport,
superhighways, supermarkets, suburbs);
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rearranging molecules'' (petrochemicals, plastics,
pharmaceuticals);
</P>
<P>
   _ Communications/entertainment (telephone, radio, movies,
television).
</P>
<P>
   Applications of each of these four innovations had the effect of
greatly increasing human capacity to do work, Gordon says. In
contrast, computers so far have failed to have comparable impact
because computers have to interact with human beings. Human beings
are bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is an increasing mismatch between the
clockspeed of computers and the finger speed of operators who use
them to write documents and create spreadsheets, says Gordon. More
bandwith doesn't mean faster thought. Moreover, he says, they
haven't built the cpmputer yet that can replace a human at any
number of demanding tasks: surgeon, pilot, truck driver,
small-scale assembly of manufactured items.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what we are seeing now is ``second-order'' innovation,
according to Gordon: the VCR, for example, which combines movies
with television but doesn't have the fundamental impact of either
invention. ``Enthusiasts of the Internet might consider that the
computer has not created the paperless society but rather a
duplication of electronic activities, all of which generate paper..
. .''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the '90s, the reigning interpretation of the
expected contribution of information technology has been that of
Oxford University economist Paul David's 1990 paper, ``The Computer
and the Dynamo.'' That extended analogy between the introduction of
electricity and present-day computing argued that a delayed impact
on productivity was to be expected, since while electricity was
widely introduced in the 1880s, it wasn't until the 1920s that
business managers figured out how to effectively harness the new
power with small motors.
</P>
<P>
   It is against that interpretation that Gordon's ``one big wave''
hypothesis will be set. Eventually, new models of ``general purpose
technologies'' developed by economists bent on measuring growth and
``creative destruction'' will help sort out the issues. Most
analysts in the meantime will prefer to work on various
microeconomic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greenspan has a problem _ rein in the economy or let
it go, in the hope that the next two years will be like the last?
If they are not _ if it turns out that low inflation has less to do
with technological change than it does with widespread belief in
Greenspan's mastery _ then the Fed chairman could make a costly
mistake by buying into the productivity acceleration tale. A couple
of quarters of gains in an ill-understood statistic don't mean much
by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe the Fed has begun to prepare the the
banking structure for tighter money in the fall. Spencer England, a
Boston-based investment strategist, is among them. It's beginning
to feel like 1987, says England.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months preceding the 1987 crash, the market surged
15 percent despite sharply deteriorating liquidity, England notes.
Unlike 1987, wage growth today is moderate, the dollar strong and
the Fed is talking about ``the current wave of technology.'' Then
again, it wouldn't be the first time the Fed said one thing and did
another.

MRS. CLINTON VISITS KOSOVO REFUGEES IN MACEDONIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Hillary Rodham Clinton swept through
Macedonia on Friday on a visit that illustrated the Clinton
administration's continuing struggle to balance the diverse strands
of its Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a refugee camp appearance so carefully scripted that
administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would
speak with, the first lady commiserated with Kosovo's expelled
masses. After hearing refugees' accounts of their flight from
Kosovo, she said their plight reminded her of movie depictions of
the Holocaust like ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not intend to let the evil Milosevic has perpetrated
against these people keep them away from their homeland and
homes,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``That is a fundamental goal of the
United States and its allies.''
</P>
<P>
   While expressing sympathy for the refugees, however, Mrs.
Clinton went out of her way to avoid offending Macedonian
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Macedonians, who make up roughly two-thirds of this
country's population, generally oppose NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia. They also fear that if ethnic Albanians _ who made up
roughly one third of Macedonia's population before the crisis _
continue to pour in from Kosovo, Macedonians will be reduced to a
minority in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   So although Mrs. Clinton spent the morning addressing the
suffering of the refugees, she spent the rest of the day trying to
defuse any anti-American sentiment and to bolster Macedonia's
fragile coalition government, a mix of Macedonian and Albanian
parties.
</P>
<P>
   She toured a 16th-century church containing the tomb of Goce
Delchev, the father of Macedonian independence, and met with
President Kiro Gligorov and Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
Although human rights groups have criticized the Macedonian
government for at times blocking Kosovo Albanians from entering its
territory and other callous treatment of refugees, Mrs. Clinton
praised Macedonia for its generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for people in my country and elsewhere to put
themselves in the position of the refugees,'' she said, sounding a
theme she repeated throughout the day, ``but also in the position
of the Macedonian people, who have responded as they have in the
last weeks. I'm very grateful to them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But for both Macedonians and Albanians, the essential issue
remains when the roughly 200,000 refugees here might return to
Kosovo. When a refugee pressed this issue with Mrs. Clinton on
Friday morning, her answer was both reassuring and vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying very hard to permit you to return to your homes
in safety,'' she said. ``That's what my husband, the United States
government and the NATO allies are trying to accomplish.''

GUARANTEED-JOB EXPERIMENT YIELDS EVIDENCE OF THE ENDURING NATURE OF
POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Imagine what would happen if society could guarantee
every poor person a path from poverty: an assured job at a
sufficient wage with child care and health care as well. How many
would take it? How many would prosper?
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, an eccentric band of reformers here set out to
find the answer, and their discoveries offer an unsettling new look
at the prospects of low-income families at a time of a vast
national exodus from welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee experiment with guaranteed jobs, called Project
New Hope, came to its scheduled close this week. It leaves behind
the most comprehensive study of poor families of the post-welfare
age, with data on everything from parents' earnings to the number
of hours their children watch television.
</P>
<P>
   The program is widely being called a success, and it did have a
modest impact in some statistical terms. But a close look at the
findings, assembled by an independent team of economists,
psychologists and ethnographers, suggests that inner-city poverty
may be even harder to alleviate than is generally understood.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope recruited 677 low-income adults and made them a simple
offer: sign up here, work 30 hours a week and your family will no
longer be poor.
</P>
<P>
   But only 27 percent of the main target group stuck with their
jobs long enough to work their way out of poverty. Their average
annual earnings were just $6,600, statistically no better than a
control group of poor people not in the program.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the conventional view that going to work makes
low-income adults feel better about themselves, New Hope
participants showed no declines in depression and no growth in
self-esteem, when compared with a control group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even after two years in the program, the average
participant still registered levels of depression above the
threshold that most psychologists consider cause for clinical
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that kept people from maintaining steady employment
comprise a catalog of inner-city ills: drug and alcohol abuse;
jealous or violent boyfriends and husbands; conflicts with
employers; unreliable baby sitters and cars, and generally flagging
spirits. In addition, some participants said they preferred to work
less and spend more time with their families, even if it meant
staying poor.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope's admirers acknowledge the persistence of low earnings
and high poverty rates. But they say the program still shows ways
to help low-income families work somewhat more and suffer somewhat
less. New Hope's generous subsidies produced demonstrable, if
modest, gains in access to health insurance and formal child-care
settings. The guaranteed jobs reduced the number of people who
never worked at all. And by complementing paychecks with wage
supplements, New Hope raised total ``earnings-related income'' by
16 percent, to about $8,100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise finding, it also appeared to improve the classroom
performance and educational aspirations of its participants'
children, though only among boys. In describing that effect,
evaluators said its statistical magnitude was roughly equal to
adding 100 points to a score on the Scholastic Assessment Test. By
the standards of social experiments, that is an unusually large
improvement, and it has already provoked interest among academics
who study poor children, though they are unsure what caused it or
how long it will last.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for inner-city adults, the main target of the nation's
strict new welfare laws, the news remains sobering. Even with a
guaranteed job at a subsidized wage, 73 percent of the target group
failed to shed poverty without additional support from welfare or a
second earner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had the opportunity to work full-time, and yet they
didn't do it,'' said Michael Wiseman, an economist at the Urban
Institute, a Washington research group, who served on New Hope's
advisory board. ``We've discovered something new that I think is
distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The results challenge conventional wisdoms across the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that poor people may have less success than
conservatives have predicted in replacing welfare with work. But
they also suggest the reasons many people fail to work stretch far
beyond the economic barriers _ low wages and scarce jobs _ that
many liberals have stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman said the results particularly ``call into question the
shortage of jobs as the explanation for poverty,'' since
participants failed to work-full time even when subsidized jobs
were assured.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope was not technically a welfare-to-work program since it
included people not on welfare. Indeed, if anything, it offers a
best-case look at the prospects of those now leaving the rolls. It
operated in Milwaukee's unusually strong economy. It worked with
low-income volunteers who had more work experience than the average
welfare recipient. And it offered them unusually generous benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even counting informal work, like baby-sitting or
hair-dressing, the average participant reported working just 27
hours a week, or about 10 percent more than members of a control
group. In a world where anti-poverty programs often produce no
gains at all _ or even bring negative consequences _ these modest
results are being treated, curiously, as resounding good news.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Stewart, who runs the welfare program for Republican Gov.
Tommy Thompson, said it ``validates our belief that a work-based
social contract'' will ``help reduce poverty in the years ahead.''
Olivia Golden, who oversees welfare programs for President Clinton,
said New Hope had brought ``very impressive results in helping
families stay in jobs and improve the well-being of children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New Hope grew from a series of conversations in the early 1980s
between David Riemer, a zealous advocate of public jobs, and his
friends John Gardner and Julie Kerksick, husband-and-wife union
organizers then working with the United Farm Workers. Gardner won
election to the Milwaukee school-board and became a prominent
supporter of public-school vouchers. Riemer and Kerksick became
early critics of the welfare system and advocates for public jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting everyone from the mayor to the head of the gas
company, they raised $17 million from corporate and government
sources. Conservatives liked New Hope because of its anti-welfare
ethos _ participants had to work to keep their benefits. Liberals
liked it because it guaranteed the jobs and subsidized the wages.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope created minimum-wage community service positions, such
as clerical jobs with non-profit groups, for people who could not
find private work. But for anyone working 30 hours a week, either
in private or community service jobs, New Hope added a cash
supplement to lift them above the government poverty threshold. For
a family of three, that threshold is now $12,802.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fund raising, the program began enrolling clients
in August 1994. Participants could keep their benefits for a
maximum of three years. To evaluate the results, New Hope hired
Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a private group based in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Kerksick, the program's director, said its full impact cannot be
seen merely by looking at averages. Some people were too troubled
to respond at all, she said. But for others, the menu of supports _
jobs, wage supplements, child care and health care _ made a marked
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at this and say, `Oh my God, look at all those
people in poverty,''' she said. ``Or we can look at this and say,
`Can you see any difference?' And you can see a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The research examines the program's findings on two groups.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, comprising two-thirds of the participants,
consisted of those working part-time or not at all when the program
began. This group most closely resembles those now leaving the
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A guaranteed job did help them work more. Only 6 percent
remained continuously unemployed over a two-year period, compared
with 13 percent of a control group. Likewise, while only 27 percent
of these New Hope participants worked their way out of poverty,
that is still better than the control group, where only 19 percent
did so.
</P>
<P>
   Kerksick noted these official estimates understate participants'
real-world income, since self-employment (like baby sitting) and
the earnings of others living in the same household. And, she said,
earnings are only part of the story. New Hope also reduced the
amount of stress participants reported and increased their access
to health insurance and child care. ``We were able to help people
in other ways that made their lives better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the modesty of the results illustrates the many
underlying problems. ``This shows it can take people years to
become steady workers, even when they are given a generous package
of jobs and subsidies,'' said Toby Herr, director of Project Match,
a Chicago employment program.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University,
said he was particularly struck by the high levels of depression
participants brought with them into the program. That supports the
notion that inner-city poverty is ``rooted in a underlying culture
of defeat,'' he said, rather than in the lack of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   New Hope also enrolled a second group: those already employed
full-time when they joined. For them, New Hope actually produced a
decline in total income of about 8 percent, to about $14,100.
Kerksick said this, too, may have been positive, since many entered
the program stressed by 50-hour work-weeks and second jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But others worried that the program may have slowed these
workers' advancement.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, for instance, their average hourly wage of
$7.28 was about 6 percent lower than that of a control group. ``It
conflicts with our hopes for advancement,'' Herr said.
</P>
<P>
   But Herr and many others were impressed with New Hope's apparent
effect on participants' sons. ``That's the big finding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When surveyed by psychologists, teachers ranked the New Hope
boys as significantly better behaved and academically skilled than
boys in a control group. And when surveyed themselves, the New Hope
boys were much more likely than those in a control group to say
they expected to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are unsure why this occurred. One theory is that the
boys may have benefited from better child care arrangements. With
New Hope's subsidies, the percentage of boys in formal child care
like Head Start or after-school programs grew to 60 percent, from
52 percent in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Herr credited the program's caseworkers for helping place
children in structured after-school settings, like scouts and boys
clubs. ``They had a broader vision of child care than most
programs,'' she said. ``This shows the importance of getting kids
into constructive, extra-curricular activities, even as parents
move in and out of work.'' The girls in New Hope families also
spent more time in formal child care.
</P>
<P>
   But they showed no classroom or behavioral improvements, partly
because they were already doing better than their male
counterparts. The program essentially raised the performance of
inner-city boys to the level of inner-city girls.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   What remains unknown is whether the boys, ages 6 to 12, will
continue their progress as they hit adolescence. ``It's certainly
not an unqualified, `Oh wow, we've solved all the problems,'' said
Aletha Huston, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who
helped evaluate the program. ``But these are striking findings for
the children.''

INJUNCTION LATEST SHOT IN BATTLE BETWEEN BC, DALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Mary Daly, a feminist theologian who refuses to admit
male students to her class, filed a court injunction against Boston
College Friday, asking a judge to bar university officials from
telling people she has retired.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction also seeks to block Boston College from
disseminating the school catalog, which does not list her courses.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College says Daly told them she planned to retire in
January. But Daly calls it a ``bold-faced lie,'' an attempt by the
school to get rid of an ``uppity woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thug behavior,'' Daly says. ``In effect, they're
firing a tenured professor.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest episode in this months-long battle has lined up
feminists who say Daly's teaching style would be compromised by
being forced to teach men in her classes who care more about her
destruction than the feminist theology she teaches. But her critics
call Daly a man-hater who has turned discrimination against men
into an intellectualized art form.
</P>
<P>
   University officials who thought they were close to an agreement
on a retirement package say Daly dropped the ultimate bomb by
taking the issue to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear to us. She agreed to retire,'' said BC
spokesman Jack Dunn. ``We have no intention of letting her renege
on her commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn called the lawsuit ``silly'' and said it's Daly's way of
seeking attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she doesn't have Boston College as the source of her
wrath, she misses the spotlight,'' Dunn said. Daly, he added, seeks
controversy because it helps her sell books.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of what she teaches, Daly, 70, is controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a pioneer in the radical feminist movement, Daly
believes that since religious structure is male-dominated, it is
abusive to women and, therefore, immoral. Her books _ which
include, ``Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' and
``Quintessence . . . Realizing the Archaic Future: A Radical
Elemental Feminist Manifesto'' _ are shocking to some, because Daly
advocates dismantling ``patriarchal'' religion.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has taught women-only classes at the Jesuit college for a
quarter century, but it was never an issue until last fall, when
senior Duane Naquin charged discrimination. Naquin sought the
backing of the Center for Individual Rights, a conservative
Washington, D.C., law firm that has successfully sued to end
affirmative action programs at public universities in Texas and is
currently suing Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a potential lawsuit, university officials asked Daly
to accept Naquin in her class. Instead, Daly requested a leave of
absence this spring but said she planned to return.
</P>
<P>
   At a Jan. 22 meeting, Dunn said, Daly agreed to retire. Daly
says that's not true and maintains that she has never signed any
retirement agreement. She has submitted her list of course
offerings for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and her lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness, devised a way to get
around accepting male students: She would teach only upper-level
courses restricted to students who have previously taken her
lower-level courses. Since those courses have been taken only by
female students, men would not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Daly will not go away quietly. Next
Wednesday, the Unitarian Universalist Association at 25 Beacon St.
will hold a ``speak-out'' from 5 to 7 p.m. to denounce the
university's position.
</P>
<P>
   She is also using other means to make her case public, including
an appearance April 13 on the television talk show ``Rosanne.''
</P>
<P>
   The university cannot get away with essentially firing a tenured
professor without due process, Van Ness argues. ``They have removed
her from the faculty through the back door.''

CHECKING THE `TO DO' LIST IN THE TREASURY HANDOFF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury,
was nominated last week to succeed his boss, Robert E. Rubin. When
Summers sits down for the first time at his new desk, he might find
a letter like this from his predecessor.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Larry: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you settle in, you might want to run over this list of
unfinished business. For all the talk of my having been the best
Treasury Secretary of the century (shucks), there remain some
explosive problems out there, scattered among the achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start on the plus side. I bequeath to you a strong and
sound banking and financial system. Most of us in the United States
take it for granted these days, but it is nonetheless an absolute
prerequisite for taking advantage of the global economy's
opportunities and weathering its turbulence. Unless you want us to
follow Japan into a deflationary spiral, don't let a credit problem
develop on your watch.
</P>
<P>
   I leave to you a close working relationship with Alan Greenspan
at the Federal Reserve. Fed chairmen and Treasury secretaries
haven't always gotten along, but you and Alan and I have not only
developed a good rapport, but we also basically agree on nearly
every big issue. On one where we don't _ whether Treasury should
cede some of its regulatory authority over banks to the Fed as part
of the financial services bill moving through Congress _ you should
consider conceding the point, as a signal that your partnership
with Alan is more important than a turf fight.
</P>
<P>
   When I took office, we assumed that federal budget deficits
would be with us for a long time. They are gone now, and you will
have a key role in determining how we use the surpluses that seem
likely to mount rapidly in coming years. If you hold the line and
don't allow the surpluses to be squandered, you may even have to
begin planning for something that no Treasury secretary in a
century has had to contemplate: Retiring the national debt,
possibly within a decade if you believe the rosier projections.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's turn to a few really complex issues. I've argued for
years in favor of keeping the dollar strong. It's always been a
tough sell in some quarters _ no doubt Ford, GM and Chrysler will
come a'knockin' again soon _ and it's not getting any easier with
our trade deficit heading rapidly higher.
</P>
<P>
   If that deficit goes totally out of control, there's going to be
pressure from all sides to bring the dollar down. Resist it. The
strong-dollar policy has helped dampen inflation and benefited
consumers by keeping the prices of imports relatively low, and it
has made the United States an attractive place for the rest of the
world to invest. And these days, we need price stability and
capital inflows a lot more than we need a few extra export sales at
the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the stock market. I have no idea whether it will
prove to be a boon or a curse for you. Alan frets over those
stratospheric valuations, but even he says they might just turn out
to be justified _ if the recent surge in productivity turns out to
be lasting. Then again, as Alan said in Chicago earlier this month,
no good thing goes on forever. Remember, my trader's instincts are
very strong, and they told me to get out of Washington while I was
still a hero to the 401(k) brigade.
</P>
<P>
   If all those matters don't keep you busy enough, there are a few
others that could steamroll you if you aren't careful. Russia and
China come to mind immediately.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to stretch to come up with nightmare scenarios
involving Russia. The good news is that by now, the Russian economy
has been reduced to insignificance, so its collapse probably would
not drag down anyone else with it. The bad news for you is that the
only approach we have to dealing with Russia involves throwing
money at Moscow. Doing that in some kind of prudent way without
enraging Congress is your responsibility now.
</P>
<P>
   China could be even trickier. No doubt you'll have a deal to
bring it into the World Trade Organization within a few months,
once the embassy bombing in Yugoslavia has blown over. But selling
a deal on Capitol Hill was going to be a tall order before we saw
those pictures of our ambassador, James Sasser, peering through the
broken glass in Beijing. It'll be even tougher now.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, it's an open question whether China's
leadership can continue to encourage development of a market
economy without releasing its authoritarian grip on power. The
implications for economic development and political stability
throughout Asia could be profound.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, it's probably silly for me to run through these issues,
since you're smarter than just about anyone in Washington.
Congratulations on learning to hide it; nothing irritates
Republicans more than a know-it-all Democrat from Harvard. You know
how to work the policy and political machinery within the
administration. If you can just learn to smile and tell them what
they want to hear on Capitol Hill, you'll do fine.
</P>
<P>
   Never forget that it's your signature on the dollar bill now _
and on that ghastly new 20. I'm going fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Your friend,
</P>
<P>
   Bob &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, organized labor has tried to counter the notion that
unionized companies deliver inferior returns. Soon, members of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and
other like-minded investors will be able to put their money where
their mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, State Street Global Advisors will introduce I.a.m.
Shares, a mutual fund that will invest primarily in companies that
employ the I.a.m.'s half-million members. While there are other
labor-friendly mutual funds, I.a.m. Shares may be the first to
focus on companies related to a single union, fund experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The union designed the fund as a way for its members to
diversify their holdings and to earn a good return, although it
will be open to the public as well. But the union also sees it as a
way to increase its leverage with management.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 25 percent of the 200,000 workers at Boeing
are I.a.m. members. R. Thomas Buffenbarger, the president of the
I.a.m., would like Boeing to give the union a seat on its board.
``If I just ask for it, why should they give it to me?'' he said in
a recent interview. ``But if I show them that we are significant
shareholders in the company, I will have a stronger case.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, he must persuade I.a.m. members and other
investors that the fund will do as well or better than the overall
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sleigh, a top I.a.m. strategist, came up with the idea
of I.a.m. Shares four years ago, but even he had doubts. To test
its plausibility, he created a ``fantasy index'' that included 40
companies with I.a.m. contracts, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin,
Harley Davidson and Northwest Airlines. Sleigh was surprised to see
that it outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   After selling Buffenbarger on the idea, Sleigh approached State
Street Bank, which has acted as trustee for the I.a.m.'s pension
fund for decades. He gave State Street a list of 360 public
companies that employ I.a.m. workers. State Street winnowed the
list to the 250 most promising stocks and back-tested their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   State Street would not disclose precise returns, but the results
were encouraging. Although the portfolio lagged behind the S&AMP;P 500
over a five-year period, it outperformed the index over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did it, it was easy for people to say, `Steve is
cooking the numbers,''' Sleigh said. ``But when State Street did
it, it really opened people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Fish, a principal at State Street, was also surprised by the
fund's pro forma record. ``We can run a portfolio that we think is
fairly attractive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors that manage I.a.m. pension funds have
committed about $60 million to the new fund. Fish said he expected
it to grow to about $100 million by the end of June, adding that it
could reach $500 million in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   At that size, I.a.m. Shares would not yet be a threat to
Fidelity Investments, but that is not the goal. The minimum
investment has been set high, at $10,000, to discourage small
investors and thereby to save on expenses. But the minimum will be
waived for workers at companies that employ I.a.m. members.
</P>
<P>
   The union will push hard to persuade I.a.m. companies to offer
the fund though their 401(k)s. ``A little over half of the members
have 401(k) plans, but in our analysis too much of their savings
are put into company stock,'' Sleigh said. ``We hope that this will
be a savings plan that our members can take advantage of to really
diversify their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's total expenses will be 0.65 percent of it assets,
less than half the industry average for United States diversified
stock funds. State Street will keep costs low by managing the fund
using computer models, which is the company's specialty. Sleigh's
list of companies has been narrowed to about 230, using
quantitative screens for numbers like expected earnings growth,
price-to-earnings ratios and yield. The three largest holdings will
be General Electric, Boeing and UAL, parent of United Airlines. The
weightings will be reviewed quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to insure diversification, State Street and the
union have agreed that as much as one-third of the fund can be in
companies without I.a.m. contracts; that will allow for holdings in
sectors like financial services, pharmaceuticals and high
technology that have scant union representation. But the I.a.m.
will be able to exclude any company it considers anti-labor.
</P>
<P>
   Since I.a.m. Shares was registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, other unions have expressed interest in
starting similar funds. But it is not clear how easy that would be.
Because I.a.m. workers are employed by a wide variety of businesses
_ including newspapers, airlines, automobile and aerospace
manufacturers and paper companies _ State Street could create a
fund that was broadly diversified. The sheet-metal workers might
have a harder time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Buffenbarger, the I.A.M president, is so
excited about the fund that he is thinking of investing some of his
own savings in it, even though he would have to meet the $10,000
minimum because he does not work for an I.a.m. company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can talk my wife into it,'' he said, ``we will take some
of the kids' college funds and do it, because I think it is a good
thing.''

NEW STUDENT PROTESTING IN CHINA OVER EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ They were back on the streets again this week _
screaming, chanting, hurling rocks, and burning flags.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every decade this century, students have been the match
that lit revolutionary movements or failed rebellions in China _
most recently in 1989, when troops crushed a student-led protest in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Several revolts began like this week's protests against the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade: as rage against foreign
powers. But they turned against Chinese leaders seen as weak or
impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous generations of activists, however, Chinese
students today are far more likely to give their government the
benefit of the doubt than to press it for change.
</P>
<P>
   Many students believe ``a movement that wants to change
everything at once could destroy this country,'' declared Jian Yi,
student union chairman at Beijing University, or ``Beida,'' the
birthplace of numerous revolutionary movements this century. ``This
is a big change from before.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1989 Tiananmen movement, he said, ``it had no chance
to survive. It was too early . . . Besides, democracy and freedom
are two different things. China will find its form of democracy
only through development.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students, like Jian, are more practical and
career-oriented, less idealistic and radical than their
predecessors. Dozens of students interviewed said they realize that
modernization cannot come overnight, so they are more patient with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the new generation is cynical and self-centered,
brainwashed and ignorant of China's painful history, and has sold
out the ideal of political freedom for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in attitudes among the new youth reflects an array of
fundamental changes that have washed over China in recent years.
The 1990s brought a second decade of Open Door policies, more
access to foreign products and ideas, rising incomes, and a steady
march toward a market-driven economy. Except for democracy, many
demands of the 1989 protesters have been met _ the right to choose
jobs after graduation, better living conditions, more choice in the
educational system, and an official campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 1980 edict limiting families to one child has
spawned a generation of ``little emperors,'' only children whose
newly prosperous parents have showered them with opportunities,
creating China's first generation of ``me-first'' college students.
</P>
<P>
   A Western scholar in Beijing who frequently visits college
campuses said students sometimes classify themselves as red hats,
black hats, or gold hats. Red hats want a Communist Party career,
and today are the smallest group. Black hats want an academic
career, and were probably the dominant group at the time of the
Tiananmen protests. Gold hats want to make money, and not
surprisingly, they are the largest group today.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is different from 10 years ago, so it's natural students
are different,'' said Liu Xiaojun, 26, a student at Beida. ``In the
'80s, students had lots of ideas, but it was just empty words. Now
China is more competitive and people are more practical, not just
sitting around and thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of looking-out-for-number-one is tempered, however,
by a deep-seated patriotism and an intense desire to make a weak
China stronger _ a common thread in student movements ever since
the May 4, 1919, protest against the transfer of German colonies in
China to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays we look at our role differently from previous
students. We think it's important to study harder and make
ourselves more useful. My goal is to get skills so I can be more
valuable for myself and my country,'' said Pan, a 19-year-old
chemistry student at the University of Science and Technology in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, increased access to foreign education,
travel, and the Internet have broadened students' exposure to
foreign ideas, but it has also made them critical of Western
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiananmen youth didn't know much about the outside world. They
believed the Voice of America and the BBC and were disillusioned
with their government,'' said Stanley Rosen, a political scientist
at the University of Southern California. ``Today's youth are much
more skeptical about the West's motives _ the West is looked upon
as self-serving in its attitude to human rights, and America is
seen as a world policeman attacking countries when it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pushing democracy in '89 are much more nationalistic
now. And the Chinese government is not distrusted and hated the way
it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because the economic and political chaos that
followed the collapse of the Soviet Union is regarded here as a
nightmare scenario of what could have happened if democracy
protesters had gotten their way in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crumbling of cradle-to-grave benefits and the
job-allocation system has meant that students can choose their jobs
and earn more money. But that freedom has made them more
competitive and goal-oriented, less interested in politics.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that a crisis does not get students and
campus organizations riled up. One need look no farther than ``San
Jiao Di,'' the triangle of bulletin boards at Beida that has long
been a window onto the thinking of the country's young elite.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the kiosks were plastered with hundreds of
anti-American and anti-NATO diatribes, as well as a memorial to the
three Chinese killed in the embassy bombing. One 3-D collage had
Coke and Pepsi cups spilling red paint to represent blood, and
called on students to boycott American products. Clinton was
depicted as a devil and denounced in obscenities. Hundreds of
students clustered around taking notes on their classmates' poems
and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   A scene from marches earlier this week was almost comical;
students nodded obediently while police read a list of ``no-nos''
(don't burn anything, don't destroy public property, don't let
non-students join your group), and marched a clearly marked
``parade route,'' chanting from a list of approved slogans. At the
end of the route, they purchased refreshments from an enterprising
woman selling ``Chinese Coke,'' ``Chinese beer,'' and ``Chinese
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The government may be pleased to have a handy bogeyman to
deflect student attention from 10th anniversary of the massacre of
democracy protesters near Tiananmen Square. But even if it were not
for the sudden coalescing of pro-government, nationalistic
feelings, Jian asserts that he knows of no one on his campus who is
preparing for any June 4 commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   But one former 1989 activist, now a graduate student, said that
despite their pragmatism, the students' dreams for the nation
remain the same as those of the May 4, 1919, activists, the first
major student movement of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have always thought we should destroy the old system
and establish a new way of thinking. But vested interests in China
are very strong, and . . . we're still facing the same problem: how
to develop our country, make it grow, make it more powerful,'' said
the 29-year-old science student at Beida. ``The ideal 80 years ago,
10 years ago, and now is the same. Just the circumstances are
different.''

KEY LEGISLATIVE PANEL APPROVES PARENT NOTIFICATION BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A compromise parental notification bill for
teens seeking abortions appears headed to the full Texas House
after gaining approval Friday from a key committee.
</P>
<P>
   The substitute for a measure that passed the Senate in March was
forged during tense and often fragile talks in the past few weeks
that nearly derailed at several bumps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call the situation volatile. This is a passionate
issue,'' House sponsor Rep. Dianne Delisi, R-Temple, said of the
measure's chances with the often unpredictable and emotionally
charged House members.
</P>
<P>
   The committee substitute for Senate Bill 30, which Gov. George
W. Bush backed this week, passed 11-1 in the much-awaited vote by
the House State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Caucus leader Ken Marchant of Coppell was absent
while Houston Democrats Sylvester Turner and Kevin Bailey
abstained. Democrat Debra Danburg of Houston, the abortion rights
champion who killed a similar measure two years ago, was the lone
dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, drafted by committee Chairman Steve Wolens,
D-Dallas, left activists on both sides of the abortion divide
complaining but won praise from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank and commend Chairman Wolens for reporting this
parental notification bill out of committee,'' Bush said. ``This is
an important step in the process, and I look forward to signing a
strong parental notification bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting such a measure into law is important to Bush, a GOP
presidential front-runner who had pledged to push for this
restriction on abortion for minors.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill would waive a two-day waiting period for
girls brought by parents for abortions, which pleases abortion
rights supporters. However, anti-abortion forces won their fight
that only a judge could decide if there is justification for a girl
not to tell her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is as strong as garlic,'' said Wolens, who not only
drafted it but voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else other than the cold, devoid, empty walls
of the courthouse for a minor girl to go to to face a bureaucrat
judge who most likely is going to see this poor girl as another
cause number that he's got to resolve in his long court docket for
the day,'' he added. ``This poor girl is going to be nothing more
than a cause number.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes in various socially conservative groups have never
fully trusted Wolens, and they object to the compromise for
offering doctors legal protections in the event criminal charges
are brought against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously not what we want,'' said Bill Price, president
of Texans United for Life. Yet, in the end, Price and a lawyer for
the National Right to Life Committee did not succeed in convincing
key legislators to kill the compromise or that it is an ``abortion
doctor protection bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens said he simply wanted to make sure a doctor could place a
sworn affidavit in a medical file if he had been told by a clerk at
the court or other official that it was OK to proceed with the
abortion. Having such documentation would prove critical if
criminal charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not kindergarten conduct that we're talking about,''
he said. ``This is something that will throw a doctor in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens, a lawyer by profession, said he grew frustrated with the
anti-abortion activists. SB 30, drafted by Sen. Florence Shapiro,
R-Plano, had ``more constitutional holes than a slice of Swiss
cheese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled in our committee at how little thought had gone
into the bill ... to create legislation that would withstand
constitutional scrutiny in the courts. I have become very impatient
over the last two months when I hear partisan and political
criticism of the way we handled the bill,'' Wolens added.
</P>
<P>
   Danburg said she will keep her ears open to see if a signed
agreement by conservative Republicans to avoid a free-for-all floor
flight on the bill is showing signs of cracking. If that agreement
starts to slip, she said, she will try to hold the bill up in the
Calendars Committee, keeping it from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy with this bill,'' said Peggy Romberg of the
Texas Family Planning Association who said anything could happen.
``The complexity of keeping an agreement _ when you have 150
members _ the odds of a few loose cannons is pretty real.''

<P>
   Blossom Martin was once bound for college and career. But by
1991, she said, she had become so consumed by alcohol and drugs
that she lost her job, was evicted from her apartment and landed on
welfare. And her two children had been living in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back was no snap. The course she has followed to
establish a new career, earn a college degree and win back her
children demonstrates both the difficulties and rewards of
recovery. Now, as director of a privately financed after-school
program in Manhattan, her purpose is to help others who are down
and out _ or could become so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blossom has a lot of valuable skills gained from her life
experience that can help her students,'' said the Rev. Leroy
Ricksy, director of the East Harlem Urban Center, the parent
organization for Ms. Martin's employer, the Booker T. Washington
Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Martin graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in
East Harlem in 1974, she wanted to be a doctor. She was accepted by
City College, but, discouraged by what she called bureaucracy and
administrative foul-ups, she never enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   A job as a bookkeeper for an after-hours bar eventually spiraled
into a life of drug and alcohol abuse, she said. The city's Bureau
of Child Welfare placed her two small children in foster care in
1985. Six years later, she had hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It was then, at the age of 35, that Ms. Martin decided to
reclaim her life. ``It just gradually occurred to me that I'd
rather spend my money on things other than drugs _ for instance,
paying the rent and buying clothes for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She enrolled at Touro College on East 123d Street and entered a
substance abuse program, taking almost two years to fully beat her
addictions. ``Many people still think that addiction can be
overcome in a few weeks or months,'' she said. ``It takes years.
It's a struggle every day.'' After Ms. Martin's second year at
Touro, her children, who had been in foster care for eight years,
were returned to her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she earned a bachelor's degree in human services. She
moved from welfare to workfare as a groundskeeper for the city's
Housing Department. Having met and impressed Ricksy, whose agency
ran her drug rehabilitation program, with her work as a volunteer
student counselor, she was hired a year later at the Booker T.
Washington center, on East 101st Street, and left public assistance
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The center operates a private, all-day preschool, an
after-school educational program for children in nearby public
schools and a full-time summer program. Most of the center's
support comes from New York City businesses like the Dover Corp.
and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   All the children receive a big helping of Ms. Martin's tough
love. ``Every child in this community has been affected in some way
by drugs, and as a result they thrive on consistency and
structure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the summer program as well, several months
after her hiring, Ms. Martin informed administrators and students
that its emphasis would be on education, not just supervised play.
</P>
<P>
   ``By coming here for the summer, these children are essentially
going to school all year, and I assure you that they're very happy
to learn every day,'' she said. ``There's plenty of time for fun
and games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, who is also a volunteer tutor at Public School 50,
visits her learning-center students' parents or other care
providers regularly, to seek their involvement. ``I truly believe
we can turn the public school system around with a more organized
coalition of parents, community organizations and the private
sector,'' she said. ``The school has computers. It has money. What
they need is more community involvement _ not something you get by
shuffling students around.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers her mother's volunteer work for the Head Start
program in 1968. ``They would go into the homes and see what was
going on and so were able to connect the family with outside
resources and community services,'' Ms. Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   She argues for smaller classes, organized after-school
supervision until 6 p.m. for all students, and year-round
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Martin's own children are proud of her, she is just as
proud of them. Last month her son, Matthew, 15, took part in a
school project, a Web site called ``Harlem Live,'' which recently
became part of a permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution.
Her daughter, Jamilla, 18, is completing the learning center's
computer course.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin's next step is to earn her master's degree in
education. She hopes to work eventually as a teacher or an
administrator in the public school system _ as an agent of change. &QL;

RISE IN CONSUMER PRICES UPSETS MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that consumer prices rose at
their fastest pace during the 1990s economic expansion, unnerving
investors and heightening suspense over whether the Federal Reserve
Board may raise interest rates to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responding to a 0.7 percent price increase in April
hammered the bond market and drove the Dow Jones industrial index
down 200 points before noon. The Dow never recovered, closing
Friday at 10,913.32, off 193.87 points, or 1.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a very substantial inflation scare here,'' said
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates when
board members meet on Tuesday. But, they argue, the CPI report
greatly increased the odds the Fed would change its official stance
on interest rates from ``neutral,'' to a tilt toward raising rates
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next move from the Fed will be up,'' predicted Lawrence
Horwitz, managing director of Primark Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A record spike in gasoline prices fueled inflation, as analysts
had predicted. More worrisome, the Labor Department said the
``core'' inflation rate _ minus energy and food prices _ rose by a
stronger-than-expected 0.4 percent. Higher prices for everything
from prescription drugs and cigarettes to clothing helped propel
the overall CPI higher.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation report coincided with other news that the economy
remains strong and inflation looms, including a hefty 0.6 percent
rise in factory output last month and continued buoyancy in
business confidence. On Thursday, the government reported producer
prices shot up 0.5 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is viewed as the single biggest threat not only to the
economy but also to stability of a delicately balanced stock
market. Before slumping Friday, stocks on Thursday broke through
the latest of numerous record highs.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was led downward by financial companies, which
are hurt by higher interest rates. Citigroup Inc., the nation's
largest banking company, lost 2 7/16 of its value, closing at 71
per share. The technology-heavy Nasdaq stock index declined 2.10
percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 2.18 percent,
compared with the Dow's 1.75 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are ``trying desperately to sustain these price-equity
ratios but it gets more difficult as bond yields rise and inflation
scares increase,'' said Clough at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing higher interest rates in the future, the bond market
tanked, suffering its biggest rout in almost three years. The
benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell 2 5/32 points. Yields
surged 17 basis points to 5.92 percent, their highest in a year.
Bond yields are up sharply from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ghost of inflation past is starting to haunt the bond and
equity markets,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer for
BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   April's CPI had its biggest monthly advance since October 1990,
marring a near-perfect inflation record during a sustained period
of growth during the 1990s. For the 12 months including April, the
CPI rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   The core inflation rate, at 0.4 percent, was markedly higher
than the 0.1 percent rate in the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Various components that go into the CPI rose sharply. The
largest single factor was energy costs, which rose 6.1 percent in
April. Gasoline prices, which rose 15 percent, had the biggest
monthly increase on record _ bigger even than increases posted
during the 1970s embargo by Middle East oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel prices rose for the first time since August _ up 1.5
percent in April. Transportation costs, fueled by higher gasoline
prices, rose 2.4 percent. Medical costs, under pressure from
prescription drugs, rose 0.4 percent in April and are up 3.5
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides the clearest evidence to date that
inflationary pressures are intensifying, creating a dilemma for Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan and board members.
</P>
<P>
   The April CPI may be ``a catch up from extraordinarily low
readings we had before,'' said Richard Rippe, a senior vice
president and chief economist at Prudential Securities in New York.
The difficulty, said Rippe, is that it could take a few more
months' data for the Fed to ascertain how big a threat inflation
may become in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, if the Fed does not act, the inflation pressure-cooker
may heat up, ultimately making it harder to control. If Fed members
do act, they could endanger the bull market, which has soared to
unprecedented highs and fueled consumer spending which keeps the
economy roaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (CPI report) complicates their decision next Tuesday,''
Rippe said. Odds the Fed would move to a bias towards tightening _
from its neutral stance _ ``have clearly gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of unabated growth, industrial output rose 0.6
percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in March. Previously,
the estimate of March industrial production had been a 0.1 percent
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Minervini, chief investment strategist for Quantech
Research Group in New York, said that though the bond market ``has
fallen out of bed, the stock market so far has held up well,''
given Friday's news.
</P>
<P>
   But, Minervini warned, investors who left early Friday ``need a
chance to digest this over the weekend so let's see what Monday
morning brings.''

FLOW OF RED INK IN BAY STATE HMO BUSINESS CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- All of Massacahusetts' major health insurers reported
operating losses for the first three months of this year,
continuing the stream of red ink that is washing over the entire
Massachusetts health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   The losses signal steep premium increases ahead for most
consumers in July, when many health insurance contracts are
renewed. Insurers are estimating increases of anywhere from 5
percent to 10 percent, with some customers experiencing far larger
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, the largest health maintenance
organization in New England, posted the largest loss of all _ more
thanr $22 million loss on revenue of $703.5 million, compared to a
net gain of $440,000 in the first three months of last year on
revenue of $632.4 million. When $10.8 million in investment income
is taken into account, the Brookline-based HMO's operating loss
balloons to $32.8 million for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, the second biggest HMO in the region, lost
$3.8 million on revenue of $485 million in the first quarter. The
figure includes investment income of $6 million. The loss widens to
nearly $10 million for the quarter once investment income is
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts, based in Waltham, made money in Massachusetts _ about $5
million _ but lost money in its efforts to expand into Maine, New
Hampshire and Rhode Island, said Richard Hallworth, Tufts chief
financial officer. The losses are expected to continue through
2000, he projected.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon Community Health Plan lost $5.4 million on revenue of
$133.3 million the first quarter, compared to a $873,157 loss
during the first three months of 1998 on revenue of $117.9 million,
according to Jay Egan, co-executive director of the Worcester-based
HMO. Egan said the losses were associated with the HMO's efforts to
expand outside of its central Massachusetts market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are dismal, to say the least,'' Susan Connolly,
principal of William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm in
Boston, said of the industry's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot was Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, which posted the industry's only net gain. Blue
Cross made $9.2 million on $491.5 million in revenue in the first
quarter, compared to a $29.4 million gain on $502.6 million in the
first quarter of 1998. The figures include proceeds from the sale
of its building at 100 Summer Street in Boston, which yielded $32
million in the first quarter of 1998, and another $8 million in the
first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On an operating basis, Blue Cross, however, lost money. This
year, it lost $10.9 million in the first three months. Last year,
it lost $9.2 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The losses reflect a general downward trend in the health care
sector as a whole in Massachusetts, which has been struggling with
cuts in Medicare reimbursement and low premium increases. As a
result, negotiations _ between insurers and employers, and between
insurers and health care providers _ are likely to be much more
acrimonious, said Connolly. ``It's going to be a very tough market
this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for example, Apex Health Care Inc. a 210-physician group
in Portsmouth, N.H., announced it was cancelling its contract with
Tufts because of a payment dispute. Apex doctors care for about
16,000 Tufts patients in the Seacoast area of New Hampshire. In
addition, two hospitals associated with Apex, Exeter Hospital and
Portsmouth Regional Hospital, also pulled out of the Tufts network
rather than accept a 10 percent cut in reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their proposal is just unacceptable,'' said Dr. James Glennon,
Apex medical director. ``Physicians have been living under the same
fee schedule since 1996, despite the fact that our costs have
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts said it will try to sign contracts with individual doctors
in Apex, whose contract expires July 1. The incident follows a
similar move this month, when 915 physicians affiliated with
Partners Community Health Inc. in Boston said they will not accept
new Tufts patients because of inadequate payment from the insurer.

   WELFARE-MILWAUKEE (Milwaukee) _ A decade ago, an eccentric band
of reformers here set out to guarantee every poor person a path
from poverty _ an assured job at a sufficient wage with child care
and health care. But as the program closes its offices this week,
an exhaustive volume of new research offers some disquieting
conclusions. Among the adults, only 27 percent managed to stick
with their subsidized jobs long enough to escape poverty. Their
average annual earnings were just $6,600. By Jason DeParle.

   HAWAII-TRUST (Honolulu) _ Developments concerning the Bishop
Estate. The estate, an institution of almost medieval power, was
long been a source of intense native pride, but in recent years it
had come to be seen as the embodiment of Hawaii's brand of inbred,
closed-door politics, as secretive and suspect as it was
impregnable. Most of the trustees were closely connected to the
state's ruling political establishment, so their dramatic ouster _
and the long fight that led up to it _ has led to predictions of a
shakeup in institutions from the Legislature to the state Supreme
Court, whose members used to select the Bishop trustees. By Todd S.

   ASSASSIN-GAME (Westport, Conn.) _ Beginning next week, 35 elite
college-bound students from Staples High School plan to arm
themselves with plastic guns with names like Lock `n' Load, Secret
Shot II, and Expand-a-Blast, then stalk classmates through town.
The students, who call the game Assassinations, have elaborate
plans for staying alive, and so expect the contest to last three
weeks. The final two survivors will shoot it out in a town park,
then collect cash prizes. Although life has not completely imitated
art in the students' game, some students have begun to worry about
the issue of real bullets. A handful of Staples students are bowing
out this year, deciding that four weeks after the killings in a
Colorado high school might not be the best time to lurk in bushes
and hide under cars in hopes of knocking off a target, even if it
is with a foam dart. By Mike Allen.

AOL STOCK HAS MAGELLAN FUND LOOKING GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online, Inc. has done more than any other stock to boost
returns at Fidelity Investment's gigantic Magellan Fund, even
though the mutual fund's manager is generally wary of Internet
stocks and newly cautious about technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's skipper, Robert Stansky, credited his decision to buy
more shares in AOL, the nation's biggest Internet service provider
and computer network, with helping Magellan to beat the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, a broad market benchmark, in recent periods.
</P>
<P>
   His decision, detailed Friday in Magellan's annual report, has
clearly pleased shareholders in Magellan, the nation's biggest
mutual fund with $93.7 billion in assets. Closed to new investors
since September 1997, Magellan recently began attracting a flood of
new cash from existing investors. Magellan was Fidelity's fourth
best selling fund last quarter, raking in a net $1 billion, the
most in three years, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Over 12 months through March, Magellan had net sales of $561
million, compared with net outflows of $1.9 billion the year
before, Fidelity said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a sober view of Web-oriented stocks, Stansky, 43, wrote
in the report that while he considered the Internet ``the most
exciting business segment of US business, many Internet companies
aren't yet making a profit and their stocks are very volatile.'' He
also provided a rare glimpse into what could be a new stock-picking
style at Fidelity, the nation's biggest fund firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply can't analyze the Internet sector the same way I
analyze other sectors,'' Stansky wrote. ``I do use some traditional
fundamental analysis . . . At the same time, I evaluate investor
psychology when it comes to Internet stocks.'' Stansky said his
decision to increase his exposure to Internet and other technology
stocks in the fourth quarter of 1998 to 25.8 percent as of year-end
was due ``at least as much to my feel for the psychology
surrounding thses stocks as it was to any numbers-related
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet fever has swept many investors off their feet, but over
the first quarter Stansky scaled back technology's share of
Magellan's assets to 20.8 percent as of the end of March.
Magellan's top tech holdings include big blue-chip issues such as
Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he took it over, Stansky is widely
credited with having turned a once-troubled Magellan around. The
fund gained 28.5 percent over 12 months through Friday, handily
beating the S&AMP;P 500, which rose 24 percent. Magellan stumbled when
its former manager, Jeffrey Vinik, placed ill-timed bets on bonds
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's flagship fund has also benefited recently from
holding popular large-company stocks, including General Electric
Co., now its top holding; retailers Home Depot Inc and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.; and pharmaceutical giant Merck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Stansky sounded a note of caution about the dominance of
large caps, which have produced most of the US stock market's
double-digit gains in recent years. Magellan, which is concentrated
in the largest issues, could be hurt if the market fundamentally
shifts to favoring smaller companies, Stansky said. He added: ``The
wild card _ in terms of stock performance _ is valuations.''

PREAKNESS HOPEFULS KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Choosing a winner in horse races demands foresight
as much as hindsight and imagination as much as crunching numbers.
It is as much an art as a science, this pastime that has consumed
so many for so long.
</P>
<P>
   And ``faith'' is an integral factor in making all decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finally training this horse the American way,''
trainer Bob Baffert commented after he saw that Worldly Manner had
worked a crisp 1:01 at Churchill Downs Tuesday. This followed a
leisurely 1:02 workout before the Kentucky Derby, a workout done
the European way _ in other words, slow _ and a few American
trainers snickered at the methods of Dubai's Godolphin Racing
Stable.
</P>
<P>
   But Godolphin just may be the most potent racing outfit in the
world. Godolphin will have 15 horses racing in six countries this
weekend, with Godolphin's Worldly Manner racing in Saturday's 124th
Preakness at decrepit, but charming Pimlico Race Course. Worldly
Manner finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby, his first real race
in eight months. Snickerers snickered at the European style.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bal-mer'' was the home of H.L. Mencken, a man who would be
sure to snicker at the snickerers himself, and of the 12 horses who
have come to Baltimore for the Preakness, Worldly Manner is the
most intriguing. Also, though, he is the horse who most requires a
leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, it is not known if Worldly Manner gave up the
ghost at the eighth pole in Louisville because 1. he was not
trained sharply enough, 2. he was not good enough, or 3. his mommy
and daddy produced a youngster who just can't run that far. If the
Derby were a mile race, Worldly Manner would have been the winner;
alas, the Derby was a 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   So faith is required. Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum of the
Godolphin blue colors paid $5 million for Worldly Manner, so it
does seem improbable that Worldly Manner is not better than the
common crowd that ran in the Derby. And while pedigree experts can
_ and will _ debate the merits of a mating six or seven generations
back, Worldly Manner does seem to have the blood to run a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, then, the question is whether Worldly Manner just
wasn't fit enough to run the Derby. American horses vying to win
the 3-year-old Classics often are much more seasoned than their
European counterparts trying to win the English Classics; it seems
likely Godolphin's use of a European style of training for the
Kentucky Derby might have been a mistake for a horse unraced in
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a lot out of the Derby,'' said Tom Albertrani, the
assistant trainer for Godolphin. ``We still don't know for sure if
he stays, but we'll find that out (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it will be too late to wager once that question is
answered definitively. Whether Godolphin actually used the Kentucky
Derby as a prep for the Preakness _ an unsettling thought _ or
whether the Derby was merely Sheikh Mohammed's first lesson learned
in his five-year plan to win America's Triple Crown, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   So a liberal dose of faith is required. For a human tip,
consider that Sheikh Mohammed is here in Baltimore Saturday and not
in England, Ireland, Germany, Japan, France, or Italy, where
Godolphin horses are running this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In early Preakness wagering Friday, Menifee was the strong
favorite at 2-1 while Worldly Manner's odds have dropped sharply
from his (strangely-high) morning line odds of 12-1. Charismatic,
the Derby winner, has been dismissed by the crowd and was 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd believes Menifee had a troubled trip in the Derby and
would have won with a clearer path; the crowd is right when it
looks back to the Derby. But the crowd may not be right when it
looks ahead to the Preakness; the crowd, after all, is seldom right
in any endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   All focus on the Derby has been on the rough-and-wild rodeo
rides that so many horses had, but little focus has been on the
extreme track bias at Churchill Downs May 1. There was an extreme
closer's bias that day in Louisville and speed horses had virtually
no chance. Worldly Manner stalked the lead and then briefly took
the lead at the top of the stretch before fading; the track bias
certainly didn't help him.
</P>
<P>
   The track bias at Pimlico Friday was the exact opposite. Horses
that took the early lead had a huge advantage, especially if they
were to the inside of the track. Worldly Manner should be helped by
1. the race under his belt in Louisville and 2. the bias of
Pimlico, which is likely to be similar Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the Derby was a bad, slow, dawdling, and plodding
race, the slowest on a dry track in 25 years. Menifee, who missed
winning by a neck, looked good simply because the other horses
weren't good.
</P>
<P>
   It seems certain, though, that Menifee will make the board
Saturday, as will one of D. Wayne Lukas's two horses, Charismatic
or Cat Thief. Charismatic is the better of the two and his odds
will be higher; take Charismatic to be second or third. Baffert's
filly, Excellent Meeting, had a most troubled trip like so many
others in the Derby, and Baffert has been talking her up. But she
can be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner can win the Preakness with Charismatic or Menifee
second and either of those two third. Of the long shots, only Badge
may make the board.
</P>
<P>
   It is a leap of faith. But faith often is rewarded.

FINALLY, THEY'LL BE `DAUGHTERS OF THE COMMANDMENTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They've waited more than 60 years for a rite of
passage denied them long ago simply because they were girls.
</P>
<P>
   With memories that still sting, they recall the attention,
praise and gifts lavished on their brothers as they crossed the
symbolic threshold into manhood.
</P>
<P>
   The time had come, they decided, for their moment in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, nine women, ranging in age from 76 to 91, will
finally celebrate their bat mitzvah, becoming ``daughters of the
commandments.'' More than 200 relatives from as far away as
California will come to watch their mothers and grandmothers
achieve a sacred milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I will feel like a complete Jewish woman,'' said
Dorothy Sockol, 86, sitting in a sun-drenched first-floor meeting
room at Heritage at Cleveland Circle. The nine women live in the
assisted living community in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two brothers were educated about the Jewish religion, but I
got no training because it wasn't something that was open to
girls,'' said Sockol, who grew up in Maine. ``It's taken a long
time but I finally earned the privilege to be bat mitzvahed.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of intense study Sockol, Violet Katz, 91, Rose
Uchill , 88, Ruth Wineburgh, 89, Sylvia Ewens, 82, Anne Prenovitz,
88, Louis Hyman, 76, Pauline Meyer, 87, and Ida Wolf, 90, will be
called by their Hebrew name to read the Torah in front of their
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, the nine women have spent dozens of
hours learning Hebrew, studying the Torah and memorizing prayers
preparing to claim a religious right that essentially did not exist
when they were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something that anyone even thought about,'' Katz
said. ``It was just assumed that this was for the boys, not the
girls so I don't remember anybody raising a ruckus about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But spurred on, in part, by the women's rights movement in the
1960s, Judaism has become more egalitarian over the past four
decades, opening doors to women that had been closed for centuries.
Women rabbis are now common and religious rituals are no longer the
domain of men.
</P>
<P>
   In the Reform and Conservative movement, bat mitzvahs for girls
are the norm _ and an increasing number of adult women eager to
embrace a vital source of Jewish identity also are celebrating the
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orthodox movement, which has strict rules regarding
gender roles, bat mitzvahs are less common. But even within this
conservative denomination, a growing number of modern Orthodox
congregations are permitting bat mitzvahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young girl, I was the only girl attending Hebrew
school,'' said Wineburgh, who grew up in Utica, N.Y. ``As I watched
the boys become Bar Mitzvahed, I asked my teacher when it would be
my turn. He predicted that someday girls will have the opportunity
to receive this honor. For me this day has finally come in my
golden years.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming of age ceremony celebrated in Judaism for hundreds of
years, the bar mitzvah _ and, today, the bat mitzvah _ is a formal
reminder to maturing youth of their responsibility to uphold Jewish
law and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming bar or bat mitzvahed, a Jew must show a basic
understanding of Jewish principles, have enough command of Hebrew
to participate in services and be prepared to assume the religious
and ethical responsibilities of adults.
</P>
<P>
   And while bar and bat mitzvahs are today typically celebrated
among youngsters, there is no age restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we may grow old physically, our sense of faith
doesn't,'' noted Rabbi Maury Levine, rabbi emeritus at Temple Beth
Sholom in Framingham. He will be officiating at Sunday's Bat
Mitzvah. ``I think it's wonderful that these women had the
motivation and desire to renew their ties with the Jewish
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ceremony probably wouldn't be happening if Rose Uchill
hadn't spoken up.
</P>
<P>
   Uchill turned 88 on Nov. 16, two weeks after sitting inside
Temple Beth Avodah in Newton watching her grandson, John, become
bar mitzvahed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she has traveled to Jerusalem, Hawaii and Denver
to see her children and grandchildren celebrate their bar and bat
mitzvah's. Every time, she listened joyfully as they read from the
Torah in a ritual that binds Jews across time.
</P>
<P>
   After playing the role of proud mom or grandma so many times,
Uchill finally decided this was something she wanted for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed right to me,'' Uchill said one day last week
after the nine women had finished another afternoon of rehearsing.
</P>
<P>
   So when Nancy Bayer, Heritage's program director, wished her a
happy birthday last November, Uchill said she had just one burning
birthday wish _ to be bat mitzvahed.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, thrilled by Uchill's request, organized a class, which
eventually evolved into the group of nine women. ``My parents who
are coming to the ceremony, instilled in me a strong sense of
Judaism and because of that I am able to teach others and I can do
this for these women,'' Bayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Calica is coming from San Franciso to watch his grandmother,
Uchill, become bat mitzvahed. ``I think it's wonderful because when
she was growing up girls were treated as a lesser class and she was
this incredibly sharp person,'' said Calica, 35. ``Had she grown up
today she'd probably be something like a scientist. I'm not
surprised she's doing this. She's a real fireball.''
</P>
<P>
   As she prepares the nine women for Sunday's celebration, Bayer
mulls what she will say during the ceremony. ``I'm going to be
praising them for their dedication, interest in learning and
commitment to Judaism,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As the women approach the Torah, their Hebrew name and that of
their parents will be called out.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, in a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah, they would be called
to read in the name of their fathers. But the women told Bayer they
also want to be called in the name of their mothers. ``That was
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the cermony ends, each women will receive a bat
mitzvah certificate that will state: ``Every living soul is a
letter of the Torah.''

YUGOSLAV INTERNET USERS PANIC ON RUMOR THAT THEY'LL BE CUT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Internet users rushed to send last-minute
e-mails at a downtown Internet cafe Friday, after word circulated
that the United States was going to cut off Yugoslavia from the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a rush here and many people heard it was going to be
shut down,'' said Borivoj Ivanovic, 23, a webmaster at the
MultiMedia Center Maverick cafi in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how many people communicate by email,'' he
said. ``When we had a power cut people were queuing behind the
computers to send email to relatives and friends to say `I am
OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of internet access is still only a threat, but Internet
providers here are worried that a partial shutdown is imminent. The
net remains the only means of communication for many in Serbia, and
apart from the short wave radio, provides the only access to
independent news in the country. Postal services to and from abroad
have stopped since NATO began its air campaign, and telephone
charges are prohibitive for most ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the feared shutdown is a presidential executive order,
signed by President Clinton, that came into force May 1. Updating a
1998 order, the order enforces sanctions to prevent U.S. companies
from dealing in ``goods, software, technology (including technical
services) and services'' with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Its impact was almost immediate for companies like Informatika,
an Internet provider and software and hardware supplier in
Belgrade. Slobodan Sreckovic, general manager of Informatika, had
just recently expanded his Internet services, organizing a direct
satellite uplink connection with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But this week he received a letter from Loral Orion, part of
Loral Space and Communications in Maryland, advising him that
because of the order they would have to suspend their satellite
service immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He also received an email from the computer company Unisys,
saying that ``a full embargo is in place and Unisys equipment and
services can no longer be provided to Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had not informed the company of their intentions, he
said, but shipments of software teaching materials had stopped,
even though Informatika had paid for the year in advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it right now not as business, but an exchange of ideas
and information,'' said Jakob Salom, assistant general manager and
a board member at Informatika. ``The first result would be to cut
us off from information from the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its letter, Loral has yet to actually cut off its
satellite service to Informatika. If and when it does, the loss of
United States satellite services would only restrict and slow down
services at Informatika's provider, forcing them to switch to
terrestrial lines and to arrange another satellite link through
East European countries or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be a black-out, that is impossible on the
Internet, it will be a brownout,'' said Alexander Mutavdzic, one of
the company's Internet advisers, and like most of Informatika's
staff, a fluent English speaker. ``The Internet is global,
democratic and practically no one can cut it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Loral Space spokeswoman Jeannette Clonan told the Associated
Press that `We're still not in the clear on this whole thing.''
Loral said it was discussing its obligations under the U.S. embargo
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said there was no truth to
allegations that it was trying to cut the flow of information to
Yugoslavia, and said it would not try to limit Internet access for
users in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full and open access to the Internet can only help the Serbia
people know the ugly truth about the atrocities and crimes against
humanity being perpetrated in Kosovo by the Milosevic regime,''
said State Department spokesman James Rubin, the AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Council said earlier that information
services are generally considered exempt from trade embargoes, but
that electronic commerce is affected, the Associated Press
reported. The Internet performs both functions.

SECOND DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL TO BE HELD IN BRYAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ After considering nearly 30 Texas counties _
and being turned down by many of them _ Jasper County authorities
have decided that the second trial of a white man charged with last
June's brutal dragging death of a black man will be held in Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the capital murder trial of Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr., 32, of Sulphur Springs, is due to begin Aug. 30, state
District Judge Monte Lawlis said Friday in Jasper. Brewer is one of
three men charged with dragging James Byrd Jr., 49, of Jasper,
behind a pickup for almost three miles along country roads early
June 7. Byrd was decapitated when his body hit a concrete culvert.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Jasper earlier sentenced Bill King, 24, to death. The
trial of Shawn Berry, 24, is scheduled for sometime this fall.
Berry's attorney said he wants his trial to be held in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlis first ruled that Brewer's trial would also be held in
Jasper, but agreed to move the case after prosecutors said they
didn't want the location of the trial to be an appeals issue.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said he and Sheriff Billy
Rowles visited almost 30 Texas counties before settling on Brazos
County. Some counties had scheduling conflicts or didn't have
proper facilities for a high-profile trial, but many officials said
they didn't want the trial in their counties. The first trial
attracted scores of reporters from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with officials in Bryan this week, Gray said,
one official stood up and said that while he, personally, didn't
want the trial in his county, he was embarrassed that others had
turned their backs on Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, a city of 60,000 near Texas A&AMP;M University, is about 90
miles northwest of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After Byrd's death, Jasper was visited by Ku Klux Klan and black
militant groups. However, no demonstrations were held during King's
trial, nor were there any serious security problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlis said he anticipates issuing an order forbidding any
groups or individuals from having any demonstrations near the
Brazos County courthouse during Brewer's trial. A similar order was
issued during King's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse renovations in Bryan, due to be finished before the
trial, will increase security at the entrances to the courthouse,
Lawlis said. While the 85th District courtroom _ the largest in the
building _ won't be available until Aug. 30, Lawlis said he
anticipates starting jury selection about three weeks earlier in a
smaller courtroom.

MANUFACTURING THRIVING EVEN AS EMPLOYMENT FALLS

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When financial crisis swept through Asia, Brazil and Russia last
year, American industry prepared to duck. With goods accounting for
over 70 percent of exports, manufacturers were sure to take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, they did. Manufacturing exports, as estimated
by the National Association of Purchasing Management, fell for 14
consecutive months starting in the fall of 1997. Employment in
manufacturing, meanwhile, fell by 400,000 last year, and the
association's widely publicized measure of manufacturing production
indicated steady declines throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the negative arithmetic misses the point, says Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
the industry's largest trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best estimates show that manufacturing survived the Asia
crisis just fine,'' Jasinowski said. ``In fact, it is thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   He backs his assertion with government statistics different from
those compiled by the purchasing managers. His data show that
production, which certainly stumbled for a while, has now recovered
and is again rising at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of manufacturing's revival came Friday, when the
Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.6
percent in April, the strongest gain since August.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial employment is continuing to fall, but that trend
actually reflects the sector's enduring strength _ fast-paced
innovation that drives up productivity, allowing manufacturers to
churn out more automobiles, refrigerators and computers with fewer
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the productivity gains can be traced to ``hard
technology'' innovations embedded in high-speed data processing
systems and computer-driven machinery. But other gains are driven
by ``soft technology'' innovations, which alter the way people,
equipment and materials are organized and managed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA, an economic
consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa., growth in production
peaked in November 1997 when it was advancing by more than 7
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Once Asian economies collapsed, manufacturing slowed, but never
actually fell. Now that exports have stabilized, the vigorous
domestic economy is pulling demand for manufactured goods back up.
According to government estimates, production rose more than 4
percent last year, about the same rate of growth as in the economy
at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade shock merely brought manufacturing down from its
giddy pace before Asia collapsed to the pace of other sectors of
the economy,'' Zandi said.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of how manufacturing kept pace with
services, which suffered little shock from Asia. Chalk the neat
trick up to the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates last year
as an insurance policy to keep the American economy upright. Lower
interest rates made housing, autos and other goods that Americans
buy on credit cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   According to government estimates, the production of durables _
furniture, industrial machinery computer equipment, automobiles and
the like _ rose over 5 percent from the end of 1997 to the end of
1998. But the production of nondurable goods like tobacco products,
textiles and apparel fell almost 1 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Economic collapse abroad hit particularly hard at commodities.
As Asia bought less oil, steel and other basic goods, their prices
fell to punishing levels, forcing cutbacks. That was a boon for
consumers, but a blow to American producers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American industry has proved remarkably resilient. A
striking feature of the last several decades is that the share of
manufacturing in the overall economy has remained rock steady. ``It
may appear to the public that we are becoming a nation of hamburger
flippers,'' said Ed McKelvey, an economist with Goldman, Sachs,
``but the simple fact is that manufacturers are holding their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report by the Federal Reserve on production showed that
manufacturing advanced 0.6 percent during April after rising a
revised 0.4 percent in March. Mining output increased 0.1 percent;
output of utilities' rose 0.7 percent. Capacity use, meanwhile,
remained low, at 80.6 percent, compared with 80.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing accounts for about 20 percent of total production
today, and about 20 percent for the last three decades. What has
fallen is the share of the nation's labor force working in
manufacturing _ from about 35 percent in 1947, to about 18.5
percent in 1988 and about 15 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity record in manufacturing in recent years has
been striking. It has been growing about 4 percent a year since
1995, about twice the rate of productivity growth in the overall
economy. In the first quarter of this year, manufacturing
productivity advanced at a 5.8 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Paul Swamidass of Auburn University says he thinks he
knows why. In a 1997 survey of more than 1,000 factories sponsored
by the manufacturers' association and the National Science
Foundation, he found that about 85 percent of the companies
involved had adopted computer-aided design technologies that permit
them to introduce new products more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent had adopted computer-run machines. More than 60
percent of the plants had built computer networks linking customers
to the plant and linking machinery within the plant. And at least
25 percent of the factories used robots for welding and other
repetitive tasks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest innovations _ an organizational concept known
as cells, which uses small teams of workers to make an entire
product rather than passing unfinished product from department to
department, each with its own crew of workers _ is spreading fast.
The survey showed it had been adopted by more than 50 percent of
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   John Heggestad, director of operations at Mine Safety
Appliances, &UR;  &LR; a Pittsburgh company that makes safety equipment,
including gas masks and other breathing devices, said that
``manufacturing cells have allowed us to cut paperwork,
transportation and inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, a worker inspects aluminum forgings
brought onto the factory floor, and, using machines placed nearby,
does whatever milling, drilling and threading is needed. Under the
old system, the aluminum would have been brought to a receiving
area by one worker, logged in by another, inspected by a third,
then transported to different areas of the factory floor for
milling, drilling, threading and further assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By moving to manufacturing cells,'' he said, ``we doubled
revenues per worker over the past 10 or so years.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Probst, manufacturing engineer at the Falk Corp. in
Auburn, Ala., tells a similar story. Falk makes coupling devices
that connect motors to equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under its old system, the assembly of a new coupler would start
at one end of the factory floor and finish at the other. Now
machines are arranged in clusters, sometimes run by a single worker
who completes all the steps himself. The process eliminates the
need to have unfinished parts sitting around in various stages;
Falk has reduced its delivery times from four weeks to one.
</P>
<P>
   Swamidass, in his survey, found that companies raised
productivity by about 4 percent a year from 1993 through 1997 and
reduced inventories by more than 20 percent. ``The record
suggests,'' he said, ``that in a tight labor market that chairman
Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve fears, the use of hard and
soft technologies can boost productivity and take the pressure off
of labor costs.''

INFLATION RISES FOR APRIL, BUT ECONOMISTS SAY THEIR IS NO CAUSE FOR
WORRY 
</HEADLINE>

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inflation, driven in part by rising oil and gasoline
prices, moved up sharply at the consumer level in April, the
government reported Friday, leading some analysts to say that the
remarkable decline in prices over the last several years may be
over.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, economists are not predicting that
inflation is taking off. It is just that after the meager 1.6
percent rise in the Consumer Price Index last year, which was due
in a large part to plunging oil prices, inflation is now likely to
return to the 2.3 percent pace of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI for April rose 0.7
percent, its biggest monthly increase in eight and a half years.
The so-called core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components, rose 0.4 percent, the largest monthly increase since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as bad as it looks,'' said Louis Crandall, chief
economist at R. H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Still the indication of an acceleration in prices was enough to
send stock and bond prices sharply lower and interest rates higher
Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 193.87 points, or
1.75 percent, to 10,913.32. But the index is still up almost 19
percent for the year. Long-term interest rates jumped to 5.92
percent, their highest in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond investors have been worrying about inflationary
pressures for several months because the economy, which has grown
at more than a 5 percent pace over the last six months, has shown
few signs of slowing down to a speed that would prevent the Federal
Reserve from raising interest rates to curb growth and inflation.
Such a move, at least initially, would have a negative effect on
both stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these concerns, the surge in inflation in April will
focus even more attention on the meeting of Federal Reserve
policy-makers Tuesday. While analysts don't expect central bank
officials to raise interest rates, policy-makers could send the
signal that a rate hike was likely if the April numbers turned into
a trend.
</P>
<P>
   The April surge in the overall CPI followed a 0.2 percent rise
in March and 0.1 percent rises in February and January.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the April increase was due to a record increase in
gasoline prices, which jumped 15 percent. Overall energy prices
jumped 6.1 percent after a 1.6 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
   Food prices were up 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent decline in
March. The index for fruits and vegetables jumped 1.4 percent after
a decline of 2.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   The more worrisome 0.4 percent jump in the core CPI followed 0.1
percent increases in each of the first three months of the year.
The jump to 0.4 percent was driven by higher apparel, tobacco and
shelter costs.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel prices jumped 1.5 percent, their first increase since
August. Tobacco rose 3.6 percent last month after falling 3.5
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the overall CPI is rising at an annual rate of
3.3 percent, compared to 1.6 percent for all of 1998. However, the
core rate is climbing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below last
year's 2.4 percent pace.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate economic report Friday, the Federal Reserve said
that industrial production rose 0.6 percent last month after a 0.5
percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
   One reason economists were relatively calm _ and why the Fed is
not expected to raise interest rates Tuesday _ is that the April
jump in the CPI, so far, seems to be an isolated event. The other
important barometers of inflationary pressure are still in check.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of wage increases, despite the low rate of
unemployment, has been declining this year. Worker productivity,
which jumped a surprising 4 percent in the first quarter of the
year, is rising. The dollar is still relatively strong, meaning
that the prices of imports are in check.
</P>
<P>
   The index for prices at the producer level rose 0.5 percent in
April, but the core rate increased just 0.1 percent. And American
companies still seem to have trouble making any significant price
increases stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember a time when the CPI, in one report, told you
the trend was changing,'' said James E. Glassman, the senior U.S.
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. But, still, he is thinking of
raising his CPI forecast for the year. But that is because he is
now forecasting a 1.3 percent increase, based in part on the
assumption that the oil price increase would retreat significantly.
He said if he was revising his forecast now, it would move to
around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shepherdson, the chief U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said that without the tobacco and
apparel increases, the core CPI would have increased just 0.2
percent, which is what Wall Street was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the apparel increase was due to retailers marking
up spring clothing after being forced to cut prices on winter
clothes earlier in the year because of the mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new calculation method for the CPI appears to
have understated price increases earlier in the year and could be
overstating last month's jump. The tobacco price increases,
Shepherdson said, followed months of discounting by producers. ``I
don't think any of this tells us anything about the underlying
inflation environment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still some disturbing trends. Medicare care
costs, pushed up by drug costs, rose 0.3 percent and are up 3.5
percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Fine, the chief market strategist at Chase Asset
Management, said there were also clear upward trends in hotel,
education and public transportation costs. In addition, there is no
assurance that the recent break in the run-up in crude oil and
gasoline prices mean that those surges are over for the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of the big questions for both bond and stock investors now
is what happens to interest rates. A move over 6 percent could
become worrisome if it undermined stocks by drawing investors to
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey M. Applegate, the bullish chief U.S. strategist at
Lehman Brothers is not worried. ``We are not going to jump the
tracks,'' he said. ``We are not going to change our asset
allocation. This is an outlier,'' he said referring to the April
CPI report. His year-end target for the Dow remains at 11,500.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at the Goldman Sachs
Group, said a at conference for clients that the country is not
facing an increase in inflation nor a spike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday, the Dow was pulled down in part by sharp
falls in IBM, off 6 3/4 to 239 1/4, and JP Morgan, down 5 13/16 to
140 15/16. Both stocks had jumped sharply Thursday, IBM on Internet
hopes and JP Morgan on takeover rumors. Friday they accounted for
more than a quarter's of the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, down 54.14 points, or 2.1 percent,
to 2,527.86, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, off
29.76 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,337.80, both fell more sharply
than the Dow. Both indexes are loaded with the often overvalued
technology and large growth stocks that investors have shunned
recently. Instead they have flocked to undervalued cyclical stocks,
which have rallied as the economy has shown much more strength than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond dropped 1
point and 30/32 to 90 22/32 while the yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, jumped to 5.92 percent, from 5.75 percent
Thursday. On Thursday bonds rallied sharply, and the yield dropped,
after the report of the restrained PPI increase and the
announcement that retail sales had cooled off, rising only 0.1
percent in both March and April.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had come to depend on the strong growth but low
inflation story, said Karen Arrese, head of global bonds at Bank
Julius Baer. ``But when you pose a threat to that story the market
doesn't like it,'' she said. She expects that long-term interest
rates will move back over 6 percent. But once that happens, she
thinks bond investors will start buying, pushing interest rates
lower again.

   BALTIMORE _ Slowly, but surely, Menifee is starting to emerge
from this pack of 3-year-olds, which once was considered tightly
bunched. All the buzz in Baltimore this week has surrounded
Menifee, who gained attention with a rippling run to finish second

   Menifee, who looks great and is working well, was 7-1 when he

he'll be closer to 7-5 than 7-1 for Saturday's 124th running of the

   ``He's had a good two weeks,'' said Elliott Walden, who trains
Menifee. ``I'm very happy with the way things are going. I'm
optimistic. He hasn't missed a beat since arriving at Pimlico He's
on top of his game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, a son of Harlan, out of Anne Campbell, a Never Bend
mare, is owned by Arthur Hancock and James Stone. Hancock bred
Menifee, a half-brother to Desert Wine _ who was second to Sunny's
Halo in the 1983 Derby _ on his 2,000-acre Stone Farm, near Paris,
Ky. Walden bought Menifee for a bargain $35,000 at the 1997
Keeneland September Sale. Hancock, who liked the colt because of
his intelligence and kind disposition, bought back half of him, and
the other half was sold to Hancock's close friend, James Stone of
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative on Menifee's resume was that his sire was
considered a sprinter, and stands at stud at Stone Farm for a
modest fee of $5,000. Menifee's price was relatively low because
horsemen didn't think he had much pedigree. But, Harlan is by Storm
Cat, a noted sire of distance horses. Harlan was the exception that
proved the rule, and there is more of Storm Cat in Menifee than
Harlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big, long-striding horse,'' said Walden. ``He's got a
lot of scope, as we say in the business. With his stride, he goes
like a big horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee broke his maiden easily at first asking at Monmouth last
July, then took a talent-laden allowance at Saratoga, defeating Cat
Thief, who was third in the Derby, and Lemon Drop Kid, who won the
Belmont Futurity in his next race. Menifee captured an allowance at
Gulfstream in February, but suffered his first loss when beaten a
length by Pineaff in the Tampa Bay Derby. Because of the loss at
Tampa, Menifee was a middle-of-the-board choice in the Blue Grass.
Had he not been beaten at Tampa, he would have been undefeated (5
for 5) going into the Derby, in which he weaved his way through
horses after being four-wide, and far back, in the 19-horse field.
Menifee was flying, but he ran out of racetrack and missed catching
Charismatic by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   Walden, 36, is from a racing family, headed by his late father,
Ben, who was a noted farm manager. Elliott grew up on Dearborn
Farm, near Midway, Ky., and is wise about horses beyond his years.
Walden has been training on his own since 1985, has dominated the
standings at Churchill Downs in recent years, and burst on the
national scene when his charge, Victory Gallop, ran second to Real
Quiet in the Derby and Preakness, then denied him the Triple Crown
in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Menifee is the horse to beat,'' said Walden.
``Charismatic ran a great race in the Derby, this isn't sour
grapes. Objectively, though, Menifee was made the favorite here
(5-2 in the morning line) because more people than just me think he
could have won the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years in a row, Elliot has trained the horse who was running
best at the end of the Kentucky Derby, but he hasn't gotten the
roses. All horsemen want to win the Derby, but for one who grew up
playing in the Blue Grass, it is a burning desire. However, Walden,
who is a deeply religious man, as is Menifee's jockey, Pat Day, has
handled the two painful defeats with grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose all the time in this game,'' said Walden. ``The Derby
is the most coveted race of our racing year. I'm disappointed my
horses got beat, I wish they had made it. But I handle it with my
faith. The Derby is not the most important thing in life. As long
as our horses represent us well, that's all I'm hoping for, to live
up to my capabilities as a trainer. As long as I've done all I can
do to prepare them, I'm all right. Both of my horses ran winning
races in the Derby, nothing we did caused them to get beat. I'd
have been a lot more upset if we made a glaring mistake that got
them beat, but that wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most of this group, Menifee is a stalker, which makes it
even more impressive that he adapted to the role of the closer in
the Derby after being knocked back from post No. 18. ``He was taken
out of his game in the Derby.'' said Walden. ``He'll be close in
the Preakness. He had one horse beaten when they straightened away
down the backstretch in the Derby. I give Menifee credit for the
way he ran. Horses get bumped around, but, the bottom line is, good
horse will overcome it, and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden feels that Cat Thief, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who also
trains Charismatic, is the horse Menifee must beat. He thinks that
both Worldly Manner, who was lightly trained in Dubai before
finishing seventh in the Derby, and the filly Excellent Meeting,
who was beaten up before finishing fifth, could go either way _
very good, or very bad. And he also believes Menifee is the
legitimate favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel a little more pressure having the favorite, but I'd
rather have the favorite than not,'' said Walden. ``If I have a
horse at 15-1 or 20-1, I know I'm not in the right spot. The Tampa
Bay Derby was his first race around two turns, but when he lost, it
threw everybody for a loop. He lost an extreme amount of ground in
that race. The lost ground, combined with the fact that he needed
the race, contributed to his defeat. He got tired. If he hadn't
lost the Tampa race, he'd have been 3 for 3 this year, with great
speed figures, going into the Derby. If you're looking for the most
consistent horse, Menifee is the most consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 12 Preakness rides, Day has won five times (Tank's Prospect,
1985; Summer Squall, '90; Tabasco Cat, '94; Timber Country, '95;
and Louis Quatorze, '96), and has been second on three occasions
(Easy Goer, '89; Corporate Report, '91, and Cherokee Run, '93).
Day's remarkable record in the Preakness further enhances Menifee's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat has a high confidence level in this horse, and that's
important because Pat has been on a lot of good ones,'' added
Walden. ``I'm very confident. I think if they ran this race 10
times, Menifee would win it the most times. I think he's the best
3-year-old in the country, but I'm not saying he's 5 lengths better
than everybody else. He needs to step up, and (Saturday) is the day
to do it.''

 &HT;    YUGOSLAVIA CLAIMS ERRANT NATO BOMBS KILL 79 CIVILIANS
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 700
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Airing grisly footage of charred bodies and burned
out tractors, state-run media in Yugoslavia reported that NATO
bombs killed at least 79 ethnic Albanian refugees early Friday and
wounded scores more in a village in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO officials did not refute the charges by late
Friday. They acknowledged, however, that NATO warplanes struck at
military targets in the area on the single heaviest day of allied
bombing to date, and said the allegations were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Still coping with the diplomatic fallout from NATO's mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a week ago, President
Clinton tried to patch up Sino-American relations in a 30-minute
phone call to Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to advance diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Kosovo,
the State Department said its top Russia hand, deputy secretary
Strobe Talbott, would meet Tuesday in Finland with Moscow's envoy
to the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was scheduled to then travel to Belgrade for talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, on what U.S. officials
hope will be a mission adding pressure on the Serb leader to accept
NATO conditions for halting the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going with the clearest possible understanding of what
will be necessary for President Milosevic to agree to and to
accept, so that we can suspend the bombing,'' said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is the acceptance of the unchanging and
unchangeable NATO conditions for a peaceful resolution of this
situation,'' said Rubin, ``and we have not seen that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, state-run television showed once again gruesome
footage of civilian carnage blamed on NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the purported attack were quoted saying they had
recently journeyed out of hiding in nearby mountains to seek refuge
near the village when their convoy was hit by a pair of large
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was sleeping,'' one dazed survivor, Feriz Emini, told
Serb-run media, the Associated Press reported from Belgrade. ``I
don't know the exact number (killed). Many.''
</P>
<P>
   An AP Television News crew saw dozens of bodies, including two
children, burned beyond recognition and lying near two craters
beside a road. A group of four dozen women and children huddled and
wept in the cellar of a nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials stopped short of denying the attack. They said,
however, that Yugoslav forces had shelled civilians in the same
area, and they warned reporters to take Belgrade's media reports
with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have planes in the area and we were attacking
legitimate military targets and we basically don't know what
happened after that,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said late
Friday. ``I don't think NATO's going to be finished with its
investigation until tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at the Pentagon, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told
reporters that, based on the televised footage of the purported
scene, it was impossible to tell what caused the pictured vehicles
to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area looks like it was attacked. Whether it was artillery
or a bomb, I don't know,'' said Wald. ``Somebody could have set the
vehicle on fire with a match.''
</P>
<P>
   With NATO warplanes stepping up their attacks on fielded forces
intermingled with civilians across Kosovo, however, Pentagon
officials could not immediately rule out the possibility of another
mistaken attack against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environment that is rich for these kinds of
mistakes,'' said Gen. John Jumper, commander general of U.S. Air
Forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The attack allegedly took place in the village of Korisa, near
the town of Prizren in southern Kosovo, a province in the main
Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The area around Prizren, a hub for Serb troop and police
operations targeting ethnic Albanians, has been the target of
intensive NATO bombing in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight Thursday, Wald said, U.S. and allied pilots attacked
more than 30 targets in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombs have resulted in civilian casualties in at least a
dozen separate instances since the air campaign against Yugoslavia
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said Friday the attacks have killed 1,200
civilians and wounded 5,000 more, figures that are impossible to
verify or to reliably refute.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have admitted, however, that alliance pilots have
mistakenly destroyed a train, a bus, parts of a refugee convoy and
other civilian facilities, in addition to the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade which was mistakenly bombed May 7.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton apologized for the embassy strike which U.S.
officials blamed on an erroneous intelligence map during a
30-minute telephone conversation with China's Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had already apologized three times in public and a
fourth time in writing, had been trying to reach Jiang since last
Saturday. Jiang refused to take Clinton's calls, however, until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president once again expressed his sincere regrets and
condolences to President Jiang and the Chinese people
</P>
<P>
   concerning the tragic accident of last week,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. ``The president
</P>
<P>
   expressed his desire that we move beyond this tragic accident in
our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to
the Balkans, visiting refugee camps in Macedonia. She compared the
forced exodus of ethnic Albanians to the horrors of Nazi Germany
half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials estimate that up to 1.5 million ethnic
Albanians have been forced from their homes over the past two
months by Serb troops, police and paramilitary forces. Roughly half
have fled to neighboring Albania and Macedonia and half are
believed to be on the run inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton vowed that all would eventually be allowed to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not intend to let the evil which Milosevic perpetrated
against these people keep them away from their homeland and their
homes,'' she said. ``That is a very basic, fundamental commitment
that is shared not only by those in the U.S. who are committed to
this effort but our allies as well.''

COMMENTARY:   ON A WING AND A PRAYER?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It would be hard to find stronger words in condemnation
of Slobodan Milosevic than President Clinton used in a talk to
World War II veterans the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic
extermination of the Holocaust,'' the president said, ``the two are
related _ both vicious, premeditated, systematic oppression fueled
by religious and ethnic hatred.'' Clinton went on to cite the
hundreds of Kosovo villages burned, the 100,000 men missing, the
rapes and mass executions carried out by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether there is in this president the political
will _ the political courage _ to match the moral force of his
rhetoric. The answer to that question will determine how the Kosovo
conflict ends: in the destruction of Milosevic's power for evil or
in a terrible defeat for Western military credibility and Western
values.
</P>
<P>
   Air power is the means on which Clinton has relied to achieve
NATO's declared goal, the return of all refugees to Kosovo under
protection of an effective international force. But the ability of
bombing to accomplish that result has, so far, been based more on
hope than confidence in a military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The hope first was that, with a few bombs, Milosevic would cave
in. He did not. Then it was that a gradual escalation of air
attacks would force him to give way. That did not work.
</P>
<P>
   The top NATO air commander, Lt. Gen. Michael C. Short of the
United States, indicated last week that he had wanted to hit hard
from the first night at Yugoslavian command centers, electrical
plants and the like. That, he told Michael R. Gordon of The New
York Times, would have sent a signal ``that we were taking the
gloves off from the very beginning, that we were not going to try a
little bit of this and see how you like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 days the bombing has become far heavier. But
there is still profound doubt that air power alone can achieve
NATO's objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of aid to the refugees in camps in Macedonia
and Albania have been told to begin thinking about winterizing the
camps. The implication must be that there is no confidence of
success for the air campaign by September. The refugees are
reported to be losing hope of an early return.
</P>
<P>
   So if NATO leaders are committed to defeating Milosevic, they
have to start moving now toward the use of ground forces. And the
leader who matters is Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton who ruled out ground forces from the start: an
undoubted mistake in military terms, because it enabled Milosevic
to have his 40,000 men in Kosovo kill and rape and expel civilians
without having to worry about defending against a ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to rely entirely on the air war may have serious
political and even moral consequences. We may succeed in destroying
Yugoslavia's economy without undoing Milosevic's savagery in
Kosovo. Think what that would do to respect for NATO and the United
States _ and to our self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has plans for what it calls an opposed ground entry into
Kosovo, and experts are updating them. What is needed now is a
decision to begin a process that will take months: mobilizing the
60,000 to 100,000 troops needed, getting them to the military
theater and training them.
</P>
<P>
   To give that signal would be difficult politically, and not just
for Clinton. The German government is divided, the Italians
reluctant. But if Clinton said yes, his decision would have a
transforming effect on other NATO members. The British and French
publics, according to polls, already favor the use of ground forces
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A move toward ground forces would concentrate Milosevic's mind
wonderfully. He is already showing signs of being rattled. His ploy
with Jesse Jackson and peace hints from some of his close
supporters suggest that he wants to find a way out that he could
call a draw _ and that would leave his internal position
unimpaired.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has bet for eight years that he could outlast and
outmaneuver Western critics. So far he has won. If Clinton's will
matches his words, Milosevic will not win this time. He will end
his political life as an indicted war criminal.

DRIVERS ARE PAID TO SMUGGLE FAMILIES FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Dr. Mustafe Abdyli and his family hid when
they heard a car approaching their house in southeastern Kosovo on
a recent Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The house had already been raided by Serbian soldiers who stole
a car, a tractor and even a pair of used sneakers, and Abdyli said
he and his family ``counted ourselves dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But to their astonishment, a yellow sedan with license plates
from Macedonia rolled into the driveway. The driver, a
mild-mannered man in civilian clothes, politely knocked on the
front door. Fighting an instinct to flee, Abdyli did something that
is extraordinary these days in Kosovo. He opened his door to a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced himself and gave me a letter my brother-in-law
had written,'' Abdyli, a gynecologist, said. ``It said my
brother-in-law had hired this man to bring us to Macedonia, and it
was safe to go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who identified himself only by the common Serbian first
name Srdjan, is one of 12 Serbian and Macedonian smugglers in
Skopje who are willing to enter Kosovo, retrieve ethnic Albanians
and take them to Macedonia, at a price. Abdyli's brother-in-law,
who lives in Switzerland, paid Srdjan $2,000 _ half up front, half
on delivery _ to smuggle his mother, his four children, his sister,
his brother-in-law and his nephew out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With the border between Macedonia and Kosovo virtually closed
for the ninth day in a row on Friday, a bidding war is erupting for
a small cadre of fearless well-connected smugglers. Their lucrative
daily runs are continuing largely unabated, said border monitors
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Typically entering Kosovo twice a day, the smugglers carry in
coffee, cigarettes and gasoline to sell to border guards and the
police or simply to bribe them. The smugglers return with their
human cargo, earning up to $5,000 a day, their customers said.
</P>
<P>
   As desperation grows, the cost of freedom is soaring. Abdyli
said Srdjan had become so busy that he was turning down business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is going higher and higher,'' Abdyli said. ``There
are a lot of people going to him. I spoke to one man who said he
would pay 10,000 Deutsche marks,'' or $7,000, ``to get his family
out. But he won't even talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although money can be an advantage, even the rich cannot simply
buy freedom in Kosovo. The randomness of the spot executions
described by Albanian refugees shows that the wealthy, as well as
the cautious, can have their lives end at the whim of a person with
a gun. Serbian paramilitary groups have singled out the houses of
Kosovars known to have relatives abroad who send back money.
</P>
<P>
   In a handful of circumstances, like those of Abdyli, wealth is a
decided help. His brother-in-law, Fadil Idrizi, who has lived in
Switzerland for 30 years, said he flew to Macedonia to gain his
family's freedom, no matter what the cost. Dozens of other ethnic
Albanians who live abroad and have returned with money are doing
the same.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the crossing between Macedonia and Kosovo in Blace on
Thursday, a middle-age Albanian waited anxiously for two smugglers
to return from Kosovo with his family. The man, who insisted on
anonymity, said he had gone to Macedonia from Bern, Switzerland, to
move his family out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The man refused to say how much he was paying the smugglers, but
said he had heard about their work in Switzerland. ``When I was in
Switzerland,'' he said, ``someone gave me the name and number of
this man in Skopje. They said, `When you go to Skopje, he can solve
your problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   A taxicab driver here who also insisted on anonymity said he
made the hourlong drive to Prizren in southern Kosovo last week to
retrieve the son and wife of a close friend. The driver, an ethnic
Turk with a Macedonian passport, said he agreed to make the trip
after his friend had traveled from Berlin to Macedonia to move his
family out of Kosovo and the smuggler he had hired refused to make
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The cabdriver's journey went smoothly, he said, until a police
commander seized the 17 cartons of cigarettes and the liquor that
he had planned to use to bribe his way through checkpoints, and he
had to pay a $200 fine. On the way back, at the Macedonian border,
the guards at first refused to allow the group to pass. But a
Serbian diplomat who was passing through helped them cross the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would go again,'' the cabdriver said. ``If
some good friend comes again that I couldn't say no to, maybe I
would.''
</P>
<P>
   After refugees reach Macedonia, money can buy a better fate.
Those who fled without being robbed of all their money and
possessions have often avoided being relegated to overcrowded
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian government considers those who enter the country
in a car to be visitors, not refugees, and allows them to go where
they wish. Refugees who can produce proof that a relative or friend
is willing to accommodate them in a private house are free to leave
the camps. Others bribe their way out.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of Abdyli and his family began when Idrizi flew on
April 25 from his house in Basel to Macedonia. In a week, he
recounted, he learned from friends and relatives that his family
was still in their hometown, Smira, an hour's drive from the
Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, he headed for the main border checkpoint in Blace in
search of a smuggler, Idrizi said. Recognizing a Serbian police
officer who was working as a Yugoslav border guard, he described
his plight. The officer gave him the name and telephone numbers of
two Serbian smugglers here.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Idrizi called them, he recalled. Both said they were
busy with other customers. They suggested Srdjan. Idrizi said that
when he met Srdjan that night, he paid him $1,000. The next day
Srdjan returned with the Abdyli family.
</P>
<P>
   At first, some members of the family had to live in a refugee
camp. But they eventually bribed their way out or moved in with
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Abdyli now lives with 14 people in a two-bedroom apartment here.
He said he was worried about relatives who remained in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A second effort, to rescue additional relatives, went awry last
week. Srdjan picked up Abdyli's uncle, aunt and other relatives in
their village, but he refused to transport Abdyli's teen-age
cousin, saying he could not guarantee the youth's safety.
</P>
<P>
   When the group reached the border, Macedonian officials, not
Serbs, refused to let the ethnic Albanians pass. Srdjan, saying he
had kept his part of the bargain, left the Albanians in the no
man's land between borders and departed with the $2,000 that he had
been paid so far. The stranded relatives managed to make their way
back to their village, said a neighbor who fled Kosovo several days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Abdyli said that he would not try such a risky rescue again and
that he held no bitterness toward Srdjan or the smugglers. ``It's
better that they go in and get the people,'' he said. ``It's OK
that they are taking money. Life is worth more than money.''

HE FREED THE AIRLINES. BUT WHAT TO DO NOW?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government rocked the airline industry on Thursday
when the Justice Department's antitrust division accused American
Airlines of illegally adding flights and slashing prices at its
Dallas-Fort Worth hub in order to drive out low-fare competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the first predatory-pricing suit by the government
against an airline since the industry was deregulated in 1978, and
it follows an 18-month Justice Department inquiry into complaints
that the major airlines have acted illegally to thwart lower-priced
competition in their hub cities.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines denied last week's charges, contending that
the essence of the lawsuit was to deny it the right to compete with
new-entrant carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit calls into question a basic premise of deregulation:
that, economically speaking, unfettered competition is all the
safeguard the flying public needs.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of airline deregulation was Alfred E. Kahn, now
the Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy Emeritus at
Cornell University. He is also a member of a National Academy of
Science committee that is evaluating airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Because American Airlines is a client of a research firm for
which he is a consultant, he would not speak to the specifics of
the lawsuit against American, but did agree to discuss its broader
implications. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Some economists say there is no such thing as
predatory pricing. Do you disagree?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My answer is not only yes, but that the airline industry is
particularly susceptible to it. Incumbent airlines can increase
capacity and then move it back out of the market again at
practically zero cost, and it can easily drive a new entrant out of
the market, because the entrant can also just move its planes
somewhere else. It's not like a manufacturing plant that can't
easily be moved. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Does it make sense for the government to be
scrutinizing the airlines' competitive practices?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A series of developments in the industry are a cause for real
concern. Hubs are most definitely an efficient way of organizing
the business, but most are dominated by a single airline, and that
creates the possibility of monopoly exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Yield management has resulted in a big spread between discount
fares and the unrestricted fares paid by a small group of people.
Adjusted for inflation, average fares since deregulation have gone
up 39 percent, and it appears that unrestricted fares have gone up
70 percent or more. That spread is not bad in itself, but there has
to be some limit short of re-regulation, which would be a mess. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Will the kinds of arguments the government will be
making find a sympathetic hearing in the courts?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's difficult to predict, because courts in the last couple
of years have become increasingly sold on the idea there is no
predation. But the economics profession has moved well beyond that
thinking. And you just can't say entry is easy; you have to see how
it is affected by the fate of previous entrants. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is there anything to the claim that the lawsuit is
potentially anti-consumer?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's an element of validity to that, because as long as
the criteria to be applied to fares are uncertain, it will create
some hesitation on the part of incumbent airlines as to how far to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer requires an exercise of judgment on our part.
I've seen one case where an incumbent carrier was offering fewer
than 1,500 low-fare tickets on a route, and when low-fare
competition came in, the incumbent increased its low-fare tickets
to 50,000. That's 50,000! And when the low-cost entrant was driven
out, the incumbent went back to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   So there's a balancing that has to be done. Right now it's too
much on the side of permitting very deep pinpointed fares
temporarily, until the competitors are driven out. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is re-regulation coming?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not in my view. But the industry usually loves the antitrust
laws, and the reason is that they think the doctrine of predation
under the Sherman Act has been so attenuated that no one can ever
bring a successful suit against them. And if ever a predation suit
were brought, they would immediately claim that's reimposing price
regulation.

ACCOUNTING BOARD MAY DEFER NEW RULE ON DERIVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's accounting rule makers may delay the date when
companies must begin following a controversial new rule that
requires them to record the value of derivatives in their financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has
received dozens of letters from public companies concerned about
the derivatives rule, said Timothy Lucas, the board's research
director. Many of the letters asked for a delay in the rule's
effective date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies must begin using the rule July 1, most
businesses must begin applying it on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies said in their letters that they were
concerned about instituting the complex rule, which will require
new computer programs, at the same time that they are working to
insure that their systems will make the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also said that a group created by the accounting
standards board, known as the Derivatives Implementation Group, had
not yet answered some critical questions from companies about how
to apply the new rules to certain types of derivative transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to vote on whether to postpone the rule
Wednesday, Lucas said. If approved, he said, the delay would most
likely be a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees to the companies' requests, it would be the
second time it has delayed the derivatives rule. Many companies
have lobbied against the rule, saying it is impractical. Some
banking companies even took their concerns about the proposed rules
to Congress, asking lawmakers to take away some of the accounting
standards board's rule-making powers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use derivative contracts to help manage business risks
like changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. The
transactions are known as derivatives because their value is
derived from an underlying asset.
</P>
<P>
   But the transactions are often risky bets on the future. An
example of the hefty losses that can result from investing in the
contracts came in September when Long-Term Capital Management, the
giant hedge fund with big bets in the derivatives market, nearly
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounting rule, which was approved by the accounting
board last June, requires companies to record the market value of
the derivatives on their balance sheets and to include the gains or
losses on those contracts in income. &QL;

SENATE GOP APPROVES LIMITED RESTRICTIONS ON FIREARMS SALES AT GUN
SHOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to counter claims they are controlled by the
gun lobby, Senate Republicans approved limited restrictions on
firearms sales at gun shows, a measure Democrats and President
Clinton described as ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders also indicated they will help pass a
provision to require child-safety locks on all guns sold, a measure
Democrats had pushed with little success before last month's
shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-47 vote on the gun-show legislation came two days after
they rejected tougher gun-show sales restrictions and pushed
through a measure to relax laws governing gun-show sales.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to contain the political fallout from that vote
Wednesday, the Republican leadership came up with its own version
of gun show restrictions, which the Democrats characterized as rife
with fine-print concessions to the gun lobby. The measure was
opposed by all but one Democrat, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators ``know the public wants gun control, but
they're afraid to offend the National Rifle Association,'' said
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people buying firearms from a licensed dealer
at a store or a show must undergo a background check. Unlicensed
vendors, who sell about 40 percent of the firearms at gun shows, do
not have to run those checks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Sen. Larry
Craig of Idaho, said the legislation passed Friday was designed to
require a background check on anyone seeking to make a purchase at
a gun show. The measure they muscled through Wednesday would have
required only voluntary checks in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said even the revised measure was flawed, claiming it
contains ambiguities about the gun-show checks, loosens current
regulations on pawnshop gun redemptions, weakens federal law
enforcement checks and record-keeping, and exempts gun sellers from
some civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Friday's vote, Clinton said ``the new Senate
Republican bill is still riddled with high-caliber loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure sponsored by Hatch and Craig ``won't stop criminals
from buying guns at gun shows. At the same time, it will open up a
new pawnshop loophole that lets convicted felons get guns,''
Clinton said. ``It's actually worse than current law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch bridled at the president's assertions. ``The president
doesn't know what's in there,'' the senator said, accusing Clinton
and the Democrats of playing gun politics. ``I hate to speak ill of
my president,'' Hatch said, ``but he hasn't told the truth about
this from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's rancorous debate on the Hatch-Craig measure,
which was being proposed as an amendment to a bill to crack down on
juvenile crime, Hatch offered to make corrections to mollify
Democratic critics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing they had the upper hand politically, the Democrats
refused to allow the Republicans to clarify the proposed amendment,
thus forcing them to vote on a measure open to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired of this stuff,'' Hatch said. ``We're trying to
solve this, others are trying to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm voted for
the Hatch-Craig amendment, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said lawmakers should ``do all we can to keep guns
from known criminals'' and to ``ensure the law is applied fairly,
so that transactions are covered whether in a store or at a gun
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the senator was ``indifferent to
the amendment because he counts it as inconsequential'' and would
have little effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly approved two other
gun-control measures _ one to prohibit juveniles from possessing
certain semiautomatic weapons, another to outlaw importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips. It was the first time since 1994
that the Senate had approved any gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Senate rejected a proposal that would require gun
dealers who peddle weapons over the Internet to comply with federal
licensing laws like most other firearms sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a longtime opponent of gun control, said he will
co-sponsor an amendment with Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., to require
anyone selling a firearm to equip it with a safety lock. The
Hatch-Kohl alliance makes passage of the proposal almost certain
when it comes up for a vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The various gun-control amendments are being pushed by Democrats
emboldened by public anti-gun sentiment in the wake of the high
school slayings in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have seized on a political issue, and I
understand that and regret that,'' said Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination and
one of a group of senators who helped engineer the GOP's reversal
on the gun shows amendment.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of contentious, time-consuming amendments awaiting
consideration, Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi
Republican, threatened to yank the bill off the floor if the two
sides fail to agree on how to wrap up debate and vote on the
juvenile justice bill by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden burst of gun-control activity in the Senate is
``another step in the effort to outlaw guns by the media and
Democrats,'' Lott said, adding, ``We're not going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bill and its gun-control amendments pass the Senate,
its fate is uncertain when it reaches the House, where opposition
to gun control generally has been stronger.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a squeaker of a vote, Senate Republicans on
Friday passed a measure to promote background checks at gun shows,
one that Democrats, preferring a more stringent proposal of their
own, almost solidly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the Senate seemed like a chamber turned upside
down, with Republicans pressing for a new gun control measure and
Democrats fighting vehemently against it. In reality, the
Democrats, concerned about many details of the Republican plan and
convinced that the political tide on gun control has turned in
their favor, were determined not to let Republicans steal any
credit for seeming to advocate stricter regulations for firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was preceded by intense bickering as members of each
party accused colleagues across the aisle of striking meaningless
poses and putting politics ahead of sound policy. The acrimony
underscored again how potent and volatile the issue of gun control
had become in the three weeks since the school shooting in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican gun show proposal passed by just one vote, 48-47,
as an amendment to a juvenile-justice bill whose fate on Capitol
Hill is uncertain. But the extraordinary political contortions
accompanying the gun-control debate made for high drama even this
early in the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democrat, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, joined 47
Republicans in favor, while seven Republicans sided with Democrats
in opposition to it. Four Democrats and one Republican were absent.
Byrd's office did not return calls seeking explanation for the
senator's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats immediately lambasted the measure, co-sponsored
by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, as a
cunningly crafted illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hatch-Craig amendment has more special effects than the
new `Star Wars' movie,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that Democrats were intent on vilifying
them. ``They prefer the gun battle to doing what's right,'' Hatch
said after the vote. ``And I tell you, it's driving me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Craig said that their measure would require all
vendors at gun shows, whether professional dealers or hobbyists, to
conduct background checks on prospective buyers. It augmented
another amendment by Craig, passed by Republicans on Wednesday,
that merely made it easier for vendors to conduct voluntary checks.
</P>
<P>
   After voting both for the amendment on voluntary checks and
against a stricter Democratic version, a number of moderate
Republicans grew worried that the party had embarrassed itself, and
they urged leaders to put forward a tougher-looking plan. But there
was serious question Friday about whether the new amendment that
Republicans passed was much different from the first.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats looked at the dense thicket of legalese and said that
it created a new category of vendor, neither professional salesman
nor collector, who would be exempt from conducting background
checks. Gun control advocates and Clinton administration officials
concurred with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Democrats were wrong. But before Friday's
vote, Hatch tried to introduce a clarification that emphasized that
all vendors at gun shows were obliged to conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rejected its introduction, saying it did not solve
many other problems. For example, the amendment would eliminate the
current obligation of pawn shop owners to conduct background checks
on customers returning to get firearms out of hock.
</P>
<P>
   It would, additionally, give licensed dealers more freedom to
sell guns at shows outside the states in which they are licensed.
And it would shorten, to 24 hours from three business days, the
time that licensed dealers at gun shows are given to conduct
background checks. Licensed dealers are already obliged to perform
those checks, but other vendors are not.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote Friday morning, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and Attorney General Janet Reno released a statement opposing the
new amendment. President Clinton derided it as ``riddled with
high-caliber loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ``The
Republicans take a step forward and a step back, a step to the
right and a step to the left. They are truly the gang who couldn't
shoot straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said that the pawn-shop and 24-hour provisions of his
amendment were simply attempts to untangle law-abiding citizens
from unnecessary regulations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had written his amendment himself, but he
acknowledged having submitted it for legal review to a lawyer for
the National Rifle Association. Craig is on the association's board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who voted against his new amendment included
advocates of gun control, like John Chafee of Rhode Island, John
Warner of Virginia and Pete Fitzgerald of Illinois, all of whom
voted for the Democratic gun show amendment earlier in the week and
obviously found the new Republican alternative insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican dissenters also included strong opponents of gun
control, like Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Craig Thomas of Wyoming
and Michael Enzi of Wyoming, who clearly thought the new amendment
was too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., also opposed the new amendment,
explaining later that he thought it meddled in matters that should
be left to local discretion.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote came down to the wire, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, and other Republicans hustled over to Smith and Thomas, who
did not change their negative votes, and to Sen. Richard Shelby of
Alabama and Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana, who did. Those switches
ensured victory.
</P>
<P>
   The close vote suggested that the passage of the juvenile crime
bill itself, which is expected either to proceed to a final vote on
Tuesday or be shelved for weeks or months, was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., agreed to meet this
weekend to talk about adjustments to the gun control amendment that
might leave Democrats happier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a separate juvenile crime bill in the House Judiciary
Committee, but it is unlikely to become a similar vehicle for gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   In another vote Friday, senators defeated, 50-43, a measure by
Schumer to prohibit unlicensed gun dealers from selling over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch signed on as a co-sponsor of a Democratic amendment,
to be debated next week, that would require the sale of safety
locks with all handguns. It was yet another sign of Republicans'
eagerness not to be seen as unyielding foes of gun control.

DUKE CLEARED TO CONTINUE FEDERALLY FUNDED HUMAN EXPERIMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to change coding; no textual changes)   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A four-day-old ban on federally financed human experiments at
Duke University Medical Center was lifted Friday after Duke
officials agreed to overhaul its protections for human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's license to conduct research on humans was suspended late
Monday, after the federal Office of Protection from Research Risks
found 20 violations of ethics and safety rules at the university
and said that Duke had failed to correct them over a period of
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ellis, chief of the ethics office, said in a telephone
interview Friday that Duke officials, who flew to Washington on
Thursday to meet with him, had presented a ``satisfactory
corrective action plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will monitor Duke closely over the next year or so to make
sure the plan is fully implemented,'' he said. ``This is the
beginning for Duke, not an ending.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they were pleased with the decision
and promised to strengthen its protections of human subjects,
starting with an overhaul of its Institutional Review Board, the
body that reviews each proposed human experiment at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know action is required of us now, but we are now committed
to developing a model IRB program,'' Dr. Edward W. Holmes, dean of
the School of Medicine at Duke, said in a telephone interview. ``It
will make the university stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the resolution produced Friday could and
should have come months earlier, but ``the important point now is
to look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Duke's plan, the university will have to make a complete
review of at least 274 experiments that had been approved by the
IRB, Holmes said, and possibly more. The university will also have
to retrain and educate each member of the review board, called the
Institutional Review Board, and put all experimenters who work with
human subjects through additional training as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis expressed relief that the negotiations went well and that
Duke's proposed plan is ``very good.'' He added that ``four months
of denial by Duke University Medical Center of inadequacies in
human subject protections finally ended this week. It is our
experience that some programs that have had problems like this in
the past have later become the best centers in terms of protection.
That could well be the case with Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Puglisi, at OPRR, said he believed that the most
important part of Duke's new plan is the extensive plans to educate
review board members and scientists. They will not only take
courses, but attended national conferences on human
experimentation, and have regular lectures on human experimentation
and the federal rules that govern it.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began for Duke late last year when the OPRR decided
to visit Duke University and conduct a routine examination of its
system for reviewing and approving human experiments. There are
about 2,000 such experiments there now, ranging from the testing of
new drugs and medical devices to behavioral research aimed at
improving patients' abilities to deal with illness.
</P>
<P>
   The OPRR, an agency of the Department of Health and Human
Services, monitors all human experiments carried out with federal
financing around the nation. They visited Duke at least partly
because Duke was the only one of the top 15 research universities
that they had not heard from for years. Most universities
periodically call with questions or to ask for advice.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators visited Duke in December 1998, they found an
array of irregular practices, most of them failures of Duke's
review board. The membership of the board was short on citizen
representation, meetings were apparently held and research approved
without most board members present, strict rules were apparently
waived with little discussion. There was no full-time employee at
the university to handle human experiment review. Informed consent
for the patients appeared to be less than the law requires,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But what was most startling to the investigators was that after
a long list of violations were given to Duke, Duke's response
seemed to be less than serious. Investigators pressed the
university several more times, but still got only limited attempts
to come into compliance with the law, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on Monday evening, OPRR notified the university that it
was going to suspend the federal government's permission to carry
on research with humans.

   NEW YORK _ Everybody snickered last July when the Zapata Corp.,
an obscure over-the-counter purveyor of fish byproducts, said that
it was morphing into an Internet company. But when its stock more
than doubled on the news, the snickerers went silent. If the gambit
could propel shares of an unknown like Zapata, why not those of
more established companies?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``Internet, c'est moi'' strategy went big league.
On Wednesday, shares in Starbucks, the trendy coffee emporium, hit
a 52-week high when Scott Waltman, a Merrill Lynch analyst,
reported that the company would announce an Internet strategy in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, IBM's shares rocketed $20.50, or 9.1 percent,
after the company's chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., told analysts
that a quarter of IBM's sales came from Internet-related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   So a murmur of the ``I'' word added $19 billion to IBM's market
value and $420 million to Starbucks'. The gains proved evanescent _
IBM shares lost $5.7 billion of the gain on Friday and Starbucks'
value fell about $216 million by the end of the week _ but wealth
was created nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can be forgiven for embracing the Internet, because it
is, indeed, changing the way things work. But people rushing to
whatever.com are forgetting a cardinal rule of investing: Making
money from world-changing events is tricky at best.
</P>
<P>
   Warren E. Buffett pointed this out May 3 at Berkshire Hathaway's
annual meeting. In the question-and-answer period he noted that two
industries born in the 20th century had changed the course of
history _ airlines and autos. But while they are wonderful
businesses, Buffett said, they have proven to be lousy investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even as IBM and Starbucks were enriching shareholders by laying
claims to Internet status, news from the Web was not all upbeat.
New issues of Internet stocks were mixed. A hot number was
TheStreet.com (in which The New York Times Co. owns a minority
stake), issued Tuesday at $19 a share. It closed the day at $60,
but fell off to $46.25 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler heads prevailed in two Wednesday offerings. Careerbuilder
Inc., an online job recruiter, went public at $13 and closed the
week at $14.25, up 9.6 percent from the offering. That was a modest
showing for an Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   And Biznessonline.com, a company that designs Web sites and
offers Internet access, went public at $10, ran up to $17.875 but
closed Friday at $11.25.
</P>
<P>
   Last week also included the results of a Securities and Exchange
Commission crackdown on Internet fraud. Regulators filed charges
against 8 companies and 18 individuals, and warned that the SEC's
``cyberforce'' would bring more cases. Would-be Net fraudsters
might want to reconsider their plans over a strong cup of Starbucks
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the cafe, it is intriguing to note that even as
Starbucks was planning its Internet foray, insiders at the company
were busy selling shares. Through April, according to First Call,
insiders sold 1.44 million shares; in all of 1998 they sold 2.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   A Starbucks' spokesman said that diversification was behind the
insider stampede, not skepticism about the Web strategy. ``Most of
our executives have a large part of their net worth tied to
Starbucks,'' said the spokesman, Alan Gulick. But the selling does
make for a murky brew.

GORE HOPES RIDING BAY STATE STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With Al Gore's presidential quest off to a lanquid
start, a straw poll among delegates to the state Democratic Party
convention in Springfield Saturday could raise more concern in his
campaign if the vice president does not trounce former Senator Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials in both camps deny the candidates have put any
significant effort into winning votes, but both sides lobbied
delegates this week, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston, for one, has
coordinated a statewide effort to identify Gore supporters and urge
them to attend the convention, according to former Senator Warren
Tolman, who co-drafted the ``action agenda'' to be discussed
Saturday. A top elected state official, who asked not to be named,
said that Bradley's supporters have been at work as well.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll, the first of its kind in the 2000 presidential
race, will be held during the first three hours of the convention,
which kicks off at 10 a.m. The stakes are amorphous, at best, 18
months before the election at an off-year state convention where
attendance is expected to be low and comprised primarily of
activists.
</P>
<P>
   But in a contest where Bradley is gaining ground on a vice
president who appears to be treading water, a showing of 30 to 40
percent for the former New Jersey senator could worry the captains
of Gore's formidable campaign machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they've been running for president for
three years, and we've been running for president for three days,''
said Michael Goldman, a political consultant and Bradley supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said Bradley will be pleased with 5 percent of the vote,
but observers speculated that the camp is hoping to gain 30 to 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Paul E. Caron, a Springfield Democrat and Bradley
supporter who made the state committee motion to conduct the straw
poll, has been under pressure for weeks from top Massachusetts and
national party officials who did not want an internecine fight this
early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think campaigns have gotten away from dealing with
one-on-one contacts with delegates, the foot soldiers of the
party,'' Caron said in explaining his support for the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield Mayor Michael Albano, a Gore supporter who publicly
endorsed the vice president Friday with 19 other Massachusetts
mayors, said he had been asked by state and national Democratic
officials to urge that the poll be canceled in the interests of
conserving party resources.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, the former Democratic National Committee
chairman, echoed that rationale. ``I think they consume a vast
amount of time and resources, financial and otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting an ``action agenda'' is the ostensible reason why more
than 3,000 delegates have been summoned to Springfield, but fewer
than 2,000 may attend. Tolman, who co-authored the agenda with
Senator Linda Melconian of Springfield, said the package sets goals
for such issues as education, economic equality, health care,
economic security, and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Governor Howard Dean will deliver the keynote speech. US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy also will address the convention.

FOR GORE, COELHO BRINGS ASSETS, BUT MAYBE LIABILITIES TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1981, Ronald Reagan had just become president,
Republicans had taken control of the Senate and Democrats were
desperately hanging on to the House as a last bastion. Tony Coelho,
a young second-term congressman from California, was put in charge
of raising money for House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, Coelho revolutionized the party,
placing fund raising above ideology as the Democratic credo,
cultivating ties with fat cats and business interests previously at
odds with Democratic politicians and, in the view of grateful
colleagues, solidifying Democratic control of the House for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 10 years ago this month, having risen to the position of
House whip, the third-ranking post in the Democratic hierarchy,
Coelho abruptly announced his resignation from Congress, saying he
wanted to avoid the agony of an ethics investigation into his
personal finances involving a junk bond investment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having earned by his own account a fortune on Wall Street,
Coelho (pronounced QUELL-oh) is returning to the center stage of
Democratic politics as the full-time, unpaid chairman of Vice
President Al Gore's campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He brings to the campaign a reputation as a peerless organizer
and tactician, a compelling performer on television and a natural
leader who can stabilize a team that seemed to be drifting.
</P>
<P>
   But Coelho, 56, also carries the baggage of a Washington
insider, more serious about strategy than substance, who introduced
the Democratic Party to strong-armed fund-raising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   This presents a potential problem since Gore has surrounded
himself with other insiders of a similar ilk and since the way the
vice president himself solicited money in 1996 is an obvious target
of attack from his political opponents. Campaign finance reform is
already a principal theme of former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Coelho said he expected to bring
``enthusiasm, discipline and decision-making'' to the Gore
campaign. ``One of these days, you're going to write that Tony
turned the campaign around,'' he said. ``But that won't be true.
This campaign already is in very good shape, money-wise,
personnel-wise, any way you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not personally be involved in soliciting
donations. Asked for his philosophy on fund raising generally, he
replied: ``Let's make sure we have the right amount of money to run
a campaign. Let's make sure we do it legally and ethically and in a
way that fits in with the campaign. I'm not interested in getting
tobacco money when we're preaching about controls on smoking. I'm
not interested in gun manufacturers' money. I think we're going to
raise the money easily without violating any of these standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leading Democratic politicians who are backing the
Gore candidacy say they are enthusiastic about Coelho's
appointment. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, said, for
instance, that Coelho would add much-needed leadership and
structure to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., chairman of the campaign
committee for Democratic candidates for the Senate, said of Coelho:
``There are very few more effective operators in American politics.
He combines good instincts with a tremendous sense of organizing
and networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who was first elected to the House in 1982 with
Coelho's support, added a thought that was expressed by a
half-dozen other Democrats who served with Coelho in the House and
who were interviewed this week: ``My career would have been
remarkably different if it hadn't been for Tony Coelho.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Gore supporters take a dim view of the appointment.
They worry that the vice president will be tainted by soils on
Coelho's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a former congressman who spoke on condition he not
be named said: ``I don't think this is something the vice president
needs. Here is a squeaky-clean public office-holder who needs to
make clear that he is an independent person whose fund raising and
other activities are completely above board. This association with
Coelho has the potential for raising questions that compromise the
candidate in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded, some said, by the presence of others
at the top of the Gore campaign whose ethics have been scrutinized
by congressional committees and in some instances the Justice
Department, though no charges have been brought. Those mentioned
include Peter Knight, chairman of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign;
Terence McAuliffe, that campaign's chief fund-raiser, and Richard
Sullivan, finance director of the Democratic National Committee in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, who was a political and policy adviser in the
Clinton White House, said: ``Gore's problem is that this crowd of
people whose institutional connections are so strong aren't the
best people to enliven his candidacy, to give it substance and
clarity of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When those views were read to Coelho, he responded:
``Ninety-nine point nine percent of American people don't know who
Tony Coelho is. What they care about are Al Gore's views on
education and health and values. He's going to articulate those
things, and no one is going to pay any attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Coelho's contribution to the ethos of
congressional politics was to integrate incumbency and fund
raising. It was detailed in a 1988 book by Brooks Jackson, ``Honest
Graft: Big Money and the American Political Process.'' Coelho is
the central figure in the book, but he said he had never read it.
</P>
<P>
   The book documented how Coelho curried favor with and solicited
large donations from shady savings and loan association owners,
some of whom were ultimately convicted of fraud that cost the
government millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The book also showed how Coelho had threatened political action
committees with retaliation if they did not donate money to
Democrats, how he arranged lucrative speaking engagements for
himself and his Democratic colleagues, how he fought against
campaign-finance and tax-reform legislation that might have limited
fund raising or worked to the disadvantage of Democratic donors and
how, after soliciting money from the Teamsters Union, he tried to
intervene with the Justice Department on behalf of the union's
president, Jackie Presser.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Friday, Coelho said he had no apologies to
make. ``I tried to make campaign finance competitive and prevent
Reagan from taking over control of Congress,'' he said. ``I don't
back away from that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1989, with the Democratic speaker, Jim Wright,
under fierce attack for ethics violations that led to his
resignation, Coelho came under fire for having profited from a junk
bond in what looked like a sweetheart deal arranged through the
firm of Michael Milken.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho quickly resigned from Congress, saying he did not want to
put himself, his family or his party through the pain of an
investigation. Later, he sought and received a letter from the
Reagan Justice Department clearing him of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho did not quietly slink out of town like Wright or Gingrich
when they resigned. He threw a big party at the Rayburn Building
with a Dixieland Band, and the next time he surfaced he was on Wall
Street, putting together business deals at the investment house
Wertheim Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   After Wertheim Schroder broke up two years ago, Coelho started
two companies of his own, an educational technology firm and one
dealing with backroom mortgage loan processing.
</P>
<P>
   He loves business, he said in the interview. Among the
conditions of his accepting Gore's offer of the campaign
chairmanship, he said, were that he would not be paid and that he
would accept no government position should Gore be elected
president. ``I want to go back into business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was on Wall Street, he had one brief foray into
politics. In the summer of 1994, as the congressional election
campaigns were heating up, the White House made Coelho a senior
adviser to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, of course, turned out disastrously for the
Democrats, with Republicans winning control of the Senate and the
House. Coelho said his entire role involved occasional political
meetings at the White House and a few television appearances for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I advised,'' Coelho said. ``They didn't take my advice.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was the advice? ``I never comment on the private advice
I give,'' he said.

WOMAN'S VIBRANT SPIRIT BLOOMED WHILE WORKING WITH WPA WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Betrenia Bowker is a petite and dignified
86-year-old woman who once ran with the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting recently in her pleasant Kansas City home, talking
quietly of old times, she dropped only the faintest hint that in
summer 1936 she fell in with the wildest bunch of writers,
painters, brawlers, poets and raw-jaw radicals who ever knocked
back a boilermaker in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that summer in St. Louis was hot,'' is what she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that can be taken two ways. Because it was hot that summer,
literally hot, 100 degrees for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to St. Louis, I actually saw the mercury
shoot right through the top of a thermometer on a building,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She saw other things: Depression homeless sleeping in doorways;
union picket lines and unemployment demonstrations; radical
speakers on almost every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the heat to which she alluded had more than one source.
Fresh-faced and fresh out of Drury College in Springfield,
Mo.,Bowker had unknowingly leaped into a political cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   She had been hired by the Works Progress Administration to help
put out the Missouri edition of the now-famed WPA state-guide
series. The guides were prepared by unemployed writers hired by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the guide was way behind schedule,'' she said, ``and the
people in Washington were getting impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowker saw the problem immediately. Missouri's project
administrators were at war with the guide's writing staff, a group
that included Missouri-born Jack Conroy, already noted for his
classic Depression novel ``The Disinherited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conroy and the other writers wanted to produce an honest,
literary portrait of Missouri,'' Bowker said. ``But the
administrators, real political hacks, wanted a sanitized,
chamber-of-commerce tourist guide.''
</P>
<P>
   When Conroy wrote a section on Missouri culture that highlighted
Ozark folk ballads and black music, he was ``reprimanded'' for not
hyping tonier subjects such as the symphony orchestras in St. Louis
and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle was on,'' Bowker said, ``and it was getting hotter
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Writers' Program was based on the ninth floor of
the Civil Courts Building in downtown St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a short ramble to the old Mississippi
riverfront levee, where the writers gathered almost nightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go down to the river at about 10 p.m. and stay until 2 in
the morning, drinking and talking about writing and politics,''
Bowker said. ``And when all those fascinating, worldly people
discussed their views on social justice, well, they made sense to
me. I became a left-wing New Dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowker had grown up in southern Missouri, one of seven children
in a very proper, very conservative home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had twin sisters, two years older than I was,'' she said.
``And when they turned 16, they each asked for a raisin pie and
permission to say `Gosh.' That should give you an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, Bowker had read of Voltaire and the Age of
Enlightenment, and she dreamed of finding true companions to match
her secret rebel spirit.
</P>
<P>
   She found them on the St. Louis riverfront, eight or nine
kindred souls who made her feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fascinating part is that Betrenia was so plain-spoken and
intelligent that she more than held her own with those wild,
hard-living characters,'' said Douglas Wixson, a social historian
and Conroy biographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She proved tough and savvy, and they all fell in love with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy was the leader of that literary wild bunch. Raised in a
tough mining camp, barrel-chested, stentorian-voiced, he bellowed
even in private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have a beer with him and imagine he was addressing a
huge throng of coal miners,'' Bowker said.
</P>
<P>
   He was bellowing more than usual that summer. In a constant rage
about the state guide, he blew off steam in riverfront saloons.
</P>
<P>
   His regular drinking crew included poet William ``Wallie''
Wharton and other guide writers such as Edwa Moser, Jean Winkler,
Jack Balch and Milton Lomask. They adopted Bowker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd always wanted to see a barroom brawl, and they kept
trying to find me one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me places (strip joints and honky tonks) where women
did things I didn't know human beings could do. We went to bars
with sawdust on the floor and people singing and making speeches
and reciting poetry from on top of the tables.''
</P>
<P>
   She was enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first cigarette? they'd ask me. Is this your
first shot of whiskey? Of course, they never took me along to the
really rough places where they hung out in East St. Louis. They
were very protective of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing her barroom brawls, they wrote her about them
after she returned to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fightin', fightin', all night,'' Winkler wrote in one letter
to Bowker. ``One man'd go down and the winner would take on
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And though they excluded her from the harder side of their boozy
nights, they did include her in their almost daily escapades, often
led by Wharton, a brilliant satirist and merry prankster.
</P>
<P>
   ``A men's clothing association was trying to popularize shorts
for men that summer,'' Bowker recalled. ``So they offered free
drinks to any man who walked into a bar wearing shorts. Wallie
walked in wearing his underpants. He got the free drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wharton also enjoyed playing a world-weary cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on to your pure and lovely innocence, Betrenia,'' he
would intone. ``Oh, if I could just recover mine once more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever recover it?'' she once asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yes, many times, but I just keep losing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   After that summer, Bowker went back to Springfield to work as
the guide's regional editor there. She left the project entirely in
1937, as did most of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   The WPA Guide to Missouri remained mired in conflict. The book
was not published until 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The fears expressed by Conroy and the others proved
well-grounded. Most of their work was edited out and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we would have produced,'' said Bowker, who
taught school for a while, married, moved to Kansas City, raised a
family and became a successful free-lance magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   In time she lost touch with most of the St. Louis bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' she said, ``1936 seemed long, long in the past.
But recently those memories have been coming back to me. And I've
been thinking more and more about that wonderful hot summer in St.
Louis.''

HOW STRONG IS THE INFLATION PRESSURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Does a one-month inflationary blip on the Consumer
Price Index radar screen signal the end of U.S. price stability?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the financial market's initial reaction to Friday's
CPI report, it seems reasonable to think so. The revelation that
consumer prices took their biggest monthly jump in nearly nine
years put Wall Street in retreat, as stock prices tumbled and bond
rates surged.
</P>
<P>
   The overall CPI rose 0.7 percent last month, which wasn't much
higher than consensus expectations. What jarred the markets,
however, was a 0.4 percent gain for the so-called core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy components.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters had expected only a 0.1 percent rise for the
core rate, based on assumptions that rising oil prices would fuel
most of the CPI's gain. As things turned out, the energy
component's increase was not only a record, but also was
accompanied by serious price pops over a broad range of items.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seldom does anything in moderation, and Friday was
no exception. A good rule of thumb, however, is that the greater
Wall Street's overreaction, the better the chance things aren't as
bad as they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective, as always, is key. Friday's report, for instance,
made much of the fact that the core rate's surge was the sharpest
monthly jump since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Think back to what has been happening since. Looking
beyond the core rate, the overall CPI rose 2.5 percent in '95. The
following year brought a slight resurgence, as the CPI rose 3.3
percent in '96. A cooling period then followed, with the inflation
rate dipping to 1.7 percent 1997 and to 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of inflation, incidentally, was all the more
remarkable in the context of a strong economy and a tightening
labor market that pushed the jobless rate down to levels not seen
in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping things in perspective demands taking the long view of
economic developments. It also demands taking into account all of
inflation's contributing factors, of which the cost of labor is the
most critical. Despite the tight job market, subdued labor costs
are a primary reason for the recent absence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are signs that the U.S. economy is entering an
era of strong productivity gains fueled by computers, which will be
to the early 21st century what electricity was to the early 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In order for inflation to occur, there must be inflationary
dynamics in play. So far nothing happening in the U.S. economy
provides valid evidence of incipient hyperinflation except energy
prices. Energy price scares have been a cyclical thing for the past
20 years, though. Nevertheless, periods of energy price spikes have
been short-lived, while the periods of relatively low energy prices
have been long.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is monetary policy to consider for those who
believe inflation is strictly a monetary phenomenon. On this count,
there seems little to worry about as long as inflation hawk Alan
Greenspan remains Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, in other words, is a chimera. There's much out there
that might bring the good times to an end, but inflation isn't one
of them in the absence of inflationary dynamics.

 &HT;    Poll shows black investors growing
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the past three years, Lee Jenkins, a stockbroker
with Raymond James &AMP; Associates, has seen the number of black
clients increase dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say African-Americans are a lot more proactive about
building wealth,'' he said. ``I believe a lot of African-Americans
have realized they need to have their long-term money in the market
instead of the bank or some other place.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll commissioned by Ariel Mutual Funds and Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. Inc. supports that view.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Ariel/Schwab Black Investor Survey examines the
spending patterns, upbringing and overall attitudes toward
investing that might keep many African-Americans from investing
with brokerage firms or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans have done more in the past year to better
familiarize themselves with the stock market,'' said Mellody
Hobson, senior vice president of Chicago-based Ariel. ``That's very
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found blacks were more likely than whites _ 58 percent
vs. 46 percent _ to read books about saving and investing; to
attend an investing seminar (28 percent vs. 22 percent); or join an
investment club (10 percent vs. 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also served as a way for blacks to find
information.
</P>
<P>
   Among noninvestors, 48 percent of blacks and 34 percent of
whites said they were likely to start investing this year.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, of 813 black households and 816 white households with
incomes of more than $50,000, was conducted by Yankelovich
Partners. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not address whether the percentage of
African-Americans owning stock has increased. Last year's study
found that 57 percent of blacks owned stocks, compared to 81
percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black women are the least likely of all groups surveyed to
invest in stocks, but when they do, are more open to seeking
professional investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   _ When blacks were asked where they keep most of their assets,
44 percent said banks, vs. 31 percent of whites; 17 percent of
blacks said insurance companies, compared to 10 percent of whites;
and 30 percent of blacks listed mutual funds or brokerage houses,
compared to 51 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   _ The median amount blacks save and invest every month is $173,
up from $146 a year ago.

 &HT;    Global considers merger with US West
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In yet another sign that stock value can make giants
out of companies that are barely profitable, Global Crossing Ltd.
is reportedly in merger talks with US West.
</P>
<P>
   If the feisty, 2-year-old Bermuda-based company does buy US
West, the deal would produce a $17 billion company. It would also
leave BellSouth as the last of the seven Bells with an identity and
turf unchanged in the 15 years since the Bells were spun out of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Global Crossing and US West declined comment. CNBC
and Bloomberg News reported that talks between the companies were
headed for a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing in March announced a $12.5 billion purchase of
Frontier Communications, an acquisition that has not been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The company's acquisitiveness has been mostly fueled by its
stock value, a tactic that allowed Mississippi-based WorldCom to
buy UUNet, MCI and other smaller companies, turning from a
minor-league long-distance company into one of the world's largest
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge for Global Crossing is Chief Executive Robert
Annunziata, who had been CEO of Teleport Communications Group.
Global Crossing was founded by Gary Winnick, a former Drexel
Burnham Lambert bond trader.
</P>
<P>
   US West has, like BellSouth, often been mentioned as a spectator
to the series of megamergers sweeping through telecommunications.
US West is profitable, but unlike BellSouth, it is not seen as an
especially attractive target.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bacurin, an analyst with JC Bradford &AMP; Co., said Global
Crossing might see the deal as a route to a surge of capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, US West is the weakest Bell with a mostly rural region,
and it would not provide the kind of advantages that usually spur a
merger. For example, when Bell Atlantic bought Nynex, it added a
turf that was at its border and could carry millions of phone calls
from beginning to end. Global Crossing wouldn't get that with US
West, he said. ``It makes zero sense to me. I can't imagine you've
got a lot of sheep farmers in Wyoming who want to make calls to
Pakistan.

 &HT;    Sears fined over child labor laws
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Department of Labor has accused Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. of violating child labor laws, and the agency said
more investigations of retailers and other employers are on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The federal probe found that 227 teen-agers were working at
Sears in violation of child labor laws. Sears allegedly violated
child labor laws in 44 stores nationwide. Sears has agreed to pay a
$325,000 fine, audit stores for problems each year and better train
its managers. Under an agreement reached this week, Sears did not
admit any wrongdoing. Sears, the nation's largest department store
and second-largest retailer, has 11,150 workers under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman used the announcement of the
settlement to warn employers that she's focused on more crackdowns
as the summer job rush approaches in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that our young people have constructive
early work experiences, but it is equally important that their jobs
are safe and complement their education, rather than compete with
it,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Labor Department investigators in 23 states reviewed
employment records covering two years at 71 of the retailer's 845
department stores. Violations were allegedly found in more than
half of the stores investigated.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases cited, 16- and 17-year-old workers were operating
forklifts, freight elevators and other heavy machinery, which is
prohibited by labor law. In a few instances, 15-year-old employees
were working too many hours. About 60 percent of teen-age workers
have retail jobs, Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this case sends a signal to other employers,'' Herman
said. ``Time and time again, we find that employers don't know the
child-labor laws in detail.'' Federal and state laws have different
requirements, depending on the age of the employee and the type of
work.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, child labor violations are rare considering the
large number of employers that rely on teen-agers to fill jobs,
said John Clark, child labor chief for the state Department of
Labor. The department depends on the public to notify it of
possible infractions. It also screens work permits for underage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, unless someone calls us, we're not aware of
the problem,'' Clark said. The most frequent complaint stems from
employers who use teen-agers and children for door-to-door sales of
candy, cookies and magazines. In many cases, the youths are too
young to work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people bring kids to a neighborhood, dump them out and
leave them unsupervised. That's a threat to the safety of the
children,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials said parents should be responsible
for becoming familiar with their children's workplaces and
assessing safety. As part of its agreement, Sears will provide
informational material to parents of workers under age 18.

 &HT;    10 Georgia businesses on Working Woman 500
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten businesses in Georgia, all in metro Atlanta, made
the Working Woman magazine 500, an annual list of companies based
on revenue, ownership, and title and duties of the top female
executive. The firms generated $80.7 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Working Woman 500 celebrates entrepreneurship, not simple
affluence,'' the magazine said. For a company to make the list, a
woman must be the largest individual shareholder or must share
ownership equally with a partner or family member and hold a
position as CEO, chair or president.
</P>

   The highest-ranked company in Georgia is packaging giant
Printpack, at No. 18. Its chairwoman, Gay Love, oversees 4,000
employees and $899 million in revenues. Last year, Printpack also
was No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Ellis, president of Atlanta Classic Cars, ranked No. 104,
up from No. 133 last year, said inclusion on the list has been good
for business. ``Women come in alone all the time, buying for
themselves. I tell the guys not to talk to women any differently
than they do a man,'' she said. ``We make it we try to make it easy
for women to do business here.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie McLure, CEO of No. 184-ranked McLure Oil, uses the list
partially to set goals for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed because we dropped in the ranking this
year (from No. 130),'' McLure said. ``Our gross revenues are
heavily affected by prices of crude oil, and prices last year
plummeted. This year we'll probably do double we did last year. My
goal is for us to be in the top 100 next year.''

SECRECY CONCERNS MAY HAVE LED TO MISTAKEN ATTACK ON EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful of security leaks, planners of the
disastrous US bombing raid that hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
excluded from their discussions former US embassy personnel in
Yugoslavia who were intimately familiar with the Yugoslav capital
and would have known the location of the Chinese mission.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 professional-level federal employees worked in the
American Embassy in Belgrade before the final deterioration of
US-Yugoslav relations. Some were intelligence operatives; many had
spent years there.
</P>
<P>
   But due to the intelligence concerns about the danger of leaks,
none of these people were included in discussions of bombing
targets, according to a senior administration source. Instead,
people who may have been able to correct sites chosen from outdated
maps were asked to leave planning sessions on the Yugoslav crisis
when the targets were being discussed, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who did not have
an intimate acquaintance with the potential targets, sat in with
the very small group of high military and intelligence officials
who discussed the targets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Pentagon and CIA had made full use of State
Department resources in their planning, State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin would not answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that everybody involved has expressed their
apologies,'' he said, ``and everybody involved knows that a tragic
mistake occurred. Mistakes do occur. . . . We will continue to work
with the Pentagon and other agencies . . . and we will try to help
more rather than less.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing follows a host of lesser-known mistakes and
miscalculations that paved the way to high-profile blunders, such
as underestimating Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
overestimating the effectiveness of air power, according to
think-tank and university-based specialists, many of whom are
former US officials and current advisers to the government.
</P>
<P>
   These errors-behind-the-errors, they say, have deeply disturbing
implications for America's capacity to deal with strife and with
renegade leaders in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The American approach to the Balkans has revealed a flawed grasp
of the nature and intensity of ethnic nationalism, a capacity to
ignore well-sourced intelligence that gets in the way of political
policy, a lack of flexibility in the face of changing
circumstances, and a tendency to bluff without knowing what to do
if the bluff is called, the specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was not unreasonable to try bombing to get the
Serbs to the (negotiating) table,'' said Ivo H. Daalder, a National
Security Council aide to President Clinton and coordinator of
Bosnia policy during Clinton's first administration. But before the
bombing started, the calculation was never that at a certain level
of pain Milosevic would come to the table, Daalder said; it was
that the Yugoslav leader thought the Americans were bluffing, and
would negotiate as soon he saw they were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not unreasonable to believe he thought we were
bluffing,'' Daalder said. ``We had bluffed before and not followed
through on our threats'' that were made repeatedly from the end of
the Bush administration right up to the launching of NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear quite quickly, certainly by the end of the first
weekend, that a little bombing wouldn't do the trick,'' he said.
``The real choice on March 27 was to go in with ground troops, or
quit because it wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States recalculated in a way that
rationalized continuing and intensifying the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A misreading of the lessons of the war in Bosnia, lack of a
serious effort to understand the Serb perspective, and inattention
to information coming out of Kosovo and Serbia all were apparent as
far back as the signing of the Dayton peace accords that ended the
Bosnian conflict in 1995, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went wrong begins with the failure to follow up Dayton
with a full-court diplomatic press to resolve the Kosovo problem
peacefully,'' despite the widespread understanding that Kosovo
would be the region's next flashpoint, said Steven L. Burg, a
Brandeis University professor of politics who sources say is
sometimes consulted by government policy makers regarding the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   From September 1996 through early 1997, Milosevic and pacifist
Kosovar Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova both were ready for a
peaceful resolution, Burg said _ Milosevic because he wanted an
easing of US pressure on his regime, Rugova because the Kosovo
Liberation Army was emerging as a violent force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so into the idea that negative incentives work with
Milosevic,'' Burg said, ``but at that moment there was a very good
opportunity for positive incentives (such as a lifting of
sanctions) to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, the US made a bigger mistake, attempting
to woo the KLA. ``It was a fundamental misreading of the KLA,''
Burg said. ``This was not a bunch of revolutionaries using force to
gain an agreement'' _ the goal sought by Rugova and the United
States _ ``it was a bunch of revolutionaries intent on
independence,'' and this was followed by ``a huge mistake'' when US
envoy Richard C. Holbrooke allowed himself to be photographed with
KLA fighters holding raised Kalashnikov machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   The impression given the Serbs was of US approval of the tactics
of the KLA. Then, that autumn, US negotiators at Rambouillet
refused to identify Kosovo as a part of the territory of Serbia in
their drafts of a peace agreement for the province _ insisting
instead on calling it part of the territory of Yugoslavia. Taken
together, these events convinced the Serbs that the United States
was committed to a policy of separating Kosovo from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a grave misunderstanding of the politics and
nationalist sentiments of the region sent policy makers down a road
from which they could not possibly return with an agreement from
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They misread the lessons of Dayton,'' said Joseph Nye, dean of
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, who was
assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs
in Clinton's first term. ``The price of selling out Kosovo was
higher for Milosevic than the price of selling out the Bosnian
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many analysts say, Milosevic would have had to pay with
his political life for giving up Serbian dominion over Kosovo _ a
price the US should have known he would not pay.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Americans took Dayton to mean that Milosevic would
yield to force, when in fact, they say, the Dayton agreement was
possible because of a balance of restrained military pressure
coupled with genuine concessions to Serb political interests.
</P>
<P>
   George Kenney, a former State Department desk officer for
Yugoslavia who resigned in 1992 to protest what he saw as poor US
policy making, said a sensible course has gotten harder to steer
due to the progressive demonization of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and others at the core of the Clinton foreign policy
team ``gradually talked themselves into a mindset where they lost
all respect for the Serbian positions, and started to think Serbs
were just bullies and cowards, not worth consideration whatsoever.
. . . They thought if we just kicked the Serbs a few times, they
would roll over and do anything we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kenney and others say, the American officials were
able to persuade themselves that the Balkans could be reformed in
line with Western democratic ideals _ a gross misunderstanding of
the region's nationalisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fear each other too much to live in areas where they
are not in the (ethnic) majority,'' Kenney said, ``and it is not
likely that we will be able to educate them to a different reality
for at least the next several generations.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT political scientist Barry Posen said American policy makers
``failed to recognize the power of the force (of nationalism), and
the particular malevolence of this power in the Balkans.'' As a
result, he said, they are pursuing impossible goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West keeps trying togetherness solutions, and the only
solutions that are going to work are separation solutions,'' Posen
said. ``The Americans think they can keep (the various peoples)
together and do it our way _ not the way of the Turks or the
communists, who knocked heads together when necessary, but in a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's idiocy, saying we're not at war with the Serbs, we're at
war with Slobodan Milosevic,'' Posen said. ``They are nationalists.
They have a nation. That's the way they want it. The others want it
that way too.''

BILL SEEKS TO CURB Y2K LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A coalition of watchdog groups is asking consumers to
bombard Washington with protest letters, part of an effort aimed at
blocking legislation approved by the U.S. House this week that
would curb Y2K liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union, Public Citizen and the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group are leading the protest against the Year 2000
Readiness and Responsibility Act. A similar bill could be
considered by the Senate as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation, backed by the computer industry, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, passed the House on
Thursday by a vote of 236-190. The legislation would put caps on
punitive damage awards, make potential plaintiffs wait 90 days
before filing suits, encourage mediation and limit class-action
lawsuits relating to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was pulled from the Senate two weeks ago because
of protests from the White House and some Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill pits the interests of big businesses that do not
want to be held accountable for their defective products against
small businesses and individual consumers who will be the ones hurt
by Y2K,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one commentator has noted, this bill `looks like it was
written by Bill Gates on a napkin while having cocktails with
Donald Trump,''' Claybrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, founded by Ralph Nader, has set up a special
free fax service on the organization's Web site that allows
consumers to fax their senators from the Internet for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fax your senator to oppose Y2K immunity for big business,''
the Web site said. The fax site is at
www.citizen.org//faxserver//letter2//step1.htm. ---A couple is
hunkered down in their bomb shelter with a stock of pickled eggs,
kilos of toilet paper, potted meat, and breath spray.
</P>
<P>
   In another spot, hundreds of depositors are milling about a bank
waiting to withdraw their cash before a computer glitch leaves them
penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that ``Y2K'' actually means ``Yes to Kia,'' the Irving,
Calif.-based Kia Motors America advises consumers in a national ad
campaign now airing on cable not to worry about imminent disaster
as the century shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a broad and well-publicized global event and
turned it on its ear,'' said Fred Golldberg, CEO of the San
Francisco firm that created the ad. ``The Y2K issue is full of
intrigue, suspense and fear. The advertising makes it humorous and
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association is not laughing. They insist
Kia should pull the parody ads because they give bankers a black
eye. In a letter to the bankers and federal regulators, the car
maker says the spot, expected to run until June 1, is not intended
to create panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ... a joke,'' Kia spokesman Monica Miller said. ``But you
know those bankers.'' ---
</P>
<P>
   Kansas National Guard officials learned two things during a
national Y2K communications drill earlier this month: Some
high-frequency radios don't work and those that do should be used
early in the morning or late at night when the signal strength is
best.
</P>
<P>
   As a regional control center, it was the job of Guard officials
in Topeka to send signal tests every hour for 24 hours to command
posts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some radios flunked the test, said Guard spokesman Joy Moser,
while some radio signals were weak during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials nationwide will run a similar test Sept. 1 to
see how prepared state armories are in the advent of a Y2K
communications blackout. Of Kansas' 56 armories, 21 still need
work, said Lt. Col. Mike Miller. The deadline for all work is Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to be prepared and not need (the radios), than to
need the capability and not be prepared,'' Miller said.

LAWMAKERS SHOW KNACK FOR DELIVERING GOODIES TO CONSTITUENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In reaching a final agreement this week on an
emergency measure to finance the air campaign against Yugoslavia,
lawmakers demonstrated that not even a war can stop them from
delivering the goodies for important constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although steel and energy-related special interests lost out for
the most part in the compromise bill negotiated by the House and
Senate, defense contractors, Alaska fishermen and the states did
quite well in getting what they wanted out of Washington. The bill
is likely to be passed by both chambers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas did better than
most of her colleagues by succeeding in having an amendment added
to the nearly $15 billion spending bill that would prevent the
federal government from sharing in the $246 billion the states have
won in tobacco settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would like to use some of the settlement money
for the reimbursement of Medicaid and Medicare outlays, and
President Clinton had threatened to veto any final emergency
spending bill if it arrived on his desk with the tobacco provision
attached. But it appears that the administration will accept the
provision as long as states pledge to use most of the money for
medical-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison also got the House and Senate negotiators to include a
provision that would prevent the Interior Department from raising
the wellhead tax on oil and gas companies in Texas and other oil
patch states until at least Oct. 1. The department has been wanting
to change the rules governing the royalties paid by companies to
Washington on oil and gas taken from federal lands and waters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Hutchison failed in getting an amendment added
that would have provided millions in federal loan guarantees to
strapped oil and gas companies hard-hit by low prices. But
Hutchison's provision is similar to another measure authored by
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., that the
Senate and House has promised to vote on later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's amendment, which would provide $500 million in loan
guarantees to small oil and gas companies in New Mexico, Texas and
other states, was rolled into another measure authored by Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., that would provide federal guarantees backing
up to $1 billion in loans to economically-depressed steel companies
hurt by foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's insistence that his provision, which was designed
primarily to help one West Virginia steel company, be added to the
emergency spending measure almost ended up derailing an agreement
on a final bill. Byrd finally backed down and agreed to drop his
amendment after negotiators promised that he and Domenici would get
a separate vote on their measures later this month as ``emergency
status'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats had decried the Byrd steel
amendment, and the Domenici oil and gas proposal, as the epitome of
``pork'' legislation designed to help only a narrow constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's original request to help fund the U.S. portion of the
NATO air campaign through Sept. 30 of this year was $6.05 billion.
But by the the time House and Senate negotiators finished their
work on the final spending measure that figure had nearly doubled
to $11.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That final figure includes $1.8 billion for a military pay
increase, $2.5 billion for munitions, air operations and equipment
maintenance, and $919 million for refugee relief efforts and aid to
the frontline Balkan nations.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill, which the House and Senate are expected to pass
Tuesday, totals about $15 billion. In addition to the military
funding for the NATO and refugee relief operations, it also
includes nearly $1 billion in aid to Central American countries to
help them rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado victims in the United States also got some help as well.
The bill contains $900 million for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to help replenish its disaster relief coffers in the wake of
the monster tornadoes that demolished parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and
Texas two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ $566 million in loan programs to help hog, corn and other
commodities producers hurt by falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   _ $100 million in aid to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   _ $4.3 million in settlement payments to some Japanese-Americans
now living in South America who were forced into U.S. internment
camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   _ $26 million to buy out fishermen and others hurt by federal
limits placed on fishing in protected waters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill contains a provision that would help
Houston-based Battle Mountain Gold Co. by delaying the
implementation of environmental laws designed to force hard-rock
mining companies not to dispose of their milling wastes on public
lands. The provision would specifically prevent the Interior
Department, for the time being, from cracking down on Battle's
Crown Jewel Gold Mine in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Losing out in the final bill were families of people who were
killed last year when a U.S. Marine jet cut a gondola wire in the
Italian mountains. The Senate had approved $40 million in
compensation for victims of the gondola accident earlier this year
when it also approved disaster relief money for hurricane damage in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   But the compensation was stripped out of the final spending bill
approved by House and Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Robb, D-Va., called the decision ``regrettable,''
saying that Italy would interpret it as an ``unwillingness'' by the
United States to own up to its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The final spending bill, which Clinton is expected to sign, will
be paid for primarily from the federal surplus this year. But
Republicans insisted on paying for about $1.6 billion of the
emergency spending by cutting some unused portions of domestic
program budgets, such as food stamps, public housing and foreign
aid.

YUGOSLAVS SAY REFUGEES   HIT BY NATO BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav officials charged that NATO warplanes
attacked a group of nearly 700 ethnic Albanian refugees in pre-dawn
darkness Friday, killing as many as 100 and injuring scores of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists taken to the scene by Yugoslav authorities said
bodies and smoldering tractors were strewn across an area near the
town of Korisa in south-central Kosovo where the Albanians, who had
been hiding in nearby mountains and forests, said they had pitched
camp for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime around midnight, they bombed us from their warplanes
three times. It was a horror,'' said Dostan Rexhaj, 49, from Lodje
Zekaj, part of Korisa village. ``Many people burned up instantly.
We still can't collect all the bodies. They are all around the
place _ in the fields and nearby farms. They have been blown to
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and US officials confirmed that heavy bombing had been
taking place in the area, but they said heavy shelling by Yugoslav
artillery was occurring, too. There was no immediate report of
physical evidence that the deaths were caused by NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised a thorough investigation, and asked journalists
and the public to treat the charge cautiously because it might be
Yugoslav propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know what damage may or may not have been done by
NATO aircraft operating in this area,'' said State Department
spokesman James Rubin. ``I would urge everyone to treat Belgrade's
information on this subject with extreme caution until NATO, which
has shown its willingness to admit when mistakes were made, has
been able to complete its assessment of what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the 52d day of the NATO bombing campaign, launched in
an effort to stop Serb-dominated Yugoslav forces from persecuting
Albanian residents of Serbia's Kosovo province. There were these
other developments:
</P>
<P>
   --NATO flew 679 sorties, the most sorties of any 24-hour period
in the campaign thus far, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. NATO
planes attacked tanks, military vehicles, artillery, and troops on
the ground in the southern Serbian province. The spokesman said the
strikes were particularly heavy around Prizren _ the closest city
to the alleged bombing of the refugee encampment _ during the day
and around Stimlje during the night. Bombing of power stations
blacked out Yugoslavia's three biggest cities and many major towns.
</P>
<P>
   --Support units for US Apache helicopters held their first live
fire exercise, signalling that the heavily armored craft might soon
see action in Kosovo. Two have been lost in crashes during training
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   --Opening a meeting of nine central and eastern European
nations, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchman stressd his opposition
to the NATO campaign, and complained that his cash-strapped country
was losing $1.2 million a day due to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   --German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder praised his coalition
partners, the Green party, for strengthening the government and its
determination to prosecute the war for Kosovo by rejecting attempts
at Thursday's turbulent, bitterly divided party congress to condemn
the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   --Hundreds of waving children greeted Hillary Rodham Clinton at
a tent city for refugees near Skopje, Macedonia. Clinton announced
a $21 million aid package.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly a week after NATO bombs destroyed the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade, killing three persons, President Jiang Zemin for the
first time accepted a telephone call of apology from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, 79 bodies had been found, the Serb-run Media
Center in Kosovo reported, but said the toll could rise as searches
for bodies continued. Sixty-one people were injured, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Serb TV initially reported the attack was with cluster bombs,
but the media center later said that laser-guided missiles hit the
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow Friday the Russian Foreign Ministry accepted at face
value the Yugoslav charges that refugees had been bombed by NATO,
and accused the alliance of a ``new crime.'' But British officials
said any investigation into erroneous airstrikes now include a new
element.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now reports of Kosovar people being rounded up and
herded under bridges so that when NATO aircraft attack these
bridges, these people can be displayed as civilian casualties,''
British Defense Minister John Spellar said in London.
</P>
<P>
   General John Jumper, commander of US air forces in Europe, at
briefing in Washington, said that NATO is doing a good job of
avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of nearly 20,000 sorties flown by NATO since the attacks on
Yugoslavia began, on 10 or 12 of those . . . we've had collateral
damage that's been an issue,'' Jumper said. ``These are probably
the best results we've ever seen . . . better than the normal odds
would indicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who
met Friday in Brussels with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana,
would return to Helsinki Tuesday for more meetings with Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis, and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari, who will soon assume the presidency of the European
Union, and has broad experience in Balkan affairs, appears to be
playing a role in efforts by the Russians to broker a conclusion to
the fighting over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said these meetings are intended to elaborate the positions of NATO
and the Yugoslavs to each other, so that a presumed eventual
agreement in principle will not break down over details.
</P>
<P>
   Thoough Chernomyrdin and the Russians are not in agreement with
the NATO action, Russia has nevertheless acted in ways the US says
are constructive in trying to end the fighting. Ahtisaari, the
official said, ``is connected to Chernomyrdin . . . and his
position meshes with ours. Chernomyrdin thinks he would be helpful,
and we think he would be helpful.''

RUSSIAN SPEAKER PREDICTS IMPEACHMENT OF YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After a day of angry and vivid speeches accusing
Russian President Boris Yeltsin of crimes ranging from treason to
genocide, the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament predicted
Friday night that the lower house would vote on Saturday to impeach
the president on one of five charges.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's latest political crisis moved toward its next
critical stage, Gennady Seleznyov, leader of the 450-seat lower
house, said that the anti-Yeltsin opposition _ strengthened by his
sudden decision this week to fire Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _
would collect more than the 300 votes required to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Friday's debate was bitter, heated and at times
incoherent, as parliamentary deputies took turns blaming Yeltsin
for all the ills that have befallen Russia in the last seven years
_ from the collapse of its military to the poverty and decline of
its population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you hear all of Russia wailing?'' asked Sergei
Govorukhin, a Russian nationalist and filmmaker. ``They wail and
hold out their hands, begging to free us from him, to save our
children. All Russia except the population of the criminal
megalopolises and some 150 deputies who are always ready to sell
themselves _ all of Russia demands impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's parliamentary
representative, accused the president's accusers of staging a
``political and not a legal process'' that was heavy on personal
judgment and weak on legally tenable facts.
</P>
<P>
   The other three impeachment charges _ due to be voted on on
Saturday by paper ballots that will be made public _ accuse Yeltsin
of orchestrating the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, of
storming the Russian Parliament in 1993 and of waging an illegal
war in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The last charge, which will be supported by a leading liberal
party as well as by the Communists and their left-wing allies, is
expected to pass by as many as 312 votes, Seleznyov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although other deputies echoed his prediction, none said Friday
that they expected the charge to survive the tortuous impeachment
process. According to the Russian Constitution, an impeachment must
next be reviewed by the Russian Supreme Court, where in this case,
it is widely expected to be squelched.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the country's nervous political condition, a vote
to impeach could carry heavy political consequences, as a Kremlin
aide warned Friday. ``The president's decisions may be most
unexpected,'' the unnamed official was quoted as saying by the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to one popular scenario, the lower house, or Duma, may
choose next week to sidestep another showdown by voting to approve
Yeltsin's prime minister-designate, Sergei Stepashin, a Kremlin
loyalist who now heads the country's main police force.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into a politically tenuous role, Stepashin held a series
of consultations on Friday with parliamentary leaders, and
potential Cabinet members, in an attempt to restore the shaky
consensus shattered this week by the dismissal of Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   If the Parliament approves Stepashin, Yeltsin will have no
evident constitutional means to dismiss it and call early
elections. Under the Russian Constitution, the president must
disband the Parliament if it votes three times to reject his
nominee for prime minister, Another clause in the Constitution
forbids him to dismiss the Parliament for as long as an impeachment
proceeding is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Constitution's loose language, and Yeltsin's
well-known penchant for political surprises, some on Friday were
saying these legalisms could be interpreted freely by a vengeful
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was growing hope on Friday for a solution that
might at least keep the country's current political arrangements in
place until parliamentary elections next December.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   `'The Communists will be happy if an impeachment passes, because
it means they will have been able to punish him,'' said Vladimir
Lysenko, a deputy from Moscow. ``In exchange, they could vote for
Stepashin, which would give them the chance to live calmly until
December.''
</P>
<P>
   Lysenko, 43, once a loyal Yeltsin supporter and fellow
``democrat'' _ a label broadly used to describe Russia's
anti-Communists _ took the podium Friday to urge the 68-year-old
president to resign and spare the country the agony of an
open-ended political crisis that he himself created.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have completely disassociated yourself from the democratic
movement that brought you to power,'' said Lysenko, now a member of
the Parliament's moderate Regional bloc. ``You have hidden yourself
behind the Kremlin walls, and high fences. We, who sincerely
believed in democratic reforms and began them with you, are now
doomed to hear the curses of our compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lysenko said Friday that he had planned to vote
against impeachment _ until Wednesday, when Yeltsin fired the prime
minister. Now, he said, he is seriously considering joining his old
Communist foes in what he said has turned into a vote of
no-confidence in a presidency that has gone badly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a human point of view, I am sorry,'' he said. ``From a
political point of view, I am fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lysenko said a straw poll of his district, a liberal stronghold
in northern Moscow, showed his electorate to be almost evenly
divided on impeachment, whereas colleagues from more distant
regions were reporting an overwhelming majority against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many deputies are required to vote for impeachment or else
they will be out of a job in December,'' said Lysenko.

   Labor vs. Airline: A Split Decision &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an effort by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers to organize its 8,000 baggage
handlers and other cargo workers, Continental Airlines called in a
heavyweight labor specialist. Last month, with a vote pending on
joining the union, the company put up posters that featured Larry
Holmes, the former boxing champion, saying: ``You won the title by
working together. Why let anyone get between you and another
championship?'' He visited with workers in Cleveland, Houston and
Newark on the airline's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmes didn't stay in the airline's corner for long. Several
pro-union workers as well as R. Thomas Buffenbarger, the machinists
union president, sent e-mail to the champ to complain. He wrote
back that his message had been ``grossly miscommunicated,'' adding,
``My presence was to inform all employees to vote for what is right
for themselves and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Holmes said, ``I'm not pro-union or
anti-union.'' Decades ago, he said, a union rescued him from an
unwarranted firing. ``If not for the union, I wouldn't have had a
job,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said that the boxer did not change his tune, which,
it said, was never intended to be anti-union. Ned Walker, a
spokesman for Continental, said, ``The message we were giving out
there was something along the lines of, `Think twice before voting
to change the direction of a winning team because we are already
champions.''' The voters' decision in the match will be announced
on June 4.

   Where the Chic Meet the Hip &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To a product line that includes Givenchy couture, Louis Vuitton
luggage and Dom Perignon Champagne, add Trailer Trash and Jail Bait
nail polishes (in silver or pink-and-white swirl). Such are the
brands LVMH Moet Hennessy picked up last week with its purchase of
75 percent of Hard Candy, a Los Angeles cosmetics company founded
just four years ago by Dineh Mohajer and Benjamin Einstein, then
both 22.
</P>
<P>
   The sellers' rationale is clear: They need a sugar daddy. Their
company soared, then slumped, leaving them frustrated and
exhausted. ``I tried for four years to play the role of business
owner, but I am more of a creative person,'' Ms. Mohajer said.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH's courtship of Hard Candy, however, may seem like quite a
culture clash. In fact, LVMH has been looking to buy its way into
the hip, young American market _ just last month it purchased
Bliss, a New York health and beauty spa, and the associated lotions
and potions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mohajer and Einstein give LVMH access to the sort of
high-spending, fashion-forward 15- to 25-year-old customers who
don't know Givenchy from Guerlain.
</P>
<P>
   The two founders will manage the creative side of the business
while keeping a minority stake. Ms. Mohajer has already learned a
few lessons in corporate diplomacy. Regarding LVMH's purchase of
her company, she said tactfully, ``This is about rounding out their
portfolio.''

<P>
   Will Streeters' Generosity Bloom? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has experienced 11,000, Goldman Sachs has gone public
and mergers and acquisitions abound. But even Wall Street
executives suggest privately that maybe their colleagues could do
more with their fortunes besides expanding them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it took Bette Midler to rescue the last group of 51
community gardens from the Giuliani administration's auction block.
Ms. Midler pledged the necessary $1.2 million through her New York
Restoration Project.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Wall Street was put off by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
description of those who protested his plan to auction off the
gardens to developers. They, he said, are stuck ``in the era of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Ms. Midler, through a lieutenant, has extended an
invitation to the financiers. ``We need Wall Street big time,''
said Joseph Pupello, the president of Ms. Midler's New York
Restoration Project, which has pledged the money. ``To bring Wall
Street into the community gardens would be a tremendous sign of
good will.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokeswoman, Ms. Midler has so far raised only
$250,000 _ none from Wall Street _ of the $1.2 million pledge. &QL;

TENSIONS RISE AS YELTSIN IMPEACHMENT VOTE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Angry lawmakers traded insults and the Kremlin hinted
darkly of a ``war'' on Parliament as Russia lurched toward
Saturday's decisive vote on whether to impeach President Boris N.
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate that was sometimes raucous, sometimes surreal and
never anything like the solemn legal proceeding it was suppose to
be, the State Duma lower house of the Russian parliament heard
arguments on five counts against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Duma leaders said only one of the charges, that Yeltsin
illegally waged war against separatist Chechnya, had a good chance
of gaining the 300 votes in the 450-seat house needed to pass on
the motion for review by Russia's two highest courts.
</P>
<P>
   Few legislators believe their vote to begin the lengthy
impeachment process will result in Yeltsin being forced out of
power. But the authoritarian Russian leader has made it clear that
he will not tolerate a ``yes'' vote on impeachment, and has
threatened to disband the Duma if it ignores him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Kremlin issued a starkly worded statement via the
official news agency that Yeltsin would view any action to remove
him as a ``declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself kept silent and stayed out of sight, as he did
during the first day of debating Thursday. Odd as it may seem for a
politician fighting the battle of his career, this is what the
aging, ailing Russian president often does during crises.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the statement quoted an unnamed senior official as
saying ``the president's response may be most unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   That raised the stakes in a government crisis that began when
Yeltsin dismissed popular Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov Wednesday
and proposed as a replacement Sergei Stepashin, the president's
loyal ally and the head of Russia's 500,000-strong Interior
Ministry troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military said it would not get involved, but everyone
here remembers 1993, when Yeltsin forced parliament to disband with
tanks and troops in an assault that left at least 140 dead -- this
is one of the charges against him in Friday's debates.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition deputy Stanislav Govorukhin said removing the man
responsible for these events ``would be the best evidence that the
country is becoming democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chaotic Duma debate seemed instead to expose the rough
spots in Russia's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's most passionate defender was ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ironic twist of fate for the president who
frequently promises to do away with Russian chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky shouted that if Yeltsin is impeached, NATO's
airstrikes in Yugoslavia could turn into ``World War III against
Russia'' next month.
</P>
<P>
   When Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov cut him off, Zhirinovsky
rasped: ``We'll pick up where we left off tomorrow, you'll all go
out of your minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky refused to comment on a rumor that he had been
offered a post in Stepashin's government in return for the votes of
his 59-member bloc.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Communist lawmaker, Alexander Kravtsev, claimed Duma
members were being offered $30,000 to stay away from Saturday's
session.
</P>
<P>
   While these allegations tainted the proceedings, the chaotic
debate threatened to make a mockery of the proceess.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 40 witnesses the Duma called, only five appeared. Among
those who declined to show up was former Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, whom the Duma wanted to give testimony on the 1991
breakup of the Soviet Union (another of the impeachable offenses
Yeltsin is charged with committing.) Gorbachev said he received
only a vaguely worded telegram, which he felt was inadequate for a
former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have at least phoned me,'' Ekho Moskvy radio quoted
Gorbachev as saying.
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses who did appear, aging Soviet-era writer
Vasily Belov, whose speech was one of the stranger moments of the
day, said Yeltsin's guilt over a third charge of ``genocide'' was
self-evident and needed no proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him come to power,'' Belov said in an unsteady
voice. ``It was all preordained.''
</P>
<P>
   One Communist lawmaker suggested sending out Duma security
guards to round up witnesses such as former Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev to answer questions about the 1994-96 war in rebel
Chechnya, or about the charge that Yeltsin destroyed Russia's army.
Duma leaders explained that the house had no right to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``These proceedings in many ways are just a farce,'' remarked
Vladimir Ryzhkov, leader of a pro-Yeltsin bloc in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker drew jeers when he ruefully commented that
America's recent impeachment of President Clinton ran smoothly in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans worked well, the investigators had facts,'' said
Zhirinovsky ally Alexei Mitrofanov. ``They knew exactly when Monica
Lewisnsky called Clinton's secretary, what day, what time. Where
are the records of Yeltsin's conversations?''
</P>
<P>
   Records would have been nice, but it is unlikely they would have
changed anything. Most Duma members think Yeltsin is guilty, a
minority say he is not
</P>
<P>
   Some Duma members guessed the house would vote yes on
impeachment because after that, according to Russia's constitution,
the president cannot disband parliament. Others observed that
Yeltsin will do whatever he wants, and predicted the house would
back down to avoid provoking him.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday we will find out.

SECRECY CONCERNS MAY HAVE LED TO MISTAKEN ATTACK ON EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful of security leaks, planners of the
disastrous US bombing raid that hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
excluded from their discussions former US embassy personnel in
Yugoslavia who were intimately familiar with the Yugoslav capital
and would have known the location of the Chinese mission.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 professional-level federal employees worked in the
American Embassy in Belgrade before the final deterioration of
US-Yugoslav relations. Some were intelligence operatives; many had
spent years there.
</P>
<P>
   But due to the intelligence concerns about the danger of leaks,
none of these people were included in discussions of bombing
targets, according to a senior administration source. Instead,
people who may have been able to correct sites chosen from outdated
maps were asked to leave planning sessions on the Yugoslav crisis
when the targets were being discussed, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who did not have
an intimate acquaintance with the potential targets, sat in with
the very small group of high military and intelligence officials
who discussed the targets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Pentagon and CIA had made full use of State
Department resources in their planning, State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin would not answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that everybody involved has expressed their
apologies,'' he said, ``and everybody involved knows that a tragic
mistake occurred. Mistakes do occur. . . . We will continue to work
with the Pentagon and other agencies . . . and we will try to help
more rather than less.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing follows a host of lesser-known mistakes and
miscalculations that paved the way to high-profile blunders, such
as underestimating Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
overestimating the effectiveness of air power, according to
think-tank and university-based specialists, many of whom are
former US officials and current advisers to the government.
</P>
<P>
   These errors-behind-the-errors, they say, have deeply disturbing
implications for America's capacity to deal with strife and with
renegade leaders in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The American approach to the Balkans has revealed a flawed grasp
of the nature and intensity of ethnic nationalism, a capacity to
ignore well-sourced intelligence that gets in the way of political
policy, a lack of flexibility in the face of changing
circumstances, and a tendency to bluff without knowing what to do
if the bluff is called, the specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was not unreasonable to try bombing to get the
Serbs to the (negotiating) table,'' said Ivo H. Daalder, a National
Security Council aide to President Clinton and coordinator of
Bosnia policy during Clinton's first administration. But before the
bombing started, the calculation was never that at a certain level
of pain Milosevic would come to the table, Daalder said; it was
that the Yugoslav leader thought the Americans were bluffing, and
would negotiate as soon he saw they were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not unreasonable to believe he thought we were
bluffing,'' Daalder said. ``We had bluffed before and not followed
through on our threats'' that were made repeatedly from the end of
the Bush administration right up to the launching of NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear quite quickly, certainly by the end of the first
weekend, that a little bombing wouldn't do the trick,'' he said.
``The real choice on March 27 was to go in with ground troops, or
quit because it wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States recalculated in a way that
rationalized continuing and intensifying the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A misreading of the lessons of the war in Bosnia, lack of a
serious effort to understand the Serb perspective, and inattention
to information coming out of Kosovo and Serbia all were apparent as
far back as the signing of the Dayton peace accords that ended the
Bosnian conflict in 1995, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went wrong begins with the failure to follow up Dayton
with a full-court diplomatic press to resolve the Kosovo problem
peacefully,'' despite the widespread understanding that Kosovo
would be the region's next flashpoint, said Steven L. Burg, a
Brandeis University professor of politics who sources say is
sometimes consulted by government policy makers regarding the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   From September 1996 through early 1997, Milosevic and pacifist
Kosovar Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova both were ready for a
peaceful resolution, Burg said _ Milosevic because he wanted an
easing of US pressure on his regime, Rugova because the Kosovo
Liberation Army was emerging as a violent force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so into the idea that negative incentives work with
Milosevic,'' Burg said, ``but at that moment there was a very good
opportunity for positive incentives (such as a lifting of
sanctions) to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, the US made a bigger mistake, attempting
to woo the KLA. ``It was a fundamental misreading of the KLA,''
Burg said. ``This was not a bunch of revolutionaries using force to
gain an agreement'' _ the goal sought by Rugova and the United
States _ ``it was a bunch of revolutionaries intent on
independence,'' and this was followed by ``a huge mistake'' when US
envoy Richard C. Holbrooke allowed himself to be photographed with
KLA fighters holding raised Kalashnikov machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   The impression given the Serbs was of US approval of the tactics
of the KLA. Then, that autumn, US negotiators at Rambouillet
refused to identify Kosovo as a part of the territory of Serbia in
their drafts of a peace agreement for the province _ insisting
instead on calling it part of the territory of Yugoslavia. Taken
together, these events convinced the Serbs that the United States
was committed to a policy of separating Kosovo from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a grave misunderstanding of the politics and
nationalist sentiments of the region sent policy makers down a road
from which they could not possibly return with an agreement from
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They misread the lessons of Dayton,'' said Joseph Nye, dean of
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, who was
assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs
in Clinton's first term. ``The price of selling out Kosovo was
higher for Milosevic than the price of selling out the Bosnian
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many analysts say, Milosevic would have had to pay with
his political life for giving up Serbian dominion over Kosovo _ a
price the US should have known he would not pay.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Americans took Dayton to mean that Milosevic would
yield to force, when in fact, they say, the Dayton agreement was
possible because of a balance of restrained military pressure
coupled with genuine concessions to Serb political interests.
</P>
<P>
   George Kenney, a former State Department desk officer for
Yugoslavia who resigned in 1992 to protest what he saw as poor US
policy making, said a sensible course has gotten harder to steer
due to the progressive demonization of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and others at the core of the Clinton foreign policy
team ``gradually talked themselves into a mindset where they lost
all respect for the Serbian positions, and started to think Serbs
were just bullies and cowards, not worth consideration whatsoever.
. . . They thought if we just kicked the Serbs a few times, they
would roll over and do anything we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kenney and others say, the American officials were
able to persuade themselves that the Balkans could be reformed in
line with Western democratic ideals _ a gross misunderstanding of
the region's nationalisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fear each other too much to live in areas where they
are not in the (ethnic) majority,'' Kenney said, ``and it is not
likely that we will be able to educate them to a different reality
for at least the next several generations.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT political scientist Barry Posen said American policy makers
``failed to recognize the power of the force (of nationalism), and
the particular malevolence of this power in the Balkans.'' As a
result, he said, they are pursuing impossible goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West keeps trying togetherness solutions, and the only
solutions that are going to work are separation solutions,'' Posen
said. ``The Americans think they can keep (the various peoples)
together and do it our way _ not the way of the Turks or the
communists, who knocked heads together when necessary, but in a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's idiocy, saying we're not at war with the Serbs, we're at
war with Slobodan Milosevic,'' Posen said. ``They are nationalists.
They have a nation. That's the way they want it. The others want it
that way too.''

EX-VA HOSPITAL NURSE COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND B.J. ROCHE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A former nurse accused of murdering four patients and
trying to kill three others at a veteran's hospital in Northampton
will become the first person in more than 50 years to face the
death penalty in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after the Massachusetts Legislature rejected a
bill that would have resurrected the state's death penalty, US
Attorney Donald K. Stern announced Friday that prosecutors will ask
a federal jury in Springfield to sentence 31-year-old Kristen
Gilbert to death if she is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gilbert's alleged cruelty and cunning that convinced US
Attorney General Janet Reno to recommend a death sentence for the
first time in a federal case in Massachusetts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are 20 federal inmates on death row and more than
a hundred others awaiting trial in capital punishment cases,
Gilbert is the first woman in recent memory to face the death
penalty in a federal case, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the murders allegedly committed by Gilbert heinous and
premeditated, Stern told reporters, ``The patients were murdered in
their hospital beds by a nurse who used her position and her
specialized knowledge to commit the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no death penalty in Massachusetts, if convicted
and ordered put to death, Gilbert would be executed in a state
designated by the court or at a federal facility in Terre Haute,
Indiana, which is equipped with a lethal injection chamber,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Gilbert was indicted by a federal grand jury on
charges that she murdered three veterans at the VA Medical Center
in Northampton in 1995 and 1996 by administering fatal overdoses of
the heart-stimulating drug epinephrine. She was also charged with
two counts of attempted murder involving other patients.
</P>
<P>
   After 37 patients died on Gilbert's ward while she was on duty
in 1995 and 1996, fellow nurses reported their suspicions to
authorities and a criminal investigation was launched.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a new indictment was unsealed that charged Gilbert with
an additional charge of murder and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   If a jury convicts Gilbert of the murders, then prosecutors will
send them back to deliberate on whether she should be put to death.
A unanimous verdict is necessary for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's attorney, David P. Hoose, argued against the death
penalty in a closed-door session with federal prosecutors in
Boston, and later in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things we urged was that this is the type
of case that can never be proved to the level needed to justify the
death penalty,'' said Hoose, citing several cases in the past year
in which prisoners on death row have been released after having
been wrongfully convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, there is nothing that connects her
scientifically to the people who were killed,'' Hoose said. ``No
eyewitnesses can say they saw her do anything to any of the
patients. Therefore, there is the concept of residual or lingering
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoose said he was not surprised at Reno's decision; he
cited the current political climate and the fact that the victims
were veterans as two factors in the decision to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that after meeting with a team of senior prosecutors
and considering arguments from Gilbert's lawyer, he made a
recommendation to Reno on whether to seek the death penalty. But,
he refused to say what his recommendation was, insisting that ``the
only part that becomes important to the public, to the defendant,
to the jury, to the court''is what Reno ultimately decided.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims were reluctant to talk about the case,
citing concerns that too much pre-trial publicity would result in
the trial being moved, said Christine Duquette of Northampton,
whose brother Henry Hudon was allegedly killed by Gilbert in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cutting, 40, of Leominster died on February 2, 1996 at
7:10 p.m. Forty minutes earlier, Gilbert had asked a supervisor if
she could go home early if Cutting died.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Springfield attorney representing Cutting's wife,
Nancy in a negligence suit against the government said his client
supported the decision to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she first learned of what had happened, she was horrified
at the circumstances, and it remains her position that the death
penalty is the appropriate sanction,'' Astor said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is also charged with killing Edward Skwira, 69, and
Stanley Jagodowski, 66, a US Army veteran who served during the
invasion of Normandy. She is charged with the attempted murder of
Thomas Callahan, Angelo Vella and Francis Marier.
</P>
<P>
   The last federal execution was in 1963. The death penalty was
rarely invoked until Congress, under pressure to crack down on
drug-related killings and terrorism, made some 60 additional
federal crimes punishable by death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Henninger, of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, criticized federal authorities for pushing capital
punishment in Massachusetts, one of 12 states that doesn't have a
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Massachusetts has recognized the death penalty is an
act of vengeance and an act of hatred and the federal government
has no business coming in and trying to impose something that the
state has rejected over and over again,'' Henninger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts House Minority Leader Francis L. Marini, a
death penalty supporter, said, ``The federal government certainly
has a right to define its own crimes on its own property and to
establish punishment for those,'' he said. ``The state law never
takes precedence over the federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, federal prosecutors in Vermont, another non-death
penalty state, announced in January that they'll seek the death
penalty in the federal murder trial of an Indiana man accused of
shipping a pipe bomb that killed a Vermont teenager last year.

   Et Tu, Tennessee? Bumps in Gore's Ride
</P>
<P>
   It is an old story.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later just about every presidential candidate takes a
ride on the campaign roller coaster. And at the moment it is Vice
President Al Gore's turn.
</P>
<P>
   For many months, he was soaring upward, looking good in the
polls, getting rave reviews in the press, seemingly guaranteed the
Democratic nomination. But now he finds himself on the downhill
side, sliding a bit in the polls, getting sour reviews in the
press, his nomination no longer taken for granted and even in
enough doubt for President Clinton to step in and do a bit of
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Loosen up, Clinton advised his famously stiff No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The current Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
will take one of these rides too, sooner or later. Bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, consider some new poll results that are
contributing to Gore's rough ride:
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Mason-Dixon poll indicated that even in Tennessee,
his home state, he is struggling. In theoretical general-election
matchups, he bested Bush by only three points, 46 percent to 43
percent, with 11 percent undecided, and then beat a fellow
Tennessean, former Gov. Lamar Alexander, by only nine points, 49
percent to 40 percent, again with 11 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 626 voters and had a sampling error of
plus or minus four percentage points, was conducted April 21-23.
Its director, Brad Coker, called it ``a warning buzzer'' for Gore
and added: ``It's still very early in the season, and Tennessee is
one of those states that can swing Democrat or Republican. But if
Al Gore's got to struggle a bit to win in his home state, then
there's something going on worth keeping an eye on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a Fox News poll, released Wednesday, that had a bit of
good news, some very serious bad news and some you-be-the-judge
news.
</P>
<P>
   The bit of good news:
</P>
<P>
   By a ratio of about two to one, most Americans would prefer to
have Gore than Clinton as a friend. And by a ratio of almost three
to one, most would prefer to have Gore than Clinton as their
business partner.
</P>
<P>
   The serious bad news:
</P>
<P>
   In a general election, Gore would trail Bush by at least 20
points and Elizabeth Dole by about 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The your-call news:
</P>
<P>
   At least five in seven Americans believe Clinton would be ``more
fun to hang out with'' than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Bullet Train To Georgia as Planned
</P>
<P>
   In a Deep South state like Georgia, gun rights advocates are
particularly plentiful, and many political candidates, whatever
their party, welcome the endorsement of the National Rifle
Association. So when the association helped elect a Democrat, Roy
Barnes, as governor last year, Republicans groused loud and long.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the election, NRA officials sought to patch up
the damage, sending word that Wayne LaPierre, the group's executive
vice president, would be happy to travel to Georgia to speak at the
party's annual state convention May 22. Party chairman Rusty Paul
replied that LaPierre would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Colorado school shootings _ followed by second
thoughts about the invitation when the NRA came in for some of the
sharpest criticism ever and polls began to indicate that the
American public was becoming more amenable to tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad timing,'' said state Rep. Mark Burkhalter of Alpharetta of
the impending LaPierre visit, summing up the sudden new concern in
the ranks of Georgia Republicans. He suggested that Paul do the
``prudent thing'' and withdraw the invitation until things cooled a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   Paul weighed his dilemma, worried about whether canceling the
speech or going through with it would cause the most division and
embarrassment within the party, and worried, too, about how to keep
the peace with the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days ago he made up his mind and announced:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to withdraw the invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the hard line, especially at a moment when congressional
Republicans show signs of softening on the gun-control issue?
</P>
<P>
   To pull back the invitation, Paul said, would be tantamount to
blaming the NRA for the Colorado killings.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Gaining In Democratic Bastion
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up more Republican resurgence in the South, this time in
Arkansas, perhaps the most Democratic state left in Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   The party's gains there have been glacial in recent years,
compared with progress elsewhere, from Virginia to Texas. But
Tuesday there was a major gain, one that left Republicans on the
verge of becoming real players rather than bystanders in the state
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In a special election to fill a vacant seat in the Arkansas
House, a Republican emerged the winner, meaning that Republicans
now hold 25 of the 100 seats there.
</P>
<P>
   The political point is this: In the Arkansas House, it takes 75
votes, not the usual 51, to pass most appropriations bills. So all
the Republicans need do now is vote as a solid bloc and woo across
a single dissident Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, because of term limits, 25 more seats will be up for
grabs in the House _ 22 of them held by Democrats.

   GAIMAN, Argentina _ When guests arrive at the Hosteria Gwesty
Tywi, a local bed-and-breakfast, Gwyn and Monica Jones pass around
a gourd of mate, the potent herbal tea that Argentines drink
communally to establish friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 36, a recent immigrant from Wales, has picked up better
than passable Spanish, developed a taste for beef and taken to
drinking more wine and less beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very Argentine,'' Mrs. Jones, 38, who though born here is
of Welsh immigrant stock, said with a laugh. ``And I am very
Argentine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Joneses speak Welsh with each other and with their
2-year-old son, Macsen. And in a twist on Argentina's history of
repeated waves of European immigration, they have set up a Web site
in Welsh and Spanish in which they advertise their lodging and
chronicle how the English stole the Celtic crown from the Welsh
around 1300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' Jones said, ``someone from Wales is faxing,
e-mailing, phoning or arriving here. Gaiman is a Welsh home away
from home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the desolation of this windswept corner of Patagonia,
where the land and even the cactuses are dry and cracked, that
attracted 153 hardy Welsh shepherds and coal miners here in 1865.
Colonists kept arriving in central Patagonia until the eve of World
War I, as word got back to Wales that Argentina was a place that
welcomed the Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Chubut Valley colonists' goal was to gain some measure of
independence from the English, speak their native Welsh without
interference and let their identity blossom.
</P>
<P>
   The original colonists accomplished all that, and more, in
establishing a lasting cultural enclave with roots deep enough to
defend against time and assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town of low mud-brick houses trimmed with ivy, of
Protestant churches marked by signs in an ancient language that
only 600,000 people in the world speak today. The place has become
a beacon for Welsh people from the British Isles and the United
States. And the lyricism and practical lessons of Celtic folklore,
fables and poetry have attracted the interest of a growing number
of Argentines who have no Welsh ancestors at all.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh is taught in the local public schools, and learning Welsh
is becoming the fashionable thing to do for adults here and in
neighboring towns _ even among the non-Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   Community festivals known as eisteddfod, which are marked by
friendly competitions of choir singing and recitations of Welsh
poetry, are attracting Argentine visitors and tourists from all
over Patagonia and even from as far away as Buenos Aires. In
recognition of the melding of cultures, tango contests have been
added to the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   At a local school this week, eight Gaiman teen-agers spent a
morning around two tables attaching pseudonyms to children's
drawings to be judged at an eisteddfod. Although only two students
were of Welsh descent, four are taking Welsh language classes, and
all said Welsh cultural activities were the center of their social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Welsh, Gaiman would be boring,'' said Romina Urios,
17.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Blasetti, a 27-year-old Welsh-language teacher who was
supervising the youths, said: ``As cultures around the world become
more and more homogenized, what we are doing here is very
important. If you don't go back to your roots, you lose your
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh renaissance here began in 1965, on the 100th
anniversary of the first Welsh landing in Patagonia on board the
ship Mimosa. Cultural interchanges with the old country were
started, and the eisteddfod, not held in decades, were
re-established.
</P>
<P>
   The next breakthrough came in 1991, when retired Welsh teachers
began to come to give language courses. The practice has been
stepped up in recent years, with younger teachers staying for a
year or more, on full-time salaries ultimately paid for by British
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Davis, 28, an administrator at the local government
pension office whose father was of Welsh descent, recalled the
moment eight years ago when he was working in a grocery store and a
retired teacher from Wales came up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After asking what was my last name,'' Davis said, ``he asked
me why I didn't speak Welsh. It was as if he stabbed me in the
back. Then, when he invited me to join him, of course I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, after dedicating himself to several years of language
study, Davis teaches Welsh to other adults in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain what the attraction is,'' he said. ``But
I'm noticing that my generation and even more those younger than us
have this urge to find our roots.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 60 Argentines in and around Gaiman took Welsh lessons.
That number has increased to more than 200 students today. Although
no survey has been taken, an estimated half of the 5,000 people in
Gaiman speak at least some Welsh and 20 percent can carry on more
complex conversations. And fluency, once common only among the
elderly, is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   A recent adult Welsh class in Gaiman, in which two students and
their teacher worked on verbs while translating a simple story
about a tranquil Welsh lake in summer, was a mix of good fun and
serious study, but also food for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the students, Irma Sara da Graca, a 64-year-old
retired teacher, taking Welsh lessons since 1992 has been an
opportunity ``to discover the genes of the grandmother I never
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``My life has been so enriched, because I identify
with this culture. Why? Don't ask. It's something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh spoken in Argentina has evolved little in a century and a
half. But the Patagonian Welsh has a few modifications, some of
which have added poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awrlais,'' the Spanish Welsh word for clock, for instance,
literally means ``the voice of the hour.'' A teacher from Wales
said she had never heard the word before she came here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flourishing of our language is like the Welsh legend of
the red dragon,'' said Mrs. Jones, the lodge owner. ``Every time it
fought the white dragon, it would disappear, only to return and
flourish again.''

BRUINS TOP MANAGEMENT SAFE, OWNER JACOBS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what happens in this playoff season with the Bruins,
owner Jerry Jacobs wants his Big Three to remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Sinden can stay as long as he wants, even another 27
years,'' said Jacobs with a laugh Friday. ``And Mike O'Connell will
be his successor when Harry decides to make a move. I like Mike a
lot. In some ways, he is even tougher than Harry, and more to the
right of Harry, if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just as important, I want Pat Burns to be our Scotty
Bowman. I want him to be a career coach, and not just another stop
along the way in his coaching career. I think he is the perfect guy
to coach this Bruins team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs feels not enough has been said about how the Bruins have
come from the worst record in the league just a couple of years ago
and are now one of the up-and-coming teams in the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those three guys have done a great job getting us to
where we are,'' said Jacobs. ``I like the way they fit together.''
Jacobs, however, made it clear that he does not intend to spend a
lot of money to make his team a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will not happen,'' he said. ``As long as I own this team,
it will make money. We are a business. I'm not going to go out and
do what some of these owners have done in this league, spend so
foolishly that they have put the league in terrible shape. And this
league is in terrible shape. Lucky for us, we've got a great
commissioner who is trying to jawbone this thing back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bruins make money, and will continue to make money. But we
do not make nearly the money people say we do. I am not trying to
make a lot of money with the team, I'm just not going to lose any.
And I'm not going to be foolish like some other owners who spent so
much money on players, they are now losing a ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh is bankrupt. Imagine having a team that can win the
Stanley Cup and maybe having to move it. Colorado was sold because
the owner spent so much money he couldn't afford it anymore. Abe
Pollin is selling in Washington because he lost so much money. And
who knows what Detroit is doing? What is that all about? If I do
what those owners have done, in five years I would have to sell
this team myself. I couldn't afford to be able to keep it. But I'm
not going to sell this team. I like it, and I think we have a great
future with the people we have running the show for me, and the
young players we have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lynn thinks what he did in '75 and Nomar Garciaparra did
last Monday, hitting three homers and knocking in 10 runs in a
game, was exceptional. But nothing compared to what Marshall
McDougall did last Sunday for Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable,'' says Lynn, the former Red Sox
All-Star center fielder. ``You could take a major leaguer down to a
Little League field, let him use a titanium bat, and he couldn't
hit six straight home runs. To do something like that is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougall is an infielder for a very good Florida State (43-10)
team. In a game last Sunday in Maryland, he singled his first
at-bat and then homered six straight times, finishing with 16 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really upset with me down here,'' says Maryland
coach Tom Bradley, a former major league pitcher. ``I've been
criticized for pitching to him his last at-bat. But what was I
supposed to do? Walk him with the bases loaded and force in a run?
No way I was going to do that. Give him credit. My pitcher made a
good pitch down and away, and he went out and got it and hit it
over the center-field fence. I take my hat off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 7 for 7 and 16 RBIs is not the whole story. In his final
two at-bats the day before, McDougall went 2 for 2 with a single
and a three-run homer. So that would make him 9 for 9 with seven
HRs and 19 RBIs in that stretch, unmatched in the history of
high-level baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came in here for that series, I watched him taking
batting practice, and he hit six in a row out,'' Bradley said. ``I
said to myself, `This kid is swinging the bat pretty good.' And he
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn still remembers his explosive night in Detroit in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``That season, and in 1979, I just felt like I could hit
everything they were throwing at me,'' he said. ``In both of those
seasons I was completely healthy and swinging the bat with great
confidence. (Joe) Coleman was pitching that night in Detroit. I
went homer, homer, triple in the first three innings. When you are
in a groove like that, every pitch the ball seems big, and in slow
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who the pitcher is, what the pitch is, or
where he throws it, as long as you see it, you feel you can kill
it. The first homer went into the upper deck. The next one went on
the roof. The triple hit the top of the fence in left field, and
just missed being a homer. Then I lined out to the gap in
right-center, got an infield hit, and then came up in the ninth
with two guys on. We were way ahead and by then most of our
starters had dressed and left the ballpark. I hit a three-run homer
in the ninth.''

   Bradley was also well aware of Garciaparra's exploits.

   ``He was great whenever he played against us for Georgia Tech,''
Bradley said. ``You just knew he was going to be a big-time
ballplayer. I can remember him coming in here, and we would pitch
him away, so he would hit the ball to the opposite field and over
the right-field fence. He could adjust to the situation.''

   In the past month, after nearly two decades of being invisible,
Bill Russell has been all over the media, trying to hustle business
for the tribute in his honor at the FleetCenter, scheduled for May
26.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite Russell's best efforts, as this is being
written, the event is a bomb. The FleetCenter can hold close to
20,000 for an event like this. At present, fewer than 3,000 tickets
have been sold. The high-priced item, which is supposed to raise
most of the money, is 100 tables on the floor near the stage, where
the likes of Bill Cosby, Julius Erving, and Aretha Franklin are
among a brilliant cast expected to pay tribute to Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has been on national television, local radio, been
featured in Sports Illustrated and USA Today, had tremendous
exposure, a ton of paid newspaper ads, and still, great
disappointment. There has been behind-the-scenes talk of calling it
off, or moving to a hotel ballroom or smaller venue, where 3,000
would be a great crowd. After 30 years out of the game, filling
20,000 seats was just too much even for Russell, one of the
greatest ever. This isn't like Larry Bird coming back a few months
after his last game.

   Speaking of selling, it appears the Boston businessmen trying to

<P>
   Your humble correspondent has been told that all eight $325,000
super boxes have been sold, showing there are heavy hitters willing
to pay box-office numbers to buy in Foxborough. This is a good sign
because it will be the money raised from these boxes, plus
preferred seating, that will ultimately pay for the stadium.

   A few years ago, Ray Bourque went to Massachusetts General
Hospital for a complete physical, which he needed for an insurance
policy that would cover his contract. Part of the exam included a
stress test, which would normally have been given to people over 45
who might have signs of impending heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque finished it, which astonished the people who have given
thousands of these tests over the years. He is the only one ever to
do it in that particular testing room in the hospital. However,
when the test results were sent to Dr. Jim Dineen, one of the very
best in the city, he questioned if Bourque might have emphysema
because his lung capacity was so great, his lungs were the size of
those who belonged to someone who appeared to have difficulty
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the story goes to Bourque's incredible endurance
for the Bruins. After 20 NHL seasons, and at age 38, he is a
medical marvel, logging nearly 30 minutes a game during the regular
season, and more than that in the playoffs. During the test,
Bourque was told at the 15/16ths mark that he could stop, because
they had seen everything they needed to know. But Bourque, not
knowing he was making MGH history, said he may as well finish
because he wanted to have a good workout.

   Other possibilities: Lamar Odom, URI; Corey Maggette, Duke;

the draft if he comes out.

   Some mystery surrounds two of the top high school basketball
players to come out of Massachusetts in recent years _ Mike Bradley
and Adam Harrington. Bradley, from Worcester, played center for
Kentucky last year, and told coach Tubby Smith he was leaving.
However, he reportedly told him he was leaving to go to Ohio State,
which is supposed to be illegal. A player transferring is not
supposed to have any contact with another school until after he
leaves the first. Kentucky, supposedly, is waiting to see if
Bradley shows up at Ohio State, and if he does, will launch a
protest with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington reportedly is back in his hometown in Western
Massachusetts, after checking out of North Carolina State after his
freshman year. Harrington started as a freshman, and the word is he
recently visited Iowa. There was speculation he would come back to
the University of Massachusetts, just miles from his home, but
UMass has heard nothing from him.

   Todd Hynes gets the bragging rights this week in his Brookline,
Mass. home, from adopted brother Joe Thornton. Todd was named the
outstanding freshman athlete at MIT, where he started in football
and lacrosse . . . Vancouver could have the first pick in both the
NHL (Canucks) and NBA (Grizzlies) drafts this year if things break
right in the lottery. Which was the last city to have two
first-round picks in two pro drafts in the same year? In 1982, the
Patriots had the first pick and took Kenneth Sims, and the Bruins
used the first pick to take Gord Kluzak. Also, only two players
performed on the same team with both Bobby Orr and Wayne Gretzky in
the NHL: Ace Bailey and Bobby Schmautz. Bailey told a friend he
didn't want to pick one over the other because of his relationship
with both, but Schmautz didn't mind. ``The best player I played
with, and the best player I played against, was Bobby Orr. One was
protected (Gretzky), the other was a target (Orr).''

SCORE ANOTHER ONE FOR JOHN WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 3 stars 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even if you're immune to ``Star Wars'' on screen,
you've got to hand it to composer John Williams for showing some
growth when he could have simply coasted on past triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   The entertaining score to ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' is a fluid mixture of whimsical and adventurous elements
that actually holds up on its own. Some of the themes are instantly
familiar _ the ``Star Wars'' main title, of course _ but there are
plenty of ambitious new sounds on display.
</P>
<P>
   Williams breaks ground by using synthesizer on some tracks,
making possible jarring moments that crackle across your living
room like the fabulous Pod race you'll see when the film reaches
theaters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Current radio fave ``Duel of the Fates'' features a dark,
pulsating rhythm that contrasts with other set pieces, such as the
strings-driven homage ``Anakin's Theme'' or ``Augie's Great
Municipal Band,'' with its kids' chorus and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``Star Wars'' themes have always been derivative of golden
age movie composers like Miklos Rozsa, and the dramatic wide-screen
sweep certainly has paid off: The original album outsold every
other soundtrack in history.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the package _ and if you want to be completely
surprised when you see the film, don't read the plot-spoiling track
listing _ is a tribute to Williams by filmmaker George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had to draw upon the signature themes while creating a
new, if somehow familiar, musical galaxy,'' he writes. ``And he had
to visit new emotional territory in Episode I. Once again, John has
exceeded my expectations and produced a lavish, rich, moving and
thrilling score.''
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback: While the package promises a poster, it's
actually about the size of a pamphlet. &QL;

<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy _ Federico Minoli is not sure if he is selling a
luxury accessory, a style of life or a means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably a bit of all three, for Minoli is the new
president and chief executive of Ducati &UR;  &LR; SpA, the renowned Italian
motorcycle maker. While sales of Ducati's two-wheelers are booming
in Europe, where clogged cities welcome anything with fewer than
four wheels, Ducati and the builders of other Italian motorcycle
classics are casting their net farther afield.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting a chapter from the textbook of Italian luxury icons like
Gucci and Bulgari and melding it with the profitable formula
Harley-Davidson used to create an image out of a pair of wheels,
these companies are looking to global markets, notably the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business opportunity,'' said Minoli, who favors jeans
and sweaters over ties and suits, ``twinned with passion and
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian drive lifts the spirits of executives in the
industry, which boasts a long tradition of making spirited
two-wheelers, but whose lack of marketing skill and financial savvy
has nearly caused some venerable brands to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for profit in tapping other markets has not
escaped American investors. Last year, the Trident Rowan Group in
New York bought out Moto Guzzi SpA, another motorcycle maker, and
took it public this March. Earlier, Texas Pacific Group, based in
Fort Worth, acquired Ducati, which it subsequently took public on
the New York Stock Exchange
</P>
<P>
   Ducati's American depository receipts have been flat since they
began trading between $31 and $32 nearly two months ago. On Friday,
the ADRs, each representing 10 common shares, closed at $29.75.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market analysts remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough market to get into,'' said Robert Mescal, who
follows initial public offerings at the Institute for Econometric
Research in Deerfield Park, Fla. ``You're looking at big bucks to
get started, and the Japanese and the Americans are not going to
give up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Italy has just a sliver of the American market, and
little hope of taking any significant share from Japanese giants
like Honda and Yamaha, which have parlayed a mix of low-cost
manufacturing and high-technology innovation into market dominance.
But motorcycle sales are booming again, as baby boomers who flirted
with the open road in the 1960s now have the income and the time to
don helmets.
</P>
<P>
   So Italian companies like Ducati, whose $263 million of revenues
make it the nation's leader, as well as Moto Guzzi, Cagiva and
Aprilia, are faring better in Europe and hope to carve off a little
of the upper end of the market in the United States. With a wave of
sexy new models, they are seeking to exploit the cachet of all
things Italian, promoting their bikes as two-wheel Ferraris or the
highway equivalent of a Gucci loafer or Versace scarf. Ducati,
copying Harley, is opening motorcycle shops, with apparel sections
and espresso bars, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian crusade got a lift last year when the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum in New York included 21 Italian motorcycles, from
a 1924 Guzzi to several 1990s Ducatis, in its wildly successful
motorcycle show. ``The Italians bring design excellence to
everything they do,'' said Ultan Guilfoyle, deputy curator of the
Guggenheim exhibit. ``And that is very apparent in their
motorcycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ducati, he added, provides a textbook case of how brilliant
Italian design is often undercut by poor management.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Texas Pacific took control of Ducati from Claudio and
Gianfranco Castiglioni, brothers who amassed a fortune selling
zippers, then sank it into their real passion _ motorcycles. The
Castiglionis acquired Ducati, then nearly bankrupt, in 1983 from
the Italian government, which had bought it in the 1950s from the
founding Ducati family.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ducati's reputation for design and technical innovation,
the Castiglionis left the company without a sales organization or
strategy and bled it financially by siphoning profits to other
projects. ``We saw a great brand and a great product, a great
factory, but no business around it,'' said Abel Halpern, a
London-based financier who scouts European investment opportunities
for Texas Pacific. ``The hard part had already been done. The easy
part was to design a business system around it.''
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Ducati bought business talent. Minoli, 49, a former
Procter &AMP; Gamble and Playtex executive with long marketing
experience on both sides of the Atlantic, was hired from Bain &AMP;
Co., the consultants who worked with Texas Pacific before the
Ducati purchase. To create a marketing campaign, Ducati hired
Kristin Schelter, a former Hill &AMP; Knowlton executive who had worked
on the Bulgari account.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Gross, a former journalist and Harvard-educated lawyer
who is Ducati's director of strategic planning, said the
advertising budget, at about $5 million, was meager. But by
piggybacking onto big spenders, Ducati makes the ad dollars go
further. Neiman Marcus has included Ducatis in its men's catalog,
and Donna Karan New York is outfitting the Ducati racing team.
``Now people are coming to us,'' Gross said. Ducati's New York
flagship store in Manhattan cost about $250,000, also a shoestring
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts are beginning to pay off, at least modestly. In the
first quarter, Ducati increased sales 13 percent, to $74 million;
motorcycle shipments to the United States rose 26 percent, to
1,541.
</P>
<P>
   If imitation is the purest form of flattery, Ducati is not
lacking in compliments. The new owners are also reinventing Moto
Guzzi, hiring this year as chief executive Mario Scandellari, a
former Ducati manager, and bringing in a nine-year Yamaha veteran,
Nicola Poggio, as chief of sales. In the United States, another
Yamaha manager, John Porter, was lured away to spearhead Guzzi's
drive there.
</P>
<P>
   To revive the American market, this year Guzzi will begin a
fast, aggressive model called the Jackal, to sell for about $7,900.
Last year, Guzzi sold 651 bikes in the United States, up from 401
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italians are good at interpreting lifestyles,'' Poggio
said. ``If I have to eat, I try to eat well; if I have to wear a
watch, I try to wear a beautiful watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are following suit. Aprilia SpA recently rolled out a new
flagship for the United States, the RSV Mille. ``The people who
rode bikes in the '60s and '70s are now earning higher salaries,''
said Mark Wilhelm, a former Ingersoll-Rand executive who is
Aprilia's marketing manager for the United States. ``The kids are
gone; they have more time and disposable income.''
</P>
<P>
   Italjet SpA, which produced motorcycling classics in the 1970s
before bailing out to focus on scooters, is re-entering the fray
with an aggressive new bike that will be tested in racing before
full production begins in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're returning to our past,'' said Leopoldo Tartarini,
Italjet's president and a leading Italian motorcycle designer.
``The European motorcycle is still made with heart; it's still
endowed with human qualities.'' In a swipe at the Japanese, he
added, ``When something is too perfect, you tire of it.''

BOLOGNA, Italy: tire of it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Harley-Davidson, with its lumbering cruisers, is the Cadillac
of motorcycles, and Honda and Yamaha are, well, the Honda and
Toyota, the Italians want to become the Ferraris and Porsches.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Brieton buys that. ``People who own them, love them,''
said Brieton, an audiovisual systems specialist from Lake George,
N.Y., who owns two Guzzis. He became hooked on Italian motorcycles,
he explained, while serving in the U.S. Army in Italy, and bought
his first Guzzi secondhand in 1989 for less than $2,000. Five years
later, he picked up a second. ``One of the appealing factors for a
guy like me,'' he said, ``is that they go up in value.'' A 1970s
Guzzi in mint condition can fetch $20,000 or more. But, he added,
``mainly, it's the way to go to be a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg L. Salchow, who follows the motorcycle industry at Roney
Capital Markets in Detroit, said enthusiasts like Brieton gave the
Italians an entree. ``There's always going to be a certain group of
people who want the real thing,'' he said. Ducati and Guzzi, he
added, enjoy relatively strong name recognition, while lesser-known
companies like Aprilia and Italjet would have to struggle harder.
``You'd have to be a very dedicated enthusiast to even know them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term challenge for the Italians, said Guilfoyle of the
Guggenheim, will be to attract young riders and keep the affluent
market rolling when the baby boomers step off their bikes. The same
challenge, of course, faces Harley-Davidson, he said, whose
``buyers are old, an average 40 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Moto Guzzi says its Jackal is aimed mainly at young riders.
``The Jackal project leader is 31 years old,'' said Poggio, who is
38. ``Our bet is to satisfy the hard core of Guzzi buyers, and draw
new customers. The Jackal is definitely aimed at the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducati is investing $15 million to $20 million a year, about 70
percent of it in product development, Minoli said. Emulating
fashion houses, Ducati is trying to build a cult around its chief
designer, Pierre Terblanche, a former Volkswagen designer who
learned motorcycle design from Massimo Tamburini, creator of some
of Ducati's greatest models, including the 916 Superbike.
</P>
<P>
   But to realize their American ambitions, said Salchow, the
analyst, the near-term challenge will be less spectacular _
distribution. ``They are not even in a lot of markets, except for
small specialty shops,'' he said. ``They need more models, more
apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducati's long-term goal is to have 200 exclusive stores
globally. The company is investing heavily to speed production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to crank out as many as you can,'' Minoli
said. ``I don't believe in scarcity'' as a marketing device to
maintain an exclusive image. From 20 motorcycles a day in 1996,
when Texas Pacific bought in, production at Ducati has risen to
170, creating 350 new jobs, which were so hard to fill in the
full-employment area around Bologna that Ducati had to retrain
women textile workers from a local lingerie manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Minoli said, Ducati has two
constituencies: ``people really serious about motorcycling, whose
interest trickles down from racing, and the people who want a
little of everything,'' adding, ``They will have their Porsche _
and their Ducati.''

POLITICS SWIRL AROUND PASSAGE OF REVAMPED GUN-CONTROL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid anger and partisan finger-pointing, the Senate
narrowly approved a Republican gun-control provision requiring
background checks at gun shows, underlining the political potency
of the issue and foreshadowing the skirmishing for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-47 vote capped an abrupt turnaround by Republicans, who
Wednesday defeated a Democratic proposal to require background
checks on all people who purchase weapons at gun shows, and instead
backed a voluntary measure. Less than 24 hours later, they reversed
their position, introducing a package that included a provision to
make those background checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The move signaled a growing pressure on gun-control issues after
the April 20 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But the final showdown will come next week, when the Senate has
to agree on dozens of more gun-control amendments before final
passage of the overall bill. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a
Mississippi Republican, has pledged to pull the entire juvenile
crime bill, which would crack down on youthful violent offenders,
off the floor if the two parties don't reach an agreement by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats continued to pound their Republican rivals
for what President Clinton called a ``phony proposal'' riddled with
loopholes and concessions to the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows. At the
same time, it will open up a new pawnshop loophole that lets
convicted felons get guns at a local pawnshop. That's actually
worse than current law,'' Clinton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, tempers flared at times, as the debate over the
role of the National Rifle Association seemed to overshadow the
legislation itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the Senate and not the gun lobby run this debate,'' said
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Rifle Association hasn't had a thing to do with
it, and I don't care whether they accept it or not,'' shot back
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican from Utah. ``I'm so tired of
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho and an NRA board
member, later told reporters that NRA lawyers had reviewed his
draft of the gun-show measure that had passed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats presented a raft of gun-control proposals to add to
the juvenile crime bill, Republicans generally sought to turn the
debate toward violence on television, the movies, video games, and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that, Lott issued a statement critical of
Clinton's weekend fund-raising trip to the West Coast. ``What's the
message to our children? Democrats care about your safety, unless
it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Democrats of refusing to negotiate in good
faith, instead turning gun control into a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being exploited by Democrats for fund-raising and
political purposes,'' said Senator John McCain, the Arizona
Republican who is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain admitted that loopholes remain in the legislation, but
insisted the Republican measure requiring private unlicensed gun
dealers to perform background checks on all purchases was not one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats disagreed and refused to accept new language that
would clarify the requirement, insisting the GOP measure includes
vague wording that would allow private dealers to skirt the law.
They said Republicans should have passed the original Democratic
measure making background checks mandatory at all gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country wants the gun show loophole closed _ not a
quarter-closed, not half-closed, but 100 percent closed,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, added,
``The Republican measure has more special effects than the new Star
Wars movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also vowed never to support the Republican proposal as
long as it includes a provision that would give immunity to gun
dealers sued in court for providing guns to individuals who should
not be allowed to buy firearms under current law.
</P>
<P>
   And they rejected provisions that would allow individuals to
retrieve guns at pawnshops without going through a background
check, saying felons have been caught buying and selling their guns
at pawnshops. Finally, they rejected a 24-hour time limit for
federal agents to conduct background checks at a gun shows. Under
current law, the FBI has three days to make sure an individual
purchasing a weapon is not a felon, an illegal alien, or mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Craig also hardened their stance after the bruising
floor battle, saying a compromise was increasingly unlikely, even
though there was ground for agreement on some provisions, including
requiring child safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Republicans handed gun-control advocates
another defeat by killing a Democratic proposal to regulate
Internet gun sales by a vote of 50-43.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion displayed during Friday's debate over background
checks on all purchasers of firearms at gun shows underscored the
political jockeying by both parties in response to the Colorado
school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Senate observers say Republicans found themselves in a bind,
trying to balance their opposition to tigher controls, the wrath of
the powerful NRA, and concerns about polls showing increasing
support for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going on is a sea change in Ameican thinking on
guns,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said the votes also indicate the ``mighty NRA fortress is
under siege'' and cited as evidence some GOP defections supporting
some gun-control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Republicans Friday voted for an amendment from Feinstein
to ban high-capacity ammunition clips, and another half-dozen voted
with the Democrats on the GOP gun-show measure.
</P>
<P>
   Two staunch conservative Republicans, Senators Richard C. Shelby
of Alabama and Conrad Burns of Montana, switched their votes at the
last minute to maintain party unity, and Republicans who voted
against the GOP proposal said they did so under duress and despite
arm-twisting by GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out of there because I didn't want a lot of pressure,''
said Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican from Illinois who
rejected the Republican measure. Fitzgzerald said Craig was unhappy
with his vote, but he believed Republicans were mistakingly giving
the issue to Democrats.

LUCAS MAKES THE FILM HE ALWAYS ENVISIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's good to be the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But even though George Lucas _ beloved ``Star Wars'' creator,
billionaire independent movie entrepreneur, deified shaper of a
generation's imagination _ spent $115 million of his own mony to
make ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' exactly the way
he wanted to, he still has at least eight toes firmly planted on
the drab little planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a movie,'' Lucas says about the prequel to his
'70s/'80s sci-fi trilogy that, in more than a few precincts of
Western civilization, is the most eagerly anticipated event this
side of the Second Coming. ``When you get a situation like this,
where you have so much high expectation, it can't possibly live up
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' did, however, have to meet Lucas' high
standards. With more than 2,000 computer generated shots (four
times the average used in big movies like ``Titanic''), a
half-dozen fully realized alien worlds, hundreds of new creatures
and fleets of redesigned space, land and even underwater vehicles,
it had to blend animated and live-action elements seamlessly in
practically every frame.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who has not directed a feature film since the first, 1977
``Star Wars'' movie, has waited all this time for Industrial Light
&AMP; Magic, the effects outfit he built with the trilogy's profits, to
get up to high-tech speed to accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
   ILM has been on the cutting edge of movie magic breakthroughs
for two decades. Besides the ``Star Wars'' sequels ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the Jedi'' (1983) and the
Lucas-produced, Steven Spielberg-directed Indiana Jones trilogy,
the Marin County firm counts ``Terminator 2'' and the ``Jurassic
Park'' pictures among its numerous benchmark credits. But Lucas'
intricate vision for the ``Star Wars'' universe only became
achievable within the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to make movies and I wanted to finish this,'' eternal
child Lucas, slightly bearish and definitely graying at the age of
55, said at a New York press conference last week. ``I had been
very frustrated before when I made the first series because I had
an imagination that created a kind of world that I could never get
on film. It was just technically impossible. I was stuck with
creatures in rubber masks that couldn't move very far, with
environments that extremely limited what I could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one part of coming back was to finish the story. But part
of it was the chance to make it more the way it was in my mind when
I created it, have alien creatures give good performances and have
really good personalities and be part of the whole dramatic
experience.'' But even that wasn't a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I had doubts for, oh, the last 4{ years,'' says a
straight-faced Rick McCallum, ``Phantom Menace's'' producer and
Lucas' right-hand man. ``There was a lot of flop sweat. Even when
we started shooting, we had no idea how we were going to accomplish
half the things in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty terrifying. I don't think there's any other
business in the world where you spend so much money and resources
and time and talent to start something, and you still don't know
how you're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unnerving as that may be, it's the core of the Lucas ethic, both
personally and in the message his films impart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk-taking is part of life,'' Lucas says. ``It's a central
theme in all of my movies. My first film, `THX 1138' (1971), is
about someone trapped in an emotionless world who takes the risk of
trying to find some emotion and leave that world. A very small
gesture, but a very difficult one for him to make. `American
Graffiti' (1973) is pretty much the same story, about the challenge
and risk of leaving your hometown, leaving your nest and going off
into the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in my life, that's been very important. At various
points I've taken what I consider great risks, and I don't think
I'd be where I am today if I hadn't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas likes to view himself as a maverick, and in a way he is.
Even though he's the ultimate purveyor of mass-market,
Hollywood-style entertainment, he's anti-Hollywood to the core.
He's gone so far as to establish his own independent filmmaking
fiefdom _ the state-of-the-art Skywalker Ranch north of San
Francisco _ where only he, and no studio executive, calls the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Modesto office-supply merchant, Lucas' early
interest in auto racing was cut short by a crash that damaged his
lungs. Turning to film, he enrolled at the University of Southern
California, where his student project eventually grew into the
existential _ and uncommercial _ sci-fi project ``THX.'' Though the
nostalgic ``American Graffiti'' became a huge hit, Lucas chafed at
studio interference with and lack of enthusiasm for the project.
</P>
<P>
   He made ``Star Wars'' on a frayed shoestring of a budget, had
trouble selling it to a distributor and ultimately made a deal with
20th Century Fox that gave him all sequel and merchandizing rights
to the property in exchange for forgoing a $500,000 directing fee.
It proved to be the deal of the century _ for Lucas. The first
three ``Star Wars'' films have collectively grossed $1.8 billion
worldwide. Toys, books, posters, clothing, video games and hundreds
of other ``Star Wars'' products have wrung up about $5 billion in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   All pretty impressive for a guy who claims to be an independent
filmmaker. But Lucas defends the mass-merchandising of his
``personal'' cinematic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie and the merchandising are two different things,
although people like to think that they're connected,'' Lucas
insists. ``I make the movies, I'm an independent filmmaker in San
Francisco, and I have to make sure that I've exploited everything
that I possibly can in a movie. It's like when an Indian kills a
buffalo, he has to use everything. We can't throw things away, we
can't leave a dead carcass out on the prairie to rot. I'm a very
small company relative to the studios. They have billions and
billions of dollars, they make billions of dollars every single
year. They can afford to just do whatever they want; I can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The licensing thing is just something that sort of grew
spontaneously. It certainly wasn't something that anybody
predicted; the first toys didn't come out until a year after the
film came out. It's grown into this big opportunity that has helped
finance the movies for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one man's independence is another man's power trip.
Lucas comes off as a low-key, even-tempered guy. A divorced father
devoted to his three young children, Lucas eschews the kind of
imperious behavior that has stereotypically characterized
mega-directors from Von Stroheim to Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if power corrupts ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's nobody who does anything in the theater,
painting, any art form whatsoever, who doesn't want freedom and
control over his work,'' McCallum says in vigorous defense of his
boss. ``Any artist wants to be in a position not to have to listen
to that person who is only thinking about the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a guy who has actually beaten the system,
who is not a part of the machine,'' McCallum continues about Lucas.
``And who, also, does not have a titanic ego, who is not a
megalomaniac, who does not give a s--- about private jets and
boats, who is just a basic guy. That is everything that's repugnant
to us, and we don't want to have anything to do with it. But the
only thing that actually makes that happen at the end of the day
is, unfortunately, you have to have the success and money to be
able to hold it together.''
</P>
<P>
   All that acknowledged, Lucas admits that ``Star Wars' ''
phenomenal success has been a double-edged lightsaber.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I conceived of `Star Wars' about the time I'd finished `THX,'
when I was getting a lot of pressure from my peers to do something
other than these offbeat, artsy, nonstory, noncharacter movies,''
Lucas recalls. ``They thought I should move into a more socially
acceptable medium. That's when I came up with the idea of doing a
sort of modern mythology, Saturday matinee serial for kids. One was
`Indiana Jones' and the other was `Star Wars.' The thing I actually
hated the most in college is what I've done the most of in real
life. I guess that's the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' was a very big, consuming thing,'' he adds. ``It's
like a little tar baby I stuck my fist in 23 years ago. I'm a
little surprised at how big it got; it's sort of dominated my life.
I don't regret it, it's been a very interesting experience and very
rewarding in a lot of ways. But I stopped after `Return of the
Jedi' because I was burned out. It's a nine-year commitment, and
that's a big deal. This'll be fine, it'll be fun, but it's a lot of
work and I do want to go on and do other movies.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, the next two movies in the prequel trilogy
(preproduction began on the second feature last week). Lucas will
direct both, and he's not complaining about it. Having finally made
the picture he's always dreamed about, the satisfaction factor far
outweighs any contradictory creative longings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first film for which I was able to sit down and,
basically, let my imagination run wild and not be hampered by `I
can't do this and I can't do that,''' Lucas says of his latest
baby. ``I could dream up whatever I wanted and, for the most part,
pull it all off. It's always a little nerve-racking when you take
risks and you don't quite know whether it's going to work or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the whole movie,'' he says of the critically dismissed
``Phantom Menace.'' ``I've taken some chances in the storytelling
and the way I've put it together and, I think, by and large I've
been successful.'' &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ More than 60 Albanians were killed and
scores more badly wounded late Thursday night when bombs blew apart
a village in southwest Kosovo, near Prizren, Yugoslav officials and
journalists at the scene said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, in the village of Korisa, was said by Yugoslav
government officials to have been carried out by NATO warplanes. A
Serbian journalist from Agence-France Presse, Alexander Mitic, said
he had found a bomb stabilizer fin with the marking GBU-12, which
would indicate a NATO laser-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, said they were
investigating the report and were reluctant to comment before their
work was complete. They said there was Yugoslav shelling in the
region. Earlier, NATO had announced that its planes had made many
strikes near Prizren and Stimlje, near Suva Reka, where the Kosovo
Liberation Army is active. Korisa is about three miles north of
Prizren on the road to Suva Reka.
</P>
<P>
   Casualty figures were also uncertain, with a Prizren police
officer Friday evening telling Radovan Urosevic, the director of
the Serbian Media Center in Pristina, that 79 people were dead and
58 injured. Urosevic said the figures were not complete. The media
center is closely connected to Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   If those figures are accurate, and if NATO aircraft are
responsible, it would represent the largest number of people killed
by a misdirected NATO bomb in the 52 days of the alliance's air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, Yugoslav officials said 75 Albanian refugees had
died in an accidental attack on a convoy near the southwestern
Kosovo town of Djakovica. NATO acknowledged attacking the convoy,
saying it was hitting military vehicles, but foreign journalists
brought to the scene did not see all the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's incident, the official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug,
said at least 100 people had died, and the Russian Foreign Ministry
immediately condemned the attack, calling it ``a new crime by the
alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitic, the journalist for Agence-France Presse, and other
journalists based in Pristina said they had counted 48 corpses,
many of them children, in the Prizren hospital morgue. Mitic also
said he saw three large plastic garbage bags filled with body parts
and 16 more corpses still at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dragan Softic of the Prizren hospital said 61 people had
been admitted with serious injuries, including five people in
intensive care and another seven who had limbs amputated in
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He said that all the injured had ``blast syndrome injuries,
severe burns and fractures of the spine,'' indicating that regular
bombs, not anti-personnel cluster bombs, had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't bring in those who died on the spot as there was
no time,'' Softic said. ``Therefore, I can't give the exact death
toll because Albanians take their dead away.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who died were part of a group of about 500 Albanian
refugees who were traveling through southwest Kosovo with tractors,
and who had stopped in Korisa for the night, sleeping in what
Urosevic described as a long, low building that could have been a
warehouse. The bombs fell about midnight, survivors said. There was
bombing nearby at about 8:30 a.m. &UR;  &LR; Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the scene saw at least two large craters.
</P>
<P>
   While Yugoslav officials said the refugees were ``returning
home,'' they could have been seeking to cross the border into
Albania or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Urosevic said he had counted at least 15 burned tractors and
trailers lined up outside the warehouse, while another 15 seemed
less damaged. Mitic said nine charred bodies still lay by the
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army Press Center in Belgrade, which authorizes all
media travel outside the Yugoslav capital, did not organize or
authorize a trip to the village Friday by foreign journalists based
in Belgrade, saying that it was too late in the day for the
seven-hour drive and that foreign journalists were already on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists were taken to Pristina Friday on a separate
visit, but Urosevic said they had arrived too late to go to Korisa,
in part because of intensive NATO air activity.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   A 62-year-old Albanian, Zecir Urimeraj, told Mitic that the
group of refugees had been ``hiding in the forests, but Serb
authorities have assured us we can return to our homes.'' He said
two of his daughters, aged 2 and 3, and his brother-in-law had all
died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 other displaced people had spent the night in nearby
houses, where, according to the witnesses, many were injured. Mitic
saw about a dozen damaged houses.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion of the first bomb, the survivors fled toward
nearby fields, Urimeraj said. ``But the bombing continued there
also.''
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, Dostan Rexhaj, 49, told a Serb journalist
working for Reuters, Goran Tomasevic: ``We decided to spend the
night here. Some time around midnight, they bombed us from their
warplanes three times. It was a horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexhaj added: ``Many people burned up instantly. When news that
they bombed us got through, police rounded up the wounded and took
them to Prizren hospital. But we still can't collect all the
bodies. They are all around the place _ in the fields and nearby
farms. They have been blown to pieces.'' He said he thought more
than 150 people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, Feriz Ametaj, said at least 100 people had
been killed. ``Numerous burnt bodies have been evacuated since this
morning in bags,'' he told Mitic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade Friday, the Yugoslav government, in a meeting lead
by President Slobodan Milosevic, urged the United Nations to press
for an immediate halt to the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``International opinion should understand that a halt to the
bombing would mean an immediate return to peace,'' the government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But two mayors in Serbia, members of the political opposition,
urged Milosevic to make peace in order to stop the bombing.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Zoran Zivkovic, mayor of Nis, heavily hit by the NATO raids,
urged Belgrade to take the West's latest proposals as the ``basis
for political solution'' for the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea is worth the death of whole population,'' Zivkovic
said. ``Patriotism is not to push the whole nation towards death,
but to ensure the future for them.'' He is a top official in the
Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic, who has fled Serbia for its
sister republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Velimir Ilic, mayor of Cacak, 100 miles south of Belgrade, where
four people were killed and 13 injured in NATO air raids on Monday,
called on the authorities to do ``everything to stop the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilic, a leader of a smaller opposition party, told the
independent Beta news agency: ``Destruction in the country is
great, and there are more and more dead every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the first staff and aid supplies arrived from the
International Committee of the Red Cross since the organization
pulled out of the war zone on March 29, five days after the bombing
started.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said a four-vehicle convoy carrying food and
shelter materials had driven into Pristina from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, NATO planes again attacked the electricity
supplies of the three largest Yugoslav cities of Belgrade, Nis and
Novi Sad, while insisting that electricity supplies were military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO does not strike anything which is not directly connected
with fueling the Yugoslav war machine,'' said the NATO spokesman,
Jamie Shea. ``We want to disrupt the command and control of the
Yugoslav forces.''

   The Queen of the Bulls Still Stays the Course &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For followers of Abby Joseph Cohen, investment strategist at
Goldman, Sachs, it probably seems like a reflex reaction. Bad news
prompts a market selloff. Ms. Cohen, a perennial bull, tells
investors not to fret.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again on Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average
lost 193.87 points on the news that the Consumer Price Index rose
an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent last month, fueling inflation
fears. Speaking at a Goldman, Sachs conference, Ms. Cohen said the
concerns were overdone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe we are on the cusp of an increase in
inflation,'' she said, adding that excess capacity in many
industries and stable commodity prices will temper price increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is in a trading range of
1,300 to 1,350, and it may get a boost as companies report
second-quarter profits, Ms. Cohen said. ``The direction of the S&AMP;P
will be higher,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen added that she didn't expect a ``significant spike''
in interest rates. For the year, she said, inflation will be 1.5
percent to 2 percent. (Bloomberg News) &QL;

<P>
   The Dogs of The Dow, Are Having Their Day &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly news to index watchers that the Dow Jones industrial
average has been on a tear. Since April 8, it has returned 9.1
percent through last Thursday, beating the broader, more
growth-oriented Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which has
returned just 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winners have been investors who follow the
so-called Dogs of the Dow stock-picking system. Although there are
several variations on the theme, the most popular one calls simply
for buying in equal dollar amounts the 10 Dow industrials with the
highest yield as of year-end, and holding them for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 8, the Dog stocks have returned 15.8 percent through
Thursday, according to Richard J. Moroney, editor of Dow Theory
Forecasts, a newsletter in Hammond, Ind. The 1999 Dogs are General
Motors, Philip Morris, J.P. Morgan, Eastman Kodak, Goodyear Tire
and Rubber, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Caterpillar,
Chevron, Exxon and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does leave you with a list of stocks that have low
price-earnings, low price-to-book ratios and low price-to-sales,''
Moroney said. ``Apart from J.P. Morgan, these are all kind of
classical cyclical stocks.'' And they are the types of stocks that
have performed best as higher valuation growth stocks have paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that's really helped them has been their
exposure to oil stocks,'' he said. The spot price of crude oil has
risen nearly 50 percent this year, as of Friday. In addition to the
big integrated oil companies among this year's Dogs, DuPont has a
big oil exposure, through its big stake in Conoco. &QL;

   1999 Hasn't Been Stellar For Two Big Hedge Funds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Soros and Julian H. Robertson, the managers of the
world's biggest hedge funds, are losing money this year even as
smaller rivals stage a comeback, according to investors and market
news services.
</P>
<P>
   The Quantum fund, the $6.75 billion flagship of Soros Fund
Management, was down 13.8 percent through May 5, and Robertson's
Tiger Management, with about $13 billion in assets, lost 8.5
percent through April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very large pools of assets and it is hard to deploy
all the money,'' said David Horn, a partner at Graystone Partners
in Chicago, which helps wealthy clients place $4 billion with 125
managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Horn said some other hedge funds bounced back strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Omega Overseas Partners Ltd., the $1.2 billion offshore fund of
Leon G. Cooperman's Omega Advisors, for example, returned 12.4
percent through April 30, investors said. It lost about 5 percent
in 1998, in part on wrong-way bets on Russian debt. Cooperman, who
declined to comment, has been sticking to stock-picking this year,
investors said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the biggest bond hedge fund, with
about $4.8 billion in net assets, climbed 11.7 percent through
April 30, investors said, though it has lost 0.57 percent since
February. A spokesman declined to comment. The firm, founded by
John W. Meriwether, a former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers, was
acquired last year by 14 lenders when it collapsed after Russia's
default.

SURVEY INDICATES CONFIDENCE IN COURTS DIVIDED AMONG RACES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new national survey indicates confidence in state
and local courts is divided across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the Hearst Corp., found black Americans
far less satisfied with the courts than others, particularly
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is that the courts protect our constitutional
rights, and that they are honest and fair. But there is also an
overwhelming belief that equal justice under the law is more equal
to some than to others,'' said Hearst President and Chief Executive
Officer Frank A. Bennack Jr., who released the survey results
Friday at the two-day National Conference on Public Trust and
Confidence in the Justice System.
</P>
<P>
   The conference included remarks by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, who urged federal and state judges to strive to increase
public trust in the court system even as they continue to render
decisions based solely on the law, without regard to popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,826 adults, conducted Jan. 13 to Feb. 15,
revealed that most Americans view judges as honest and fair in
deciding cases and ensuring that litigants are adequately
represented.
</P>
<P>
   But the study, by the Indiana University Public Opinion
Laboratory, also showed that nearly 80 percent of Americans believe
court cases take too long to be resolved and about 67 percent say
it is too expensive to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight percent of blacks surveyed say that ``people like
them'' are treated worse than others in court. Thirty-three percent
of Hispanics surveyed felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 percent of Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites say they
believe blacks receive worse treatment, the survey indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hispanics, 33 percent say they strongly agreed with the
statement that courts make reasonable efforts to ensure all
litigants get adequate legal help. Twenty-nine percent of
non-Hispanic whites and 27 percent of blacks said the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 85 percent of participants say courts protect
criminal defendants' constitutional rights, and 18 percent prefer
that a judge ignore the law to ensure a defendant's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But 81 percent also say they believe judges' decisions are
influenced by political considerations, and 78 percent agreed with
a statement saying elected judges ``are influenced by having to
raise campaign funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent disagree with this statement: ``The media's
portrayal of courts is mostly accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said judges can inspire trust and remain independent
if they make their courts more understandable to citizens by taking
such steps as ``giving plain reasons'' for their decisions. These
efforts to educate the public must begin in the local traffic
courts, ``where most people have their only personal contact with
our judicial system,'' the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, however, warned judges that their efforts to inspire
confidence should not come at the expense of the need to decide
cases independently of the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, of course, it is possible in the name of building public
trust and confidence in the judicial system to say that judges who
have rendered an unpopular decision should reconsider it if a
majority of the public does not agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever such a practice might do to increase public trust
and confidence in the system _ and I think it might be quite
counterproductive _ it would be quite contrary to the idea of an
independent judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the public most effectively voices its criticism
at the federal court level, where judges must first be nominated by
the president and confirmed by the Senate. Rehnquist himself
survived two bruising Senate confirmation battles to become an
associate Supreme Court justice and later chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slow process, but it is the only one consistent with
the idea of an independent judiciary,'' Rehnquist said. ``Whatever
may be the merits or demerits of a poll-driven executive or
legislature, the specter of a poll-driven judiciary is not an
appealing one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the conference included the National Center for
State Courts, American Bar Association, League of Women Voters,
Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court
Administrators.

ALLIES DEFEND USE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon and NATO on Friday defended the use of
cluster bombs in the NATO air campaign over Kosovo, saying the
weapons are as accurate as other gravity bombs and remain effective
against targets like troop concentrations, airfields and other
large military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has charged that a NATO warplane fired at the Kosovo
village of Korisa, killing more than 60 civilians in an assault
that bore some resemblance to one caused by cluster bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing, Pentagon officials said that NATO airplanes were
attacking in the general area, but that they had no evidence so far
that any of the planes had been near that village or that cluster
bombs had been used in attacks in that region.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of cluster bombs was criticized just last week in
the strike on the market in Nis, where Belgrade said 15 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   General John Jumper, commander general of U.S. Air Forces in
Europe, emphasized today that cluster bombs have the same accuracy
of other bombs that are not precision-guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean mistakes don't happen,'' said Jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pentagon and NATO officials said they were reluctant to say
yet who was to blame in the Korisa deaths, asserting that they had
to wait until the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's good reason to be cautious about the Serb
reports,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``I would just
urge you to be careful with those reports; don't rush to judgment.
NATO is in the middle of investigating this now, and as soon as
they finish, we will have something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they did not want to repeat the mistakes
made in April when NATO warplanes accidentally hit a refugee convoy
in southeastern Kosovo. At first NATO officials publicly denied
responsibility for the April 14 bombing, suggesting Serbian planes
were to blame. But then, after a series of gaffes, they had to
retract their statements and admit NATO jets had hit two convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch appealed this week to NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana to stop using cluster bombs in the air campaign. The
group warned in particular about small unexploded bomblets left by
these cluster bombs. These duds, they said, ``effectively turn into
landmines and like antipersonnel landmines, they kill civilians
even years after the conflict has ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of cluster bombs, particularly in urban areas or
populated areas, has grave consequences for the civilians,'' said
William Arkin, the author of the Human Rights Watch report. ``In
the short term we've already seen two young kids killed picking up
the brightly colored bomblets and in the long term you'll see they
are a hazard for peacekeepers and rebuilders of Kosovo.``
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said unexploded ordinances are a hazard in any war,
whether from bomblets from cluster bombs are no worse than the far
larger .
</P>
<P>
   Italy questioned NATO on Friday about hundreds of de-activated
bombs that have been found in fishermen's nets in international
waters in the north Adriatic Sea. The Italian government has been
receiving complaints from fishermen operating out of the port of
Chioggia, east of Venice. Italian airbases host the majority of the
NATO airfleet engaged in the air campaign against Kosovo which lies
directly across the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials confirmed today that ``in rare cases'' pilots are
unloading bombs into the Adriatic Sea when there has been a
technical malfunction of the plane and it can not safely land
without shedding the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure by overflying the area first to see there is
nobody there and then these weapons are jettisoned there,'' said
Major General Walter Jertz, a NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said that when the pilots jettison their bombs they do not
explode because they are already crippled by the malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of Chioggia had complained to the Italian government
that these bombs are washing up on the beaches and could cause
injuries.

 Budding Fine Wineries Boost the Flow of Profits in Industry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Wine producers often lament the fact that Americans don't drink
enough wine: Per-capita consumption of table wines grew a measly 2
percent last year, which hardly kept pace with the population
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The average adult American drinks about a bottle of wine a
month, and a whopping 70 percent of the drinking-age population
doesn't touch wine at all.
</P>
<P>
   But per-capita figures alone are meaningless, according to wine
industry economist Jon Fredrikson at Schied Vineyard's annual
meeting in San Francisco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The more important thing is that the 11 percent of the
population who consume 88 percent of the wine continue to spend
more on wine.
</P>
<P>
   The market for premium wines, defined as anything above $7 per
750 milliliter bottle, is exploding. Although premium wines
represent 19 percent of total U.S. production, they account for 44
percent of the total $5.1 billion revenues, Fredrikson noted. As a
sign of their popularity and profitability, these wines dominate
shelf position in supermarkets and wine stores.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of premium wineries have popped up as the favorable
economy, weather conditions, health studies and aging of the Baby
Boomer generation have nurtured California's wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, average per-capita spending on wine has more than
doubled from $18 in 1990 to $38 in 1998. Although total wine
consumption increased just 2 percent last year, premium wines
priced $7 to $14 were up 15 percent, ``ultra-premium'' wines in the
$14 to $25 price gained 10 percent and ``luxury'' wines priced $25
and up jumped 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of hot-selling varietals such as Merlot soared 34 percent
last year and were up another 28 percent in the first four months
of this year, Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been trained to watch wine volume, not
dollars, but that is a mistake,'' added industry consultant Victor
Motto. Another indication of the robust market for California wines
is that privately owned wineries are being acquired for record
prices. The latest crop of vintners to be acquired includes Geyser
Peak, Sonoma-Cutrer, Simi and Franciscan, and experts expect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profit margins of super- and ultra-premium wine producers
is quite strong and buyers know the value of consumer brands,''
said Motto, who believes more acquisitions are likely.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to boost wine consumption in certain parts of this
country, the Wine Market Council in Larkspur has been testing
generic ads in Austin, Texas, and Albany, N.Y. Official results of
the ``Wine _ What are you saving it for?'' campaign will be tallied
next month.
</P>
<P>
   But John Gillespie, president of the council, said it seems to
be working. After the three-month promotional campaign in Austin,
indications are that table wine sales were up 24 percent from the
comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for top wines extends to varietal grapes, which is so
strong that Kendall-Jackson Winery of Santa Rosa announced last
week that it will sell vines as well as wines. Kendall-Jackson will
graft 4.3 million vines on its 70-acre ranch north of Madera in the
Central Valley this year and for the first time will sell them to
other growers and nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, which started growing rootstock and grafting on
premium varietal cuttings for its own use six years ago, sees
growing demand as more vineyard land is planted and replanted. A
number of vintners produce rootstock and so-called benchgrafts for
their own use, but Kendall-Jackson says it is the only one to
develop it as a commercial offshoot.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, it expects to rank fifth in the industry. Major
nurseries Duarte, Sunridge, Sonoma Grape Vines and Vintage together
sell about 35 million vines a year.

 Vintners Showing MBAs How to Appreciate Wine
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Most mortals who want to sample wines these days have to visit
wineries to get free sips. And increasingly they have to pay for
the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But some vintners are going out of the way to court a new class
of promising customers _ MBA students at the premium universities.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson and Cakebread Cellars not only provide free
tastings and seminars to the next generation of business leaders,
they take their case (and cases) right to the graduate schools of
business at such spots as Stanford, the University of California at
Berkeley, Yale and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The average attendance at Kendall-Jackson's seminars is about 65
students, and bottle prices range from $10 to $60. The winery's
executive director of communication, Jim Stanley, figures the
events cost $30 to $50 per student.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners say they feel it is money well spent. After all, MBAs
from top schools often earn $100,000-plus when they graduate. And,
presumably, they also will host a lot of expense-account meals.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson of Santa Rosa has visited close to 30 top MBA
schools for each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cakebread Cellars of Rutherford started its targeted MBA mission
this spring. ``These are the decisionmakers of tomorrow,'' said
owner and CEO Jack Cakebread, who has visited MBA wine clubs at
Harvard, Yale, Stanford and UCLA in the past month and plans to
visit a dozen more top MBA schools by this fall. ``The best place
to do business is over a nice lunch or dinner and it's good to know
you don't order a sauterne with a steak.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, where nearly half the 1,200 students belong to the
wine club, Cakebread served five wines, including the $70 1995
Benchlands Select Cabernet, at two back-to-back seminars and
tastings attended by 60 MBA candidates each.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson's program offers similar sessions, which start
with a 40-minute multimedia presentation on wine production, the
market, health benefits and other classroom kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the ``interactive tasting'' segment, which typically
features four varieties of wine in two different styles so the
students can discern the difference, for example, between a
``crisp, lean, acidic'' Chardonnay and a ``big, oaky, buttery``
Chard. The students also get a taste of winespeak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's hard to quantify the potential financial rewards of
offering wine tastings on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missionary work can be effective,'' said John Gillespie,
president of the Wine Market Council, a nonprofit promotional
organization. ``And there's no question MBAs have promising
potential as wine ambassadors in corporations and their
communities.''

CLINTON APOLOGIZES BY PHONE TO CHINESE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after the NATO bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, President Clinton was finally able
to express his condolences directly to Chinese leaders on Friday in
a telephone call that also touched briefly on Chinese efforts to
gain entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   News of the phone call was quickly disseminated by the Chinese
news agency and featured on Chinese Central Television, suggesting
that the Chinese government is eager to portray the United States
as having bowed to its demands. It took the government two days to
publicize Clinton's first apology.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the half-hour conversation was devoted to
Washington's regret about the bombing, which killed three Chinese
journalists, Clinton also took the opportunity to say that Chinese
entry into the trade organization would benefit both countries,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cloud cast by the bombings, and long-standing
concerns in Congress about China, the Clinton administration still
hopes that trade talks can resume within the next month and that
China, which has continued its trade talks with Europe, can join
the world organization this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been trying to call Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president, after a mistake led to NATO bombs falling on the embassy
last Friday. But China, which opposed the NATO war with Yugoslavia
from the beginning, went into a public rage when its embassy was
hit, and rebuffed Clinton's overtures _ until Thursday night, when
Beijing signaled a willingness to ease the tensions.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Clinton at the White House by the Chinese ambassador
on Thursday night led to Friday's phone conversation. The White
House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, described it as constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president once again expressed his sincere regrets and
condolences to President Jiang and the Chinese people concerning
the tragic accident of last week,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``The
president expressed his desire that we move beyond this tragic
accident in our relationship,'' he said, adding that both sides
need to ``continue working'' on winning China access to the trade
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the Chinese leader ``took the opportunity to
express his views,'' but he would not characterize Jiang's side of
the conversation or say whether he accepted the president's
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, gave no clues to
Jiang's reaction either, saying only that he had ``noticed''
Clinton's apology. Most of its report said that the bombing was an
outrageous act that had shocked the world and created sympathy for
China, but it did not vilify the United States, as Jiang had done
publicly the day before, and did not demand an end to the NATO
bombing, as it has done before.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the news agency said Jiang repeated China's view that
there was a ``pressing need'' for the United States to conduct an
investigation of the incident and to make the results public. China
had previously demanded that those responsible for the error be
punished, but that was not included in Friday's news report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the severe strains between the two countries, officials
in Washington and Beijing were exploring when and where trade talks
between the United States and China might resume. U.S. officials
said it would be up to China to determine when a decent interval
had elapsed before putting the trade talks back on track.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said Friday,
``We don't have any specific plans to meet with the Chinese next
week.'' But, she said, ``I do think the Chinese wish to remain
engaged on WTO and indeed wish to re-engage, but we will have to
work out the specific time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cassidy, the U.S. trade representative's special China
negotiator, had planned to go to China next week. Now, officials
said, that meeting has been postponed for at least another week.
Officials said both countries were searching for some neutral
ground such as Geneva, where the trade organization is based.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two leaders engaged in their delicate dance toward
easing tensions, the governor of China's central bank signaled his
country's willingness to advance the trade talks. He said Friday
that the United States should stop demanding that China make any
more concessions to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some question of how much leverage the embassy
bombing might give the Chinese as they try to join the
organization, which would lower Chinese trade barriers and make it
conform with global trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said that the
bombing had not changed the requirements China needed to meet to
join the world body. ``Our approach as we go forward on
negotiations is that China's joining the WTO on solid commercial
terms is strongly in both countries' interest _ not that there's
been some alteration in leverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress also indicated their eagerness. Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., and about two dozen other senators, from both
parties, sent a letter to the president vowing to support permanent
most-favored-nation trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
   This would eliminate China's need to seek annual approval for
its access to U.S. markets _ and would eliminate the grueling
debate that Congress engages in every year when it uses the trade
vote as a chance to criticize China's human rights record. Congress
has become even more leery of China since allegations surfaced that
Beijing has stolen U.S. nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The president is to make his annual recommendation on whether
China should receive most-favored-nation status _ now called normal
trade relations _ by June 3. Congress then has 90 days to overturn
this opinion. The administration and its allies on Capitol Hill
were hoping that China's entry into the trade group would be
secured by then so that the issue would not spill over into this
fall's political campaigns.

<P>
   By accusing American Airlines of lowering its prices in a
deliberate attempt to drive smaller competitors out of its hub at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, as it did on Thursday, the
Justice Department has adopted a risky legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how obvious American's aggressive tactics may appear
to frequent fliers, the legal hurdles that must be overcome to
prove that American was guilty of the predatory practices charged
by the government are extremely high. William E. Kovacic, a
professor at the George Washington University Law School, said that
the latest case was the first predatory pricing case brought by the
government since the 1970s. ``That was partly the result of
deliberate policy choices made by the Reagan and Bush
administrations,'' he added. ``But it is also a recognition that
these cases are extremely difficult to win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the federal courts have ruled on about 150 private
predatory pricing cases since 1975, Kovacic estimated that those
claiming to be victims won on only a handful of occasions. ``The
success rate has been well under one in 10,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As American Airlines, which is a unit of AMR Corp., has been
quick to remind people, the antitrust laws are designed to protect
consumers, not competitors. In the last 15 years, the Supreme Court
has overturned virtually all lower court decisions that found
businesses guilty of trying to undermine competitors by lowering
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very
essence of competition,'' the court declared in a 1986 decision.
Thus, mistaken conclusions of predatory pricing are costly, the
court continued, ``because they chill the very conduct the
antitrust laws are designed to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers agree that they face a tough standard
but they argue that the unique qualities of the airline industry
create fertile ground for predatory practices. They charge that
American's actions in the mid-1990s against three small competitors
were so egregious that it amply meets the current legal tests
established by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``American crossed a fundamental line,'' said Joel I. Klein, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   American denied any wrongdoing and charged that the government
was ``overreaching'' the law in a bid to establish a new precedent.
``The government will be hard pressed to find law, facts, or common
sense that supports its position in this case,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Some antitrust experts agree. ``It's really a novel legal theory
that they are advancing,'' said Mark. C. Schechter, an antitrust
attorney at Howrey &AMP; Simon who led the Transportation, Energy and
Agriculture Section of the Justice Department's antitrust division
from 1988 to 1993. ``It is really a very aggressive application of
the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's charges focus on American's operations at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. American now flies 70
percent of the scheduled seats out of the airport. Dallas-Fort
Worth accounted for $2 billion of American's $17.4 billion in
overall revenue in 1998, making it the airline's most profitable
hub.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that by dominating major metropolitan
airports like Dallas, major carriers like American have a monopoly.
Few rivals of equal size would risk spending the money necessary to
challenge a major airline's hold on its hub, leaving only smaller
low-fare airlines as the only viable competition.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused American of deliberately lowering its
prices and adding more flights on specific routes out of
Dallas-Fort Worth in the mid-1990s to prevent three small carriers
_ Vanguard Airlines, Sun Jet International and Western Pacific _
from gaining a foothold there. Then, after the three upstarts were
forced to abandon the routes, American reduced the number of its
flights and raised prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the only reason American would risk losing
money by lowering prices and adding capacity was because it knew
that driving out the small competitors would discourage other
challengers and enable it to earn back monopoly profits at
Dallas-Fort Worth International. That is the very definition of
predatory pricing as defined by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit draws on internal American documents to show that
the airline estimated in 1993 that the potential encroachment of
low-cost airlines put $3.6 billion worth of American's annual
revenue ``at risk.'' Citing other documents, the government said
that American adopted a deliberate strategy to drive the
competitors out with the intention of making back later whatever
money it lost in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the arguments that will be heard in court,
American denied that it has a monopoly at Dallas-Fort Worth. The
airline said that it faced ``significant competition'' in the
Dallas market, where low-fare carriers also fly to 62 of the 75
cities it serves. Therefore, American said it was merely responding
to the competition when it lowered its prices. It added more
flights only because the lower fares stimulated more demand.
</P>
<P>
   American also counters that the government's case fails to prove
that it lowered its ticket prices below its variable costs when it
added flights on routes that competed with the smaller carriers.
That is one of the key tests of predatory behavior established by
the Supreme Court. That is where the government's case may run into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is not arguing that all of American's
disputed flights were flown below cost. While some were, according
to the government, others simply fell below American's own measures
of what was an acceptable profit. In other words, American was
willing to earn less than it would have by flying its planes on
other routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generally accepted standard is that to engage in predatory
pricing one must price the service below the incremental cost of
providing that service,'' Schechter said. ``What the Justice
Department is saying is that it doesn't matter that American's
pricing was below cost. It is very novel.''
</P>
<P>
   But one Justice Department lawyer said the Supreme Court
standard only demands that the price ``has to be below an
appropriate measure of cost.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation is sure to spark a debate in court when the
case comes to trial several months from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a pretty full battle,'' the Justice
Department lawyer said of the case. ``This is going to be a good
one to watch.''

 &HT;    Tourism workers meet world's travel writers
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County Convention and
Visitors Bureau employees will pitch the county's hotels and
attractions to tour operators and travel writers from all over the
world in the next few days _ and never leave South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The county tourism promoters will join an estimated 6,000 people
from 71 countries at the Travel Industry Association's
International Pow Wow beginning today at the Miami Beach Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Beach gets the biggest piece of the economic action as
host city to the event. But the visitors bureau and hoteliers from
Palm Beach County also expect to reap future bookings from the tour
operators they meet at the annual international show, the largest
of its kind in the industry. The show was last in Miami in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A total of $3 billion in business is expected to be conducted at
the show. Miami Beach will feel an economic impact of about $7
million just because of the show, and an estimated $300 million in
future bookings, according to Raul Rego, marketing manager at the
Miami Beach Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hoteliers and organizations representing resort destinations
have appointments to meet with tour operators from overseas,
including Europe and Latin America. They negotiate with the tour
operators to be included in brochures and tour packages that are
sold to travel agents and ultimately consumers, according to
Christophe Dagasson, director of leisure and international sales at
The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Convention and Visitors Bureau has a large
booth at the show, at a cost of $8,000, according to Public
Relations Director Ann Hersley. Three hoteliers _ the Sheraton
Oceanfront of Singer Island, the Colony of Palm Beach, and the
Radisson, Boca Raton _ share the booth as well. Other hotels,
including the Breakers, the Boca Raton Resort and Club and the
Radisson Palm Beach Shores Resort have their own booths. Still
others join the booths set up by their chains.
</P>
<P>
   Hersley couldn't estimate how much the event means for Palm
Beach County in terms of tourist dollars. But it's important enough
to the visitors bureau that they are sending nine people, primarily
to meet travel writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're meeting with people who I would otherwise have to spend
an exorbitant amount to fly around the world to see,'' Hersley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakers, which does about $1 million in business with
overseas tourists each year, plans to meet with tour operators from
Germany, England, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland, Dagasson said.
The resort already has contracts with 75 percent of these
operators, but it gives Dagasson the opportunity to present what's
new at The Breakers _ the new spa, beach club and ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we profit from it is we get to welcome some of the
delegates before and after the event,'' Dagasson said. ``We host
some of these top tour operators at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagasson said one of the large tour operators The Breakers
contracts with might book as many as 1,700 room nights a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators will try to negotiate wholesale rates for resort
rooms, allowing them to pay travel agents a commission and still
make money, Dagasson said.
</P>
<P>
   Visit Florida, a public-private agency created in 1996 to
promote tourism, hosts tours for operators before and after the
show. But, none are scheduled to visit Palm Beach County, said
Maria Hayworth, director of public relations and promotions.

   BC-LEMBA-JEWISH-GENES-NYT (moved on Saturday, May 8)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, May 8,
about genetic research suggesting that some members of the Lemba, a
group of South African blacks, have Jewish ancestry, omitted
attribution for two points. While The Times's account was gathered
independently, The Jerusalem Report was the source of the fact that
one researcher was in Toronto when he began thinking about ways of
tracing Jewish lineage, and the fact that the Lemba number more
than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred imprecisely to an earlier historic
reconstruction using Y chromosomes _ the case of Thomas Jefferson,
and whether he fathered a child or children by his slave Sally
Hemings. The chromosome study in that case corroborated an oral
tradition, short of confirming it.

JAMES W. NANCE, RETIRED ADMIRAL AND HELMS AIDE, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ga.)   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James W. Nance, a retired Navy rear admiral who
took on a late-career job as the chief aide to his old boyhood
friend Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, died on Tuesday at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. He was 77 and lived
in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Marc A. Thiessen, the spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, where Nance was staff director, said the cause was
complications of myelodysplasia, a pre-leukemia condition.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Nance was known for having brought order to the
committee's Republican staff, which Helms, the senior Republican,
and others on the panel had found disorganized and riven by
ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came over here, I couldn't understand the
organization,'' Nance said in a 1992 interview with The National
Journal after agreeing to come out of retirement a year earlier to
help his old friend. ``It was a zoo to me. My military mind has got
to have all the men and women in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance's role was important then, when Helms was the committee's
ranking minority member, and it became more important later, when,
after the 1994 elections, the Republicans took control of the
Senate and Helms became chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nance was brought in, The National Journal said in its
1992 article, there had been a movement among the committee's
Republicans to remove Helms as their leader because of the minority
staff's disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Helms accepted Nance's recommendation that eight members of the
staff be fired, and, although there was an angry reaction at first,
Republican leaders later said the Nance replacements had brought
order to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Nance was born in Monroe, N.C., where he and Helms grew up two
blocks from each other. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in
1944 and went on to serve as a naval aviator in World War II, the
Korean War and the Vietnam War. By the time he retired from the
Navy in 1979, he had held several commands, including that of the
aircraft carrier Forrestal.
</P>
<P>
   He became a humorous if caustic reflection of the Helms, who
seems to enjoy saying no to State Department requests. Once, when
questioning the benefits given to ambassadors abroad, including
hardship pay at some posts, Nance said: ``I fought at Iwo Jima.
That's hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   He had many Navy decorations, including two Distinguished
Service Medals and the Legion of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   After his Navy service, Nance served for two years on the White
House staff of President Ronald Reagan and later worked for Boeing
in its naval systems department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Naval Academy, he graduated from the Naval War
College and the National War College, and received a master's
degree in international relations from George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nance, who was known as Bud to his friends, is survived by his
wife of 51 years, the former Mary Lyda Faulk; two sons, James Lee
Nance of Richmond and Andrew Monroe Nance of McLean; two daughters,
Mary Catherine Worth of Atlanta and Susan Elizabeth Nance of
McLean, and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When Nance agreed to go to work for Helms, The Washington Times
reported in an obituary on Wednesday, he asked that he not be paid,
but the senator pointed out that a federal law required that Senate
staff members be paid a minimum of $153 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Once he went to work for the $153, Nance said, ``Nobody can ever
say Jesse gave his old buddy a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, noting that his friend's pay came out to $2.94 a week,
said, ``Bud's worth every penny.''

 &HT;    Convention attracts radio hams from across globe
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Yasuo Tokuda spent 24 hours on airplanes and in
airports traveling from Japan to Hamvention, where is shopping for
military radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say we are crazy,'' said Tokuda in broken English and
with a big smile. ``Hamvention is very, very famous. Every time, my
wife says, `Never buy.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Tokuda, who has been to Hamvention half-a-dozen times, buys.
Tokuda says he has more than 1,000 pieces of radio equipment in his
small home.
</P>
<P>
   Tokuda isn't the only ham who travels from afar for Hamvention
at Hara Arena. Join the meandering flow of Hamvention shoppers and
you'll hear Italian, Spanish, Japanese and British accents.
Organizers say people from all 50 states and 50 foreign countries
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a radio ham. He loves old radios. He buys
thousands of them. And he finds wonderful bargains here,'' said
Mercedes Reguant, who lives outside of Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Reguant family traveled through New York City, where they
were mugged, and arrived Thursday at Hamvention. By Friday morning,
Jaime Reguant had already purchased 12 or 14 antique radios,
Mercedes Reguant said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Sheila Williams of Southampton, England, spent $1,000
in airfare and built their two-week vacation around Hamvention.
They flew into Washington, rented a car and drove through Amish
country on their way to their first Hamvention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nothing like this in England. Ours are one-day
events, very small,'' Mike Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Many amateur radio operators claim nothing beats the prices,
scope and organization of Hamvention, a Dayton-area event for the
last 48 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hamvention is the biggest show in the world,'' said Lucia
Hendriks of Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Hara Arena, manufacturers and dealers display the latest
equipment and gear. Thousands of hams mill about the arena floor to
shop and buy. Outside, 2,800 vendors set up an open-air flea market
where radio and computer equipment _ high-tech, low-tech, old and
new _ is displayed on folding tables and sheltered by tarps. In the
flea market, radio enthusiasts hunt for old parts, collectors items
and bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a place to buy gadgets and gear, Hamvention is one of
the best places to people-watch. An odd sight at Hamvention is a
ham without a radio tucked in his pocket or hanging off his belt
and a microphone clipped to his lapel or strapped to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Men wearing hats that announce their name and call letters are
common: W4HFB Hugh, KC8NP Steve, KT4SU Norm. Some hats even have
the antenna attached as a sign of a ham who isn't afraid to look a
little, well, goofy. As the hams shop, they fiddle with their
radios and talk into their headsets. Some carry backpacks to hold
their mobile radio equipment. And if hams get separated in the
crowd _ which is expected to be 28,000 over three days _ they just
call one another on their radios.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pagliarani of Rimini, Italy, has been making a pilgrimage
to Hamvention for 10 years, looking for airplane altimeters and
testing equipment. When asked if Hamvention was worth the trip, he
replied ``Si, si, si. Number one.''

 &HT;    Portman relishes challenge of `The Phantom Menace'
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Natalie Portman was reluctant to take the coveted
role of Queen Amidala in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' and its forthcoming sequels. The 17-year-old actress
hesitated for two reasons: The length of her commitment to George
Lucas' top-grossing sci-fi series and the impact such colossal
films would have on her personal and professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Portman, who made her screen debut in 1994's ``The
Professional,'' was approached at age 14 to play Amidala. As the
future mother of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, she will also
appear in Episodes II and III, the last of which will arrive in
2005. From production of ``The Phantom Menace'' to publicity for
the final film, the teen-ager was looking at a 10-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge thing to do at any age,'' Portman said during an
interview Sunday at the Regency Hotel. ``And when you're 14 and
don't know what you're going to do the next day, you're not really
jumping on the opportunity to sign away your life until you're 24
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace,'' opening at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday on 5,000
screens, is one of the most anticipated movies of the decade.
``When you do any sort of big film it changes your life because you
become more recognizable,'' Portman said. ``It makes your life a
lot more difficult. But also, it presented so many opportunities
and it seemed like I was going to have the best summer ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Long days of shooting under the hot sun in the Tunisian desert,
while wearing cumbersome costumes and head-pieces, proved more
difficult than she expected. Her makeup and hair took 2 1/2 hours;
getting into costume was another 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have done harder things for money, but it wasn't as big
of a breeze as I thought it was going to be,'' she said with a
schoolgirl giggle. ``I thought it was just going to be this flighty
action movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, ``The Phantom Menace's'' female lead never saw the
original ``Star Wars'' until after she was offered the role. ``I
was really excited by it,'' Portman said. ``I think it's a really
fun and entertaining film. And I love films that have meanings on
different levels, depending on what you want to take away from it.
It can just be entertainment or it could be the way of your life,
as some people have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman was born in 1981 in Jerusalem, Israel, and moved with
her physician father and artist mother to Maryland at age 3, and
then to Connecticut at age 7, before finally settling in Long
Island, New York. She was approached at a New York pizza parlor at
age 11 by a Revlon representative, and was soon appearing in their
ads. But Portman didn't want to model; she wanted to act.
</P>
<P>
   Her first film role was as a young girl who allies herself with
a hitman after her parents are killed by a corrupt DEA officer in
``The Professional.'' Portman's performance was hailed by critics
and she received a YoungStar Award, sponsored by The Hollywood
Reporter, for best actress in a drama. Films such as ``Heat,''
``Everyone Says I Love You,'' ``Beautiful Girls'' and ``Mars
Attacks!'' followed, along with her Broadway debut last year in the
title role of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Phantom Menace,'' Lucas was looking for someone
youthful and strong, along the lines of Leia. ``Natalie is very
intelligent and has a lot of presence and is a very strong
person,'' the director said. ``At the same time, she's very young.
I needed somebody to play a 14-year-old girl who basically could be
elected to rule a planet and make that believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman praises Lucas for creating strong female characters for
his films. ``I was thrilled to get to be the really smart and in
control one, and also get to kick some butt at the end of this one,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Amidala is a great role model for girls, she said, particularly
as a straight-A high school senior who sees her fellow students
lose more and more self-confidence every year. ``It's I think a
teen-age trait in general to be self-conscious, but especially in
girls, we don't have a lot of female leaders to look up to. There
have been very few in reality and very few on film, because film on
the whole has been a reflection of reality. So I think it's really
cool for a girl to see _ even if it's a fantasy _ this young woman
in a very strong and powerful position.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman has been accepted to both Harvard and Yale. Her choice,
like her real last name, the town she lives in and the school she
attends, remains private for security reasons. ``I lead a really,
really regular life,'' she said. ``I go to public school. My
friends are regular people and my parents are not involved in the
industry at all. I lead a really regular life and I'd like to keep
that as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As feared, ``The Phantom Menace'' and its high-profile publicity
campaign might make that more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a lot more interested in me all of a sudden,''
Portman admitted. ``They care about where I live and who I'm dating
and what I'm wearing a lot more than they ever have. It's a little
strange, but what I always say is you choose to put yourself in the
limelight and I knew what I was getting into. So it didn't surprise
me or anything. It's strange always and I think it will never stop
being strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her initial reservations, Portman looks forward to
shooting the next two ``Star Wars'' films. Unlike most movies,
where everyone works together intensely for three months, becomes
close and then goes their separate ways, Episodes II and III will
be something of a reunion. ``Usually, you don't really have the
chance to work with people again, and I'm really looking forward to
it because I'll get to see the whole crew and many of the cast
members again,'' she said.

APPEALS PANEL THROWS OUT NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: We plan to move a longer version of this file)  (rm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court panel on Friday threw out
air quality standards that were a cornerstone of the Clinton
administration's antipollution strategy, ruling that they had been
set arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that in setting the standards, which lowered
the allowable levels of smog and soot, the Environmental Protection
Agency had used powers that Congress had granted it
unconstitutionally.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, did not find the Clean Air
Act unconstitutional, but said the Environmental Protection Agency
might choose to ask Congress to re-write it.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 2-1 decision said that the agency must state a
coherent and explicit basis for its standards. If that view
prevails through an anticipated appeal, it could be used to
overturn several pending new pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   The court's push for a clear basis for new pollution limits
contradicts a long-held legal doctrine that courts should defer to
the discretion of the scientific expertise of administrative
agencies when they are making complex scientific decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Robin S. Conrad, said:
``We see this as a big win. The EPA's got to justify its numbers;
it can't pull them out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the EPA's standard, which was announced in
June 1997 and is supposed to take effect over the next few years,
said that the court's logic was not likely to survive review by the
whole appeals court or the Supreme Court, the two places to which
it could be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   They cited the dissent by one of the three judges, David S.
Tatel, a Clinton appointee, who wrote that the decision by his
colleagues, Stephen F. Williams and Douglas H. Ginsburg, both
Reagan appointees, ignored the fact that over the past
half-century, the Supreme Court had permitted far wider delegation
of power, like the kind at issue in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision said that ``What EPA lacks is any
determinate criterion for drawing lines. It has failed to state
intelligibly how much is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as though Congress commanded EPA to select `big guys,'
and EPA announced that it would evaluate candidates based on height
and weight, but revealed no cut-off point,'' said the decision.
``The announcement, though sensible in what it does say, is fatally
incomplete. The reasonable person responds, `How tall? How
heavy?''' And the way the EPA read the Clean Air Act, the court
majority said, left it ``free to pick any point between zero and a
hair below the concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog.''
</P>
<P>
   The states of Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia challenged the
EPA standards, along with a trucking group and a variety of
industries; supporting it were the states of Massachusetts, New
Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, New York and New Hampshire, along
with the American Lung Association and other groups. As is often
the case with challenges to prominent regulations, the case went
directly to a three-judge panel of the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The standards at issue set levels of smog and particulates in
the air and were based on new medical studies. Under the new
standards, hundreds of communities around the country were
classified as out of compliance with the Clean Air Act and states
were directed to take steps to reduce levels of these pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The decision points out what people on both sides of the case
say is a growing contradiction in air pollution policy. Congress
told the EPA to set standards that are ``requisite to protect the
public health'' with ``an adequate margin of safety,'' on the
theory that there is a threshold below which any pollutant is safe.
But some scientific studies now say that for contaminants like
ground-level ozone, known as smog, any amount may be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, of the Chamber of Commerce, said it was ``a stunningly
broad decision that goes to the heart of the way EPA promulgates
these standards.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
said in a statement, ``We are deeply disappointed by the Court of
Appeals' ruling today on clean air standards, particularly given
the court's explicit recognition that there is a strong scientific
and public health rationale for tougher air quality protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said in a statement that the standards it had put in
place ``will protect the health of 125 million Americans, including
35 million children.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, the statement asserted, ``does not question the
science and process conducted by EPA justifying the setting of new,
more protective standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposed tighter rules on automotive emissions, including new
standards for sport utility vehicles, would be among the first
affected and possibly derailed by the new interpretation, some
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans an appeal. If that is not successful, the
agency said in a statement, ``Congress must ensure that these
protections are preserved for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates of tighter standards were wary of Congress.
John M. Stanton, a lawyer for the National Environmental Trust,
said of the ruling, ``they're saying, you can always give this back
to the legislative branch, you can always give this back to the
Republicans, who we know are going to overturn these safeguards.''

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a myth that most of the people trading on the Internet
are like Spyridon Ganas. Since opening an account with E(star)Trade
on his 18th birthday in January, Ganas has taken to Web trading
with a vengeance, betting not just on volatile technology stocks,
but on the even more volatile options on technology stocks. A
long-term investment is one he holds for more than a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part of the Internet generation,'' said Ganas, a high
school senior in Shrewsbury, Mass., ``and it was more natural for
me to use the Internet for investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the madcap market these days, especially the
gyrations in shares of technology and Internet companies, it is
natural to wonder whether the dominant investor is in fact some
sort of recent Nintendo graduate who has wired his joystick right
into his brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenon is far broader than the day traders who have
made online investing almost a full-time pursuit. The number of
households with people trading on the Internet has nearly tripled,
to 6.3 million in the last 16 months, according to NFO Worldwide, a
research firm based in Greenwich, Conn., that regularly surveys
online investors and other Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   An even more impressive number of households _ 20 million _ tap
into the Internet for investment news, quotes and ideas, NFO
surveys have found.
</P>
<P>
   To understand more about who is using the Internet for investing
and how it is changing what they do with their money, Money &AMP;
Business asked NFO to assemble focus groups of active online
traders, occasional online traders and the larger group of
investors who glean information from the Web but do not trade on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the discussions occurred not in person but in a
special chat room on the Internet, where the 35 participants could
read and respond to questions posed by a reporter as well as the
answers they typed in.
</P>
<P>
   While these people represented a wide range of ages, incomes,
investment philosophies and behaviors, a common thread emerged: The
Internet has bolstered their confidence about investing and
emboldened them to take greater risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little more daring, now that I'm a better-educated
investor,'' wrote Dorothy Brown, 52, of Morgantown, W.Va. She had
mainly favored bond investments, but she shifted funds into stocks
after trying trading at Charles Schwab's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the focus groups as well as in follow-up interviews, the
participants said they felt increasingly secure about their
investment decisions as they used the Internet to monitor their
portfolios, follow news about their holdings and track the comments
of other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Those who trade on line said they felt empowered by the
minute-to-minute control that Internet investing allows _ and
liberated from the intermediaries who have guided them in the past,
like stockbrokers and mutual fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With online trading, the easy access to the market is driving
people to trade more, driving their confidence level up, raising
their risk tolerance,'' said Lee Smith, a vice president in NFO's
Internet research division. ``They are holding stocks for a shorter
period of time and holding stocks more than mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   If the trends hold, they will begin to alter the composition of
America's retirement nest egg and the landscape of financing
available to American businesses. They already have Wall Street in
a tizzy, as traditional brokerage firms and stock markets confront
upstarts and a few established players that have been quicker to
latch onto new trading technologies. Even longtime professional
traders now face a powerful new market mover.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the market's run from 3,000 to 8,000, a lot of the upward
movement had to do with the fact that people were invested in
mutual funds and were not apt to sell very quickly,'' said Charles
Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College in the Bronx.
``It's no coincidence that in the last year and a half, as Internet
trading has become more common, the market has become more
volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after a number of years _ including a couple of serious
bear markets _ will it be clear whether the newfound confidence and
self-reliance of so many online investors is justified. What is
already clear is that a big and growing group of Americans are
engaged in a high-stakes experiment to see whether they have been
prudent in betting their future on stocks they trade themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Internet's most significant impact on investing _
evident in the fast growth of online trading volume and the
increasing volatility in the markets _ is how it emboldens many
investors to trade stocks more often.
</P>
<P>
   NFO's surveys have found that among investors who have been
trading on line for less than a year, 16 percent are what it calls
heavy traders, those who say they have conducted more than 10
trades in the last six months. But of Web investors who have had
online accounts for more than a year, 30 percent are heavy traders.
</P>
<P>
   That's not only because active traders were first to jump on
line. An NFO survey found that only 13 percent of investors who
started trading in 1997 were heavy traders back then.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the focus group participants said that their experiences
matched the surveys' findings about the seductions of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trade more often, because it is easier and can be done 24
hours a day,'' wrote James Moyer, 45, of Elma, N.Y. ``If a stock is
moving _ up or down _ I am aware of it on a daily basis, and can
sooner decide it is time to buy or sell. I don't have to fumble
through a newspaper or an end-of-month report from my account.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were trading more often because they were using
the Internet _ often at their jobs _ to watch prices throughout the
day. That offers the temptation to pounce the moment they see
reasons to hop in or out of a stock, though even some who do so are
ambivalent about the merits of such trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do trade more than when a trade cost more than $8,'' said
Treg Owings, 41, of Madras, Ore., who said he checked his portfolio
often during the day. ``You might trade something because it looks
like it is dropping, and the next minute it is up $5. The cost of
trading with a broker might discourage in-and-out trading and might
save some people money in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are relying less and less on traditional sources of
guidance, like brokers and mutual funds, as they actively trade
stocks in their Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not miss the frustration of the broker trying to sell you
something,'' said Bev Waldrip, a retired customer service
representative for BellSouth who lives in Blairsville, Ga. ``They
do not understand the word `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NFO, whose research clients are mainly financial
services concerns, is finding that Web trading is becoming much
more of a threat to the big, full-service brokerage firms like
Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, which often charge commissions 10
times higher than those at the online firms but provide access to a
broker for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the bulk of online investors came from the
discount brokers, because they are more comfortable making
independent decisions,'' Smith of NFO said. ``Now, transfers from
full service are starting to grow as people realize that all the
information they see on line makes them less dependent on their
brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the infatuation with online stock trading threatens
to halt the two-decade-long shift of investment assets out of
individual securities and into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather manage my own `fund,''' said Thomas Holycross,
68, of White Lake, Mich., who opened an account 10 years ago with
what is now DLJ Direct, the discount unit of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Kashou of Mequon, Wis., says he is putting less into
mutual funds now. ``I've been doing too well in stocks to put it in
funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking aspects of the focus groups was how
important the Internet has become even to investors who have never
placed a trade on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is speeeeeeeeeeeeeed,'' wrote Leo Lomasney, 62, a
longtime investor from Rochester, N.H., who said he was too lazy to
learn how to trade on line. ``The Internet has allowed us poor
people access to the information that the brokers used to own,'' he
added, explaining that he uses several Internet sites to get
investment ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry White, 52, a semiretired engineering executive in
Ferndale, Calif., checks the value of his portfolio on line every
day, reads investing news on the Web and occasionally ventures onto
message boards to see what others are saying. He is trading more
often, he said, because the Internet gives him more ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he feels more comfortable trading through the Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter broker who has an office near his home and with
whom he can compare notes. ``I'm making faster choices,'' White
said. ``I'm still not sure they are better choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The many message boards and chat rooms where users share ideas
about investments with one another are, of course, the most
controversial sources of investing information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has highlighted these
sites as fertile breeding grounds for fraud. And a substantial
number of Web investors simply have no use for stock tips from
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use the message boards or chat rooms _ they are too
large and time-consuming for my needs,'' said Moyer of Elma, N.Y.
``I know what I'm looking for and go to more reliable sources than
what an anonymous Net user has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganis, the youngest participant in any of the focus groups,
takes an even more cynical view. ``Message boards can't be
trusted,'' he said, ``but they're useful if you want to hype a
stock you just bought.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Waldrip, the former BellSouth employee, who is
57, said she had had good luck with online investment tips. Someone
she met in a chat room on America Online suggested buying the stock
of Home Depot, an investment with which she has been happy.
</P>
<P>
   While several people in the focus groups reported bad
experiences with tips on line, many said the message boards still
had allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a lot when I was new to them; I believed people,'' said
Kashou, the Wisconsin investor. Yet even though the boards are
populated by ``a lot of hypesters,'' he added, he continues to read
them, because ``occasionally I find a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many investors said, traditional sources of investing
information just seem anachronistic in the Internet era. ``If I
read the paper, the opportunities to strike are already gone,''
said Thomas Fitzgerald, 33, of King of Prussia, Pa. ``It is always
old news after you have been on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As people become comfortable using the Internet for investing
information, the principal lure to leap into trading on line is the
very low commissions of the online brokers. But the focus group
participants said that as they experimented with online trading,
what they liked best was the sense of control it gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price is a big factor, but that alone wouldn't do it,'' said
Mary Hill, 49, of Salinas, Calif. ``On-line trading is easy, always
available, and I don't have to listen to someone try to tell me
what they think,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the focus group participants were satisfied with their
online trading experiences, though a few complained of being
stymied by the occasional computer glitches that have kept big
online brokers like Charles Schwab and E(star)Trade from processing
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had trouble getting on a couple times,'' said Wendall
Sherk, 34, of Florissant, Mo. ``But brokers don't answer their
phones at bad times, too, so that's no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Crissey, 32, of Milford, Pa., was not so sanguine. ``I
have had problems with orders not going through or the Web site
being down with Schwab,'' she said. ``This has prompted me to
switch many of my accounts'' to another online broker.
</P>
<P>
   NFO's surveys have found that about 22 percent of online
investors have switched their Internet broker at least once. But
most have moved for lower prices or better investing features, with
only 14 percent of the switchers citing complaints about service or
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, highly publicized computer glitches at most of the major
online brokers have discouraged some people from trying online
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Carlson, 48, of Aurora, Colo., said that his family had
been planning to move some mutual funds to an online brokerage
account, but that the recent problems at online trading sites
``caused us to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the best measure of the value of any investing tool
is how well a portfolio performs. Many focus group participants
said they thought that going on line had made them more successful
investors, though some had lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grisinger, 47, of Junction City, Kan., said his return
has been higher, ``but that could be because it seems the market is
booming and hasn't taken a good crash lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that online investors cite for their having done
well is their eager buying of the stock of Internet companies _ the
hottest, if the most volatile, sector of the market recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking advantage of the Internet explosion,'' said
Fitzgerald of King of Prussia. ``It's a wild ride, but returns are
big if you play it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional traders have long observed that a large part of the
activity in Internet stocks comes from small orders entered through
online brokers. And a Gallup survey for Paine Webber earlier this
year showed that 44 percent of online traders have invested in
Internet stocks, compared with 15 percent of investors over all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a lot of participants said the Internet stock ride was
just too wild for their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I braved into Internet stocks about a year ago, bought Lycos
and sold it four days later at a $500 profit,'' recalled Moyer, the
New Yorker. ``The reward was great, but the trauma was awful. I
haven't bought an Internet stock since.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among more active traders, there is a widespread feeling
that the wave of Internet investing will soon crest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think online trading has spurred part of the new high record
prices and is spurring them on,'' Moyer said. ``If the market takes
a downturn, it may be a really big one, as people won't ride out
the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, like investors through the ages, the Internet traders
are more concerned about how other investors will behave than about
their own investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like driving,'' said Owings, the Oregon investor, who is
proud of his purchase of technology stocks like Dell Computer and
Ebay. ``You have to worry about the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another focus group member, Dean Coston, 75, who was deputy
under secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the 1960s and
is now retired, pointed the finger at the generation of beginning
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that concerns me is all the younger investors who
have never experienced anything but a rising market,'' said Coston,
of Falls Church, Va. ``They don't know that what goes up will come
down. It will be terrible for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Spyridon Ganas, the high school senior who trades options
in technology stocks on line, the beauty of the Internet is that it
lets him take advantage of what he considers the folly of his
elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers think the stocks are worth it,'' he said.
``So I might as well ride the wave.''

RUSSIAN SPEAKER PREDICTS IMPEACHMENT OF YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``The other three impeachment charges'' to ``The
other impeachment charges'' in 8th graf.)  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After a day of angry and vivid speeches accusing
Russian President Boris Yeltsin of crimes ranging from treason to
genocide, the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament predicted
Friday night that the lower house would vote on Saturday to impeach
the president on one of five charges.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's latest political crisis moved toward its next
critical stage, Gennady Seleznyov, leader of the 450-seat lower
house, said that the anti-Yeltsin opposition _ strengthened by his
sudden decision this week to fire Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _
would collect more than the 300 votes required to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Friday's debate was bitter, heated and at times
incoherent, as parliamentary deputies took turns blaming Yeltsin
for all the ills that have befallen Russia in the last seven years
_ from the collapse of its military to the poverty and decline of
its population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you hear all of Russia wailing?'' asked Sergei
Govorukhin, a Russian nationalist and filmmaker. ``They wail and
hold out their hands, begging to free us from him, to save our
children. All Russia except the population of the criminal
megalopolises and some 150 deputies who are always ready to sell
themselves _ all of Russia demands impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's parliamentary
representative, accused the president's accusers of staging a
``political and not a legal process'' that was heavy on personal
judgment and weak on legally tenable facts.
</P>
<P>
   The other impeachment charges _ due to be voted on on Saturday
by paper ballots that will be made public _ accuse Yeltsin of
orchestrating the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, of storming
the Russian Parliament in 1993 and of waging an illegal war in
Chechnya from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The last charge, which will be supported by a leading liberal
party as well as by the Communists and their left-wing allies, is
expected to pass by as many as 312 votes, Seleznyov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although other deputies echoed his prediction, none said Friday
that they expected the charge to survive the tortuous impeachment
process. According to the Russian Constitution, an impeachment must
next be reviewed by the Russian Supreme Court, where in this case,
it is widely expected to be squelched.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the country's nervous political condition, a vote
to impeach could carry heavy political consequences, as a Kremlin
aide warned Friday. ``The president's decisions may be most
unexpected,'' the unnamed official was quoted as saying by the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to one popular scenario, the lower house, or Duma, may
choose next week to sidestep another showdown by voting to approve
Yeltsin's prime minister-designate, Sergei Stepashin, a Kremlin
loyalist who now heads the country's main police force.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into a politically tenuous role, Stepashin held a series
of consultations on Friday with parliamentary leaders, and
potential Cabinet members, in an attempt to restore the shaky
consensus shattered this week by the dismissal of Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   If the Parliament approves Stepashin, Yeltsin will have no
evident constitutional means to dismiss it and call early
elections. Under the Russian Constitution, the president must
disband the Parliament if it votes three times to reject his
nominee for prime minister, Another clause in the Constitution
forbids him to dismiss the Parliament for as long as an impeachment
proceeding is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Constitution's loose language, and Yeltsin's
well-known penchant for political surprises, some on Friday were
saying these legalisms could be interpreted freely by a vengeful
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was growing hope on Friday for a solution that
might at least keep the country's current political arrangements in
place until parliamentary elections next December.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   `'The Communists will be happy if an impeachment passes, because
it means they will have been able to punish him,'' said Vladimir
Lysenko, a deputy from Moscow. ``In exchange, they could vote for
Stepashin, which would give them the chance to live calmly until
December.''
</P>
<P>
   Lysenko, 43, once a loyal Yeltsin supporter and fellow
``democrat'' _ a label broadly used to describe Russia's
anti-Communists _ took the podium Friday to urge the 68-year-old
president to resign and spare the country the agony of an
open-ended political crisis that he himself created.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have completely disassociated yourself from the democratic
movement that brought you to power,'' said Lysenko, now a member of
the Parliament's moderate Regional bloc. ``You have hidden yourself
behind the Kremlin walls, and high fences. We, who sincerely
believed in democratic reforms and began them with you, are now
doomed to hear the curses of our compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lysenko said Friday that he had planned to vote
against impeachment _ until Wednesday, when Yeltsin fired the prime
minister. Now, he said, he is seriously considering joining his old
Communist foes in what he said has turned into a vote of
no-confidence in a presidency that has gone badly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a human point of view, I am sorry,'' he said. ``From a
political point of view, I am fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lysenko said a straw poll of his district, a liberal stronghold
in northern Moscow, showed his electorate to be almost evenly
divided on impeachment, whereas colleagues from more distant
regions were reporting an overwhelming majority against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many deputies are required to vote for impeachment or else
they will be out of a job in December,'' said Lysenko.

WHITE HOUSE GIVES SUPPORT TO MEASURE ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., N.M., Texas, Fla., Okla., Kan., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eager for money to pay for the war in Yugoslavia,
the White House on Friday said it expected President Clinton to
sign a nearly $15 billion emergency spending measure that doubles
what the president had requested for the Balkan conflict, for
Central American hurricane victims and for hard-pressed American
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The package was completed by House and Senate negotiators late
Thursday night. Republican leaders planned to pass it next week in
an effort to bolster their party's credentials on national security
after the House's refusal in April to give its political support to
the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The president had sought $6 billion for the air campaign and
assistance to Balkan refugees and nations neighboring Yugoslavia.
The Republicans provided $11.8 billion, including money for a
general military buildup and to allow for a pay increase for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our differences over the administration's Balkan
policy, this bill sends a strong message to our troops in the field
that the Congress supports them,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill also contained $1 billion for relief and
reconstruction efforts in Central America, long-stalled in
Congress. And the negotiators took care of the needy at home,
approving $900 million for tornado victims, mainly in Oklahoma and
Kansas, and $566 million for financially troubled farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also used the bill to sidestep a looming
confrontation over the next census that could have risked a partial
government shutdown. The package lifts a provision enacted last
year that would have blocked financing for the Commerce, Justice
and State departments after June 15 because of a dispute over how
the census will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency spending bills have become magnets in Congress for
special interest provisions because the legislation is usually
considered too important to be vetoed. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert tried to hold the line
against a flood of such amendments and riders, although a number
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Across three days of furious bargaining between the House and
Senate, several Republican provisions that the administration had
opposed as anti-environmental were dropped or softened as were some
offsetting spending cuts the administration had opposed. The
negotiators also killed a Senate provision providing $40 million
for the families of victims of last year's accident in Italy in
which a low-flying Marine jet cut the cable of a ski gondola and
sent it plunging in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The last obstacle to the agreement was overcome Thursday night
when Hastert persuaded several House negotiators to reverse
themselves and reject a guaranteed loan program for some steel
companies that was sought by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. The steel
assistance and a similar program for oil and gas companies
sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., was separated from the
bill to be considered later in the session. Such stand-alone
measures are easier to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bill still includes language that effectively overturns an
administration decision to deny a permit for a mine in Buckhorn
Mountain in Washington state. And it contains a provision sponsored
by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that would block the
administration from using any of the $246 billion the states have
won from a legal settlement with the tobacco industry. Clinton had
wanted to use part of that money for health care and anti-tobacco
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier veto threats, nonetheless, disappeared as the president
finally won long-stalled aid for Central America, $100 million in
aid to Jordan and the money for the Balkan war. ``While the
legislation is not perfect, it accomplishes a great deal and
represents significant progress,'' said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman
for the Office of Management and Budget. She said the White House
was still reviewing the agreement, but added, ``We expect the
president will be presented with a bill he can sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had not wanted to offset the new spending with cuts in
other programs. But the Republicans insisted on offsetting $2
billion of the package's cost, by reducing spending for the food
stamp program and subsidized housing. But the administration agreed
with Republicans that these reductions would not affect the poor,
coming from unspent balances that had not been used because of the
improved economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new spending was to be paid for by dipping into the
federal surplus, which in the current fiscal year is entirely due
to Social Security tax receipts. Republicans have said they are
ready to protect Social Security money from being used for other
means, but they have argued that the military is a special case.

U.S. AND RUSSIA SEEK FINNISH LEADER'S HELP WITH MILOSEVIC TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia and NATO still differ on key issues for a
peace settlement in Kosovo, but Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin agreed this week on
some ways to approach Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the
State Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two diplomats plan to go to Helsinki on Tuesday to confer
with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari to try to persuade him to
accompany Chernomyrdin when the time is right to talk to Milosevic,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari has yet to accept the task of presenting Milosevic
with NATO's plan for an international security force, the
withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and its other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And many details of that plan _ including the makeup of the
force and how much of it would involve NATO forces _ were still
being discussed among the allies themselves and with Russia,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington sees Ahtisaari as a suitable negotiator on Kosovo
because Finland is not a NATO member _ a quality that would appeal
to Milosevic _ and also has ties to Russia. Ahtisaari has been
outspoken against the reported atrocities by the Serbian forces in
Kosovo against the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable differences still exist between the allies and
Russia on how many Russian troops would be deployed in the force
and where in Kosovo they would be deployed. As well, Russia
remained insistent that some Serbian forces be allowed to stay in
Kosovo after the bombing stopped, a condition that Belgrade has
demanded as its sovereign right to protect its territory, including
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding all of Talbott's talks, in Moscow earlier this week and
Friday in Brussels at NATO headquarters, was the political turmoil
in Russia. A U.S. diplomat present at Talbott's briefing to the
North Atlantic Council _ the chief NATO decision-making body _ said
that the deputy secretary predicted Chernomyrdin would continue as
the Balkans envoy.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott told the Council that there was only a 50-50 chance
that Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov would stay in his post.
Ivanov has been a chief contact for Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during the Kosovo crisis. He remains as acting foreign
minister, having been dismissed along with the rest of the Cabinet
by President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the appearance of diplomatic activity, the main
object of the activity _ Milosevic _ was still waiting to be
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic this week told former U.N. official Yasushi Akashi,
who the Yugoslav leader knew from many negotiating sessions during
the Bosnia war, that he would only accept a lightly armed U.N.
mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO has demanded that as part of a settlement, Milosevic
must agree to a well armed international force with NATO at its
core, that he must withdraw his army, police and paramilitaries
from Kosovo, and accept an international civil administration that
would govern the ethnic Albanian refugees on their return.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Talbott and Chernomyrdin established working groups
to work out these issues so that a common front could be presented
to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic's views would be tested was not clear, Clinton
administration officials said. But one thing was plain, said State
Department spokesman James Rubin on Friday: Talbott would not be
going to Belgrade. This would be left to Chernomyrdin and
presumably Ahtisaari at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands on Friday, Ahtisaari met with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The Finnish leader said he would meet
with Chernomyrdin and Talbott ``to try and see if we can enlarge
the common ground that would facilitate the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the points that were under discussion in Moscow in detail,
according to Rubin, were: the composition of the force, what
constituted a ``rapid and precise'' timetable for withdrawal of
Milosevic's forces and how the withdrawal could be verified. The
shape of the civil administration over Kosovo, which would most
likely be run by the United Nations, was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that an important part of Chernomyrdin's mission when
he went to Belgrade would be to explain ``what will be necessary
for President Milosevic to agree to and to accept, so that we can
suspend the bombing but only if there's a rapid and precise
timetable for the verifiable and demonstrable steps to that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO arms mistakenly hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
last Friday, these demands have come under increased pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese and the Russian governments, both of which are
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, were
likely to work together to try to get NATO to be more flexible,
several administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its major NATO allies have said they
would seek a Security Council mandate for the international
security force.

FRANK STANTON, 78, DEVELOPER AND ENTREPRENEUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., name Domna, 2nd graf, is CQ)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Stanton, an entrepreneur and real estate investor who
developed an early videocassette, died May 9 at his home in Water
Mill, N.Y. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, said his
wife, Domna C. Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton conducted most of his business and real estate dealings
in partnership with his brother, Arthur, who died in 1987, and
Victor Elmaleh, through World Wide Holdings, the company they
established in Manhattan. It was created for trading in surplus
goods left scattered around the world in the aftermath of World War
II. With a foothold in North Africa, the company became the largest
importer of sugar into Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   It was later involved in importing Volkswagens, Porsches and
Audis into the United States. Later, the company engaged in toy
manufacturing and movie distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, World Wide Holdings joined forces with Avco
Corp., a high-technology manufacturer, to found Cartridge
Television, a company that produced a videocassette and player that
anticipated later developments in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, World Wide Holdings branched into real estate, and
was frequently in partnership with William Zeckendorf Jr. in such
projects as the $300 million Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza-Manhattan, a
46-story hotel on the west side of Broadway between 48th and 49th
Streets, which was designed to light up like a giant jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The partners were also among the backers of World Wide Plaza, a
residential and business structure at the site of the old Madison
Square Garden at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. That project helped
push midtown Manhattan development activity to the west.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, James, of
New York City, and Michael, of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter,
Alexandra, of New York City, and two grandchildren.

FIRED REPORTER ADMITS SHE LIED ABOUT AIDS, TOO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 33-year-old reporter in Kentucky who was fired on Monday
after revealing that she had lied in her newspaper columns about
having cancer to cover up the real diagnosis, AIDS, now says that
she has never been treated for AIDS, either.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the reporter, Kim Stacy, published Friday
in the newspaper that fired her, The Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer,
Ms. Stacy said that all her illnesses had been fabricated, but that
she believed she had been suffering from symptoms compatible with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stacy's first fabrication took place in 1995, when she told
her co-workers at The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky.,
that she had stomach cancer. Her picture was later featured in an
article in that newspaper about cancer survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the idea came from,'' Ms. Stacy said in
Friday's article in The Messenger-Inquirer. ``At the time I was
having trouble with my blood sugar and going to the doctor a lot,
and everybody was real nice to me, real concerned. It seemed like
they made an effort to be friends with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Stacy arrived at The Messenger-Inquirer in 1998, she
told her editors that she no longer suffered from stomach cancer;
she told them she had brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Her columns on cancer, one of which was distributed by The
Associated Press in Kentucky, were richly detailed. In one, she
described the thrill of hearing about a new kind of laser surgery
that would remove her brain tumor. In another, she described how
she had befriended an 8-year-old leukemia patient who later died.
``He had been battling a rare form of leukemia for three years and
had just finished his latest round of treatments,'' she wrote. ``He
knew every detail of his illness and, unlike me, was not afraid to
talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stacy told her editors early this week that she was not
suffering from brain cancer, but believed she had AIDS, and chose
not to reveal it because of the stigma associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The only signs of illness Ms. Stacy has right now, she says, are
an upset stomach and a rash, which she attributes to stress. Her
father, Monroe Stacy, said in Friday's Messenger-Inquirer that she
is a diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ashley, the editor of The Messenger-Inquirer, said:
``Tragic and embarrassing are two words I would use to describe
this situation. It was embarrassing to have to acknowledge that we
published false newspaper columns. But we've debriefed and gone
around a dozen times, and I don't think, looking back over it, that
we could have avoided it. This is clearly a person who is quite
troubled.''
</P>

LABOR DEPT. FINES SEARS $325,000 FOR CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Labor announced a $325,000 fine against
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Friday after investigators uncovered child
labor violations at more than 60 percent of the Sears stores they
visited.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors found 227 teen-agers working in violation of
child labor laws at Sears, the nation's second largest retailer.
The most common violation found was that 16-year-olds and
17-year-olds were operating power-driven equipment. Federal law
bars children from running such hazardous equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman said department investigators
found child-labor violations at 44 of the 71 Sears stores they
visited in 23 states. Investigators found that more than 200 Sears
employees under 18 were illegally operating power-driven paper
balers, freight elevators and forklifts _ all machines the Labor
Department has declared hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite frankly hope this case will send a signal to other
employers so that we don't have more cases like this,'' Ms. Herman
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the violations, Ms. Herman also said Sears had
agreed to put into effect a corporate-wide program to assure
compliance with child labor laws at its 850 department stores,
where nearly 11,000 of its 200,000 workers are under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Sears agreed to pay the fine, but it did not admit liability.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that retailers employ 60 percent of teen-agers under 18
who are working, Ms. Herman promised rigorous monitoring of
retailers around the nation to check whether they are obeying child
labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement it signed with the department, Sears said it
would appoint a manager to oversee child-labor compliance and said
it would audit all its stores to ferret out child-labor violations.
Sears officials also pledged to provide more information to the
parents of employees under 18 and to improve its training of
managers and teen-age workers to increase compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Drummond, a Sears spokeswoman, said, ``When Sears was made
aware of the Department of Labor's audit, we saw it as an
opportunity to create a unique program that is designed to insure a
safe work environment for teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said, ``We believe Sears' commitment to corporate-wide
compliance and its new child labor program can be a model for other
corporations to build upon.''

 &HT;    Narrowed abortion bill fight goes to Texas House floor
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A bill requiring pregnant girls to notify their
parents before getting an abortion cleared a House committee Friday
and is on its way to the House floor, where lawmakers will duel
over whether to add other relatives to the list of adults who could
be notified.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the committee substitute for Senate Bill 30
requires doctors to notify the parent or guardian of any female
patient under 18 who wants an abortion. The bill gives pregnant
teens just one option to bypass parental notification: go before a
judge and plead your case.
</P>
<P>
   That's stricter than an earlier version that would have let
pregnant minors go to a judge, mental health professional, or state
child welfare officials to bypass parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   After the House State Affairs Committee passed the substitute
bill in an 11-1 vote, committee chairman Steve Wolens (D-Dallas)
said he wasn't crazy about this version _ he wants a teen-ager's
relatives to be another option for notification _ but he wanted to
get it to the House floor, where he expects it to be altered.
</P>
<P>
   One potential change, according to committee member Debra
Danburg, a Houston Democrat who cast the lone ``no'' vote, will
come in the form of an amendment to allow other relatives to be
notified of a girl's abortion instead of her parents. Danburg said
a handful of key lawmakers involved in shaping the bill has agreed
not to engage in an amendment war on the House floor. The group
agreed only to propose the amendment adding relatives to the
notification list, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right-wingers will knock down the right-wing amendments,
the left-wingers will knock down the left-wing amendments,''
Danburg said. ``I told them if they wouldn't add any right-wing
amendments, I wouldn't propose any liberalizing amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   Danburg said the lawmakers, who include Wolens, also have an
understanding with Gov. George W. Bush's office that the governor
won't lobby against including relatives in the notification section
of the bill, and will sign the bill with or without the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Governor Bush said (Thursday), he always reserves the right
to veto a bill,'' Edwards said. ``His position is he wants parents
to be involved, and if there is some extenuating circumstance where
the parents cannot be involved, then he supports the option of
taking it before a judge. He does not support that amendment
(adding other family members).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office has been very involved working with legislators
throughout the session on this issue, which is one of the
governor's top priorities,'' Edwards added.
</P>
<P>
   Another House member involved in the negotiations over the bill,
Rep. Dianne White Delisi (R-Temple), said she was part of the group
that agreed to keep the bill ``clean'' and not offer amendments.
</P>
<P>
   But Delisi, whose own bill died in committee, said that doesn't
mean she will let relatives be added to the notification bill
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight it with everything I have,'' she said. ``That is
not the purpose of this bill, to call an aunt who lives in North
Dakota or to write a grandmother in a nursing home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will prevail,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Wolens said he hopes the final version of the bill includes a
little more compassion. He said he disagrees with the idea in the
current bill that a doctor can go forward with an abortion without
parental notification if the girl could die or suffer serious
injury without an abortion _ but a young woman's emotional anguish
over revealing a pregnancy isn't considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much this bill says that if a girl is going to commit
suicide (if she has to tell her parents), have at it,'' he said.
``It is very harsh in that respect.''

 &HT;    Agnes Scott grads to hear Vonnegut original
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sure, there'll be pomp. And you can't beat this
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   With 140 graduates receiving diplomas this morning, Agnes Scott
College in Decatur may have one of the area's smaller commencement
ceremonies. But look at the big fish they've reeled in as speaker:
born-again pop cultural touchstone Kurt Vonnegut.
</P>
<P>
   The same Vonnegut whose classic 1969 novel
``Slaughterhouse-Five'' became required read-and-be-seen-reading
material for Vietnam War protesters and other '60s archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   And the same Vonnegut who unwittingly set off a flurry of rumors
two years ago, which in turn, spawned a current hit record _ all
because of a commencement speech he didn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably made me more famous than anything else I've ever
done,'' Vonnegut joked by telephone from New York earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Thank (or blame) the Internet. Two years ago, an e-mail
careening through cyberspace reprinted Vonnegut's commencement
speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, beginning,
``If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would
be it.''
</P>
<P>
   All very amusing, except the ``speech'' was actually a column
written by the Chicago Tribune's Mary Schmich, and Vonnegut hadn't
even spoken at MIT. Still, sometime movie director Baz Luhrmann
turned it into a song, ``Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen),''
which currently plays about 20 times per week here on radio station
Star 94.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Scott senior Class President Sandy Miller said that
today's students still appreciate Vonnegut _ the class requested
him before ``Sunscreen'' ever hit.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vonnegut, he gives but one commencement speech each year,
each a ``custom job.'' His subject at Agnes Scott: ``What it must
feel like to be a woman graduate and go out into the world as it is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, meanwhile, about ``his'' hit song?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary and I are getting no royalties,'' Vonnegut sighed. ``And
it's gone platinum.

GUARANTEED-JOB EXPERIMENT YIELDS EVIDENCE OF THE ENDURING NATURE OF
POVERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Imagine what would happen if society could guarantee
every poor person a path from poverty: an assured job at a
sufficient wage with child care and health care as well. How many
would take it? How many would prosper?
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, an eccentric band of reformers here set out to
find the answer, and their discoveries offer an unsettling new look
at the prospects of low-income families at a time of a vast
national exodus from welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee experiment with guaranteed jobs, called Project
New Hope, came to its scheduled close this week. It leaves behind
the most comprehensive study of poor families of the post-welfare
age, with data on everything from parents' earnings to the number
of hours their children watch television.
</P>
<P>
   The program is widely being called a success, and it did have a
modest impact in some statistical terms. But a close look at the
findings, assembled by an independent team of economists,
psychologists and ethnographers, suggests that inner-city poverty
may be even harder to alleviate than is generally understood.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope recruited 677 low-income adults and made them a simple
offer: sign up here, work 30 hours a week and your family will no
longer be poor.
</P>
<P>
   But only 27 percent of the main target group stuck with their
jobs long enough to work their way out of poverty. Their average
annual earnings were just $6,600, statistically no better than a
control group of poor people not in the program.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the conventional view that going to work makes
low-income adults feel better about themselves, New Hope
participants showed no declines in depression and no growth in
self-esteem, when compared with a control group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even after two years in the program, the average
participant still registered levels of depression above the
threshold that most psychologists consider cause for clinical
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that kept people from maintaining steady employment
comprise a catalog of inner-city ills: drug and alcohol abuse;
jealous or violent boyfriends and husbands; conflicts with
employers; unreliable baby sitters and cars, and generally flagging
spirits. In addition, some participants said they preferred to work
less and spend more time with their families, even if it meant
staying poor.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope's admirers acknowledge the persistence of low earnings
and high poverty rates. But they say the program still shows ways
to help low-income families work somewhat more and suffer somewhat
less. New Hope's generous subsidies produced demonstrable, if
modest, gains in access to health insurance and formal child-care
settings. The guaranteed jobs reduced the number of people who
never worked at all. And by complementing paychecks with wage
supplements, New Hope raised total ``earnings-related income'' by
16 percent, to about $8,100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise finding, it also appeared to improve the classroom
performance and educational aspirations of its participants'
children, though only among boys. In describing that effect,
evaluators said its statistical magnitude was roughly equal to
adding 100 points to a score on the Scholastic Assessment Test. By
the standards of social experiments, that is an unusually large
improvement, and it has already provoked interest among academics
who study poor children, though they are unsure what caused it or
how long it will last.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for inner-city adults, the main target of the nation's
strict new welfare laws, the news remains sobering. Even with a
guaranteed job at a subsidized wage, 73 percent of the target group
failed to shed poverty without additional support from welfare or a
second earner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had the opportunity to work full-time, and yet they
didn't do it,'' said Michael Wiseman, an economist at the Urban
Institute, a Washington research group, who served on New Hope's
advisory board. ``We've discovered something new that I think is
distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The results challenge conventional wisdoms across the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that poor people may have less success than
conservatives have predicted in replacing welfare with work. But
they also suggest the reasons many people fail to work stretch far
beyond the economic barriers _ low wages and scarce jobs _ that
many liberals have stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman said the results particularly ``call into question the
shortage of jobs as the explanation for poverty,'' since
participants failed to work-full time even when subsidized jobs
were assured.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope was not technically a welfare-to-work program since it
included people not on welfare. Indeed, if anything, it offers a
best-case look at the prospects of those now leaving the rolls. It
operated in Milwaukee's unusually strong economy. It worked with
low-income volunteers who had more work experience than the average
welfare recipient. And it offered them unusually generous benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even counting informal work, like baby-sitting or
hair-dressing, the average participant reported working just 27
hours a week, or about 10 percent more than members of a control
group. In a world where anti-poverty programs often produce no
gains at all _ or even bring negative consequences _ these modest
results are being treated, curiously, as resounding good news.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Stewart, who runs the welfare program for Republican Gov.
Tommy Thompson, said it ``validates our belief that a work-based
social contract'' will ``help reduce poverty in the years ahead.''
Olivia Golden, who oversees welfare programs for President Clinton,
said New Hope had brought ``very impressive results in helping
families stay in jobs and improve the well-being of children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New Hope grew from a series of conversations in the early 1980s
between David Riemer, a zealous advocate of public jobs, and his
friends John Gardner and Julie Kerksick, husband-and-wife union
organizers then working with the United Farm Workers. Gardner won
election to the Milwaukee school-board and became a prominent
supporter of public-school vouchers. Riemer and Kerksick became
early critics of the welfare system and advocates for public jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting everyone from the mayor to the head of the gas
company, they raised $17 million from corporate and government
sources. Conservatives liked New Hope because of its anti-welfare
ethos _ participants had to work to keep their benefits. Liberals
liked it because it guaranteed the jobs and subsidized the wages.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope created minimum-wage community service positions, such
as clerical jobs with non-profit groups, for people who could not
find private work. But for anyone working 30 hours a week, either
in private or community service jobs, New Hope added a cash
supplement to lift them above the government poverty threshold. For
a family of three, that threshold is now $12,802.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fund raising, the program began enrolling clients
in August 1994. Participants could keep their benefits for a
maximum of three years. To evaluate the results, New Hope hired
Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a private group based in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Kerksick, the program's director, said its full impact cannot be
seen merely by looking at averages. Some people were too troubled
to respond at all, she said. But for others, the menu of supports _
jobs, wage supplements, child care and health care _ made a marked
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at this and say, `Oh my God, look at all those
people in poverty,''' she said. ``Or we can look at this and say,
`Can you see any difference?' And you can see a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The research examines the program's findings on two groups.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, comprising two-thirds of the participants,
consisted of those working part-time or not at all when the program
began. This group most closely resembles those now leaving the
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A guaranteed job did help them work more. Only 6 percent
remained continuously unemployed over a two-year period, compared
with 13 percent of a control group. Likewise, while only 27 percent
of these New Hope participants worked their way out of poverty,
that is still better than the control group, where only 19 percent
did so.
</P>
<P>
   Kerksick noted these official estimates understate participants'
real-world income, since self-employment (like baby sitting) and
the earnings of others living in the same household. And, she said,
earnings are only part of the story. New Hope also reduced the
amount of stress participants reported and increased their access
to health insurance and child care. ``We were able to help people
in other ways that made their lives better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the modesty of the results illustrates the many
underlying problems. ``This shows it can take people years to
become steady workers, even when they are given a generous package
of jobs and subsidies,'' said Toby Herr, director of Project Match,
a Chicago employment program.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University,
said he was particularly struck by the high levels of depression
participants brought with them into the program. That supports the
notion that inner-city poverty is ``rooted in a underlying culture
of defeat,'' he said, rather than in the lack of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   New Hope also enrolled a second group: those already employed
full-time when they joined. For them, New Hope actually produced a
decline in total income of about 8 percent, to about $14,100.
Kerksick said this, too, may have been positive, since many entered
the program stressed by 50-hour work-weeks and second jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But others worried that the program may have slowed these
workers' advancement.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, for instance, their average hourly wage of
$7.28 was about 6 percent lower than that of a control group. ``It
conflicts with our hopes for advancement,'' Herr said.
</P>
<P>
   But Herr and many others were impressed with New Hope's apparent
effect on participants' sons. ``That's the big finding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When surveyed by psychologists, teachers ranked the New Hope
boys as significantly better behaved and academically skilled than
boys in a control group. And when surveyed themselves, the New Hope
boys were much more likely than those in a control group to say
they expected to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are unsure why this occurred. One theory is that the
boys may have benefited from better child care arrangements. With
New Hope's subsidies, the percentage of boys in formal child care
like Head Start or after-school programs grew to 60 percent, from
52 percent in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Herr credited the program's caseworkers for helping place
children in structured after-school settings, like scouts and boys
clubs. ``They had a broader vision of child care than most
programs,'' she said. ``This shows the importance of getting kids
into constructive, extra-curricular activities, even as parents
move in and out of work.'' The girls in New Hope families also
spent more time in formal child care.
</P>
<P>
   But they showed no classroom or behavioral improvements, partly
because they were already doing better than their male
counterparts. The program essentially raised the performance of
inner-city boys to the level of inner-city girls.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   What remains unknown is whether the boys, ages 6 to 12, will
continue their progress as they hit adolescence. ``It's certainly
not an unqualified, `Oh wow, we've solved all the problems,'' said
Aletha Huston, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who
helped evaluate the program. ``But these are striking findings for
the children.''

   PAHRUMP, Nev. _ The sun was hot as Hades, but that hardly
mattered to the 50 students gathered in the desert for Ignatius
Piazza's free submachine-gun training class.
</P>
<P>
   They came from as close as Pahrump, a half-hour's drive west, on
the California border, and as far as New England, lured to this
vast sand pit for one day so that Piazza could pitch them his plans
for the first resort community in the world for gun enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   And in this crowd, mostly members of Jews for the Preservation
of Firearms Ownership, the plans went over like shade and a breeze.
The 550 acres that will become the village of Front Sight are bare
except for a few tents and one makeshift shooting range. But
Piazza, a 39-year-old former chiropractor from Santa Cruz County,
Calif., has grand visions _ and a scale model to match.
</P>
<P>
   He says that by the fall, this baked land 50 minutes west of Las
Vegas will hold 12 shooting ranges, an armory, video simulators,
tunnels, defensive-driving courses, a SWAT tower and a landing
strip. If construction moves right along, by next year Front Sight
(named for the part of a gun you focus on to hit a target) will be
an incorporated village, gated and deeded for people who can recite
the Second Amendment as though it were the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the two counties that Front Sight straddles, Clark
and Nye, have given the $25 million project their blessing, and no
one is writing angry letters to the local papers or organizing to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms classes, which began in January, have drawn 2,000
students from across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about building a Waco compound for gun nuts,'' he
said, as he pointed out the proposed celebrity training building
and jet pad on the scale model. ``The people who take our classes
are honest, law-abiding citizens. What we're giving them is similar
to what you'd find in a high-end golf resort like Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Front Sight will be set up much like a golf resort. People who
choose to live here _ 25 of the 177 one-acre lots have been
reserved _ will do so by buying a platinum membership in Front
Sight for $200,000. Other memberships will include the use of one
of 350 townhouse condominiums, or classes in everything from
``practical rifle'' to ``tactical shotgun'' to ``defensive
handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's visionary,'' said Piazza, a small, muscular man with a
thick mustache who was wearing black fatigues, combat boots and a
Glock .40-caliber pistol on his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that we offer training that exceeds that of
law-enforcement officials. I have law-enforcement officers you can
talk to who will tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 48 men and two women taking his free submachine-gun training
class certainly seemed happy with it. The class was divided in
half, and while one group took its turn shooting at human
silhouettes, the other sat in folding chairs in a white tent,
marveling at the instruction and the Front Sight village to be.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they want to move here, if only to get away from an
anti-gun society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said David Nathanson, a volunteer with a crisis
response team for the Los Angeles Police Department, ``none of
these guys here will ever shoot this kind of gun. What we share is
the belief that an armed society is a safe society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Piazza opened his first Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
in Bakersfield, Calif., in 1996, though without the residences, and
on a much more modest scale. He said the dream of an upscale
institute, which he is financing through the profits of the
Bakersfield institute and minor investors, began 10 years ago when
he took his first handgun lessons after a drive-by shooting in his
middle-class neighborhood in Aptos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy, he said, is that the more skills a citizen has
with a gun, the less likely he or she will use it unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to the people taking this class,'' he said, ``and you
see that none of them are crazy gun nuts, though they might have
some strong views on the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, a national
group, advocates the abolition of gun control. And several students
in the group, like Frank Baker, a maintenance worker from Lafayette
County, Mo., were members of several gun-rights groups. ``I'm a
recruiter for the NRA,'' Baker said, handing out a business card
that read ``Frank Baker: Defender of the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shootings in Littleton, Colorado, would have happened with
something else, like gasoline, if the gunmen hadn't had guns,'' he
said, waiting for his turn to shoot. ``Until you take the meanness
out of the human spirit, there's going to be violence.''

 &HT;    Wallace, Andretti fastest in practice
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. - How's this for Excitement? Rain has forced
NASCAR's Winston Cup drivers into a one-day show for tonight's
Pontiac Excitement 400.
</P>
<P>
   They'll practice at 10:30 this morning, qualify for starting
positions at 12:30 this afternoon, practice again at 2 and run the
Pontiac 400 tonight at 7:40 at Richmond International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's qualifying round and a morning practice session were
rained out. Drivers managed to squeeze in a 90-minute practice,
which only confirmed what everyone already knows: Rusty Wallace and
John Andretti have the fastest cars right now on short tracks. Each
has won a short track race this season and Wallace has led 60
percent of the laps (602 of 1000) raced on short tracks this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, in a Ford, circled the three-quarter-mile asphalt track
in 126.292 mph (21.379 seconds) and Andretti, in a Pontiac, was
second-fastest at 125.986 mph. Ken Schrader (sixth-fastest) had the
fastest Chevrolet at 125.605.
</P>
<P>
   The big practice surprises were Jeff Gordon's 15th-fastest time
of 124.890 mph and Dale Earnhardt, at 122.844 mph, the 43rd fastest
among 46 cars. Only Derrike Cope was slower than Tucker's Buckshot
Jones (122.272 mph).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton leads the points race by 55 over Dale Jarrett. There
have been seven different winners in the first 10 races this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won the pole for last year's race but was eliminated when
Wallace brushed his car exiting turn two and Gordon's No. 24
Chevrolet ended up in the wall. Terry Labonte survived four caution
periods in the final 27 laps to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   Rain began wreaking havoc on the weekend schedule Thursday night
when daylong threatening skies opened up 68 laps into the 150-lap
NASCAR Featherlite Modified race.
</P>
<P>
   The foul weather continued until 4 p.m. Friday. By then,
second-round qualifying for the Hardees 250 Busch race had been
scrubbed as well as Friday evening's Cup qualifying round.

 &HT;    Chicago nope: Cubs' Lieber prescribes shutout for Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - A slumping team with a man on the mound possessing a
1-4 record and 6.05 ERA in his career against the Braves was
supposed to spell a little relief on this tumultous trip.
</P>
<P>
   But not these Cubs, and not Jon Lieber. They extended the
Braves' misery to five losses in the past seven games with a 9-0
victory as Lieber pitched his first career shutout in front of a
sold-out Wrigley Field crowd of 40,046.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has given me fits. It's great to win the way we
did,'' Lieber said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who had won only two of their previous seven games,
have beaten the Braves six consecutive times in regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will send Greg Maddux against Steve Trachsel today
looking for their first win at Wrigley since July 22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Braves starter won was Tom Glavine's previous
start on May 8. This time around he wasn't nearly as sharp. He
allowed seven hits and five runs _ two runs on a two-out single by
Henry Rodriguez and two on a Sammy Sosa home run _ and lost for the
first time since April 23. The control and the quality of pitches
he'd had over his past three starts wasn't there this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pitcher after you have three or four good games, in the
back of your mind you wonder when things aren't going to quite
click,'' Glavine said. ``Today was one of those days. I wasn't able
to battle through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who'd allowed only two earned runs in his previous 20
1/3 innings, needed only one inning to reach that mark on Wednesday
on the Rodriguez hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' offense has been in a hibernation of its own. In
five losses on this trip the Braves have scored a total of five
runs and been shut out twice in the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   An idea of how it's been going? Brian Jordan just missed a home
run when the ball curled foul down the left-field line in the sixth
inning. On the next pitch, he grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do too much,'' Jordan said. ``One person is
trying to pick up the whole team. We're overswinging.''

 &HT;    Top scout says Glover isn't ready
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dion Glover's decision to make himself eligible for
the NBA draft drew a rebuke Friday from Marty Blake, the league's
director of scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's making a big mistake,'' Blake said. ``My
recommendation to him is to explore his options, and then return to
Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Glover, who would be a redshirt sophomore next
season, has decided to enter the June 30 draft despite missing all
of last season after injuring his left knee the first day of
practice and undergoing reconstructive surgery. Glover averaged
18.4 points a game during his first season, 1997-98, the
third-highest scoring freshman in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, who considered turning pro a year earlier, had the third
highest-scoring season (608 points) ever recorded by a Tech
freshman _ behind Kenny Anderson and Stephon Marbury _ and tied the
freshman school scoring record with a 33-point effort against Seton
Hall in the National Invitation Tournament. Anderson, Marbury and
Dennis Scott are the only three to leave as underclassmen during
coach Bobby Cremins' tenure at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Cremins could not be reached for comment, but in a
statement released through the school, Glover said: ``When I was
first injured in October, Coach Cremins explained this option to
me, and I want to take full advantage of the rules to get an idea
of what the pros think of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover could maintain his eligibility by withdrawing his name 72
hours before the draft. Also, if he goes through the two-round
process without being picked, he has 30 days to request that his
college eligibility be restored, as long as he hasn't signed with
an agent or accepted any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do all I can to help and guide Dion through this
process,'' Cremins said in the statement. ``Dion has assured me he
will abide by all NCAA rules.

SERIOUS ISSUES BEHIND DIVISIONS AS WTO SEARCHES FOR A LEADER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Anger and betrayal have colored the World Trade
Organization's deadlocked talks to choose a new leader, but behind
the emotions are three substantive issues _ the interests of
workers, farmers and the environment _ that have polarized the
134-nation group, producing odd alliances of rich and poor, big and
small.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is picked as director-general of the organization that
sets rules for global commerce will have an important impact on
whether it tries to impose some labor and environmental protection
rules on everyone, and tries to clear away some existing domestic
protections for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes, on the surface, seem fair and reflect the global
forum's commitment to level playing fields in the competition to
sell goods and services across borders. But they represent threats
to countries heavily dependent on agriculture, farm imports or the
use of inexpensive labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These issues have factored into the reasons why member countries
are refusing to compromise over the two finalist candidates, Mike
Moore of New Zealand and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock, now entering its third week, has left the
organization leaderless since the four-year term of Renato Ruggiero
of Italy expired May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The choices of Japan and the United States, the two giant
trading powers, particularly reflect concerns over these issues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Moore, who is seen as a strong advocate
of better worker treatment and free trade in agriculture. Japan
favors Supachai because he is viewed as more sensitive to the
interests of farmers who worry that they cannot compete with
inexpensive imports.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' preference rests partly on concerns that
Supachai would not advocate environmental and labor issues. ``It
became clear that these issues would take a back seat, as far as
Supachai was concerned,'' a U.S. official said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American environmental setbacks in trade organization decisions,
most notably an overruling of U.S. safeguards for endangered sea
turtles caught in shrimpers' nets, contributed to Washington's
concern that a new trade leader be attuned to such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States also differ on which candidate would
serve each nation's interest best in agriculture. The Americans
view Moore as a forceful advocate of ending subsidies for farmers
that keep prices artificially high. The Japanese say such a
position is unfair to countries that want to protect small,
family-run farms.
</P>
<P>
   Yoichi Suzuki, Japan's envoy to the trade organization, said,
``Politically speaking, it is not very easy to accept someone from
a country which is a free trader in agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Thailand, too, is a large agricultural exporter,
especially of rice, a sensitive commodity in Asia, as well as being
a member, along with New Zealand, of a major pro-free trade group.
So why would Japan back Supachai? ``He is viewed as having a more
receptive attitude to the Japanese view that agriculture is a
pillar of rural life, of the environment, of conserving old ways,''
a Japanese negotiator said. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not every country with big agricultural interests has based its
decision on agriculture alone. France, with entrenched farm
subsidies and a powerful farmers lobby, supports Moore. ``This is a
case where the labor forces who fear low-wage competition have won
out over the agricultural interests,'' a European diplomat said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other European countries have also split between the two
candidates, leaving the 15-member European Union with no unified
choice for director-general.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington favors Moore, it has remained conspicuously
silent. This has created resentment among a number of trade
diplomats in Geneva, who are convinced that American trade
officials are maneuvering clandestinely to ensure that Moore wins.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment is also fueled by a belief among many developing
countries that they have not benefited yet from current free-trade
rules, that liberalized agricultural trade and higher labor
standards would hurt them. Many are also convinced that a
representative from a developing country, such as Thailand, should
lead the organization. Among the most vocal advocates of Supachai's
candidacy are India and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong feeling, right or wrong, that the United
States has prolonged this race to influence the outcome,'' one
envoy from a developing country said. ``That has upset a number of
delegates, and entrenched positions.''

APPEALS COURT REVIVES ARCANE DOCTRINE IN EPA CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (Sidebar with EPA-POLLUTE) 
(bl) 
By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In overturning a clean air standard Friday, a
federal appeals court panel here focused on the ``nondelegation
doctrine,'' invoking a phrase with an unfamiliar ring. Indeed, the
notion that Congress can violate the constitutional separation of
powers by delegating too much legislative-like authority to another
branch of government has essentially been a non-issue since the
early days of the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the mid-1930s, the Supreme Court struck down federal
laws as delegating too much power, in those cases not to
executive-branch agencies but to private organizations. In the
National Industry Recovery Act, Congress gave authority to private
industry groups to establish codes of competition, and in the
Bituminous Coal Conservation Act, Congress had delegated to the
coal industry the job of setting wage and hour regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But since striking down those laws, the justices have
consistently upheld broad congressional delegations of authority
and have shown no appetite for reviving the old doctrine. The issue
received its most extended recent discussion in a 1989 Supreme
Court case, Mistretta vs. United States, which upheld the federal
sentencing guidelines. The guidelines had been challenged as
delegating too much legislative authority to a new judicial branch
agency, the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling, all nine justices rejected the delegation
challenge. Writing for the court, Justice Harry Blackmun said the
court's current view of the delegation question was based on ``a
practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society,
replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress
simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under
broad general directives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the flame has never quite died among conservative
legal scholars and judges, who view administrative agencies with
even more suspicion than they regard Congress.

BOBBE BROX, 98, VOCALIST IN SISTER TRIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobbe Brox, the last surviving member of the vocal trio who
called themselves the Brox Sisters and who appeared on stage and in
films, died May 2 in Glens Falls, N.Y. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brox, whose original name was Josephine Brock, and her
sisters were American-born but were brought up in Edmonton,
Alberta. Embarking on a career in show business, they changed their
name to Brox when a producer persuaded them the new spelling looked
better on a marquee.
</P>
<P>
   She then changed her given name to Dagmar and then to Bobbe. Her
sister Eunice became Lorayne, and Kathleen decided to call herself
Patricia.
</P>
<P>
   As the Brox Sisters, they sang in the first ``Music Box Revue''
in 1921 and also appeared in the 1923 and 1924 editions of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1926 they performed in the musical comedy ``The
Cocoanuts'' with the Marx Brothers, singing a number called
``Monkey Doodle Doo.'' They also appeared in the 1927 Ziegfeld
Follies with Eddie Cantor.
</P>
<P>
   The trio also made a number of recordings during the 1920s and
appeared in several films, including ``Hollywood Review of 1929''
and ``King of Jazz'' (1930).
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brox's marriage to William Perlberg, who was her agent
before becoming a film producer, ended in divorce in the 1960s. She
married the songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen in 1969. He died in 1990.
Her sister Patricia died in 1988 and Lorayne in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, William Brock Perlberg of Rancho
Mirage, Calif.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 14 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
made background checks at gun shows mandatory. Voting 51-47, the
Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal offered by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., as an amendment to a larger juvenile crime
bill. Supporters said it is easy for criminals to buy firearms at
gun shows because of the lack of background checks. Opponents said
that most of the dealers at gun shows are licensed, and requiring
background checks on private sales would infringe on individual
rights. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: VOLUNTARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 53-45, a measure that called
for voluntary background checks on private sales at gun shows. The
amendment was offered by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, as an amendment
to a larger juvenile crime bill. Supporters said private dealers
would be encouraged to do the background check in order to be
protected from liability if a customer uses the gun in a crime.
Opponents said the measure did not do enough to prevent criminals
from acquiring guns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FCC
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass a measure that would have
asked the Federal Communications Commission to limit broadcasts of
violent programs to times when children are not likely to be in the
audience. Voting 60-39, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the
proposal offered by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., as part of a
larger juvenile crime bill. Supporters said there is too much
violence on television when children are watching. Opponents said
the measure would be too much regulation of the television and
satellite industry, and infringe on First Amendment rights. A
``yes'' vote favors settting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TEENS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 96-2, a measure that would
prohibit juveniles from owning semi-automatic assault weapons and
high-capacity ammunition clips. The measure was introduced by Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., as an amendment to a larger juvenile crime
bill. Supporters said it would correct the disparity between
handguns, which juveniles need parental permission to own, and
assault weapons, which they need no permision to own. No one spoke
in dissent. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   5) BILL NUMBER: AMMO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed a measure that would ban
importation of high-capacity anmmunition clips. Voting 59-39, the
Senate failed to table, or set aside, the measure introduced by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., as part of a larger juvenile crime
bill. Immediately after, the Senate passed the motion on a voice
vote. Supporters said it would close the loophole that bans the
domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition but allows their
importation from other countries. Opponents said it would undo a
provision in the law and do nothing to control crime. A ``yes''
vote favors setting aside the bill.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 236-190, a bill that would
protect businesses from class action lawsuits and punitive damages
in the case of Year 2000 computer failures. Supporters said there
needs to be legislated limits on such cases to protect businesses
from major financial loss. Opponents said it would bar consumers
from bringing merited lawsuits and recouping losses suffered as a
result of the Year 2000 computer bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

P. SCOTT MAKELA, 39, PIONEERING GRAPHIC DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Minn.)   (Editors: in 4th graf, replace `plus' with the typographical
symbol)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   P. Scott Makela, a graphic and multimedia designer whose
audacious experiments helped create the esthetic of new
computer-age media, died May 7 at St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in
Pontiac, Mich. He was 39 and lived in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a rare infection of the epiglottis, said his wife,
Laurie Haycock Makela.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife Makela was a chairman of the 2-D design department
at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield.
</P>
<P>
   They were also founders of a design studio called Makela
(originally Words plus Pictures for Business plus Culture),
specializing in print and advanced technology projects for
corporate and cultural clients.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Makela was working on integrating traditional
print design and typography with motion and sound for videos,
CD-ROMs and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott was a leading figure in the creation of a new '90s
electronic esthetic,'' said Rick Poynor, former editor of Eye, an
international design magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His graphic visions ``gave an intoxicating foretaste of what
total immersion in digital media might someday be like,'' Poynor
added.
</P>
<P>
   One of Makela's proudest accomplishments was the Connections
Theater at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, a ``graphic film
project''that gave audiences a way to experience how the earth and
its species were created.
</P>
<P>
   The installation is a wood and metal shell that houses a cloud
of translucent fabric against which the viewer is exposed to more
than 2,000 images, 30 pieces of live-action film, custom typography
and original music.
</P>
<P>
   Makela also designed and produced animated type sequences for
film titles, including those for David Fincher's forthcoming movie
``Flight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The title sequence depicts a journey through the brain, the
synapses, the frontal lobe and sweat glands and finally down the
barrel of a gun aimed at the actor Edward Norton. The credits,
featuring a unique typeface designed by Makela and his associates,
flash maniacally throughout the visual journey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 Makela designed a ground-breaking digital typeface for
the Emigre fonts he called ``dead history'' because it was a
mixture of historical and contemporary forms that explored new
computer software for making fonts. It represented a major shift
from age-old type-founding traditions to the techniques and
esthetic of the new computer age.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed the boundaries of page design in magazines, catalogs
and books by rejecting conventions of legibility and readability in
favor of a cacophony of layered text and visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   Makela was born in St. Paul in 1960. He received degrees from
the University of Minnesota, the Minneapolis College of Art and
Design and the Cranbrook Academy of Art. In 1996 he and wife were
appointed as leaders of the school's graphic design graduate
program, which was known as a hothouse for new ideas in print and
computer design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to teaching classes and mentoring students, he did
work for Sony Music, Warner Brothers Records, Propaganda Films,
Amnesty International and Nike. Last year he was an author with his
wife and Lewis Blackwell of ``Whereishere,'' a book and Web site
that survey contemporary digital design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Carmela;
a son, Nikolai; his father, Martin, of Bloomfield Hills; a brother,
Eric, and a sister, Anne Snyder, both of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   For most designers precision is a paramount virtue, but for
Makela, who said that as a child he was dyslexic and had a hard
time making himself understood, chaos was a tool and code. Using
type and image to construct various levels of information, he wove
ideas and feelings together for viewers and readers to decipher at
their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a background where emotion and passion are
everything,'' Makela said.

THOMAS C. COCHRAN, AUTHORITY ON AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY, DIES AT
97

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas C. Cochran, an authority on the economic history of the
United States who liked to chronicle how economics and business had
touched his fellow citizen's lives, died on May 2 at the Quadrangle
retirement center in Haverford, Pa. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, a prolific writer, retired in 1972 as Benjamin Franklin
professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a
former president of the American Historical Association and of the
Organization of American Historians.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, said in a
telephone interview: ``In the '40s, '50s and '60s, he was
definitely one of the most important economic historians of the
United States. His book `The Age of Enterprise' was a very
important history of American capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a kind of history which was institutional, about
people, about the structures of economic change and the impact of
capitalism on people's lives. Today, economic history is all
statistics and model-building.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, late in his career, on his own writings, Cochran
observed: ``The principal aim of some 50 years of writing history
has been to convince readers that business has been the most
important American social institution from the Colonial period on.
My aim has always been to write cultural, not narrowly economic,
history, to place business as a social force as important as
politics, or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan and received bachelor's and master's
degrees from New York University and a doctorate from Pennsylvania.
He taught at NYU before joining the Pennsylvania faculty.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former
Rosamond Beebe, died.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Widmer.

<P>
   Proposing what would be a formidable challenge to regulators,
Global Crossing Ltd., an acquisition-hungry communications upstart,
is in talks to merge with U S West Inc., the smallest of the Baby
Bell local phone giants, in a stock swap valued at more than $30
billion, executives close to the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations are far from over and talks could fall
apart at any time, the two companies could announce a deal as early
as next week. Executives close to the companies said the boards of
both concerns planned to meet this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, a startup with headquarters in Bermuda, aims to
build and operate a worldwide fiber optic telecommunications
network and had ambitions of rivaling MCI Worldcom. A merger with U
S West, which has been left out of the consolidation trend among
the Baby Bells, would help Global Crossing establish the American
foothold it needs to compete against the communications industry's
behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have been discussing a merger for about three
weeks, the executives said. But the talks hit a stumbling block in
recent days after the Frontier Corp., the No. 5 long-distance
company, which agreed in March to be acquired by Global Crossing
for $12 billion, learned about Global Crossing's discussions with U
S West.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Frontier and Global Crossing has not been
finalized, and Frontier's agreement with Global Crossing gives
Frontier the the right to veto any sizable acquisition by Global
Crossing, said one executive close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the combination of U S West and Global Crossing is being
billed as a merger of equals _ with the combined company to be
equally owned by shareholders of Global Crossing-Frontier on one
side and and U S West on the other _ the executive said Global
Crossing might not need Frontier's approval. Still, if Frontier
does not bless the transaction, it could lead to a legal tangle.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the financial details, a full-blown merger between
Global Crossing and U S West would face immense regulatory
obstacles. In fact, some analysts and communications industry
executives said Friday that it would be highly unlikely that
federal regulators would approve such a deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nothing is simple about this deal, least of all the new
company's proposed structure. The U S West and Global Crossing
combination would comprise two tracking stocks: one for the
traditional telephone company assets for Frontier and U S West, the
other for the higher-growth Internet and data assets.
</P>
<P>
   U S West shareholders would swap their shares for stock in
Global Crossing, with each company's original holders owning 50
percent of the combined company. Investors would have the option to
receive shares in either tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies would also have significant cultural issues to
overcome, and most analysts agree that executives from Global
Crossing would really run the show. Solomon D. Trujillo, chairman
and chief executive of U S West, would be expected to be named
co-chief executive along with Robert Annunziata of Global Crossing
in a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo would probably move to Beverly Hills, Calif., where
Global Crossing's main offices are located, from U S West's Denver
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global is a fast-paced entrepreneurial firm, the other a
traditional phone company,'' Richard Klugman, a telecommunications
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., said. ```Any time you
introduce two different cultures, there is likely to be a clash.''
</P>
<P>
   There are serious regulatory hurdles as well. The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 says the Bells may not sell
long-distance service in any state within their traditional regions
until they convince the Federal Communications Commission that they
have opened their local phone networks to potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   No Bell has yet passed that test, and U S West is seen by most
communications analysts as being farther away from winning
long-distance entry than any of its Bell brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier, meanwhile, has long-distance customers all over the
nation, including some within U S West's region, which includes
Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Ore., Seattle and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   While Frontier may have a disproportionately small number of its
customers in U S West's territory, which also includes many rural
states including Wyoming and the Dakotas, a merger between U S West
and a company that includes Frontier would appear to be a clear
violation of the communications act, many communications experts
said Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``U S West is farther behind any of the Bells in being able to
get relief from the FCC, and realistically it's at a minimum a year
out and probably a lot longer,'' said Scott Cleland, a
communications policy analyst in Washington for the Legg Mason
Precursor Group. ``There aren't any states in U S West territory
where regulators think they're close.''
</P>
<P>
   There are moves that could potentially solve the problems, such
as selling all of Frontier's long-distance customers in U S West's
territory. And regulators may look more kindly on a U S West deal
than they did on the abortive merger talks in 1997 between AT&AMP;T and
SBC Communications because U S West is the smallest Bell; a deal
with Global Crossing could allow U S West to compete against the
communications industry's behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears to be a more workable deal would be for U S
West to take a mere 10 percent interest in Global
Crossing-Frontier, the limit stated in the law. Earlier this year,
SBC Communications Inc. agreed to acquire up to 10 percent of the
Williams Companies Inc.'s communications unit, a long-distance
upstart, while the BellSouth Corp. agreed to acquire 10 percent of
Qwest Communications International Inc., another new long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In such a deal, Frontier could also sell U S West its far-flung
local phone properties, which are scattered in 13 states.
Frontier's local businesses, which have about 1 million customers,
are close to stagnant and have been a drag on the company (though
they do provide needed cash).
</P>
<P>
   The 1 million local customers could be expected to command
perhaps between $2 billion and $3 billion, while 10 percent of a
combined Global Crossing-Frontier would have a market value of
about $3.6 billion. To pay a price of $6.6 billion (or higher, if
the 10 percent stake merits a premium), U S West could assume some
of Global Crossing-Frontier's debt and, even better for Global
Crossing, put up some cash to help Global Crossing pay for its
continued network construction.
</P>
<P>
   In such a deal, Global Crossing would get an anchor tenant for
its network (U S West can currently sell long-distance calls as
part of its less-regulated operations, such as wireless service). U
S West would be assured of low-cost long-distance capacity to meet
its needs for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing's shares gained $1.375, closing at $61.375 in
Nasdaq trading after CNBC, the cable network, said it was in talks
with U S West. Shares of U S West closed at $62.25, up $2.25, while
shares of Frontier lost $2.75 to close at $56.125.

TEXAS SENATOR'S MOVE KILLS ALCOHOL MEASURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Houston senator killed a House measure Friday
that restricted drinking, including a ban on open containers of
alcohol in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Galena Park, ``tagged'' three bills on
the Senate floor, making it impossible to amend them for 24 hours.
Faced with a midnight deadline to be voted out of Senate
committees, the bills were effectively killed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the-open container issue, one of the bills included
amendments that would ban alcohol from topless bars and ban minors
from entering bars.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to kill the legislation came from abortion rights
groups, who feared that anti-abortion legislators would succeed in
amending some bills so that an unborn fetus could be defined as a
living person.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways that amendments could be tacked on that would
lay the groundwork for abortions to be deemed illegal,'' said Peggy
Romberg, executive director of Texas Family Planning Association,
who said she asked Gallegos to tag the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Romberg feared that a senator could have added an amendment to
the bill that would stiffen the penalties against someone who
drives drunk and kills a pregnant woman, allowing the driver to be
prosecuted for the death of the mother and her unborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed was a bill sponsored by Rep. Fred Hill,
R-Richardson, that also would have banned open containers but which
included fewer exemptions and potential loopholes. Hill's bill was
proposed in an effort to avoid the loss of federal transportation
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Without an open-container law in place by Oct. 1, 2000, the
state will face harsh penalties. Texas would be forced to divert
about $40 million in highway construction funds to safety and
education programs. In 2002, the amount would double, and would
continue to increase for every year the state fails to comply with
the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallegos said his primary concern is not the highway funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is not the dollars (being lost) and the issue
is not open containers,'' he said. ``The issue is this: I'm not
going to allow others to have a chance to put language in that
would be a vehicle for pro-life legislation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A year ago this week, Anthony Salim looked
out from his 19th-floor office and watched his hometown go up in
flames. Angry mobs rampaged through the streets, looting and
torching cars, motorcycles, shops and anything else in their path.
Plumes of smoke rose from Jakarta's Chinese quarter, where the
crowds turned their rage on the terrified residents.
</P>
<P>
   In his wood-paneled perch, Indonesia's leading ethnic Chinese
tycoon could almost feel the flames at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 on that Thursday morning, Salim learned that his
family's home had been burned to the ground. Rioters had dragged
out and slashed a portrait of his father and spray-painted the
words ``Suharto's dog'' on the gate. Reluctantly, Salim caught the
next flight to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your house is already burned, the next thing they would try
to do is get the people,'' Salim explained in a rare interview
here. ``You don't want to get caught in the middle of something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Salim, 49, is back in the middle of things. And while he
may not fear for his life, his fortunes are hardly more secure than
they were during those stormy days. Salim is fighting to save the
family empire that he and his father, Liem Sioe Liong, built over
six decades _ an empire, devastated by Indonesia's economic
collapse, that is lurching under $5 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, moreover, is still a dangerous place. Fresh violence
may erupt next month as the country holds its first multiparty
elections in four decades. Ethnic Chinese merchants are preparing
to board up their shops, fearful that if crowds take to the
streets, they will again be victimized.
</P>
<P>
   As the richest of the Chinese families _ one whose wealth was
founded on its close ties with Indonesia's fallen president,
Suharto _ the Salims are a lightning rod for both ethnic and
economic resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could go after him for everything,'' H.S. Dillon, a
prominent economist here, said of Salim. ``He would be a very good
symbol to crucify. He is the most vulnerable of the cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Salim Group, the family's network of businesses, has
proved remarkably resilient. Its stubborn survival shows how deeply
crony capitalism has taken root here.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many people believe, Salim can hold his empire together,
it will say a lot about the limits of reform in a country where
conglomerates still dominate the economy _ and where the cost of
unraveling the biggest ones may be more than anyone is prepared to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Salim is making a vigorous case for the
status quo. After remaining in Singapore for a month after
Suharto's ouster, he returned here and began chipping away at the
mountain of debt that looms over the Salim Group. It has been a
grueling, painful and humbling exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was forced to cede control of his flagship asset, Bank
Central Asia, to the government. He also handed over stakes in
dozens of companies, ranging from flour mills and cement factories
to palm oil plantations and office towers. And he is selling other
assets in a desperate effort to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to raise enough money to pay off the $5 billion he
owes the government for its bailout of the bank. If he has enough
left over, he wants to buy back a stake in BCA, which despite its
huge debts is still Indonesia's largest private bank, with 760
branches scattered across this vast archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to weather this period _ ``not to
be wiped out by the big wave coming in,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably _ given the tsunami that engulfed him last year _
most analysts, bankers, and government officials agree that Salim
will survive and may even prosper. With $20 billion in sales, 500
companies, and 200,000 workers, the Salim Group is so embedded in
the commercial tissue of this country that its breakup, economists
say, would cause severe disruptions in major industries like food
processing, construction and banking.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Salim Group, like America's Chrysler Corp. a
generation ago, may be too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever rules Indonesia will have to do business with the
Salims,'' said Wilson Nababan, the president director of CISI Raya
Utama, a credit-rating agency in Jakarta. ``They still have so many
valuable concessions and they own assets in virtually every part of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salims have also hedged their bets by building a sizable
offshore empire during the last two decades. About 35 percent of
the group's revenues come from holdings outside Indonesia, like the
First Pacific Co., a Hong Kong conglomerate that owns real estate
and telecommunications properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy will never be wiped out,'' said Suryo Sulisto, the
chairman of a trade association that represents pribumi, or
indigenous Indonesian business executives. ``He's got his money
salted overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many native Indonesians, Sulisto resents the favorable
treatment the Salims and other ethnic Chinese enjoyed under
Suharto. Such treatment, he said, helped them accumulate a
disproportionate share of the country's wealth. Although they make
up only 3 percent of the population, ethnic Chinese control as much
as 70 percent of Indonesia's private economy.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, according to Sulisto, the most powerful Chinese tycoons
made loans recklessly and lacked accountability, which he said
turned the devaluation of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, into an
economic calamity.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie, he added, should confiscate the Salim
Group's assets and auction them; other critics say Salim should be
put on trial for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Anthony Salim about that hostility and he responds in a
matter-of-fact tone that suggests that he came to grips with it a
long time ago. Even before the riots, Salim's family lived in
Singapore, and he commutes there every weekend. Two of his children
are in college in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without personal safety, everything else is gone,'' Salim said
quietly. ``It's unrealistic that you're not calculating every
single event or every single possibility. But if you keep worrying,
you do no work.''
</P>
<P>
   A cordial, soft-spoken man with tousled hair and a tuft of
whiskers on his chin, Salim works hard to project a nonthreatening
image. In this, he is like his father and other Chinese tycoons in
Southeast Asia. Educated at a technical college in London, he wears
batik shirts to the office and looks very much like a product of
the central Javanese town of Kudus, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Salim has pushed to expand the octopus-like reach of
the Salim Group, he says he is not interested in building a
glittering monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am neither IBM nor Shangri-La,'' he said, referring to the
luxury hotel chain. ``I have to understand my limitations and
compensate for my weaknesses. What I am good at is trying to
package products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   That subdued style worked to his advantage in his arduous
negotiations with the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, which
nationalized BCA and represented the government in its debt talks
with Salim.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this process, everyone was skeptical,'' said
Farid Haryanto, the deputy chairman of the agency. ``But Anthony
Salim focused on the problem. What dragged us together was a common
belief in the future of the private sector in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Salim has won respect for tackling his financial
problems, the real durability of the Salim Group may owe more to
Liem Sioe Liong, his father. By extending his family's reach into
almost every corner of the Indonesian economy, Liem created a
virtually indestructible machine.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a poor family in Fujian province in China, he immigrated
to Indonesia in 1937. At first, he labored in obscurity, selling
cloves, peanuts and bicycle parts in Central Java.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1950s, Liem made the contact of his life, meeting a
young army lieutenant colonel named Suharto _ and began supplying
the military base that came under Suharto's command.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, Liem adopted an Indonesian name, Sudono
Salim. While his son Anthony took the Salim name, the 83-year-old
patriarch _ who now divides his time between homes in Los Angeles,
Singapore, and Jakarta _ is still widely referred to by his Chinese
name.
</P>
<P>
   Liem's fortunes rose along with Suharto's. When Suharto forced
out President Sukarno in 1966, Liem was ready to help the new
leader develop the country's economy _ one of the cherished goals
of the Suharto ``new order.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Liem won a monopoly license to import cloves, the key
ingredient in Indonesia's distinctive sweet-smelling cigarettes. It
was the first of dozens of licenses, franchises and concessions
that would make Liem a baron in coffee, rubber, sugar, wheat,
flour, noodles, rice and cement.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto wanted Indonesia to expand into new industries,
Liem obliged by opening factories or planting fields. When Liem
needed favors _ a waiver of securities law of restrictions on
satellite transmissions _ the president happily complied.
</P>
<P>
   Liem's ties with Suharto went beyond back-scratching. Two of the
former president's daughters owned d stakes in Bank Central Asia.
And one of Suharto's cousins, Sudwikatmono, is a member of a group
of businessmen who invest in many of the Salim Group's ventures.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the Salim Group was a leviathan, accounting
for 5 percent of Indonesia's economic output. In the United States,
that would be like the combined output of Exxon, General Motors,
IBM and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Liem was scarcely exaggerating when, in the group's most recent
annual report, he wrote, ``Our companies are intimately involved in
the day-to-day lives of literally millions of Indonesians.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that Liem had earned all this by sweat and guile. Instead,
he was other tycoons were beneficiaries of subsidies and sweetheart
deals that turned Indonesia into an exemplar of emerging-markets
cronymism.
</P>
<P>
   The Salim Group's dominance of the Indonesian flour business
provides a case study of its methods. In 1969, Suharto granted Liem
a monopoly on the importation, milling and distribution of flour.
That enabled his company to build the world's largest flour mill,
Bogosari.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the arrangement, Indonesia's state logistics
agency, known as Bulog, imported wheat and sold it to Bogosari at a
subsidized price. Bogosari then milled the wheat into flour and
sold most of it back to Bulog, tacking on a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were Liem's advantages confined to milling. Bogosari kept a
portion of the flour, which its parent, the Salim-controlled
Indofood Sukses Makmur, processed into instant noodles. The
arrangement helped make Indofood a dominant food producer, with 90
percent of the noodle market in this country, which has 210 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia deregulated the flour business in March. But
Bogosari's vast size gives it a commanding edge over potential
competitors. The mill, which sprawls along Jakarta's waterfront and
processes 10,000 tons of wheat a day, is 50 percent larger than the
next largest in the world _ one also owned by the Salims, in the
Indonesian city of Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's parliament recently passed anti-monopoly legislation
that analysts say could force the Salim Group to spin off Bogosari.
Cesar dela Cruz, the chief financial officer of Indofood, said the
parent company would be willing to sell up to 60 percent of the
mill to a group of investors, a deal that analysts say could raise
$420 million.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Anthony Salim defends the roots of the family's
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never broke the rules,'' he said. ``Whether it was a
monopoly or not, those were the rules of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Salim was eager to make changes when he joined the family
business out of college in 1972. By 1992, when Liem named his
youngest son chief executive of the Salim Group, Anthony Salim set
about transforming the group from an old-fashioned trading house
into a sophisticated global conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Liem had built his business through a intricate web of
partnerships. His bank, for example, was run by Mochtar Riady, who
later started the Lippo Group and became enmeshed in the
campaign-finance scandal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Salim slowly phased out these partnerships and recruited
professional managers to run companies like First Pacific and
Indofood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eager to embrace modern ways of doing things,'' said
Robert L. Meyer, an American who was a co-founder of First Pacific
and was a director until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Salim said the Salim Group, with the rapid development of the
Indonesian economy, had moved from a government-dictated strategy
to a market-based approach. Now, he said, it has to move again, to
a standard of greater financial disclosure and adherence to
international legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lack of regulations and transparency that put the Salim
Group in jeopardy. During the 1980s and early-1990s, most
Indonesian conglomerates financed their capital needs with loans
from their own banks. Although Indonesia's Central Bank limited
such intercompany loans to 20 percent of the bank's portfolio, few
tycoons paid much attention to the rules.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Salim Group was no exception: BCA made as much as 50 percent
of its loans to other Salim companies. Many of those loans were
denominated in American dollars, which meant that when the rupiah
crashed in late 1997, BCA was suddenly shouldering $2 billion in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also became a target during last year's riots. Dozens
of its branches were looted and burned. And nearly three million
panicky depositors besieged the bank to withdraw their money.
Within a week, BCA lost 42 percent of its capital, forcing a
bailout by the government at a cost of an additional $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Salim regrets the profligate lending, but he puts
the loans in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was the wrong thing to do in the sense of prudent
lending,'' Salim said. ``But on the other hand, everybody was doing
the same thing. We just fit into the prevailing climate.''
</P>
<P>
   The debt crisis ultimately gave the government the leverage to
cut a deal with the Salims. By hinting that Salim could be
prosecuted over the lending excesses, the Bank Restructuring Agency
persuaded him to turn over stakes in 104 companies, including
publicly listed giants like Indofood, Indocement and First Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The government is holding the stakes as collateral to offset its
bailout of BCA. Salim's future depends on how much money he can
earn from selling other assets to pay down the debt. He is not
unlike a homeowner rummaging in the attic for things to sell in a
yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though his yard sale has been a stop-and-go affair.
Salim recently sold his Singapore property arm for $183 million,
but only after a previous deal had fallen through. And he announced
the sale of 60 percent of Indofood to First Pacific, in which the
group holds a minority stake, and a Japanese food company, Nissin
Food Products _ only to have Nissin pull out because of doubts
about obtaining approval from its banks.
</P>
<P>
   That cut the value of the deal in half, to $285 million. And it
made Salim vulnerable to accusations of self-dealing, since the
remaining investor, First Pacific, is controlled by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these setbacks, Salim has had some good fortune. Stock
markets in Asia have rebounded sharply in the last four months,
driving up the value of his publicly listed companies, particularly
Indofood and First Pacific. While each is still worth about 40
percent less than its value before the Asian crisis, they have
climbed back from having lost 80 percent to 95 percent of their
market value.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also speculate about further deals, including a
possible investment by the Ford Motor Co. in the Salim Group's auto
maker, Indomobil. The Indonesian government is also keen to lure
foreign banks to invest in BCA. Citigroup and ABN Amro are both
mentioned as potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in all this is Indonesian politics. Foreign
investors have generally shunned the country out of fear that the
parliamentary elections next month could prompt a new spasm of
violence. Few analysts think Salim will make great strides with his
asset sales until the elections are over.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, a setback for Habibie's party could have a profound
effect on Salim's prospects. Although the president has endorsed
his government's efforts to drive a hard bargain with Salim, he has
not confiscated Salim assets or prosecuted him for corruption.
Other politicians, particularly those with stronger ties to the
Muslim business community, might be more hostile.
</P>
<P>
   With Suharto in retirement, the Salim family's most obvious
political alliance has gone up in smoke. But that does not mean the
family has given up trying to influence events. A former government
official here said Salim has made large donations to Habibie's
governing party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   Salim responded that he did not have spare money to lavish on
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Indonesia, you shouldn't participate in politics,'' he
said, ``But you can't be immune from politics either. You watch and
observe.''
</P>
<P>
   Salim said he had even visited Suharto, who lives in a
well-guarded house on a leafy Jakarta street. But he was quick to
add that the Salims were not helping the former president,
financially or otherwise. Antipathy toward Suharto runs deeps here,
and Salim does not need to make any new enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is like a room with oxygen,'' he said. ``We'll be
here as long as there is enough oxygen to survive. If there is no
longer enough oxygen ... .''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Salim's voice trailed off and his gaze drifted to the
window. The skyline of Jakarta shimmered in the tropical haze _ as
ever, a city of promise and peril for Indonesia's ethnic Chinese.

OFFICER WHO BROKE CODE OF SILENCE IN TORTURE CASE DEFIES LABELS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW   and KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After giving damning evidence to Internal Affairs
investigators, Eric Turetzky, a rookie New York City police
officer, emerged from an interview room at the 70th Precinct
station house in Brooklyn. It was not yet dawn on Aug. 15, 1997,
six days after a handcuffed defendant, Abner Louima, allegedly was
tortured in a bathroom at the precinct.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was tense. Some officers muttered angry words at
Turetzky for cooperating with Internal Affairs. But one burly,
towering officer approached Turetzky, and, as Internal Affairs
investigators braced for a confrontation, the officer said in a
loud, clear voice: ``I wanted to let Eric know he is doing the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident revealed the stinging rejection _ and unexpected
acceptance _ that Eric Turetzky has found within the New York City
Police Department since that day, two years ago, when he became one
of the few officers to break the code of silence that often impedes
investigations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Again this week, this conflicting response was on display as
Turetzky _ since promoted to detective _ testified in a U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn against five of his former colleagues
from the 70th Precinct. During some four hours of testimony,
Turetzky was forced to publicly confront the central question about
him: Is he a selfless hero or a selfish rat?
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand, he refused to be placed in either
category. He portrayed himself as a flawed officer who wanted to do
his duty, but also agonized about turning in friends. But the
debate about Turetzky, and his motives, is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony is critical for prosecutors who are attempting to
prove that one officer, Justin Volpe, thrust a stick into Louima's
rectum. Turetzky testified that he saw Volpe, moments after the
alleged assault, swinging a broken broomstick as if it were a
sword.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, neighbors and family members spoke about Turetzky this
week with extraordinary warmth. ``If you need to find a most honest
and upstanding person, you'd be looking for Eric,'' said Dr. Ellen
D. Panzer, who has know Turetzky since he was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the five officers, however, contend that Turetzky is
concealing darker elements of his personality. They have questioned
whether he cooperated because he was scared of being implicated in
the case, or because he was jealous, or because he felt picked
upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true, detective, that what you did in this case was
operate out of your own self-interest?'' one defense lawyer,
Stephen C. Worth, asked him on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hero or rat, there is no disputing one point: that August
morning marked a turning point for Turetzky, 28. For as he left the
precinct station house, he was also leaving behind the dream he
held for his future in the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that Eric loved more than anything else was being a
beat cop, working with the other officers and being in the
community,'' said one investigator involved in the Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Turetzky found himself under police protection. He
spent months doing little more than desk work for the Internal
Affairs Bureau, where he now works as a detective investigating
possible crimes _ by fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky, who lives with his mother and grandparents in
Canarsie, Brooklyn, declined to be interviewed. ``Right now he's
not ready,'' his grandmother, Anne Rosenblum, said.
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, describe him as being at peace with his
decision to testify this week, and unruffled by attacks on his
character. ``He's not uncomfortable about it,'' Mrs. Rosenblum
said, adding that her grandson has found new friends and new goals
while working in Internal Affairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rabbi Alvin Kass, who will preside at Turetzky's upcoming
wedding, said the officer believes in the Talmud's message that a
civilized society rests on truth, justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prerequisite to justice and peace is integrity,'' said
Kass, who is a Police Department chaplain. ``I've discussed these
beliefs with him, and he always struck me as someone who takes
these values seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, though, Turetzky's commitment to Talmudic
principle has wavered on the street. In a chilling admission at
trial, he described how, during the melee outside a nightclub
before Louima's arrest, he threatened to kick a pregnant woman in
the stomach if she did not move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a foolish statement,'' he told jurors this week, adding
that he felt scared and nervous when he made the comment.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky was born in Brooklyn and raised in Canarsie by his
mother and grandparents. His parents divorced when he was an
infant, and his father did not play an active role in his
upbringing, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, Morty Panzer, an assistant principal at John
Wilson Junior High School in Brooklyn, was looking for a student to
be his office monitor, someone he could rely upon to run errands
and trust around sensitive school records.
</P>
<P>
   He thought immediately of skinny Eric Turetzky. ``One of the
nicest kids I ever met,'' said Panzer, 66, who is the father of
Ellen Panzer.
</P>
<P>
   He had a curious, agile mind. As a 12-year-old, Eric Turetzky
offered his services to the Canarsie Volunteer Ambulance Service.
Why? Because he was impressed by the way emergency technicians
treated him when he crashed his bike. Starting with minor clerical
tasks, he later was fully trained as an emergency medical
technician and for a time he considered a career in medicine. At
age 14, he volunteered at a hospital in Brooklyn. In the 10th
grade, he apprenticed with a local dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he graduated from Canarsie High School, where his
mother, Lois C. Turetzky, is a secretary. That fall, he entered the
State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he concentrated
on social science.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Stony Brook in 1992, Turetzky found work as a
campus police officer at SUNY Farmingdale. A few years later, he
joined the New York City Police Department. His first assignment
was the 70th Precinct. Records show that he has made four arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky has testified that the decision to come forward was
agonizing. It took two days after he learned of Louima's
allegations for his sense of duty to override his sense of loyalty,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   During those two days, defense lawyers pointed out, his
sergeants were being questioned, and other superiors were being
transferred, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was visiting Louima in the
hospital and Commissioner Howard Safir was calling on officers to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is happening before your sense of duty makes you come
forward, right?'' Worth asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objection, argumentative,'' a prosecutor called out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overruled,'' said the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' said Turetzky.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ On the day before the Preakness, a wide-open race
with no sure favorite and a dozen contenders, only one thing seemed
certain Friday: Charismatic, the long shot who won the Kentucky
Derby two weeks ago at odds of 31-1, was still something of a long
shot to make it two straight in the Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   As his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, said in a ringing
understatement, ``There will be doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubters? There are skeptics, critics and outright nonbelievers.
They start with the Pimlico linemaker, Clem Florio, who made
Charismatic third choice at 5-1 behind two horses he outran in the
Derby. If the filly Silverbulletday had not been scratched to run
in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, Charismatic would have been the
fourth choice.
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way to treat the winner of the Kentucky Derby?
</P>
<P>
   It happens on rare occasions. In 1971, it happened when Canonero
II won the Derby but then was listed at 6-1 for the Preakness two
weeks later. He won. He is among the 27 Derby winners who came back
to win the Preakness, including Silver Charm and Real Quiet in the
last two years. But the handicappers and linemakers say it will not
happen this year with Charismatic, who ran as a claimer only three
months ago but was not claimed by anyone willing to risk $62,500 on
his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a much better horse than people think,'' Lukas said
without great conviction. ``He's a horse who could move forward off
the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, sounding like a man searching for answers to his own
questions, Lukas said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse completely fooled me. I just didn't have any grasp
of where I was with him. I kept changing and doing different
things. I felt there was something I was missing all the time. I
would watch him train in the morning, and say, `This is a better
horse than I'm getting in the afternoon.' I felt I just wasn't
pushing the right buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was chagrined at Charismatic's poor start to his racing
career. He had put up $200,000 to buy Charismatic, a chestnut son
of Summer Squall and the mare Bali Babe, when the colt was a
weanling. The money was paid by Beverly and Bob Lewis of Los
Angeles, who earlier owned Timber Country, winner of the 1995
Preakness; Serena's Song, who led the Kentucky Derby for one mile
the same year before tiring, but came back to win the Black-Eyed
Susan, and Silver Charm, who won the Derby and Preakness in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Charismatic lost eight of his first nine starts and
twice was entered in claiming races for $62,500. Nobody claimed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least,'' Bob Lewis said with a smile, ``we would have got
back one-third of our investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charismatic turned a corner last month when he started
racing every two weeks, with startling results.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, he ran fourth in the Santa Anita Derby. On April 18,
he won the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. On May 1, he won the
Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. On May 15, whatever the smart
money says, he will shoot for the Preakness at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a two-week horse,'' Lukas quipped. ``You know, he doesn't
have the look of a chiseled athlete. He's got smoother muscles,
something like Paul Hornung and Merlin Olsen had in football. But
don't overlook him. It would be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think it would be dangerous to overlook the second
colt Lukas is running in the Preakness _ Cat Thief, who ran third
in the Derby behind Charismatic and Menifee. Both colts warmed up
for their next performance by galloping this morning and drew raves
from Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both responded well in training since the Derby,'' he
said. ``They're doing great. Charismatic always has to have a
little more work than Cat Thief. I have him gallop a little more
and usually work a little longer. He's strong, and he needs to do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like win the Preakness. One thing about Charismatic, he is a
work horse, maybe an iron horse. He has run more races than any
other horse in the Preakness, 15, winning four, running in the
money nine times and earning $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of battle, Charismatic was being offered to the
betting public as third choice behind Menifee, who just missed
winning the Derby by a neck and was quoted at 5-2 in the early
line, and Excellent Meeting, the filly who finished fifth, who was
9-2. After that, you might find Wayne Lukas and the claimer who won
the Kentucky Derby. &QL;

THE WOODS-GARCIA CONFRONTATION COULD BE UPSTAGED BY PATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Tiger Woods held a share of the lead,
19-year-old Sergio Garcia held a share of third place, and the
weekend at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic held intriguing
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   After a windy day that was far more challenging than Thursday's
opening-round birdie barrage, Woods and Steve Pate shared the lead
at 12 under par (128), one stroke ahead of Garcia and Jeff
Gallagher. Woods and Pate equaled the 36-hole tournament scoring
record, set by Woods when he won here in 1997, and matched by Lee
Rinker that same year.
</P>
<P>
   While many golfers remained in contention, a Woods-Garcia
weekend confrontation is what most fans want to see, and the two
talented young players are keeping a close eye on each other.
Garcia and Woods crossed paths just once Friday as Woods was
standing on the 10th tee and Garcia was on the adjacent 16th tee.
Woods nodded at Garcia and Garcia returned a smile. They practiced
together on Tuesday, but this weekend the stakes will be much
higher. A first-place check of $540,000 and a chance for bragging
rights are on the line in what could be a budding rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday, both players were glad to be in contention and they
were looking forward to the final 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio's playing great, and I want him to keep it going,''
said Woods, who shot a three-under-par 67 at the TPC of Las Colinas
Friday after tying the Cottonwood Valley Course record Thursday
with a 61. ``I have to keep hitting the ball well and give myself
chances. I'm putting well. I just need to give myself chances.''
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, who also shot a 67 at Las Colinas, Friday was
another example of his ability to adapt to changing conditions
despite his youth. With wind gusts of 20 miles an hour making club
selection and ball-flight control more difficult, Garcia made just
two bogeys and avoided any major blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Already a celebrity in his native Spain, Garcia will undoubtedly
be a crowd favorite this weekend, trying to win in his first
appearance as a pro on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win this week, I'd like to dedicate this victory to Gene
Sarazen's family,'' said Garcia, referring to the golf legend who
died Thursday. ``I met him in Naples like two years ago and he was
really, really nice with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's condition was really tough, a lot of wind, changing
all the time, going different directions. So I think it was a
pretty good round. Maybe I have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with early tee times had an advantage, finishing most of
their holes before the wind reached its peak. Gallagher, teeing off
in the day's first group at Las Colinas, shot himself into
contention with a 62, the day's best round, as he turned heads by
shooting seven under par through his first seven holes, including
five birdies and an eagle. Gallagher eventually cooled off, making
a bogey at No. 8, then not making another birdie until No. 17. But
on the front nine, some thought Gallagher might be on his way to a
59.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made my putt on No. 7, Dan Forsman was like,
`Fifty-nine, fifty-nine,''' said Gallagher, referring to one of his
playing partners. ``I just tried to stay focused. I mean, it takes
a lot of pressure off when you're seven under after No. 7. It was
my best round ever. I've never gotten off to a start like that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who shot a 65 at Las Colinas, continued his strong 1999
play, and at age 37 he has already enjoyed a career-best year in
winnings ($1,010,215). A serious car accident in 1996 forced Pate
off the tour for a year and threatened his career, but since
returning he has been a more patient and more appreciative player.
</P>
<P>
   ``After sitting at home for a year, I started watching my
friends go to the same place every day for work and realized that
this isn't too bad,'' Pate said. ``I got a reality check.'' Asked
what else motivated him to return, Pate joked, ``Ten months at home
_ my wife realized she didn't want me around that much.''
</P>
<P>
   All the attention focused on Woods and Garcia may help Pate,
Gallagher and the five players tied for fifth place at eight under
par _ Lee Janzen, Andrew Magee, Loren Roberts, Michael Bradley and
Steve Lowery. But Pate had to laugh when asked if he felt old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be Sergio's father,'' said Pate, who will be paired
with Woods in Saturday's final group. ``But I don't care. I turn 38
in two weeks, and I don't really feel any different than I did 15
years ago. I'm 25 pounds heavier and a little more tired at the end
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods and Garcia were probably ready to play another 18
holes, and they were definitely looking forward to the weekend.
Asked if he missed being at home with friends in Spain, Garcia
said: ``Probably, but the guys in Spain are missing this. So I
wouldn't change things.'' &QL;

VIDEO GAME MAKER TO BUY SOFTWARE DEVELOPER

<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Video &UR;  &LR; game maker THQ Inc. said Friday it
will pay about $13 million to acquire Pacific Coast Power &AMP; Light
Co., a small Northern California game developer.
</P>
<P>
   The news came one day after THQ successfully launched three new
titles at Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the video &UR;  &LR; game
industry's largest annual gathering &UR; , &LR;  which was held this week in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Pacific Coast, formerly known as Don Traeger
Productions Inc., is located in San Jose. Company founder Don
Traeger will continue to manage the firm as its president, THQ
said, and Dennis Harper will remain its vice president of product
development.
</P>
<P>
   THQ is increasingly focusing on developing in-house content.
Friday's proposed deal would give it a considerable increase in
development management strength. Traeger spent 10 years at THQ
archrival Electronic Arts, while Harper was with Atari Games for 17
years developing arcade games.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, THQ said it has signed a deal with MTV to
develop and publish MTV Sports video games. The four-year contract
gives THQ rights to the MTV property for all current and future
game platforms from Sony, Nintendo and Sega, and for the personal
computer. The first games are due out this winter.
</P>
<P>
   THQ also said it signed an agreement with the Professional Rodeo
Cowboy Association to publish and distribute pro rodeo games for
the PlayStation and PC worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   None of Friday's news was enough to lift THQ shares in the face
of a wide sell-off of stocks that sent most indexes down sharply.
THQ shares fell 6.12 percent, or $1.6875, to $25.875.

PETER MAURIN, THE CATHOLIC LEADER WHO WAS CRAZY IN HIS OWN CRAZY
WAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 50 years ago Saturday since the death of Peter Maurin, one
of the unlikeliest figures ever to ignite a religious movement. He
died poor, as he had lived, and was buried in a donated suit and
laid in a donated Brooklyn, N.Y., grave. But there were obituaries
in Time magazine, on the front page of the Vatican's L'Osservatore
Romano and in the Chicago paper of the remnant Wobblies _ the
Industrial Workers of the World, the radical labor movement of the
early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   What Maurin helped ignite was the Catholic Worker movement, that
mix of pacifism, anarchism and identification with the poor that
has had an immeasurable impact not only on American Catholicism but
also on social and religious radicalism of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1932, Maurin had suddenly appeared in the crowded
New York apartment of Dorothy Day. George Shuster, one of the lay
Catholic editors at Commonweal magazine, had sent him, he
explained. ``Also, a red-headed Irish Communist in Union Square
told me to see you,'' he added. ``He says we think alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Day was then 35, once a crusading journalist for Socialist
newspapers but for the last four years a convert to Roman
Catholicism and not sure exactly how to direct her undiminished
passion for social justice. Maurin was 57, half-scholar, half-hobo,
stocky and wearing a suit that, to Day, ``looked as though he had
slept in it.'' As she found out later, he had.
</P>
<P>
   Maurin had a vision of a better society, ``where it is easier
for people to be good.'' He had a proposal for Day: start a
newspaper. Five months later The Catholic Worker, a monthly selling
for a penny a copy (still its price in 1999), was born. Day was the
paper's founder, and became the leading spirit of the movement
until her death in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That Maurin proved the essential catalyst in Day's life has
puzzled many, but she insisted that this was so, to the point that
some people have shrugged off her account as a womanly attempt at
self-effacement. Certainly they were different. She was a radical
American-style: combative, practical, urban, ready to feel and stir
outrage. He was a Frenchman of peasant stock, rooted in the land,
once a teaching brother in a Catholic religious order, later an
emigrant and failed homesteader in Canada, then a wandering laborer
and ultimately a kind of lay philosopher-monk who carried a
portable monastery in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His vision was the Green Revolution, a program that foreshadowed
the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s: a society of farming
communes _ ``agronomic universities,'' where labor, study and
discussion would mix _ plus small factories owned and operated by
artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Manual labor, simple living, hospitality to those in need: with
these guiding principles, he believed, a new society could be
quietly built in the shell of the old. People simply had to clarify
their ideas, render the good ideas plain enough, repeat them often
enough and then just do it rather than wait for government reform
or wholesale revolution.
</P>
<P>
   He translated these principles into his Easy Essays, punchy
little lessons written in short, sometimes repetitive rhythmic
lines, sometimes bouncing phrases around like billiard balls,
setting up a thesis or a problem like a riddle and bringing it to a
close with a thump.
</P>
<P>
   Maurin inspired The Catholic Worker's devotion to round-table
discussions. Unfortunately his own idea of a discussion was most
people's idea of a monologue. He declaimed his Easy Essays, or he
just talked, with no interruptions allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From long practice on the debating fields of Union Square and
Columbus Circle, Peter had learned never to breathe between
sentences,'' John Cort recalls in the current issue of The Catholic
Worker. Cort was a recent Harvard graduate when, in 1936, he first
met Day and Maurin, an encounter that led to his lifetime of
activity in the Catholic Worker movement, the labor movement,
interracial efforts in Boston and the Peace Corps overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Day herself, although always protective of Maurin's
image, once recalled that what had first struck her about him ``was
that he was one of those people who talked you deaf, dumb and
blind, who each time he saw you began his conversation just where
he had left off at the previous meeting, and never stopped unless
you begged for rest, and that was not for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Cort offers another story about Maurin's unswerving zest for
discussion, this tale once frequently told by John Cogley, a
onetime Catholic Worker who later reported on religion for The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One night,'' Cogley would relate, ``when Peter was staying in
a cheap hotel, a young woman knocked on his door and asked, `Want
to have a good time, honey?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Come in, come in,' he cried, and when she did he inquired of
her: `Now, what would you say a good time means exactly? Let's
discuss it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cort nor Cogley exudes the reverence often accorded
Maurin in Catholic Worker circles. But Cort still remembers how
struck he was when, in 1935, he first read bits of Maurin's Easy
Essays. One of those bits defined a leader:
</P>
<P>
   A Leader is a fellow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   who refuses to be crazy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   the way everybody else is crazy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   and tries to be crazy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   in his own crazy way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At The Catholic Worker,'' Cort concludes, ``Peter helped
several generations of the young and the not-so-young to be crazy
in their own crazy way.''

HEALTHEON EXPECTED TO MERGE WITH WEBMD IN STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Healtheon Corp., the medical record-keeping Web site based in
Santa Clara, Calif., that was started by the founder of Netscape
Communications Corp., Jim Clark, is expected to announce Monday
that it is merging with WebMD, a privately held Internet provider
of medical information.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be valued at more than $3.5 billion,
with WebMD shareholders receiving Healtheon shares. The boards of
both companies are expected to meet this weekend to approve the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, chairman of Healtheon, would be the chairman of the new
company, which is expected to have headquarters in Atlanta, where
WebMD is based. The chairman of WebMD, Jeffrey Arnold, would be
chief executive of the new company, and Healtheon's chief
executive, Michael Long, would be chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   As with any negotiations, the talks could falter at the last
minute. A spokesman for WebMD declined to comment on a possible
deal. Healtheon executives did not return telephone calls seeking
comment. Shares of Healtheon spiked on Friday, up $10 on reports of
a possible deal, to close at $57 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon was started in 1995 by Clark and David Schell, a
Harvard-educated doctor who was also a partner at the venture
capital firm of Kleiner Perkins. The merger would give Healtheon
access to more consumers. It currently focuses mainly on doctors,
hospitals, insurers and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon has been an active acquirer, having bought ActaMed, an
electronic-data concern, in 1998, and Metis, a Web-site developer
of Internet-based health-care information services, also in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon called off a planned initial public offering last
July, citing the temperamental market for Internet stocks then. The
company went public earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD was set to go public itself, but last week filed a
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission canceling its
$55 million public offering. The company was founded in October
1998, but was earlier named Endeavor Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded by Arnold, an Atlanta native, who in 1994 _ when
he was 24 years old _ started Quality Diagnostic Services, which
describes itself as a cardiac-arrhythmia monitoring company, with
his wife, Meg. Arnold holds a bachelor of arts degree in
communications from the University of Georgia.

WASHINGTON, May 14 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
made background checks at gun shows mandatory. Voting 51-47, the
Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal offered by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., as an amendment to a larger juvenile crime
bill. Supporters said it is easy for criminals to buy firearms at
gun shows because of the lack of background checks. Opponents said
that most of the dealers at gun shows are licensed, and requiring
background checks on private sales would infringe on individual
rights. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: VOLUNTARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 53-45, a measure that called
for voluntary background checks on private sales at gun shows. The
amendment was offered by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, as an amendment
to a larger juvenile crime bill. Supporters said private dealers
would be encouraged to do the background check in order to be
protected from liability if a customer uses the gun in a crime.
Opponents said the measure did not do enough to prevent criminals
from acquiring guns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FCC
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass a measure that would have
asked the Federal Communications Commission to limit broadcasts of
violent programs to times when children are not likely to be in the
audience. Voting 60-39, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the
proposal offered by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., as part of a
larger juvenile crime bill. Supporters said there is too much
violence on television when children are watching. Opponents said
the measure would be too much regulation of the television and
satellite industry, and infringe on First Amendment rights. A
``yes'' vote favors settting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TEENS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 96-2, a measure that would
prohibit juveniles from owning semi-automatic assault weapons and
high-capacity ammunition clips. The measure was introduced by Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., as an amendment to a larger juvenile crime
bill. Supporters said it would correct the disparity between
handguns, which juveniles need parental permission to own, and
assault weapons, which they need no permision to own. No one spoke
in dissent. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: AMMO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed a measure that would ban
importation of high-capacity anmmunition clips. Voting 59-39, the
Senate failed to table, or set aside, the measure introduced by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., as part of a larger juvenile crime
bill. Immediately after, the Senate passed the motion on a voice
vote. Supporters said it would close the loophole that bans the
domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition but allows their
importation from other countries. Opponents said it would undo a
provision in the law and do nothing to control crime. A ``yes''
vote favors setting aside the bill.

</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 236-190, a bill that would
protect businesses from class action lawsuits and punitive damages
in the case of Year 2000 computer failures. Supporters said there
needs to be legislated limits on such cases to protect businesses
from major financial loss. Opponents said it would bar consumers
from bringing merited lawsuits and recouping losses suffered as a
result of the Year 2000 computer bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

EDITORIAL: THE STRIPED BASS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 15:
</P>
<P>
   No fish is more emblematic of New York's waterfront setting than
the striped bass. ``Its symmetry, marks, and satin sheen,'' wrote
Genio Scott 130 years ago, ``render it one of the most picturesque
and interesting fishes in the world, independent of its great game,
generous play, and luxury as a dinner fish.''
</P>
<P>
   One rarely hears more enjoyable news than the report this
spring, from up and down the Hudson River, that striped bass have
returned in greatly increased numbers and sizes. There is even
better news. In the lower river the bass have generally been
testing below the federal limit allowed for PCBs, which were
released into the river years ago by General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   It was the presence of PCBs, as well as depleted fish stocks,
that ended the commercial striper fishery in the Hudson River in
1976. So the news of increased runs and lower PCBs has naturally
led to pressure to reopen the fishery. Gov. George Pataki has, in
fact, announced that fishery officials are considering doing just
that. But to resume commercial fishing for striped bass in the
Hudson anytime soon would be a serious mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Some responsible environmentalists such as John Cronin, the
president of Riverkeeper Inc., thinks the time may come to bring
back commercial fishing as a traditional part of river life. But it
is clearly too early to contemplate such a step now, just when the
fish stocks have rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   In our view, since striped bass can also be caught in oceans and
bays, it would be a sounder long-term policy to leave their Hudson
spawning grounds off limits to all commercial fishing for the
foreseeable future. Also, if the federal Environmental Protection
Agency decides to force GE to clean up its mess by dredging parts
of the river, more PCBs might be dislodged from the riverbed,
potentially raising their levels in the fish again.
</P>
<P>
   For all the pleasure the returning bass bring _ and who can deny
it? _ they offer several vital lessons. Stripers have come back
because commercial fishing was severely restricted. They have come
back because no dams block access to their spawning grounds and
because the waters they live and breed in have grown steadily
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as they are, these lessons should be rigorously applied, as
they fit, to other threatened species _ to Atlantic and Pacific
salmon, to swordfish and perhaps cod. Bringing back the striped
bass was not simple or painless. Here they are, nevertheless. &QL;

   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 15:
</P>
<P>
   In its start-up year, the e-rate program created by Congress as
part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act has helped tens of
thousands of rural and low-income communities connect to the
Internet. Given the growing needs, Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard has properly recommended that
the program _ which subsidizes telecommunications services and
Internet hook-ups for schools and libraries _ be financed at the
maximum authorized level of $2.25 billion for the coming year. The
commission is expected to vote on the plan this month.
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate subsidy provides a 20 to 90 percent discount on
telecommunications services to schools and libraries depending on
community poverty levels. The funds pay for telephone and Internet
fees and wiring of classrooms, but may not be used to pay for
computers, software or teacher training. New York state received
$164 million in e-rate subsidies this year, with about half of that
flowing to New York City schools, which are in desperate need of
technological improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong support from schools and educators, the e-rate
program has been politically vulnerable from the start. It is
financed mostly by fees from long-distance phone companies as part
of the bargain under the 1996 act. But the industry has complained
loudly about the costs ever since. Under heavy pressure from
lawmakers, the FCC scaled down the program initially, awarding only
$1.7 billion in the first 18 months, even though demand was much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 applications requesting $2.4 billion in
subsidies have been submitted for the coming year. But Republicans
in Congress are pushing to restructure and reduce the program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns introduced legislation this week that would
cut the program to roughly $1.9 billion a year for five years, to
be financed by part of the current 3 percent federal excise tax on
phone service instead of the current e-rate fees. The rest of the
excise tax would be eliminated. After five years, the aid would be
financed through annual appropriations, and would be capped at $500
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal would destabilize a program that works, and,
worse, cut assistance even as telecommunications become
increasingly important in education.

EDITORIAL: WAGING PEACE IN COLOMBIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 15:
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Andres Pastrana won the presidency of Colombia by
pledging to pursue an end to its 35-year-old civil war. He has
courageously stuck with the peace process in the face of setbacks.
He has also made some progress in the related task of controlling
the armed forces, but military pressure has forced him to back off
some of the most important measures. Pastrana needs more resolve,
and steadier support from a Clinton administration whose policies
have at times undercut him.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's two Marxist guerrilla groups have resorted to
kidnapping, extortion and, in the case of one group, taxing local
cocaine traffickers and defending coca-growing and rudimentary
refining by peasants. Right-wing paramilitary organizations
massacre civilians and engage in major cocaine trafficking. Some
top army officers collaborate with the paramilitaries. This year
paramilitaries have increased their killings, and issued a blanket
death threat against human rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has made peace the center of his agenda. His first
efforts to talk with the larger guerrilla group's leaders were
rebuffed, raising doubts about the group's interest in peace. But
now he has met with the top guerrilla leader. Formal negotiations
will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   Peace requires arrest of the paramilitary leaders, but army
officials with paramilitary links block this. Last month, for the
first time, the government dismissed two generals for such ties _ a
good start, but other such officers remain on duty. The government
also needs to put more clout behind a bill stalled in Congress by
military opposition that would reform the military's penal code,
which now allows officers near-total impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has given important support to the
peace talks and the promotion of human rights. But it has undercut
both through its growing involvement with the military. Colombia is
now the third-largest recipient of American security aid after
Israel and Egypt, and there are around 250 American military
trainers there. The money is supposed to be used for the drug war,
even though Colombia's military attack on drugs has failed, with
coca production rising 28 percent last year. But the arms will also
be turned against the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's link with the military has turned American
officials into apologists and supporters of a brutal and
undemocratic group, and encourages army officers to continue their
defiance of Pastrana's government. It is the civilians, well
intentioned but weak, who need backing.

COMMENTARY: STILL UNABLE TO PROCLAIM `THIS IS MINE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Celia Angel was growing up in Mexico, she was
orphaned by her fifth birthday and sent to live with relatives who
treated her more like a servant than kin. Maybe that's why she
tried giving her 11 children the tenderness she never received. And
maybe that's why she relished the affection her children and
grandchildren gave her on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, most of her children visited her, but only after
she had spent a few hours selling tamales on the street. She has to
work and people have to eat, including herself. That hasn't changed
much in the nine years since Mrs. Angel, 60, came to the United
States and moved to East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are neither bad nor good,'' she said quietly, inside
her apartment on Sunday morning. ``But moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   What was different this year was who wasn't by her side. Her
daughter, Alma Gonzaga, is confined to a Bronx psychiatric ward, a
frequent stop for the young woman who has suffered from
schizophrenia and violent outbursts. Absent, too, were Alma's two
children. Alma's infant daughter, Manuela, was placed in foster
care after Alma tried to jump off a bridge in September. Her son,
Pedro Jose, was placed in foster care when he was born in February.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Angel has attended many hearings in Family Court, hoping to
have her grandchildren given to her, or at least to another of her
daughters. But the authorities said they were worried about Mrs.
Angel's ability to protect the children from Alma.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the judge want for these children?'' Mrs. Angel
asked. ``They do not have a home they can say is theirs. I had that
experience. I was an orphan who could not say, `This is mine.'
Because of the experiences I suffered as an orphan, I do not want
that to happen to my grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest twist in the case happened late last month at a
hearing before Judge Harold Lynch of Bronx Family Court. Mrs. Angel
was there, along with Ilze Earner, a social-work administrator in
East Harlem who has been helping the family at the request of
officials from the Mexican Consulate, which often assists Mexicans
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Earner said that a lawyer for the city's Administration for
Children's Services admitted in court that the agency had
mistakenly thought it had an open case against Mrs. Angel, stemming
from an incident in which she left Alma alone with her infant
daughter while Mrs. Angel attended to a medical emergency in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like a bad credit report and she didn't get her
Amex card,'' Ms. Earner said this week. ``Kids are languishing in
foster care. Do we think this is a good thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, the spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, said that a misunderstanding occurred, but
officials with her agency were still worried that Mrs. Angel had
endangered the child by leaving her with Alma. She said that other
family members, including relatives of the children's father, who
is in jail on a parole violation, are being considered as
guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Naso, the spokeswoman for St. Christopher's, the
foster-care agency responsible for the children, said the agency
wanted to ensure that the children would be in a safe and
comfortable home. ``The court wants a choice to see the children
are cared for,'' she said. ``I don't think we have any concerns as
far as that goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Earner fears that investigating the paternal relatives
will only create more paperwork, more delays and more time in
foster care for the children. She knows that she risks the judge's
ire by talking about the case, since he reprimanded her in court
for having spoken to this columnist last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now she wants a lawyer to do the talking for her: She has
enlisted Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who plans to meet with Mrs. Angel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to be talked about,'' Ms. Earner said. ``This is a
real problem affecting the poorest, most vulnerable families in
this city. Who is allowing them to speak and say it is wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, before she went out to sell food, Mrs. Angel
refused to accept that her own childhood destiny would befall her
grandchildren. She said Alma would remain institutionalized. In
effect, Mrs. Angel would forsake her own child to save two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their father is in jail, their mother is in a hospital and
nothing has happened to improve this situation,'' she said. ``You
see, I still have two cribs waiting for the children. I am waiting
for the judge's conscience to soften. Now it is in God's hands. And
the judge's.''

EDITORIAL: STRUGGLE OVER THE TOBACCO SPOILS  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 15:
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani over how to divide New York state's share of the
multi-state settlement with the tobacco industry works to
everyone's disadvantage. The fight, now in the courts, could delay
the state's receipt of $306 million in tobacco money for 1999 and
even hold up the $800 million the state is expected to receive in
2000. There is no reason the two sides cannot find a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fight might also delay tobacco payments to other states
because the settlement requires that 80 percent of the 46 states
involved, accounting for at least 80 percent of the money, receive
final approval of the settlement from their state courts if any
money is to be disbursed this year. Since New York state will
receive almost 13 percent of the nationwide settlement, or about
$25 billion in the first 25 years, its timely approval is
important.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Dennis Vacco, then New York's attorney general,
decided that state government would get 51 percent of the proceeds,
New York City 26 percent and all other counties 23 percent, using a
formula based on population and Medicaid expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The city makes a solid argument that the formula fails to fully
compensate it for what it must spend to care for Medicaid
recipients with smoking-related diseases. A state judge, however,
approved the formula, and the city has appealed the decision. Erie
and Westchester Counties have also appealed, but their claims are
considered easier to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki can end the court fight and get the money flowing by
accepting a fair compromise. The Giuliani administration had agreed
to a sensible deal with Vacco that would have given New York City
about $700 million more than the $6.7 billion it now expects to
receive over the next 25 years, an amount that would bring the city
closer to covering its tobacco-related health costs. Pataki
rejected that proposal. Now the current attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, who came to the issue as a neutral party, is trying to get
the two sides to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has already shown poor instincts on how to use the
tobacco money. He has proposed spending the bulk of it in the first
five years on state debt reduction, leaving little for new health
initiatives and anti-smoking programs that could help reduce future
spending on tobacco-related disease. At the very least, he should
strike a compromise that would get the funds flowing.

TERENCE H. BENBOW, QUINNIPIAC LAW DEAN, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mich., Nev., Belgium, France)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terence H. Benbow, a lawyer and longtime community leader on
Staten Island and was also the dean of the Quinnipiac College Law
School, died in his sleep on May 4 at his home in Fairfield, Conn.
He was 69 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Benbow was born on June 4, 1929, in Wyandotte, Mich. He earned a
bachelor's degree with honors from the University of Michigan in
1951 and was a Fulbright scholar in Brussels from 1951 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He received his law degree from Yale in 1956. That same year he
moved to Staten Island, where he became involved in numerous civic
causes, including a fight to save the 3,000-acre Staten Island
Greenbelt, one of the nation's largest urban nature preserves.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as chairman of the New York Landmarks Conservancy
and the Citizens Union, a watchdog group that has long monitored
city and state policies. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for
Congress in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Benbow worked as an associate with Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &AMP;
Roberts, an international law firm with offices in New York,
Stamford, Conn., and abroad. He later became a partner there. He
also served on numerous boards, committees and associations,
including the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   He left the firm in 1986 to become dean of the University of
Bridgeport School of Law. In 1992, when the University of
Bridgeport was taken over by the Professors World Peace Academy, an
affiliate of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, he left
and established the law school at Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   After the move, Benbow, whose specialties were international
law, business organization and antitrust law, remained dean of the
law school for a year and then became dean emeritus and a
professor.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, Christopher Benbow
of Staten Island and Jonathan Benbow of Paris; a daughter, Shawn
Elizabeth Benbow of Bridgeport, and a brother, Alan Benbow of Las
Vegas, Nev.

APPEALS PANEL THROWS OUT NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs for previous version. Adds details throughout)  (rm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court panel Friday threw out air
quality standards that have been a cornerstone of the Clinton
administration's antipollution strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency had
arbitrarily set standards for permissible levels of fine soot.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that in setting standards for smog, the EPA
had exceeded its powers. It ruled that it would have been
unconstitutional for Congress to have granted it such broad
authority under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the agency
had failed to adequately explain how it set its standards.
</P>
<P>
   The standards put hundreds of communities out of compliance with
the Clean Air Act. The EPA had directed states to take steps to
reduce levels of these pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's standards would limit the allowable levels in the
air of extremely fine soot, particles measuring as little as 2.5
microns across, a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair. The
agency would also require that ozone, an essential part of smog,
not exceed a concentration of eight-hundredths of a part per
million in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Previous standards, which remain in force, allow ozone
concentrations to reach twelve-hundredths of a part per million,
and do not regulate soot less than 10 microns across.
</P>
<P>
   None of the standards actually require specific industries to
reduce their pollution. Instead, the federal government tries to
set national pollution rules, such as for automobile emissions,
that will allow most cities to comply with the air quality
standards, and then demands that cities and states with
particularly dirty air take further steps.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Robin Conrad, said:
``We see this as a big win. The EPA's got to justify its numbers;
it can't pull them out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the EPA standards, which were announced in
June 1997 and were to take effect over the next few years, said
they saw hope in the dissent of one the judges, David Tatel, a
Clinton appointee, who wrote that the decision by his colleagues,
Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsburg, both Reagan appointees,
ignored the fact that over the past half-century, the Supreme Court
had permitted far wider delegations of powers to federal agencies,
like the kind at issue in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved challenges by Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia
along with those by a trucking group and a variety of other
industries. Briefs in support of the standards were filed by
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, New York and New
Hampshire, and others.
</P>
<P>
   A broad regional plan by the EPA clamps down on emissions by
power plants in the Middle West that create pollution that drifts
into the Northeast, putting cities out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling said, ``What EPA lacks is any determinate criterion
for drawing lines,'' adding, ``It has failed to state intelligibly
how much is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as though Congress commanded EPA to select `big guys,'
and EPA announced that it would evaluate candidates based on height
and weight, but revealed no cut-off point,'' the decision
continues. ``The announcement, though sensible in what it does say,
is fatally incomplete. The reasonable person responds, `How tall?
How heavy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The way the EPA read the Clean Air Act, the judges said, left it
``free to pick any point between zero and a hair below the
concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog.''
</P>
<P>
   In calling into question the EPA's criteria, the judges were at
odds with a long-held legal doctrine that administrative agencies
have broad discretion in making complex scientific decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision points out what people on both sides of the case
say is a growing contradiction in air pollution policy. Congress
told the EPA to set standards that protect the public's health with
``an adequate margin of safety,'' on the theory that there is a
threshold below which any pollutant is safe. But some scientific
studies now say that for contaminants like ground-level ozone,
known as smog, any exposure may be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, spokesman for President
Clinton, said in a statement, ``We are deeply disappointed by the
Court of Appeals' ruling today on clean air standards, particularly
given the court's explicit recognition that there is a strong
scientific and public health rationale for tougher air quality
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said in a statement that the standards it had put in
place ``will protect the health of 125 million Americans, including
35 million children.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, the statement asserted, ``does not question the
science and process conducted by EPA justifying the setting of new,
more protective standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the panel called into question the constitutionality
of the primary public health provision of the Clean Air Act that on
numerous occasions have been ratified by Congress and, until now,
the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposed tighter rules on automotive emissions, including new
standards for sport utility vehicles, would be among the first
affected and possibly derailed by the new interpretation, some
experts said. One EPA official said he thought the regulations for
vehicles could still proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans an appeal. If that is not successful, the
agency said in a statement, ``Congress must insure that these
protections are preserved for the American people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some advocates of tighter standards were wary of Congress.
John Stanton, a lawyer for the National Environmental Trust, said
of the ruling, ``they're saying, you can always give this back to
the legislative branch, you can always give this back to the
Republicans, who we know are going to overturn these safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the case, Quinlan Shea, of the National
Mining Association, said that between the lines, the court was
saying that the Clean Air Act is unconstitutional.

GIULIANI AND VALLONE SEE A BUDGET TANGLE IF THE COMMUTER TAX ENDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After predicting for months that budget negotiations
would be quick and relatively painless this year, city officials
are now warning that the state Legislature's plan to repeal the
commuter tax will seriously hinder the process, forcing Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and the City Council to prepare for the potential
loss of up to $360 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone both said this
week that if the Legislature pushed through the repeal, they might
have to scale back or even abandon their own tax cut proposals _
the largest of their respective tenures _ which they have touted as
ways to share the city's $2.1 billion surplus with its residents.
In recent weeks, the Democratic speaker and the Republican mayor
had cheerfully predicted that their most daunting task would be
agreeing on which taxes to cut.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that Albany will decide for them, eliminating a tax
that suburban residents who work in the city have paid since 1966.
While commuter tax revenue is only a tiny fraction of the city's
$35 billion budget, officials in the Giuliani administration say
the proposed repeal is an egregious example of state lawmakers'
tampering with the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is New York City going to successfully manage its money if
Albany, on a whim, can repeal a tax that is an important source of
revenue?'' said Robert Harding, Giuliani's budget director. ``We
are being forced to move away from targeted tax cuts and meet
somebody else's idea of how we should govern our city.''
</P>
<P>
   The pending repeal would affect only New York state residents,
who represent 58 percent of those paying the commuter tax. But
lawmakers in neighboring states have already said they would sue to
force New York to cut the tax for all commuters. If the suit
succeeded, the city would lose $360 million annually. Otherwise,
the loss from New York commuters would be $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   Independent budget monitors said Friday that either way, the
city could absorb the revenue loss because the economy was so
strong. But they said the commuter tax was sensible and important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the biggest hole in the world,'' said Diana Fortuna,
the president of the Citizens Budget Commission. ``But it's just a
shame, because it will probably knock out some tax cuts that would
be much more beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding and other city officials said that if the Legislature
made good on its promise to repeal the commuter tax next week, the
mayor and the Council would struggle to meet their goal of adopting
a budget by June 5. They would have to readjust revenue estimates
and shuffle spending priorities, which could lead to more haggling
between the two sides, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget process has been going on for five months, we're
getting into the final stretch, and now this major hurdle has been
thrown in front of us,'' said Thomas McMahon, the director of the
Council's finance division. ``Having significantly less resources
will require both sides to reassess our priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat,
questioned why the proposed commuter tax repeal would complicate
budget negotiations, when all Giuliani and Vallone had to do was
relinquish part of their own tax cut proposals. The mayor has
proposed $405 million in tax reductions, while the speaker's tax
cut package is worth more than $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and the Council speaker both have proposals to take
away more money than this,'' Silver said in an interview. ``It may
make it harder for them to impose the tax cuts they want, but they
have clearly allocated money for tax cuts in their fiscal plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the state Senate were the first to propose
ending the commuter tax, hoping that it would help a Republican
Senate candidate from Rockland County win a special election later
this month. But they privately expected that the State Assembly,
which is dominated by New York City Democrats, would block the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Silver surprised everyone by announcing that the
Assembly would support the repeal. Two influential Assembly
Democrats, Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx party leader, and Clarence
Norman Jr., the Brooklyn party leader, declined to say Friday how
they would vote, but they expressed little opposition to ending the
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Shelly needs the votes, he usually gets the votes,'' Norman
said.

NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT UNION'S DEMAND COULD LEAD TO STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raising the possibility of a strike on New Year's
Eve, the president of New York City's largest union is calling for
a 30 percent raise over three years in coming contract talks with
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Willie James, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers
Union, said he was driving a hard bargain because the local's
33,000 bus drivers and subway workers had accepted a small wage
increase in their current contract and because the MTA has a budget
surplus of nearly $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there is a big surplus, since everyone is flush with
money, we want them to give us a substantial wage increase,'' James
said. ``We deserve it. We helped turn this place around.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though state law bars public sector workers from striking,
James warned that when the union's contract expires on Dec. 15,
there could be a walkout that would tie up the city on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use a strike _ it would be horrible,'' James
said. ``But I'm not ruling out anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit workers last walked out in 1980, in an illegal 11-day
strike. The union was fined $650,000, and strikers were fined two
days' pay for each day they were out.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the MTA, declined to comment on the
union's demands, saying the agency did not want to do its
bargaining in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission,
a corporately financed watchdog group, said the union's call for a
10 percent raise three years in a row was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, echoing earlier statements about municipal labor by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, she said, ``We can't afford to grant raises to
these workers without getting productivity increases in return.''
</P>
<P>
   James said his demand for a 30 percent raise was reasonable _
members of his union earn about $39,000 a year on average before
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's outrageous,'' he said.`` We've already
increased productivity. We are totally responsible for bringing the
system back.''
</P>
<P>
   In sending a strong warning to the MTA before negotiations begin
this fall, James, like many other labor leaders in the city, is
talking tougher than he was just a few years ago, when there was a
budget deficit and large layoffs were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts said James' demand for a 30 percent raise
could embolden other union leaders to make similar demands, while
other experts dismissed James' demand as merely an opening bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the union's current three-year contract, workers received a
single 3.75 percent wage increase, a lump sum averaging $800 and a
supplementary pay increase of $200 to $500 for the 30 percent of
workers with at least 15 years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   James said that he also wanted an improved health plan and a
decrease in employee-paid pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He said union members were working harder than before, even
though buses and subways were running less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a lot more stress for our members,'' he said,
``because when people are waiting for buses or subways a longer
time, they don't take out their anger at the MTA, they get angry at
the first body they see, and that's a bus driver, subway motorman
or conductor.''

MALCOLM X'S BULLET-RIDDLED DIARY FOR SALE, AS OWNERSHIP IS
QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials began investigating Friday how the
bloodied, bullet-riddled diary of Malcolm X, which was in his coat
pocket when he was assassinated 34 years ago, got into the hands of
a private collector who is now auctioning it off in California.
</P>
<P>
   The red, mock-leather diary was People's Exhibit 60 at the trial
of three men convicted in the February 1965 killing of the black
Muslim leader, and officials said they had believed it was still in
storage alongside the paperwork and other evidence from the case.
But an unidentified private collector, who says the diary was sold
by the Police Department about seven years ago during a purge of
old files, has arranged to sell the pocket-size book later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said it was not customary to sell the personal
effects of a murder victim. Such items are usually returned to
family members, Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman,
said. Officials said they did not know why the diary had not been
returned shortly after the trial to Malcolm's widow, Betty Shabazz.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an effort to determine what had happened, they began
going through the remaining files on the case, which are in a
warehouse in Brooklyn as part of the Municipal Archives. The
archives took possession of the case files from the Manhattan
district attorney's office in 1993, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The files contain autopsy reports, shell casings and mangled
bullets, but all that remains as evidence of the diary is an empty
envelope, marked ``1965 Red Diary with Three Bullet Holes,'' said
Kenneth Cobb, director of the archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time it was part of this case file,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing the estate of Dr. Shabazz, who died in
1997, said the family would like to block the California auction,
which is scheduled for May 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reaction is that they are shocked that something that
represents so intimate a part of their father's last moments would
find its way to an auction house on the West Coast,'' said the
lawyer, Joseph Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   The 146-page diary contains the phone numbers of many of
Malcolm's friends and associates. One page carries the notation
that Malcolm was scheduled to attend a meeting at Brown University
several days after his death during an appearance at the Audubon
Ballroom in upper Manhattan's Washington Heights, said the auction

   The diary has three bullet holes and some blood stains, said
Vanessa Hardy, a book specialist with the auction house. ``It's an
incredibly shocking item,'' said Ms. Hardy, who estimated it would
sell for as much as $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardy said a private collector had approached her company
within the past few months with a letter of provenance indicating
that the book had been bought from the Police Department between
1991 and 1993, when, according to the letter, the police were
purging their evidence files. The purchase was made by one
collector, who then sold it to the collector currently represented
by Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield. Ms. Hardy declined to identify either
collector, saying such disclosures are against company policy.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Charges of driving while intoxicated against Houston
Rockets forward Scottie Pippen were dropped Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said the charges were dismissed
after the district attorney's office determined there was
insufficient evidence that Pippen, 33, was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to dismiss was accepted Friday in the Harris County
Criminal Court-at-Law of Judge Sherman Ross. A representative of
the district attorney's office could not be reached late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped Pippen's Mercedes at 1:20 a.m. April 22 after he
allegedly passed traffic stopped for a red light in downtown
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Pippen failed a field sobriety test and was arrested.
Authorities say he was later videotaped and refused to take a
Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was charged with misdemeanor DWI. He was released after
posting a $500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons of the Jones Bar in Houston said Pippen was there after
an April 21 game, with teammates Charles Barkley and Matt Maloney.
The Rockets had lost 109-95 to the Dallas Mavericks in Compaq
Center, with Pippen scoring four points.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen appeared in court briefly April 30 and his next court was
set for May 26.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years with the six-time NBA champion Chicago Bulls,
Pippen was traded to the Rockets in January. The team signed him to
a five-year, $67 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was arrested in Chicago in January 1994 after a police
officer checking on his illegally parked car noticed a loaded
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun inside. The charge was dismissed
when a judge ruled the officer had no probable cause to look in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was charged with misdemeanor domestic battery in May
1995, after being accused of grabbing his fiancee, Yvette Deleone,
and shoving her. The case was dismissed when Deleone declined to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 37 points in a 102-88 win Thursday night over the
Los Angeles Lakers in an NBA playoff game. The Rockets trail the
Lakers 2-1 in the best-of-fives series.

ALLIES SAY ASSIGNING BLAME SHOULD WAIT FOR INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Story rewritten throughout.)  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After Belgrade charged that a NATO warplane had
fired on refugees in the southwestern Kosovo village of Korisa,
Pentagon officials said Friday that NATO warplanes were attacking
in the general area around Korisa, but that they had no evidence so
far that any of the planes had been near the village.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pentagon and NATO officials said they were reluctant to try
to say who was to blame in Korisa, where at least 60 died, until an
investigation was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's good reason to be cautious about the Serb
reports,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. ``I would
just urge you to be careful with those reports; don't rush to
judgment. NATO is in the middle of investigating this now, and as
soon as they finish, we will have something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they did not want to repeat the mistakes
made last month after NATO warplanes accidentally hit a refugee
convoy in southeastern Kosovo. At first NATO officials denied
responsibility for the bombing, on April 14. Then, after a series
of gaffes, they had to retract their statements and admit that NATO
jets had hit two convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also questioned NATO on Friday about hundreds of
deactivated bombs that have been found in fishing nets in
international waters in the northern Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NATO air fleet engaged in the campaign in Kosovo are
stationed at Italian bases. The Italian government has been
receiving complaints from fishermen operating out of the port of
Chioggia, south of Venice. Residents of Chioggia have also
complained that bombs are washing up on their beaches. Kosovo lies
across the Adriatic, to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials confirmed on Friday that ``in rare cases'' pilots
unloaded bombs into the Adriatic. This happened, they said, when a
technical malfunction of the plane made it unsafe to land with the
ordnance still on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure by overflying the area first to see there is
nobody there, and then these weapons are jettisoned there,'' said
Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said that the jettisoned bombs would not explode, because
they would have been crippled by the malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's early accusations that NATO had attacked Korisa
included suggestions that NATO had used cluster bombs. The
description later changed to ``laser-guided'' missiles.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials defended in principle their ability
to use cluster bombs, which can leave undetonated ``bomblets''
littered across a landscape that will act like land mines. The
bombs drew criticism last week after a strike on the market in Nis,
in which Belgrade said 15 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO and Pentagon officials said that the weapons are as
accurate as other gravity bombs and remain effective against
targets like troop concentrations, airfields and other large
military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John Jumper, commander general of U.S. Air Forces in
Europe, emphasized that cluster bombs have the same accuracy as
other bombs that are not precision-guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean mistakes don't happen,'' the general added.

SILVERBULLETDAY WINS AGAIN  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Silverbulletday, the filly who was scratched from
the Preakness after she drew an outside post position, gave a
commanding performance from the inside post position Friday as she
won the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for her eighth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 11th time in 12 starts that Silverbulletday had won,
solidifying her standing as the best filly in the country. She
easily outran Dreams Galore by two lengths, came within
three-fifths of a second of the Pimlico track record for a mile and
one-eighth and broke the record for the Black-Eyed Susan by
two-fifths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   She was no surprise to the public, which bet her down to 1-9
while her closest rival in the field of seven, The Happy Hopper,
went off at 8-1. Silverbulletday lived up to her reputation. She
moved smartly in front at the start, opened up on the far turn,
drifted out a bit in the homestretch and held off a late rush by
Dreams Galore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, who rode Silverbulletday, said, ``I so much wanted
to run this filly in the Preakness.'' He said that he tapped her
when the gate opened, and added: ``She went on; she kept going and
she exploded. It makes the hair stand up on the back of your
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday ran the mile and 1/8 in 1:47 4/5, breaking the
record set by Imaginary Lady in 1989 and nearly matching the track
mark set by Private Terms in another race in 1989. &QL;

WOUNDED CABBY DISARMS MAN AND TURNS HIM OVER TO POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn livery cab driver whose head was grazed by
a passenger's bullet Thursday night disarmed the gunman, chased him
down and made a citizen's arrest, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Phedro Desprez, 37, turned the attacker over to two
rookie officers walking their beat nearby. The suspect, identified
by the police as Lewis Oswin, 19, has been charged with robbery,
assault and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that he had emigrated from Haiti eight months ago and
had to support his wife back home, Desprez said he had little
choice but to fight off the man when the gun was pulled shortly
after 11:30 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had $89 in one pocket and 60 in the other, and I was in a
panic when I saw the gun,'' he said, while resting Friday at his
Flatbush home. ``I had to protect myself. My head was bleeding, but
you have strength in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the account given to the police by Desprez, he was
driving through the Brownsville section around 11:15 p.m. when two
girls flagged him down on the corner of Thomas S. Boyland Street
and Hegeman Avenue. But when Desprez pulled over, the girls called
over three men standing on the other side of the street, who also
got into his car and began giving him directions.
</P>
<P>
   After he dropped the girls off at Lenox Road and Kings Highway,
the three men told him there would be one more stop. But they kept
giving him different directions as he drove a circuitous route
through Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them if they were looking for a club and they said no,
that it was a house,'' said Desprez, scratching at a white gauze
bandage wrapped about his head. ``Then this man put his hand in his
pocket and pulled out a gun. The guy said he was going to kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Desprez was grazed by a bullet to the right side of his head as
he fought with the gunman over control of the pistol in the front
seat of the moving car. Desprez said that he was able to wrest it
free only after his cab ran into several parked cars on East 96th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The two other men jumped out of the cab when it finally rolled
to a stop near Willmohr Street. Although Oswin also tried to flee,
he stopped when Desprez leveled the gun at him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the two officers walking their post
happened upon Desprez, who dropped the pistol and explained what
had happened. The officers quickly arrested Oswin and sent Desprez
to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where he was treated and
released.

THREE JOCKEYS IN THE PREAKNESS, THREE STORIES OF ADDICTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding afternoon and night at two tracks, Chris Antley once won
nine races in a single day. In 1991, he guided Strike the Gold to
victory in the Kentucky Derby. He was a savvy enough player of the
stock market that he turned the $6 million he had earned riding
race horses into a fortune big enough to insure that he would not
have to work again.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that mattered 17 months ago. Antley, 32, was back in
an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, his body was as wrecked as his psyche, crumpled from
years of trying to shrink himself into a saddle fitted for a
117-pounder. There had been too many mornings of throwing up his
day's one meal, ingesting laxatives, wilting in a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   The stay in the clinic, scheduled for 18 days, lasted four
months. Antley said he found himself more comfortable among
recovering addicts than pretending he was not one around his fellow
jockeys. When he got out in April 1998, he still was not ready to
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he returned home to his parents in South Carolina and
hid out in a bedroom filled with newspaper clippings of his
accomplishments as a rider. Directionless and overwhelmed by
self-doubt, Antley's highlight of the day was making the morning
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought nobody would like me,'' said Antley, whose weight
rose to 147 pounds. ``I thought everybody hated me. I got big old
fat cheeks. I wore extra large T-shirts.'' Fixing dinner was a huge
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, only months removed from his most despairing
moments, Antley rode a 31-1 long shot named Charismatic to his
second Kentucky Derby crown. This time, he wept right there in the
winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dug deep into the depths of my soul and faced down some
monsters,'' Antley said later.
</P>
<P>
   Antley is far from the first jockey to inhabit the dark world of
substance abuse. In fact, in the Preakness, Antley will race
against two Hall of Fame jockeys, Jerry Bailey and Pat Day, who
have battled alcohol or drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every tale of addiction is shaped by its own
particulars, and there is no evidence to suggest race riding is
disproportionately rife with substance abuse. But for jockeys, the
struggles with addiction are often very public and frequently
driven by aspects of their unforgiving work.
</P>
<P>
   Addiction afflicts young riders who suddenly make big money in a
grueling year-round sport. It hits jockeys who are forced to be
obsessive about their weight, men often struggling with lifelong
concerns about being undersized. It grows out of a need to numb
oneself after another day of courting catastrophic injury. It can
be a costly consequence for jockeys working in an industry with a
reputation for hard living.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, state racing commissions around the
country have investigated and taken action against at least 160
jockeys for alcohol or drug abuse. There are roughly 900 licensed
jockeys in the United States, although not all of them are active
at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey and Day count themselves fortunate not to have
permanently harmed themselves or their livelihoods with their
addictions. But Patrick Valenzuela was not so lucky. Valenzuela,
whose mounts earned $95 million in purses, including the 1989
Kentucky Derby, is broke at the age of 36 and has not ridden in two
years. Drugs and alcohol are the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave the nest pretty early and begin to fly pretty
quick,'' Day said of the life of a jockey. ``We're competitive
people, maybe because we've always been small and the brunt of
jokes coming up. There's a macho element, too, where we don't talk
about problems and our addictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Bailey and Day became famous _ Bailey is third and
Day sixth in 1999 earnings _ they were awkward kids alone at small
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Day was a hard-drinking teen-age bull rider from Colorado.
Bailey was 17 when he left El Paso to become a jockey. The closest
he had been to athletic fame before was being manager for his high
school's football and basketball teams. Suddenly, both Day and
Bailey were winning races. Both had money. Both had a lot of time
at night and spent it drinking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was because I didn't have that education or family
foundation,'' Bailey said, ``but instead of facing everyday life, I
chose to numb it with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley, a high school dropout, left his native South Carolina as
a boy to find his talent. He began galloping horses at Delaware
Park, and by age 19 was the leading rider in New Jersey. He moved
on to New York, and on Oct. 31, 1987, he won four races in the
afternoon at Aqueduct and five more that night at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, he tested positive for marijuana and cocaine and
soon surrendered his racing license. Antley got his license back a
year later, and won his first Derby with Strike the Gold. But he
remained troubled.
</P>
<P>
   He weighed well beyond the necessary 114-to-117-pound range, and
so he ``flipped,'' or stuck a finger down his throat to induce
vomiting. He ate laxatives and sat in the sauna for an hour. He
even used Lasix _ a diuretic that is often used on horses to reduce
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pulling five or seven pounds off a morning,'' he said.
``It means stepping into the day is difficult. You wake up worrying
how light you've got to be. It takes a mental toll, and once you're
in that cycle it's the death zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey and Day say there are no shortcuts _ vomiting or taking
drugs _ to staying slight beyond eating and exercising with
rigorous discipline. They discovered that after they were sober.
But sometimes even that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the nation's second-leading rider, Gary Stevens,
announced he was going to ride in Europe, where the demands of
staying light are not so great. He said he had never suffered from
addiction, but knee injuries and making weight had become too
taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between giving my knees a break and not needing to reduce so
hard, I figure I can add a few more quality years to my career,''
said Stevens, who will move to England in June.
</P>
<P>
   Antley was in no shape to make such a clear-headed decision. He
rode in the afternoon, partied at night and tried to shrink himself
again in the morning. It sank him deeper into despair and
disrepair. He had ridden at the highest levels and, like Bailey and
Day, earned well into six figures. All of that only highlighted the
disappointment and panic he felt at the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be a superstar each day,'' he said. ``It's all
blue eyes and charisma. If you win three the day before, a trainer
asks where your agent is. If you don't do so well, they punch you
on the shoulder and say, `Next time.' Inside I'd feel like I'd been
run over by a truck, but I was terrified of letting anyone know.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In December 1997 Antley could not hide it anymore. He refused a
drug test at Hollywood Park. His agent, Ron Anderson, says that is
what put him in a rehabilitation program in Pasadena. Antley says
he was not using drugs at the time but was ``heading back in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He had reached the kind of bottom Bailey and Day had had years
before. At 31, Bailey's drinking had him slurring words by
midafternoon. He also had become injury-prone _ a broken jaw, three
cracked vertebrae, a broken collarbone, a foot broken in three
places, 15 broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had taken over every part of my life,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey quit drinking on Jan. 1, 1989. In 1993, he won his first
of two Kentucky Derbys aboard Sea Hero, and from 1995 to 1997 he
won three consecutive Eclipse Awards as the nation's leading rider.
</P>
<P>
   For Day, the cruel bottom came in January 1984 at a Howard
Johnson's motel near the Miami airport. His addictions included
alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. When he checked into the motel, he
turned on the television and watched a broadcast of a religious
revival. He clicked it off and went to sleep. Soon, though, he
awoke, watched the television again and fell to his knees and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned my life over to the Lord because I was tired of being
numb,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Antley's commitment to recovery came in stages. First he watched
a horse race on television and remembered how it felt to ride. Then
his father, Les, suggested he forget about racing altogether and do
something else. That hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought me to a cold reality that it was the one thing I
loved,'' he said. ``I had cheated myself my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Running 25 miles a day and swearing off carbohydrates, the
pounds melted off. Starting last February, he got mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stuck in the sun visor of his car, Antley has a tongue
tie from a cheap horse he won on when he first came back. On the
other visor is a pennant from the Derby. He insists one does not
mean any more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at that tongue tie and that pennant and I know I want
to live,'' Antley said. ``That may sound strange, but I came a long
way to feel that way again.'' &QL;

COMPROMISE ON HATE CRIMES BILL COLLAPSES IN TEXAS SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A compromise on a hate crimes bill pushed at the
11th hour by Gov. George W. Bush collapsed Friday night in the
Texas Senate as Republicans refused to sign off on it.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to resolve a rancorous partisan split primarily over
whether gays and lesbians and other specific groups should be
offered special protections under the bill has effectively killed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has had a rather ignoble history as it relates to race
relations and a rather ignoble history as it relates to sexual
orientation,'' said Sen. Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat who is
the Senate sponsor of the bill. ``All is not well in the wild, wild
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume this bill is dead for this session, but don't be too
sure. Miracles happen every day ... if it's too hot for you this
session, don't worry I'll be back,'' Ellis vowed.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 938, carried successfully in the House by Rep.
Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, had taken on huge symbolic
significance. It was named the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act in
memory of a black East Texas man who was chained to a pickup and
dragged to his death last summer. A white supremacist has been
sentenced to die for the crime and two other white men are due to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's family has been lobbying for the measure, along with a
coalition of civil rights groups _ from African-Americans, gays and
lesbians to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Last week President Clinton challenged the governor to push the
bill through the Texas Legislature. At the same time, socially
conservative groups have been opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's dramatic end came after a morning prayer vigil and
impassioned speeches by Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason this bill is not passing is because of
presidential politics and Republican primary politics,'' said Sen.
John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat. ``We have to rise above politics
today. We have to rise above presidential politics today. Bush and
his party are dead wrong on how they are handling this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   By midday, Democrats learned that compromise language that had
been offered the night before had come from the governor's office,
even as Bush has publicly refused to take a position on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the past two days, we offered some ideas in an effort
to break the stalemate on this sensitive issue,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   After the efforts cratered, Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, the chief
Republican negotiator, said, ``It is with the encouragement of the
governor of the state of Texas that we embarked on this effort.
Anybody that says leadership was lacking just doesn't know what
they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's role in trying to broker a deal late this week only
became known to most Democrats, including some of the key
negotiators, at midday Friday. Bush has repeatedly said only that
he would ``consider'' any hate crimes bill that comes to his desk
and he has doggedly refused to take a public position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no other Senate work was getting done Friday, and an
estimated 200 House bills died in Senate committees as time ran out
for legislation. There is little more than two weeks for bills to
pass both houses, with the session ending at midnight May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, chairman of the Senate
committee that wrangled with the bill for more than a week, said
Bush's compromise had suggested a way that the Senate could
eliminate the hot-button protections for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The new wording, he said, adopted language from the federal Hate
Crimes Statistics Act that the governor's father signed into law as
president in 1990 &UR; . &LR;  The law refers to reporting requirements that
the attorney general tabulate crimes related to prejudice based on
race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. But the law itself
apparently doesn't state those categories.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up for the possible death of the bill, Senate and House
Democrats, their staff and supporters of the measure first held a
prayer vigil in the Capitol Rotunda instead of reporting to the
floor for the 10 a.m. call. Once they got to the floor, Senate
Democrats launched into a series of impassioned personal privilege
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, without having acted on a single piece of legislation,
the Senate had recessed into political caucuses. The day dragged on
as teams of Democrats and Republicans, occasionally including Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, scurried in and out of meetings, writing and
rewriting the proposal. They were still at it nine hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, blamed
Republicans in general and Bush in particular for the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg you, governor, to get involved in this issue as you do
in tax reform,'' Whitmire said to hoots and applause at the Rotunda
prayer vigil. ``I ask that the lieutenant governor give us a vote
on the Senate floor. Get the leaders or our caucus and help.''

GALAXY SEEKING MISSING PIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- As Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid continues to say the
ship is holding strong -- he's not about to say it doesn't lack
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles misses post-up striker Carlos Hermosillo, it's been
unable to create the counters that made them so effective last
season and midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos needs to be more
involved in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that and their lack of a scoring punch, the Galaxy
(4-4, 6 points) is fine as it prepares to face Tampa Bay (3-4, 7
points) at the Rose Bowl this evening at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, previously winless Kansas City (1-7) handed the
Galaxy a 2-1 defeat. It was the first loss for Schmid since he took
over the club last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm not happy about losing, but when you look at the
game and look at the domination of the game, it wasn't a total
loss,'' Schmid said of the Galaxy's loss to the Wizards. ``We
created 11 corners, that means we're going forward. We had more
shots and more shots on goal than they did. So, from the standpoint
of being dangerous, I think we're getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, only five goals in eight games?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go six and seven more games and have the same results
then we have a real problem,'' said Schmid. ``But I'm confident
it's going to be better this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid has the team working on finishing more than anything
else. But with strikers Welton, Clint Mathis and Cobi Jones all
small, finesse finishers, the Galaxy lacks size up front.
</P>
<P>
   And Hermosillo doesn't return from Mexico until next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use some size up there for sure,'' said Schmid. ``Last
year the Galaxy countered against teams. This season teams are
taking away that countering space from us. They're dropping back.
And when a team takes away countering space, you need someone who
can hold the ball under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, meanwhile, has been caught defending more than
distributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Kansas City last week he got stuck back-tracking,''
said Schmid. ``We have to get him the ball in offensive
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Mutiny, Los Angeles needs to control the midfield,
particularly against Tampa Bay's Carlos Valderrama and Mauricio
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give those two time and space they can hurt you ...,''
said Schmid. ``If we can force those midfielders to defend, it will
be to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY INFO BOX
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: Tampa Bay (3-4, 7 points) vs. Galaxy (4-4), Rose
Bowl, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Television: None.
</P>
<P>
   Radio: KTNQ 1020-AM (Spanish); KRLA 1110-AM (English).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: First meeting this season; Galaxy leads
all-time, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy update: Except for a lack of a scoring punch, the Galaxy
didn't play that badly in last week's 2-1 loss to Kansas City. But
how is this for scoring comparisons? After eight games last season,
the Galaxy had 26 goals and five multiple-goal games. After eight
games this season, it has only five goals and no multiple-goal
games. Ouch. Clint Mathis, who has split time on the front line and
at midfield, returns to the lineup after serving a red-card
suspension. Former UCLA All-American striker Seth George, a
second-round college draft choice by the Galaxy last winter, is
expected in training camp next week. George had been training in
Germany, after signing a temporary contract with 1860 Munich of the
German Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay update: The Mutiny is 0-4 at the Rose Bowl, but is
going for their fourth consecutive victory after reacquiring
midfield playmaker Carlos Valderrama from Miami. Tampa is coming
off a 2-1 victory over MLS champion Chicago. Striker Musa Shannon,
the MLS Player of the Month for April, leads the club with five
goals and an assist.

CITY COUNCIL REMATCH BREWS  
 WAITING IN THE WINGS  
 A POLITICAL CLUB WITH A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With elections for the state Legislature and Congress
a year away and New York City's next major municipal races a year
after that, 1999 is likely to be a pallid year in local politics.
But a heated rematch is shaping up in one corner of the city, a
City Council district that includes the center of Staten Island and
a slice of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In a special election in February, James Oddo took 53 percent of
the vote in a three-way race and won the seat vacated by John
Fusco, who had been elected Staten Island's surrogate, a judicial
position. By law, another election must be held later this year,
and Oddo, a Republican, is likely to face his major rival in that
earlier race: John Sollazzo, a Democratic district leader who ran
against Fusco for City Council in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sollazzo received only 40 percent of the vote in the
special election in the 50th Council District, he said he was
convinced that he would do better this fall in the rematch. ``It
was a special election, and only 13 percent of the voters came
out,'' Sollazzo said. ``But this time we have more time to prepare
and we will have a larger turnout. This time we will have a strong
candidate at the top of the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sollazzo referred to the race for Staten Island district
attorney, which will coincide with the City Council election. In
that race, the incumbent, William Murphy, a Democrat who beat the
Staten Island borough president, Guy Molinari, four years ago, will
face Catherine DiDomenico, a Republican lawyer who is counsel to
Vito Fossella, the U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   Although defeating an incumbent like Oddo is usually an uphill
battle, Staten Island Democrats suggest that this year's council
race represents their most fertile opportunity in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tradition in politics that says that the best time
to beat an incumbent is his first time out,'' said Robert Gigante,
the chairman of the Democratic Party on Staten Island. ``Jimmy Oddo
has only been a councilman for a couple of months. Bill Murphy's
coattails will be helpful. It will be enough to pull this off.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddo said he had not begun thinking about the election. ``For
me, the best campaign strategy is to focus on doing my job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the Wings
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively rare for a member of the state Assembly to give
up his seat, particularly in a district where he is virtually
assured of re-election. So even a hint that an incumbent will
retire is enough to bring out potential successors.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Samuel Bea, 66, a Democrat who represents a district
in the northeastern section of the Bronx, says he has not decided
whether to seek a third term next year. But there is rampant
speculation in his district that he might retire from the Assembly
at the end of this term.
</P>
<P>
   That has inspired a number of politicians to say they are
contemplating running for the Assembly seat. One potential
candidate is Carl Heastie, 31, a Democratic state committeeman and
a budget analyst in the office of City Comptroller Alan Hevesi.
Heastie is a close political ally of state Sen. Larry Seabrook, a
dominant political figure in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate is Joey Jackson, 32, a lawyer who is
chairman of the Bronx Democratic County Committee. Jackson has
close ties with Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic
Party chairman. Another is Lethia Williams, a schoolteacher who is
heavily involved in civic organizations in the district.
</P>
<P>
   But the most prominent possibility is City Councilman Lawrence
Warden, 54, who has represented the district since 1992 and is
barred by term limits from seeking re-election to the council in
2001. ``With term limits in place now, I have to keep options
open,'' Warden said. ``It's certainly something I'm looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that has the potential to create tension in the ranks of
the Northeast Bronx Democratic Club, of which all the prospective
candidates are members. Warden angered many club members in 1997
when he endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sam does decide to retire, it will be quite an
unpredictable situation in our area,'' Seabrook said. ``There are a
lot of people who would like to be in the mix. It's going to be
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   A Political Club With a Twist
</P>
<P>
   Typically, political clubs make their central mission the
advancement of a single party's candidates. Occasionally, however,
there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   One such anomaly is the new Caribbean and American United
Political Club, in the northeast Bronx. Hugh Beckford, one of its
leaders, said the organization would support both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not necessarily advocating for any political party,''
Beckford said. ``We will support candidates who are advocating what
is in the best interest of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal, he said, is to register a large number of
immigrants to vote in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the club does have aims that are decidedly traditional.
The club is considering running candidates from its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Beckford himself, the director of a social-services agency in
the Bronx called Caribbean and American Family Services, said he
was considering running for office, although he was uncertain which
position.
</P>
<P>
   While the new organization could well provide some political
competition for Seabrook's club, which is the dominant Democratic
group in that section of the Bronx, the state senator dismissed
that possibility. ``To the extent that they will work for
Democratic victories,'' he said, ``we won't have any problem.''

 &HT;    Fire kills 11 racing horses in Ohio
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Willard Miller stared into the charred rubble
where 11 harness racing horses died Thursday night after fire raced
through a barn at the Greene County Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamestown man lost three horses in the blaze, including a
2-year-old colt who showed great promise and was to race for the
first time June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best thing I ever had. He was the kind you dream of
having,'' said the teary-eyed Miller, for whom the loss was as much
personal as financial.
</P>
<P>
   The state fire marshal spent Friday sifting through the rubble
but has not yet determined what caused the fire. Investigators have
not ruled out arson and are following possible leads, said Xenia
fire Lt. Jeff Leaming, who serves on the Greene County Fire
Investigation Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Xenia fire Chief David Price set a preliminary damage loss
estimate at $700,000 and said a final amount would not be
determined until fire officials talked to all of the owners who
lost trotters and pacers in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horseman's worst nightmare,'' said Virgil Wallace,
president of the Greene County Harness Horsemen's Association and
member of the fair board.
</P>
<P>
   As a few harness racers took their horses through the paces on
the nearby track, a backhoe dug a large hole in the infield where
the carcasses were buried. The large grave was just behind a
headstone memorializing 38 horses who died in a fire in an adjacent
horse barn in June 1984.
</P>
<P>
   That barn had been rebuilt and became threatened by Thursday
night's fire, whose flames leaped into the air about 30 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Flames spread quickly through the 37-year-old barn filled with
hay and straw. Xenia firefighters who responded to the scene within
two minutes of receiving the first 911 call at 8:18 p.m. found the
structure engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire was coming out both ends of the barn

 &HT;    Aggressive trade policy called for at summit
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. _ Speaking at the Florida Economic Summit on
Friday, Gov. Jeb Bush outlined some of his favorite economic
policies, including property tax cuts and universities raising
money by having professors do corporate research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you can connect research to the real world, the more
synergy you'll see,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is convened under state law three times a year, with
Friday's meeting being held at the Radisson Resort in Coral
Springs. It brings together lawmakers, economic development
officials, business people and chamber of commerce representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Summit discussions included Florida's role in international
trade. Sixteen panelists agreed that Florida's commitment to
international trade is eclipsed by the state's spending on
promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state ought to have an international trade policy
equivalent to a country,'' said Mike Fitzgerald, president of
Enterprise Florida's International Trade and Economic Development
Unit. ``We have one of the largest economies in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As other panelists warned that Florida will lose out to other
states in the race to attract foreign trade, Rep. Carlos Valdes
(R-Miami) suggested the state create a new agency to promote
international business.
</P>
<P>
   But panelist Dick Nunis, an Enterprise Florida board member,
chastised Valdes for his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you looking for another job?'' Nunis asked. ``We've had
too many organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rudolph Bradley (D-St. Petersburg) told Nunis his comments
were insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Though outnumbered, Nunis, who recently retired as chairman of
Walt Disney Attractions, refused to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   The three-times-a-year economic summit might soon be history. A
bill to reorganize Enterprise Florida, the state's business
promotion agency, would reduce the meeting requirement to once a
year. The bill has passed the legislature and is awaiting the
governor's signature. As recently as 1996, the law called for four
meetings a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's director of tourism, trade and economic development, J.
Antonio Villamil, said it's better to have small meetings dedicated
to focused topics, such as space or transportation, rather than
three general meetings.

SALMON HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Tim Salmon glanced down at his fiberglass-wrapped left
wrist, then looked up at the reporters encircling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I've been here before,'' the Angels right fielder said
with sad smile.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst kind of deja vu. For the second consecutive
year, Salmon was breaking out toward a monster season when injury
stopped it. Last year, a torn ligament in his foot landed him on
the disabled list for two weeks in May and hobbled him the rest of
the year. This time, a badly sprained wrist was the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become an expert on my foot and it looks like I'm going
to become an expert on my hand now, too,'' Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon admitted he was shocked when results of an angiogram
showed a slight tear in the wrist, meaning it had to be immobilized
and would keep him out at least four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd poke around a little bit and say, `OK, you're
day-to-day.''' Salmon said. ``I was shellshocked. I wasn't able to
comprehend what they were telling me. My wife said, `Hey, you took
that news pretty good.' Well, I was dazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was batting .347 with a team-leading seven homers and 25
RBI when he injured the wrist on May 4 while attempting a sliding
catch. He's finally shed the slow-starter label. Now if he could
just make it through May without landing on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have the slow starts and be healthy,'' Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting Mo: Angels manager Terry Collins said he has no
reservations about leaving Garret Anderson in the cleanup spot
until Salmon returns.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was hitting .301 entering Friday's game, and his seven
home runs are more than he usually has this early in the season.
But is he enough of a threat to keep opponents from pitching around
Vaughn?
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, Anderson said he won't change his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter where I hit in the lineup,'' he said in a
flat voice. ``If you're a run producer, you drive in runs. You
either know how to do it or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Total body workout: Second baseman Randy Velarde said the
discomfort in his lower back is still there, though it's tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde started for the fourth consecutive game Friday after
missing five with a bulging disc.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde has a Mr. Olympian physique and spends more time in the
weight room than most players. Not enough time, as it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did weight training for every part of the body, but I
neglected the small muscles of the spine and it caught up to me,''
Velarde said. ``If you don't take care of the small muscles, the
big ones take over and it causes instability.''

METROSTARS LOOK TO REGAIN SCORING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scoring only one goal in the first four games at home is not
what the MetroStars had in mind in their attempt to lure soccer
fans to Giants Stadium. The MetroStars will enter Saturday night's
game against the Miami Fusion without having scored a goal in the
last 280 minutes of action at home.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the MetroStars' lack of offensive
production is the absence of Tab Ramos, their most creative
midfielder, who has not played since the opening game of the season
because of an injury just below his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Without Ramos in the lineup to provide quality service to
Eduardo Hurtado, the team's premier striker, the MetroStars (3-4)
have been starved for goals. And they may stay that way until Ramos
returns or until the team acquires its last foreign player. Ramos
assisted Hurtado on two goals in the opening-game victory in Miami
on March 20. While Ramos was missing the rest of the games, Hurtado
has one goal _ and that came from a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars have scored two other goals, by Mike Petke and
Nansha Kalonji, for a grand total of three in their last six games
_ not counting shootout goals, of course.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's practice at the team's training facility at
Kean University in Union, N.J., Ramos said that his injury was more
than nerve trauma below his right knee, as had been announced, and
that it also included a partial tear of a tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't find out that two-thirds of a tendon was torn until
four weeks later when I had an MRI,'' Ramos said after working
mostly on his own at Thursday's practice. ``I can kick the ball
with force now. I started doing that yesterday. But it bothers me
when I use the inside of my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   For about three weeks after his injury Ramos was in severe pain
every time he tried to kick the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good when I started kicking with force yesterday,''
Ramos said Thursday. ``But I have no idea when I'll be ready to
play. They tell me I have to be patient. I will start working with
the team next week, and once I'm 100 percent I'll start playing a
little here and a little there before I can play a full game.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Ramos, it is becoming imperative for the MetroStars to
acquire the last foreign player they are due by the league. The
MetroStars have given the league a list of five players to choose
from, but their first choice appears to be Florin Raducioiu, a
29-year-old Romanian striker who plays in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars are in a desperate need of another striker to be
paired with Hurtado on the attack. Coach Bora Milutinovic has tried
Roy Myers of Costa Rica and Mark Chung as Hurtado's partner without
much success. Both are midfield playmakers rather than strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game against the Fusion (3-5) will also serve
as a qualifier for the 1999 US. Open Cup. The winner will
automatically advance, while the loser will have to finish among
the league's top scoring teams to qualify for the next round.

RICE WANTS MORE HELP FROM LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A rout at the hands of the Houston Rockets left a bad
taste in the Lakers' mouths Thursday night. But they can clear
their palates with a simple culinary formula.
</P>
<P>
   Just add Rice.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know? Just ask the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've always been saying,'' Glen Rice said, ``we got
back to that standstill (stuff) out there. And if you look at the
second half, all I basically was doing was forcing up (3-pointers).
And that's not what I'm about, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice missed 8 of 13 shots in the Lakers' Game 3 playoff loss to
Houston, and that's not what he's about either. It was his worst
game in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice said _ and teammates agreed _ it was the Lakers'
stagnant offense that stunted his shooting performance. It's a
trend they need to reverse immediately to win Game 4 today and
close out the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers took off on their recent six-game winning
streak, it was largely due to better player movement in their
offense, with plenty of screens set for Rice, who isn't comfortable
standing still waiting for shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers wilted under the Rockets' defensive pressure
Thursday and strayed from their game plan _ and lost for the first
time in seven games. It also left Rice hoisting up bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we were going so well is we were moving the ball
around. We had the floor spread and we had guys running off
screens, and that's in my opinion what this team needs to do,''
Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job taking us out of our sets, and we made a
lot of mistakes in terms of where we were supposed to get the ball
and who we were supposed to get the ball to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lakers help Rice with movement and screens, they'll
help themselves handle Scottie Pippen. With Rice standing still,
Pippen expended no energy fighting past screens, and he was able to
conserve energy on defense. Presto, Pippen gets aggressive on
offense and scores 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to keep that man tired,'' Rice said. ``If we allow him
to do what he did (Thursday) night, it's going to be a tough Game
5.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Game 4, but if the Lakers don't adjust quickly, they'll
be facing elimination in Game 5 back in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 lead in the series, the Lakers were far from
panicking Friday, but there was a clear sense the Rockets had put a
dent in their psyches with the 102-88 win. After all, the Lakers
hadn't lost since April 26 _ a 22-point loss to Houston. Since
then, they'd looked unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we hadn't lost in a while, so it felt kind of
awkward, it felt a little weird being in that situation,'' Kobe
Bryant said. ``But we just have to respond come Saturday....
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the formula for winning basketball, we just have to do
it every night. We just have to adjust well to their pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to adjust to their aggressiveness as well. Allowing
the Rockets a 12-rebound advantage, and 19 offensive rebounds, is a
sure-fire formula for losing. But it's not every night that Charles
Barkley grabs 23 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little upset with ourselves,'' Bryant said, ``because
we didn't go out there with the energy that we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, seemingly on the verge of collapse just days ago,
not only stayed alive in the series, they breathed new life into
their self-confidence. They now know the maligned Pippen can win
games and the Rockets can frustrate the Lakers' once-overpowering
offense.
</P>
<P>
   That's all a veteran team with three superstars needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put them away. You don't want to give this team
any life, because they've done it before in the past,'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, the Lakers said they were unaffected. They exuded
their usual L.A. cool in the face of the Houston humidity. The only
overwhelming feeling was restlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious right now, we can't wait until (Saturday),''
Bryant said. ``We want to get out there and play. I think today is
like the slowest day in the world, because we're all anxious to get
out there and kind of get this thing over with.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ONE CRUISE ENDS, ANOTHER BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley stood on a Carnival cruise ship in 1995 and
was introduced as the Miami Heat's $30 million Moses; the visionary
who would lead the team from the humiliation of losing to the NBA's
Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Miami is trying to avoid its own period in the
wilderness _ trying to avoid being eliminated by the Knicks for the
second straight year. After Friday night's 87-72 victory, the Heat
have a chance in Game 5 Sunday to avoid a humbling first-round
exit. Once again Friday night, Riley pulled a rabbit out of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's program, his credibility, will be on the line Sunday.
When he took over in Miami, Riley could have told the people he
could walk on water and they would have believed him. Today they
might ask, ``Can we see?''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked what the significance of a lost series would
be, Riley said, ``Major.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a winning team; we're building a good program down
there,'' he said. ``But this isn't good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd like to think that a game is a game, a series a series.
But the venom that surrounds this series underlines the credibility
at stake. Less so for Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks, who is in the
beginning of his head coaching career, than for Riley, whose best
work is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   A year after he was introduced in Miami, Riley lost Juwan
Howard, the Washington forward he was trying to sign as a free
agent. Riley felt Howard could have put the Heat over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The league negated the deal, saying the Heat did not have room
under the salary cap to sign him. The league charged that incentive
bonuses in the contracts of Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown should have
been counted against the salary cap by Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was counting on getting Howard, and to make room for him,
Riley got rid of, among others, Kevin Willis, now playing well in
Toronto; Glen Rice, a tremendous weapon for the Lakers, and Matt
Geiger, playing well at center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat are left with a wagon whose wheels have been run off.
For the Knicks, losing this series wouldn't be any more cataclysmic
than what this season has already been. Factions formed, causing
divisions and rancor that spilled over from the front office to the
locker room. The president of the team was demoted, and an ongoing
debate developed over whether Van Gundy should stay or go, or
whether the Knicks should walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   Even a series victory over Miami would bring the Knicks back to
where they were last season, when they defeated Miami, three games
to two, in the first round. The Knicks have not gone beyond the
second round since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, there has never been a debate over Riley's status.
It's exalted. Period. He is Moses, though a loss to the Knicks may
prompt some of the bolder members of the flock to wonder if Riley
really knows where he is going.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has been associated with the NBA for 32 years: as a
journeyman player, a broadcaster, an assistant and then a head
coach. In that time, he has been a part of six NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's credibility bankroll is hefty, but a loss to the Knicks
would cost him a big chunk of it. Regardless who wins, this series
will bring a four-year-old drama full circle. Riley left New York
as the loser, more or less, in a struggle that saw Ernie Grunfeld
emerge as the winner and team president.
</P>
<P>
   Now Riley, as president of the Heat, is at risk of being
defeated by players Grunfeld brought to the Knicks; Riley is losing
with players he brought to the Heat: Brown, Hardaway, Alonzo
Mourning and Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   Riley quickly points out that Miami's pilgrimage is just
beginning. The Knicks played their first season in 1946-47 and
didn't win their first championship for 23 seasons. They have not
won a championship in 26 years. Beyond that, Madison Square Garden
has been part of New York's sports culture since 1879, this actual
building since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami franchise and Miami Arena _ which taxpayers paid for _
are 11 years old. Now Riley must persuade the public to buy into a
new arena, the centerpiece of a slick, 70-acre complex near the
Port of Miami. Plans for the complex include the expansion of the
port that benefits the Carnival Cruise Lines owned by Micky Arison,
who also owns the Heat. The chief architect of the new arena's
financial plan is P. Anthony Ridder, chairman of Knight-Ridder,
which owns The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is Arison's Moses, but you wonder after a series like this
that exposed so many flaws and weaknesses whether Riley will suffer
the same fate _ lead the Heat and their followers to the Promised
Land but never cross into it with them. Lots of holes to fill and
lots of seats to fill. For the time being, the Heat is nearing the
wilderness and Van Gundy is out of the woods. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a startling turnabout, the Miami Heat used the
3-point touch that had deserted it in Game 3 and overwhelmed the
New York Knicks during a 41-15 run in the second half Friday night
at Madison Square Garden to win Game 4, 87-72, and force a deciding
game Saturday afternoon in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario seemed unthinkable in the third quarter, after
the Knicks held a 62-58 lead. The Heat's desire took over as it
weathered a 22-5 run. Scrambling for loose balls and rebounds, it
made up an 11-point third-quarter deficit and rallied to take the
lead, 67-64, on a 3-pointer from a suddenly resurgent Tim Hardaway
with seven minutes 57 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who had all but disappeared in this
three-of-five-games series because of a sore knee and suspect
confidence, delivered another 3-pointer off a drive-and-kick by
Terry Porter, who caught Charlie Ward off his guard. Porter
penetrated and found the open Hardaway, who drilled the 3-pointer
to give the Heat a 74-66 lead with 5:23 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After a turnover by Larry Johnson on his drive to the basket,
Porter was left open in transition for his 3-pointer to provide the
Heat with a 77-66 lead with 4:10 left. That lead ballooned to 19
points with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   During that same stretch, the Knicks were 2 for 10 with 6
turnovers. All that had gone right for them in Game 3 went terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway finished with 14 points, and Alonzo Mourning had 16
points and 14 rebounds. Porter chipped in with 16 points off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston and Ward scored 12 each for the Knicks, who shot 2
for 13 in the fourth quarter and were outscored, 29-10.
</P>
<P>
   The way the momentum swung from the second quarter into the
third was hauntingly familiar for the Heat. As its shots ricocheted
off the rim, the Knicks took the misses and overwhelmed Miami in
transition. The Knicks trotted off on a 22-5 run from the second
quarter into the third on the wings of 3-pointers from Ward and
Johnson to take a 51-40 lead with nine minutes left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, the Knicks broke open the game with a 32-2 run. But
just as this run approached that kind of roll, Ward had to leave
the game. He dived for his own turnover and banged the left side of
his head into the knee of Dan Majerle with 9:49 left in the third.
Ward went to the locker room, where he had medical glue put on the
cut near his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks missed him as the Heat did something it did not do in
Game 3: Miami rode Mourning and mounted a comeback to pull within
4, 51-47. A 3-pointer by Johnson stopped the Heat's minirun with
6:30 left. But this game was not going to be decided as quickly and
as easily as the previous blowouts in this series.
</P>
<P>
   The tension was thick as both teams went tit for tat as the
third quarter wound down. Each time the Heat inched within 3 to 5
points of the Knicks, there was Houston to hit a jumper or a free
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Voshon Lenard tossed up a 3-pointer as the shot clock ran and
that pulled the Heat within 2 points with 50 seconds left in the
third. But an active Latrell Sprewell sprang between two Heat big
men and came up with a rebound and put-back to give the Knicks a
62-58 lead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat came out like a team desperate but not out of control.
Methodically it carved a 7-point lead early in the second quarter
by sinking the 3-point shot that had escaped it in Games 1 and 3.
But just as in Game 3, the Knicks found a way to take the edge off
the Heat before the first half closed.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3 it was Sprewell who came in and stirred his team. This
time it was Ward, who hit all three 3-pointers he attempted in the
first half and put his body in peril to bring the Knicks back to
life and help provide a 44-40 lead before the break.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:56 left in the second quarter, Ward drove the lane,
careened off the chest of P.J. Brown, crashed to the floor and
brought the fans to their feet. He hit one of two free throws. Two
possessions later, with the shot clock running down, he took off in
front of Hardaway and nailed a 3-pointer to tie the game, 37-37.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks overwhelmed the Heat in Game 3 with a 12-0 run
to close out the first half, they provided an encore with a 15-5
run. The half was capped when Johnson missed a 3-pointer, gathered
his rebound and went in for a layup at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   As it has throughout the series, the Heat started out executing
its game plan well. Although Mourning, Brown and Majerle found foul
trouble early and were on the bench more often than not, the Heat
rediscovered the cold-blooded shooting of the limping Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   He had made just one of his first 15 3-point attempts in this
series, but found his groove in the face of Childs. He dribbled in
front of Childs, pulled up and hit two consecutive 3s in the first
quarter. Earlier in the day, Hardaway was fined $5,000 for verbal
abuse of officials and refusing to leave the court in a timely
fashion after his ejection from Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Pat Riley also dusted off another 3-point artist.
Lenard, whose playing time in this series had been limited to a
cameo in the blowouts, delivered as well. The Heat, finding success
from 3-point range, took a 25-24 lead after the first quarter and
extended its lead to 7 points early in the second.

REID IT AND WEEP: THIS IS J.R.'S TEAM

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whose team is it?
</P>
<P>
   That old question deserves a fresh answer, now that the Lakers
have made up their minds at last what sort of team they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq's team? Kobe's team? How unoriginal. What have O'Neal and
Bryant got besides 46 points a game and $191 million between them?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a new suggestion:
</P>
<P>
   The human symbol of the new Lakers averaged five points for them
in the regular season, didn't lead the team in any statistical
column in any game, and is the member of the starting five whom
fans would have the most trouble naming.
</P>
<P>
   It's J.R. Reid's team.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team of vagabonds, and none of them embodies that
spirit more than Reid, who played his way through San Antonio, New
York, Charlotte and even France on his way to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team that pledges a one-for-all, all-for-one
commitment to winning, and none of them gets less glory or seems to
worry less about it than Reid.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team that proposes to rise or fall on their defensive
effort, and none is playing a more important defensive position
with more determination than Reid.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers aim to go far beyond the first round of the NBA
playoffs, their stars will do well to emulate their leading
character actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of team we are,'' point guard Derek Fisher
said when he was asked about Reid after a practice session at the
Forum. ``A bunch of guys who could be doing more (elsewhere) who
are sacrificing for the good of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That takes a lot out of a guy, to have to do that without
complaining about it or feeling you're being taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reid is doing it.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't how he figured to pursue his first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Reid came to the league with potential-star credentials, taken
fifth overall by the Charlotte Hornets in the 1989 draft after
three seasons at North Carolina in which he was a consensus
All-American and MVP of the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets found out quickly they'd spent that high draft pick
on a player with regional appeal and an even more limited game.
</P>
<P>
   Know that stat about Elden Campbell, how his scoring average
went up for six straight seasons with the Lakers? Reid is the
opposite, his average having gone !ital!down!off! for six straight
seasons from '90-91 to '97-98.
</P>
<P>
   For the '96-97 season his best contract offer came from a French
team, and he played there, winning a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Back with the Hornets, he briefly turned back into a star early
this season. With Glen Rice out with an elbow injury, the offense
went through Reid and he was getting 15.2 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the trade that brought Reid, Rice and B.J. Armstrong
(soon waived) to the Lakers and sent Campbell and Eddie Jones to
the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't know if I'd like it,'' Reid said this week.
``I knew, coming here, I wasn't going to get a lot of shots. It's a
lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   At first he sat and watched Dennis Rodman start at his position
_ Reid reliving his experience with the San Antonio Spurs _ and
sometimes played behind Travis Knight, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of like (going from) college to the pros again,''
Fisher said, commiserating. ``It's like going from conference
Player of the Year to averaging two points a game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knight blew his shot at starting and Rodman was released.
With 10 games to go in the regular season, Reid became a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's had to hear how the Lakers would be better if
they still had Rodman and Campbell, talk he dismisses as ``the
media _ it's always something.''
</P>
<P>
   On a one-year, $780,000 contract, with a chance to go free-agent
this summer, Reid also brushes aside the suggestion his time with
the Lakers is a temporary inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good team and we're winning. Any situation like that,
it's good for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Lakers will want him back, Reid thinks, ``all
depends on how we do (in the playoffs).''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10th year in pro basketball, he is playing the role of a
lifetime, assigned by a marquee team desperate for a title to throw
his stringy 6-foot-10 body up against three of the NBA's leading
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has guarded the Houston Rockets' Charles Barkley with mixed
success in the first round, which the Lakers lead 2-1 going into
this afternoon's game at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   And if the playoffs proceed according to the seedings, he'll get
the Spurs' Tim Duncan next and the Utah Jazz's Karl Malone in the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of being a power forward in this league,''
Reid said with a shrug, after referring to his job as ``dirty
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaining? Taken advantage of? Counting his ``touches''?
</P>
<P>
   Not Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think J.R. wouldn't trade where he is right now,'' Rice
said. ``He's got a legitimate shot at winning a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Whose team is it?
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to anybody who thinks the same way. &QL;

METS BLUNT PHILLIES, 7-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They had stumbled into Philadephia, reeling and
wrung out, insisting they were not worried about their slump but
slipping behind the streaking Phillies in the standings all the
same. But like fireworks that illuminate even the heaviest clouds,
the New York Mets' hitters unleashed a bombardment that lifted them
to a 7-3 victory Friday night over the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with another disciplined outing by Masato Yoshii, the
victory jolted the Mets out of the doldrums that had engulfed them
during their 2-4 slide in Arizona and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, Robin Ventura and Edgardo Alfonzo all hit home runs
_ Olerud's and Ventura's were both two-run shots in the first
inning _ to boost the Mets to a 5-1 lead by the third. Olerud's
blast was only the 14th that ever reached the upper deck of
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who had pitched six shutout innings in each of his last
two starts, had allowed only a solo inside-the-park homer by Bobby
Abreu to that point and seemed firmly in control of the game,
allowing just one other runner to reach second base and getting
ahead on most hitters. His fastball was regularly in the '90s, an
uptick that Manager Bobby Valentine has attributed to a slight
change in Yoshii's mechanics. With the new success has come an
increased aggressiveness and confidence from the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go up there, I'm trying to be as aggressive as
possible,'' Yoshii said. ``I'm pitching the same as usual. Nothing
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets added another run in the top of the fifth inning,
Phillies starter Chad Ogea was gone, the former Met Yorkis Perez
was trying to prevent a blowout and Valentine was leaning back on
his bench in satisfaction. The Mets scored the run thanks to the
leadoff hitter Roger Cedeno, who showed the speed of a sprinter in
stealing four bases Friday night. He hit an infield single, then
stole second, advanced to third on an Alfonzo fly ball and scored
on Olerud's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has given Cedeno, who is filling in for Rickey
Henderson and has 14 stolen bases, the green light to go whenever
he gets on base. Like Cedeno, the Mets read all the signs correctly
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed and power, that was all our runs,'' Valentine said. ``It
was a well-balanced attack, guys hitting the ball hard and Roger on
the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But starting pitching has given the Mets fits this season, and
in the bottom of the fifth, Yoshii flirted with disaster. He
yielded a leadoff homer to pinch hitter Dave Doster, whose shot hit
the left-field foul pole. Three batters later, Scott Rolen sent a
2-2 pitch against the left-field scoreboard to narrow the Mets'
edge to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of mistakes and they hit the foul pole,''
Valentine said of his starting pitcher. ``He was fabulous, making
pitches, keeping them off stride. He came up big. When he keeps the
ball down, he's a good major league pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine let Yoshii bat in the sixth, and his pitcher redeemed
his decision in the bottom half of the inning. Yoshii struck out
Ron Gant, got Abreu to ground out and forced Mike Lieberthal to pop
up to Olerud. It was all Valentine could ask of his starter, and
better than the Mets' manager has received recently from the rest
of his rotation. In six innings, Yoshii gave up three runs on five
hits _ the three solo homers did the damage _ with two walks and
four strikeouts. The pitcher who two weeks ago was battling for his
job baffled a team that went 5-1 on its recent road trip while
hitting .336 with 15 home runs and 44 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard on his mechanics,'' Valentine said. ``He knows
when he has it. And he flaunts it when he does.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ BOBBY JONES will start Monday after he threw Friday and
reported no problems after his session. Jones has had soreness in
his elbow and tingling in his fingers, but he was pleased with his
performance in a series of tests the team gave him. ``That eased my
mind,'' Jones said. ``There's still a little swelling, but nothing
drastic.'' RICK REED will pitch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mets purchased the contract of pitcher PAT MAHOMES from
Class AAA Norfolk. To make room for Mahomes on the 40-man roster,
the Mets transferred outfielder JAY PAYTON to the 60-day disabled
list, retroactive to opening day. At Norfolk, Mahomes was 4-1 with
a 3.49 earned run average in six starts. In 382/3 innings, he
allowed 38 hits, 17 runs (15 earned), with 12 walks and 24
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICKEY HENDERSON, hampered by a strained right knee, ran in
the outfield Friday and will likely be ready to play Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitcher JOSIAS MANZANILLO will accept his assignment to
Norfolk while reserving the right to dispute the assignment.
Manzanillo told the Mets he had a sore right elbow, but general
manager STEVE PHILLIPS says Manzanillo didn't mention it until told
of the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entering the game, the Mets led the National League with a
.989 fielding average. &QL;

 &HT;    Election airlift grounded for South Florida Israelis
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Israelis in South Florida hoping to cast
their vote for the next prime minster Monday afternoon had their
cut-rate round-trip tickets to Israel yanked hours before they were
set to depart in what is either a massive display of
disorganization or distrust by the politically motivated parties
that arranged the flights.
</P>
<P>
   The hotly contested race for prime minster between conservative
incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor Party Leader Ehud Barak was
expected to draw between 10,000 and 15,000 Israeli-Americans back
to the Middle East to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political parties desperate for an edge had heavily
subsidized the flights. Prices for round-trip tickets that normally
sell for up to $2,000 were cut by as much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday and Friday, as flights were supposed to depart
from Miami, many were canceled either because organizers overbooked
the charters or because rival political factions believed members
loyal to the opposition party had bought seats to vote for the
wrong candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realized there was too much risk in taking
people,'' said Avi Tansman, who is from a suburb of TelAviv and has
lived in Boca Raton for ten years. ``They don't know us and it's
much easier to go to Brooklyn and take the masses (who support
Likud).''
</P>
<P>
   Said an Israeli-born doctor who lives in Boca Raton and whose
flight was canceled Friday afternoon: ``I think they were just
overwhelmed. They had too many people who wanted to get on those
flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the flights were organized in numbers never before seen,
the phenomenon the Israeli press dubbed the ``election airlift'' is
not entirely new. In the 1996 election, several thousand, mostly
ultra-Orthodox right-wing Jews from Brooklyn flew to Israel to back
the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hasidim have always gone over in a small number and some
Israelis, particularly people who served in wars have gone,'' said
Bill Gralnick, South-Central Florida Director of the American
Jewish Committee. ``It's never been significant, but in the last
couple of elections there has been a big influence of American
money and more and more of a media ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis use U.S. strategies
</P>
<P>
   Part of that ripple effect has come from Israeli politicians
employing American strategies and American strategists, Gralnick
said. For instance, James Carville, President Clinton's campaign
manager, is running Barak's campaign, using a strategy of
repetition, focus and simplicity that was nowhere to be found in
Israeli political campaigns of 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to get the most effective strategists has
intensified this year in the wake of Netanyahu's upset victory in
1996. Netanyahu defeated Shimon Peres by 29,457 votes out of about
3 million. The expatriate population began to be understood as
critical. Strategists, desperate for any additional edge, began to
look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Israeli community, there has been a buzz about this for
a while,'' said Chuck Reddy, the executive director of the
nonpartisan Florida-Israel Chamber of Commerce. ``As the issue of
Jerusalem comes up and the debate gets more intense, people are
following it. They say, `I was going to go home in July anyway,
instead I'll go in May.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are approximately 300,000 Israelis living in America and
30,000 in South Florida, according to estimates by the Florida
Israel Chamber of Commerce. Thousands of others are expected to fly
from Europe, most notably from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, according to observers of Middle Eastern politics, is
the posture of the Israeli government toward the peace process with
Palestinians, and by extension, the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every Israeli living here has family in Israel,''
said Itzhak Asher, a Boca Raton sculptor and dual citizen who said
he will be flying to Israel in June to vote in the predicted runoff
between Netanyahu and Barak. ``This is our only way to make our
voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Americans, Israelis living abroad are not allowed to vote
through absentee ballots unless they are away on official
government business. And unlike Americans, who rarely muster an
electoral turnout greater than 50 percent, nearly 80 percent of
Israelis of voting age traditionally cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sold out for weeks
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip tickets from Miami that typically cost $1,000 have
been discounted to $765 by the government-run airline, El Al,
according to El Al sales representative John Balcer of Miami.
Politically backed charters have been advertised for as low as
$180. The catch is tickets generally are for flights that arrive
the day of or the day before the election, and return two or three
days later. Tickets went on sale in March and April and have been
sold out for weeks according to travelers and representatives from
El Al, which flies from New York; Newark, N.J.; Chicago; Los
Angeles; Miami; Baltimore and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Though most people know that the subsidy is coming from the two
largest political parties through Kesher on the left and Chai
L'Yisrael on the right, the groups advertise in Jewish and Hebrew
publications that the fares are for any Israeli registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about these trips through friends,'' said Sam Ballen,
a Boca Raton lawyer who holds dual citizenship but will not be
returning to Israel to vote because he waited too late to book a
flight. ``All you need to get a ticket is a passport and to be
registered, but it's understood who is sponsoring the trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two groups, political analysts say Chai L'Yisrael has
chartered more flights and raised more money to subsidize them.
Kesher offered flights for $450 and Chai L'Yisrael for under $200.
</P>
<P>
   `Maybe they identified me'
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the election seemed almost certain to
result in a runoff to be held in June but a surge by Barak in the
polls late this week shook the confidence of Netanyahu's supporters
and may have added to the cancellation of trips from Miami and for
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Tansman, for instance, bought a ticket for $195 from Miami to
Tel Aviv on a Likud-linked charter but he is an ardent Barak
supporter. ``Maybe they identified me, maybe they got overwhelmed
because Netanyahu is behind in the polls. At this point, it's
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reservation line overwhelmed
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the answering machine at the toll free number for the
Chai L'Yisrael reservation line sounds almost comically overwhelmed
and repeated several times: ``If you have made a reservation, we
will contact you shortly. Please be patient. We will contact you
shortly. Please do not call this number again. We will contact you
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   The election airlift strategy, which has been widely reported in
the Israeli press, has angered some Israelis who feel voters living
abroad are not invested in their country, do not know what's going
on and should not be allowed to vote if they do not live there.
</P>
<P>
   Asher, 53, acknowledged the anger but is adamant about his stake
in the election. A veteran of three wars, Asher said he reads three
Israeli papers once a week, lives in Israel for five months a year
and speaks to his two daughters in Caesarea three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   `Too much at stake'
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much at stake,'' said Asher, who said he plans to
vote for Barak. ``I really want to make sure that my small voice
contributes to the issue.''
