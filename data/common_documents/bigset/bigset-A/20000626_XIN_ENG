<HEADLINE> Japan's Coalition Certain to Secure Majority in Lower House Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three-way ruling coalition
is certain to secure a combined 241 seats, a simple majority, in
the 480-seat House of Representatives, the Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party(
LDP), the New Komeito and the New Conservative Party (NCP),
targets a stable majority of 254, which would give it the
chairmanship of all lower house standing committees and at least
the same number of seats on each committee as the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), meanwhile, said the three
parties are certain to secure a stable majority.
</P>
<P>
As of 0:47 a.m., the LDP won 225 seats, while the New Komeito
garnered 27 and the NCP 7.
</P>
<P>
Senior LDP officials said Sunday night that Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori would continue serving as premier only if the ruling
bloc gets a majority.

<HEADLINE> UAE Citizens Urged to Keep Away From Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
called on its citizens to keep away from drugs, reported official
WAM news agency on Sunday, one day before the World Anti-Drugs Day.
</P>
<P>
"As an Arab and Islamic society, we should reject this trend
which is increasingly taking toll all over the world. Islam orders
us to distance ourselves from anything that leads to death,"
Interior Minister Mohammed Saeed Al Badi said.
</P>
<P>
After releasing a statement to mark the World Anti-Drugs Day,
Badi advised the Emirates' parents to instill patriotic values in
their children and to protect them from all forms of delinquency.
</P>
<P>
Badi also warned that "gangs of drug-pushers" were still
awaiting chances to bring in these poisons to destroy the rich-oil
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, UAE has so far been successful in
containing the drug menace, which has become an international
concern to both individuals and governments.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the authorities have worked out plans to

monitor drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"We have also been able to provide proper treatment for the
addicts in order to re-integrate them in society as good citizens,"
Badi added, without giving details about the drug addicts in his
country.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Coalition Wins Absolute Majority in Parliamentary Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three-way ruling coalition
won an absolute majority in Sunday's general election for the
House of Representatives by easily clearing the 269-seat mark in
the 480-seat lower house, setting the stage for Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori to stay on in office.
</P>
<P>
The ruling bloc, comprising the LDP, the New Komeito party and
the New Conservative Party (NCP), gained a combined 271 seats,
which will allow it to pass bills at all lower house standing
committees even without the chairman's vote, the Kyodo news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The result is much higher than the target of a 254-seat stable
majority in the lower house set by the ruling bloc.
</P>
<P>
But the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori, lost its simple majority, garnering 233 seats, a bit
higher than the 229-seat goal that LDP Secretary General Hiromu
Nonaka had set for the ruling party. The New Komeito party and the
NCP captured 31 seats and seven seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although the LDP, the dominant party in the coalition, fell
short of a lone majority in the lower house, Mori will likely
remain Japan's prime minister as senior officials of the three
parties pledged to stick to the alliance and have Mori stay on as
premier.
</P>
<P>
The LDP was followed by the main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ) with 127 seats. The results also showed the other
three opposition parties -- the Liberal Party (LP), the Japanese
Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP)-- won
22, 20 and 19 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,404 candidates were vying for the 480 seats in the
lower chamber, 300 in single-seat constituencies and the remaining
180 in the proportional representation section. The number of
seats was cut from 500 due to electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
The final turnout among the record-high 107 million eligible
voters in the election was 62.49 percent, the second lowest on
record, the Home Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
From the LDP, Wataru Takeshita, younger brother of late former
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and Yuko Obuchi, daughter of late
former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, won the races for their
respective districts in Shimane and Gunma prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said one reason that the ruling coalition managed to
maintain control of the lower chamber was it's campaign promise of
stability for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the election campaign, the coalition portrayed
itself as the key to stability needed for a full-fledged economic
recovery, and it appears to have worked with part of the
electorate wary of drastic change, they said.

<HEADLINE> I Only Scored Three Goals, Says Kluivert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Dutch hero Patick Kluuivert said
he only scored three goals instead of four as the Netherlands
routed Yugoslavia 6-1 in the Euro 2000 quarter-finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert was originally credited with scoring four goals, the
only player to have achieved the feat in the history of the
European championship finals.
</P>
<P>
But asked about the third goal he said: "Yes, honestly. I have
to say the defender touched it before me so really I only scored
three goals tonight."
</P>
<P>
The third goal came in the 51st minute when Kluivert and
Yugoslav Dejan Govedarica both went for a cross into the goalmouth
from Paul Bosvelt at the near post. The ball was deflected into
the net.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said they planned to make a ruling on the goal later on
Sunday, once they had seen the referee's report.

<HEADLINE> Kluivert Scores Four to Lead Dutch into Top Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Kluivert became the first
player to score four goals in a game at a European championship
finals and his record goals lift the co-host Netherlands sweep
Yugoslavia 6-1 on Sunday to reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch victory sets up a semifinal against Italy in
Amsterdam on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert gave the Dutch a 1-0 lead in the 24th minute of the
quarter-final played in Rotterdam and added his second goal seven
minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona striker stroke home two more time soon after the
interval and the four goals took his international tally to 29 in
44 games.
</P>
<P>
Marc Overmars added another two in the 78th and 90 minutes
before Yugoslavia scored an injury-time consolation goal from Savo
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"It was totally unexpected," the four-goal Dutch hero said
after the match.
</P>
<P>
"Everything went so fast. It's a bit like a dream." he added.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert's goals in a brilliant Dutch performance made the
forward the leading striker in the tournament with six goals so
far.
</P>
<P>
But Kluivert still has one thing to prove: "The face that I am
top scorer at the moment does not bother me at all. We all want
one thing - reaching the final and winning it."
</P>
<P>
They were enjoyed by the fanatical Dutch fans in a capacity 44,
000 Rotterdam crowd, almost all of them sporting the national
color of bright orange.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert's first came after Dennis Bergkamp put him through in
the box with a fine floating ball. The former Ajax Amsterdam
forward controlled the ball on the run with one touch and then
fired past Ivica Kralj with his right foot.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Davids supplied the through ball for Kluivert's second,
sending a looping pass over the Yugoslav defence. The former Ajax
forward fired home with his first touch.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a close-range shot in the
51th minute after Paul Bosvelt beat Dragan Strojkovic on the right.
He added his fourth just three minutes later, this time with
Boudewijn Zenden supplying the final pass from the left.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch could easily have added to their tally, even after
Kluivert was substituted in the 60th minute after taking a knock.

<HEADLINE> Washington to Urge U.S. Companies to Invest in Jordan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of
Treasury Stuart Eizenstat said Monday that Washington will try to
persuade U.S. companies to step up their investments in Jordan as
the two countries are looking forward to closer economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge in talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Ali
Abu Ragheb on trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat commended Jordan`s efforts to establish qualified
industrial zones which enabled its entrepreneurs to export products
to U.S. markets, and to create more jobs for the kingdom, where
unemployment rate stands at over 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat also praised the efforts by Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein to promote peace talks between Israel and its Arab
neighbors as well as Jordanian government's pursuit for higher
economic growth by way of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is eyeing for a 3 percent economic growth this year
from 1.5 percent in 1999, apparently emerging from a decade-old
economic recession since the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ragheb said his government was keen to forge ahead
with economic and administrative reforms to create appropriate
investment conditions for both domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said in statement earlier in the day that the U.S. and
Jordan had entered a new era of economic cooperation, and a
historic free trade agreement will soon be discussed between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Washington has provided Jordan some 1 billion U.S. dollars in
economic and military aid during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Washington considers Jordan as an important ally in the Arab
world. Their bilateral trade rose drastically from 7.77 million
dollars in 1998 to 325 million dollars in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lots of Work Going on Before Clinton-Barak-Arafat Summit: Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Middle
East envoy Dennis Ross said here Monday there is a lot of work
going on and more might be done before a three-way American,
Israeli and Palestinian summit for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
After an hour-and-a-half meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Ross, who came back to the Middle East on Thursday for
another round of shuttling diplomacy, told reporters that there is
potential for such a summit to take place.
</P>
<P>
Ross' trip is aimed at preparing for the regional tour by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which is to begin on
Tuesday. Albright will try to judge whether the Israeli and
Palestinian positions on the main issues are close enough for the
holding of the summit between Arafat, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak next month in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
So far, Barak is eager to attend such a summit but the
Palestinians consider the gap between the two sides still wide.
</P>
<P>
Arafat gave a speech in the West Bank town of Nablus on Sunday
that a Palestinian state would be declared "in a few weeks", even
without a deal with Israel. His remarks were strongly criticised by
the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Ross said, "We are out here trying too make a judgment about
where the parties stand on the issues, what is possible, is there a
basis to move towards a summit or should one continue working."
</P>
<P>
Albright will report to Clinton on her assessment of the
prospects of the summit and Clinton "will determine if we are at a
stage to move towards a summit or continue working," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat had
presented Ross with "some ideas" on both the interim and final
settlements, but that there were still gaps.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues raised by Arafat were the free of Palestinian
prisoners and a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank that
was to have taken place last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat did not say how Ross had responded to Arafat's requests.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy in Cyprus to Prepare for New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Alfred Moses, U.S. presidential
emissary for Cyprus, started on Monday a three-day visit to Cyprus
to prepare the ground for the third round of U.N.-sponsored talks
on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Larnaca airport on Cyprus' southern
coast, Moses underlined the need for compromise on both sides of
the island.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is the art of compromise -- that's the purpose of
negotiations, and that's why the parties are going to Geneva on
July 5," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiation is never a 'sum-zero' game where one side receives
all and the other side nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Moses, who is accompanied by
State Department Cyprus coordinator Tomas Weston, will have
separate meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkish invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have held two rounds of indirect talks
under the United Nations' auspices in an effort to pave the way for
substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement on
the Cyprus issue. However, no significant progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has been demanding that the talks be
aimed to set up a confederation of two states in Cyprus, contrary
to U.N. resolutions and two agreements reached between the two
sides in the 1970s stipulating for a bizonal, bicommunal
federation.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government rejects the idea and sticks to the
resolving of the Cyprus issue under the bizonal, bicommunal
formula.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared in 1983 a breakaway state in
northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Budget Surplus Forecast of 1.87 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday predicted the U.S. budget surplus will reach 1.87 trillion
U.S. dollars over the next decade and offered to use some of the
money to cut taxes for married couples if Congress enacts a
prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The budget projection, one trillion dollars higher than
estimated for the 2001-2010 period four months ago, provides a
windfall that the Democratic White House and the Republican-led
Congress are already fighting over ahead of the November 7
election.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the huge increase in the projected surplus,
which was forecast at 746 billion dollars in February, reflected
the booming U.S. economy, and it also boosted growth forecasts for
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the figures, Clinton dangled the carrot of 250
billion dollars in tax relief to reduce the so-called "marriage
penalty" paid by two-income married couples, a long-standing
Republican goal, if Congress approved an elderly prescription drug
benefit of roughly the same size.
</P>
<P>
While crowing over the new surplus forecasts, Clinton cautioned
that the money might not actually materialize and argued that the
government should therefore not commit to spending all of it or
return all of it to the public through tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it would be a big mistake to commit this entire
surplus to spending or to tax cuts," he said. "The projections
could be wrong, they could be right. That's why we shouldn't spend
it all now."
</P>
<P>
The new 1.87-trillion-dollar surplus projection excluded Social
Security. With Social Security's own surpluses included, the
overall 10-year black ink was being projected at 4.19 trillion
dollars, a Democratic official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants to save the entire Social Security surplus of 2.3
trillion dollars over 10 years and devote it to paying down the
public debt.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the new budget projections, and the
dedication of some of the new surplus to debt reduction, would
allow the government to pay off its debt by 2012, a year earlier
than forecast in February.
</P>
<P>
Of the 5.7-trillion-dollar national debt, Clinton would pay off
the 3.5 trillion dollars held by the public. The remaining 2.2
trillion dollars is money the government owes its own trust funds
for Social Security and other programs.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore wants a 500-billion-dollar tax cut and
more spending for Social Security, health, schools and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
George W. Bush, the presumed Republican nominee for president,
wants to use 1.3 trillion dollars of the surplus for a tax cut and
more of it for debt reduction and shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The fresh projections were put forward as part of the annual
midsession review of the budget, which also forecast stronger
growth than predicted in February as well as higher inflation than
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
The review predicted gross domestic product growth at 3.9
percent this year and 3.2 percent next, up from the 2.9 percent
and 2.6 percent predicted with the February budget submission.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index, on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter
basis, was forecast at 3.2 percent in 2000, up from the 2.3
percent estimated in February.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Against Arms Sales to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China said here Monday that
it is firmly opposed to the attempt by certain countries to make
arms sales to Taiwan, a Chinese province, saying that such sales
not only jeopardizes China's sovereignty and security, but also
poses a threat to the peace and security in Asia and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
plenary meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission (UNDC)
, which opened here Monday and will end in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"China is firmly opposed to the attempts by certain countries
to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other
countries by means of arms sales," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," he said. "This has
been recognized by the international community."
</P>
<P>
"However, certain countries, in disregard of this fact, have
been selling large amount of advanced weapons to Taiwan," he said.
"This action violates the principle of respecting national
sovereignty and territorial integrity as enshrined in the U.N.
Charter."
</P>
<P>
"It not only jeopardizes China's sovereignty and security, but
also poses a threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
This goes against the spirit of the confidence-building
measures (CBMs), and "We demand countries concerned stop this
wrong practice as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
China is of the view that there is only one China in the world,
the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only
legitimate government of China, representing all Chinese,
including people in Taiwan, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China.

ATHENS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The left-wing political parties in
Greece Monday urged the Greek government to take immediate
measures to combat the growing narcotics problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
In messages marking Monday's International Anti-Drug Day, the
Communist Party of Greece (KKE) said that it was struggling to
create a wider social movement that would fight the causes of the
problem, and founded its policy on prevention and cure, as well as
rehabilitation.

<P>
The Coalition of the Left and Progress (SYN) Monday also
called for drastic reinforcement of the detoxification communities
and the speedy establishment of more such programs.
</P>
<P>
To show their opposition to the use of drugs, about 400
teenagers of a rehabilitation center and their parents marched
through Athens Monday while a concert was hosted by Greece's
Health Ministry, with cooperation of a drug rehabilitation center.
</P>

In the southern Greek island of Crete, police Monday uprooted
650 cannabis trees in the region of Krasi near the town of Malia.

<HEADLINE> China: Hegemonism, Power Politics Hampering Progress in World Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China said here Monday that
international arms control and disarmament efforts have suffered
some serious setbacks as hegemonism and power politics are still
hampering the establishment of a just and rational new
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the remarks at the two-week plenary meeting
of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which opened here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The world is far from being tranquil," he said. "The old
security concept and the Cold War mentality, based on military
alliance and build-up of armaments, still linger on, posing a
serious threat to international peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
"Hegemonism and power politics are still hampering the
establishment of a just and rational new international political
and economic order," he said. "Against such a backdrop,
international arms control and disarmament efforts have suffered
some serious setbacks."
</P>
<P>
"A certain country refused to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), casting doubt over the treaty's prospect
of entry-into-force," he said. "Ironically, this country pushed
very hard the negotiation and conclusion of the treaty."
</P>
<P>
"The very same country, in disregard of strong international
opposition, is intensifying its efforts to develop national and
theater missile defense systems to the detriment of global
strategic equilibrium and regional stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This country even threatened to withdraw from the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) that underpins international
arms control effort," he said. "The strong momentum emerging in
the field of international disarmament after the end of the Cold
War has been severely weakened. People are worrying about the
future course of disarmament efforts."
</P>
<P>
The United States is under strong fire in the international
community for its efforts to speed up research on the missile
defense systems and its plan for their future deployment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Bill Gives More Power to Secret Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House approved a bill
by voice vote Monday to authorize more powers for the U.S. Secret
Service to investigate threats against former presidents and their
families.
</P>
<P>
The bill also gives the agency more authority to probe imminent
threats against the immediate family of major presidential and
vice-presidential candidates and some foreign dignities.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, the Treasury Department will be allowed
to set up a National Threat Assessment Center where the Secret
Service can share its expertise with state and local law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service will also have the power to coordinate
security for events of national significance such as summit
meetings with the permission of the president and obtain limited
administrative subpoenas for information needed when there has
been a threat against a protected person.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Republican Representative Bill
McCollum from Florida, is in part a response to a 1994 law that
terminates Secret Service protection for presidents 10 years after
they leave office. The bill now goes to the Senate for approval.

<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Election
Observer Mission Monday said violence and intimidation during the
pre-election period in Zimbabwe must be condemned.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU mission Pierre Schori said in an interim report
that serious defects in the electoral process, particularly in
regard to the voters' roll and lack of transparency of the
electoral authorities, must be resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of international observers had a calming
and stabilizing effect.
</P>
<P>
The overall assessment of the polling, he said, was highly
positive with presiding officers and their staff competent and
efficient.
</P>
<P>
He said there were serious problems with the voters' roll, and
as a result a number of eligible voters were unable to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Political Adviser to the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Front-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) Jonathan Moyo dismissed the EU's
assessment, saying it was not representative of the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Opposition Leader Detained for Attending Berlin Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRNA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Iranian opposition
leader was detained on Monday by the Islamic revolution court for
attending a controversial political conference on Iran in Germany
in April.
</P>
<P>
Branch 3 of the Islamic revolution court in Tehran issued
temporary arrest warrant for Ezzatollah Sahabi, member of the
Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI), for taking part in the Berlin
conference, Tehran Justice Department was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The department said Sahabi was summoned to court for questioning
about the classified letters found from the houses of some
participants of the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
Sahabi was suspected of having links with other participants in
the Berlin conference, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sahabi, a supporter of the reformist policies of President
Mohammad Khatami, had been summoned to court for attending the
conference, held on April 7-9 by the German Heinrich Boell
Foundation, on Iran after the February parliamentary elections. But
he was set free on bail then.
</P>
<P>
Iran's powerful conservatives have strongly condemned the
conference, attended by a dozen reformist allies of Khatami, as "
anti-Islamic" and accused the reformists of advocating "U.S.-style
reforms in Iran," which the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
strongly rejected.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated courts have arrested at least six
participants of the conference but released some of them on bail.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Two Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were injured
when U.S. and British warplanes bombed civilian installations in
southern Iraq Sunday morning, a military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at 8:45 (0445 GMT) on Sunday, U.S. and
British planes bombed targets inside the southern Thi-Qar province.
</P>
<P>
The two injured, identified as 10-year-old Yasamein Aoda Aziz
and 18-year-old Hashimia Aoda Aziz, were taken to a nearby hospital
for emergency treatment, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Thi-Qar province is one of the seven provinces covered in the
southern no-fly zone, set up by the U.S.-led Western allies after
the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the Shiite
Muslims from persecution of the troops of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
A similar air exclusion zone was also set up in northern Iraq to
allegedly protect the Kurds population there.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UAE Keen to Help Iraqi People: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A major daily of the United Arab
Emirates on Monday commented on the reopening of Iraq's embassy
here, saying that the step was a reciprocal one which indicates the
UAE has great concern "over the plight of Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
There was a dire need to help the innocent Iraqi people, who are
suffering from the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of neighboring Iraq, said the Dubai-based "Gulf News."
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that more than 2 million people, including
half a million children, have reportedly lost their lives as a
result of the sanctions, adding the UAE was one of a growing number
of countries that are demanding a lifting of these crippling
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This necessitates an open diplomatic channel in order to
facilitate humanitarian assistance for them, the paper said, with
the proper establishment of relations with Iraq, the UAE will prove
its commitment to aiding Iraqi people in need.
</P>
<P>
The UAE reopened its embassy in Baghdad on April 20, ending a
decade of diplomatic freeze. Iraq is to reopen its embassy here in
the coming few days, according to the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's acting charge d'affaires, Abdul Razak Hamoudi Ahmed,
presented his letter of credentials to UAE Foreign Ministry's
Undersecretary Saif Saeed bin Saed here on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan
was one of the first leaders to call for the lifting of sanctions,
because they were hurting the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that the UAE has been in the forefront of
humanitarian aid to Iraq to help the population, which has been hit
hard by sanctions and by American and British bombings, the paper
added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Meets Hezbollah Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on
Monday hold unprecedented face-to-face talks with Hassan Nasrallah,
secretary general of the guerrilla group Hezbollah, in the wake of
Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud highly praised the sacrifice of Hezbollah in its fighting
against Israelis occupation, and stressed that Lebanon will never
abandon a single inch of its territory.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Shiite Muslim militant group
backed by Iran and Syria in spearheading a war of attrition that
drove out the Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel pulled out all its troops from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending 22 years of occupation there, under pressure of growing
casualties caused by guerrillas attacks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in the Baabda Palace, Lahoud said that the
solidarity of Lebanese people is the secret of victory over
Israel. "We will try our best to consolidate this solidarity and
maintain our good relationship will resistance," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah told a news conference after the talk that he and the
president talked about the cooperation and harmonious relationship
between Hezbollah and the government. "Our talks also focused on
the reconstruction and development in the liberated south," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The talks underscore the closeness and mutual confidence
between the Lahoud regime and Hezbollah's resistance movement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting remolds relations between Lebanese government
and Hezbollah at the highest official level, despite U.S. and
Israeli accusation that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah has never visited the presidential palace before,
although Hezbollah's members of parliament have often called on
Lahoud at the palace to discuss consolidation of cooperation
between Lebanese army and the group during the guerrilla war
against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Anti-drug Regional Meeting Held in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Deputy Secretary General Pino
Arlacchi on Monday called on Western and Central Asian countries
to "urgently" start a campaign against the production and
trafficking of drugs, which have reached a "dangerous level".
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi, also the executive director of the U.N. Office for
Drug Control and Crime Prevention, made the appeal in a statement
at a meeting on regional drugs problems, held by the U.N.
Subcommission for Drugs Trafficking and Related Problems in the
Near and Middle East, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 30 regional countries and of countries and
international organizations in observers' status participated in
the meeting, which kicked off Monday in Antalya in southern Turkey
to run through June 30.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi noted that opium production in Afghanistan, a major
opium producer of the world, had reached a record level of 4,600
tons annually. Moreover, the volatile Central Asian country has
also been able to produce heroin recently.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that drugs and crimes go hand in hand, Arlacchi
underlined the fact that farmers accepting to produce raw material
for drugs often become bound by illegal organizations and terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
He said terrorist groups usually spend the income of drug
smuggling on the purchase of weapons.
</P>
<P>
About 60-80 percent of the drugs smuggled to the European
continent was supplied by or transported via Central Asia,
participants of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran are of major importance in the fight against
this crime due to their significant geographical locations on the
drug trafficking routes.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day meeting, the participants are expected to
discuss ways to increase cooperation against the smuggling of
narcotics, measures that governments have to take against this
crime and means to prevent corruption and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Condemn Visit by Algerian Journalists to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An Arab organization of journalists
on Monday condemned a visit paid by a group of Algerian journalists
to Israel, the first of its kind, and said that they should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Federation of Arab Journalists (FAJ) denounced
the visit as a violation of its resolutions which opposes
normalization steps with Israel before a just and comprehensive
peace is realized in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The journalists who have not adhered to the boycott should be
punished, said a statement released by the federation, which groups
the journalists' unions of all Arab countries. But it did not
specify the punishment.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed the federation's belief that most of the
Algerian people are opposed to normalization with Israel at the
current stage when it still occupies Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian journalists and a number of academics began the
groundbreaking visit to Israel Monday with a meeting with Foreign
Minister David Levy. The Algerians have been invited by the Israeli
Foreign Ministry. The Algerian government was reportedly aware of
the trip.

<HEADLINE> UAE Takes First in Economic Growth Among GCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1999 reached four percent, topping the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, said a report issued Monday by
the Muscat-based Gulf Organization for Industrial Consultancy
(GOIC).
</P>
<P>
The other GCC countries also witnessed a notable improvement in
their gross domestic product (GDP), due to the rise of oil prices
in the world market, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The UAE was followed by Oman with 3.7 percent growth in GDP,
Bahrain with 3.2 percent, Saudi Arabia with 1.8 percent, Qatar with
1.3 percent and Kuwait with 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report issued recently by the Emirates' central
bank said that the UAE's GDP rose in 1999 to 190 billion dirhams
(51.9 billion U.S. dollars). 
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise to the increase in the revenues
of crude and manufacturing industries. 
</P>
<P>
Non-oil products contributed 147 billion dirhams (40.16 billion
dollars), or 74.4 percent of the GDP, whereas it contributed 137
billion dirhams (37.43 billion US dollars), or 79.2 percent, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's per capital income increased by 3.9 percent from
62,400 dirhams (17,049.18 dollars) in 1998 to 64,800 dirhams (17,
704.92 dollars) in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus in trade balance surged from only 2 billion dirhams
(546.45 million dollars) in 1998 to 12.4 billion dirhams (3.3
billion dollars) in 1999 due to the rise of the dirham exchange
rate against currencies of all UAE's leading trade partners, except
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Announce Completion of Working Draft of Human Genome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists involved in the publicly funded Human Genome Project
and at the private company Celera Genomics Inc., announced the
historic achievement, which is regarded as important as an man's
walking on the moon. The announcement was made at the Capitol
Hilton Hotel at Washington.
</P>
<P>
Francis Collins, chief scientist of the Human Genome Project,
which was launched in 1990, said that they have completed a "
working draft" of the human genome, which contains the genetic
sequence of an estimated 90 percent of the sequence arranged in
near perfect order on a genetic map.
</P>
<P>
Craig Venter, president and chief science officer of Celera
said scientists of his company has assembled the 3.5 billion
letters of genetic code into their natural order.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, joined at the White House
announcement by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, hailed
completion of the work, calling it "a day for the ages."
</P>
<P>
The genetic blueprint of the human body is like a string of
letters representing the four substances that make up every gene:
adenine, thymine, guanine and cystosine, referred to simply as A,
T, G and C.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that knowing the sequence of letters that make
up all DNA in humans opens an era in which the most fundamental
causes of disease can be understood and targeted treatments can be
developed.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project is an international consortium
supported mostly by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the
Wellcome Trust, a philanthropic organization based in London.
Celera Genomics Inc. is a private company based in Rockville,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The ten-year effort involved thousands of scientists from
United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France and China and cost
nearly three billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After completing the draft map of human chromosomes, scientists
will turn their work to annotation: learning the function of every
gene and how genes relate to one another.
</P>
<P>
"The real work begins," Dr. Francis Collins said. "There is a
very long list of things that we can do, all of which will greatly
benefit medicine."
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe eventually medicine will be able to identify
from birth the diseases that a person may develop and to provide
treatment to extend life and health beyond what was ever possible
before.

LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The financial health of Britain's
least profitable companies is weaker now than it was during the
last recession, according to new Bank of England research.
</P>
<P>
The research, carried in the Bank's Financial Stability Review,

It showed while the top 10 percent of highly geared companies
have seen gearing surge to levels not seen for at least a quarter

other end.

The research found that profitability for the weaker firms is
lower now than at any time in the last 25 year.Even worse, many
companies are burdened with heavy borrowings.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the broadly favorable outlook for the corporate sector
as a whole, the least profitable companies in 1998 were much less
profitable than the least-profitable companies in the recessions
of the early 1980s and early 1990s," the research concluded.
</P>
<P>
It added: "These results imply that the downside risks facing
creditors of the corporate sector may have been greater in recent
years than suggested by aggregate corporate performance alone."

BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's anti-trust
authorities on Monday raided the KPN Telecom NV to investigate
whether the leading Dutch telecoms company was involved in a
possible price cartel.

HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri Monday appealed to Zimbabweans to remain calm
and not to speculate on the election results.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the press conference here that enough
police had been deployed throughout the country to maintain law
and order.
</P>
<P>
"Some people may become over-excited and start spreading
rumors, causing problems," he said, adding: "We have deployed
enough police to ensure that those who do not accept the outcome
of the election are forced to do so."
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said that they have put
in place contingency security measures countrywide to deal with
any form of post- election violence which may occur after the
announcement of the parliamentary election results.
</P>
<P>
He said that police had mounted road blocks at Harare's major
roads to prevent the bussing of political supporters who may
trigger violence while celebrating.
</P>
<P>
"We are not sure of what the situation will be like after the
election results are announced," he said. "Groups of more than
10 people will be dispersed. The situation is still calm as of
now."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ruling Party Denies Government's Contacts With Rebels Angolan ruling party has denied the existence of any </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Angolan ruling
party has denied any government's contacts with high-ranking
officials of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), the official news agency Angop reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan government is not negotiating on anything" with
rebels, said Joao Lourenco, secretary-general of the People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), who is now paying a visit to
the central Province of Kwanza-sul.
</P>
<P>
According to Lourenco, the mentioned rumor was aimed at testing
the attitude of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lourenco admitted the existence of the appeal made
by Angolan President Jose dos Santos for pardoning all the rebel
soldiers who would lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also reiterated Angola's refusal to
attend the summit of the Organization of the African Unity (OAU)
scheduled for July in Lome, the capital of Togo, saying that the
absence of Angola in Lome is in accordance with the consistent
defense of its principles.
</P>
<P>
If Angola participates in the conference, he said, it will
disagree with the report by the U.N. Angola Sanction Committee,
which accused some European and African countries, including Togo,
of giving logistic support to the Angolan rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi.

<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An Irish court on Monday ordered to
postpone the trial of former Irish prime minister Charles Haughey
on charges of obstructing a government inquiry into payments to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, the capital city of Ireland, a Criminal Court judge
said there was a real or substantial risk that Haughey would not
receive a fair trial, a Reuters report from Dublin quoted the
Irish state broadcaster as saying.
</P>
<P>
Haughey, 74, who served as Irish prime minister four times
between 1979 and 1992, is accused of obstructing the 1997
McCracken Tribunal into payments to politicians from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
It is accused that Haughey received some 1.3 million Irish
pounds(about 1.54 million U.S.dollars) in donations from a tycoon
friend between 1987 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, it was concluded that there did not appear to be any
political impropriety relating to the payments on the part of
Haughey.
</P>
<P>
Tribunals are being widely used to probe corruption allegations
in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Headed by a senior judge, they have the power to force
witnesses to give evidence and ultimately produce a report and
recommendations which can then give rise to civil or criminal
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Rebound in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes posted
a surprise 4.3 percent increase in May following a 6.2 percent
decrease in the previous month, the National Association of
Realtors reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The May advance pushed existing-home sales to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.09 million units from a rate of 4.88
million sales in April, suggesting that despite rising interest
rates, the housing market remains strong.
</P>
<P>
Housing analysts said the strength in May in part reflected the
fact that more homes than normal were put on the market in March
and April after strong demand in earlier months had pushed the
inventory of unsold homes to a record low.
</P>
<P>
"Many buyers were frustrated in early spring because there
simply weren't enough homes on the market," said Dennis R. Cronk,
the president of the Realtors group. "Many homes listed in March
and April received quick offers, resulting in a higher number of
transactions closed in May."
</P>
<P>
The sales jump came as a surprise to many economists who had
been expecting home resales would be unchanged or even dip
slightly as the housing market cooled under the impact of six
interest rate increases over the past year by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was scheduled to meet Tuesday and Wednesday
with economists predicting Fed officials will decide to leave
rates unchanged this time, preferring to wait to see if the rate
increases already implemented will work as intended to slow
economic activity enough to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
For May, sales were up in all regions of the country, led by a
7.5 percent rise in the Midwest, where home resales climbed to an
annual rate of 1.15 million units.
</P>
<P>
Sales were up 3.9 percent in the West to an annual rate of 1.34
million units. In the South, sales rose 3.6 percent to an annual
rate of 1.99 million units and the Northeast saw sales rise by 1.7
percent to an annual rate of 610,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The median sales price, the price where half the homes sold for
more and half for less, was 137,200 U.S. dollars in May, up 3.3
percent from April. The average sales price rose by 5.5 percent to
176,600 dollars.

<HEADLINE> No Death Penalty for Accused Iranian Jews: Iranian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Justice Department of
Iran's southern Fars Province Hossein Ali Amiri said on Monday that
the 13 Iranian Jews accused of espionage for Israel will not face
the death penalty, and the final verdict for them is expected on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are only accused of "acts against the national
security" and the charge of "mohareb" (waging war against God and
the country) has been dropped, hence they would not face the
capital punishment, the official announced, actually repeating what
he said last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His remarks contradict those of Prosecutor-General Ayatollah
Morteza Moghtadai who said on Sunday that the accused may receive
the death penalty since they have confessed to spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The final verdict will be issued on July 1, which will involve
the 13 Jews along with four Muslims charged with the same offenses,
Amiri was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Altogether eight Muslims have been accused of spying, but Amiri
said the case for the other four of them is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the likelihood of some of the accused being
acquitted, saying that it depends on the decision of the presiding
judge.
</P>
<P>
Court hearings for the accused Jews started on April 13 in
Shiraz, capital of Fars Province. So far at least eight of them
have reportedly confessed to passing on classified information to
Israel and having connections with Israel's security service.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were arrested in Shiraz in March 1999. Resisting
Western pressure to release them, Iran has maintained their arrest
had nothing to do with their religious background and no foreign
countries should interfere in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's All Business Community Sectors to Be United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- All sectors of business
community in Singapore will soon be united in a single federation,
according to Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Singapore Federation of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (SFCCI) Annual Luncheon Monday, Yeo said
that SFCCI has taken a bold move and decided to create the
Singapore Business Federation (SBF) which will represent
Singapore's private sector, both locally and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was made in line with Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong's suggestion to transform the SFCCI into the apex
representative body of the private sector in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The government therefore welcomes your plan to restructure
SFCCI and strengthen it," Yeo said, adding "A strong business
federation will articulate more effectively the needs of
entrepreneurs in Singapore, big and small."
</P>
<P>
On the role SBF will play, Yeo said that SBF will represent
Singapore in the international arena and to speak for the entire
business community in Singapore with one voice when dealing with
the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeo's paraphrase, Domestically, SBF should help
to strengthen the links between government and the private sector,
improve further the pro-enterprise environment, play a role in
shaping national plans, provide enterprises with better support
services and help them to improve their business practices.
</P>
<P>
Abroad, SBF should strengthen Singapore's links with other
governments and business communities through bilateral exchanges
and participation in multilateral forum. In addition, it should
enlist the help of its multinational company members to expand
Singapore's business interest overseas and take the lead in
representing Singapore's private sector at multilateral forums.
</P>
<P>
On funding to the need of SBF, Yeo said the collection of an
annual levy from the top companies in Singapore has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal for the business levy to be limited to the top 5
to 10 percent of companies in Singapore, on some kind of scale, so
as not to burden the smaller enterprises, is a reasonable one," he
added.
</P>
<P>
SFCCI, which currently is a low-profile and low-budget body,
groups the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce and the
country's four ethnic-based chambers, namely the Singapore Chinese
Chamber of Commerce &AMP; Industry, the Singapore Indian Chamber of
Commerce &AMP; Industry, the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce &AMP;
Industry and Singapore Confederation of Industries.
</P>
<P>
When SFCCI becomes the new boy, it will take within its ambit
powerful groups that had gone their own independent ways, such as
the Singapore National Employers Federation, Association of Banks
in Singapore and Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Two other leading business associations, the Singapore Shipping
Association and the Singapore information Technology Federation,
are also expected to be among the SBF's 10 founding members.

<HEADLINE> Inspectors Satisfied over IRA Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two international statesmen
appointed to inspect Irish Republican Arms (IRA) arms dumps said
on Monday that they were satisfied that weapons have been secured.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Northern Ireland's International Independent
Decommissioning Commission, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari
said they have been "shown a substantial quantity of IRA arms,
including explosives".
</P>
<P>
They added they "have ensured the weapons are secure and cannot
be used without their becoming aware that this has happened".
</P>
<P>
The two men met British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Downing
Street on Monday morning to update him on what they had seen.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting,Blair said the inspections represented "a
very substantial further step along the road to a lasting peace".
</P>
<P>
He added that although there was still a long way to go in the
political process, Northern Ireland "has never had a better
prospect than it has had today".
</P>
<P>
The inspections report was presented after the IRA released a
statement on Monday saying some of its arms dumps had been
inspected and it had renewed contact with the decommissioning body.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors said in their report: "All our requests were
satisfactorily met. We plan to re-inspect the arms dumps on a
regular basis to ensure that the weapons have remained secure."
</P>
<P>
"The process that led to the first inspection visit and the way
in which it was carried out makes us believe that this is a
genuine effort by the IRA to advance the peace process," they
added.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the IRA said that the dumps inspected"
contained a substantial amount of material including weapons,
explosives and other equipment".
</P>
<P>
The IRA agreed in May to allow the two international inspectors
to verify that some of their arms dumps were secure as part of the
package of proposals to reinstate Northern Ireland devolution and
the power-sharing executive.

<HEADLINE> British Peacekeepers in Kosovo Accused of Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- British Ministry of Defense said on
Monday that four British peacekeepers in Yugoslavia have been
accused of stealing money and valuables from ethnic Albanian
civilians at a checkpoint in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The four soldiers, on duty in the international peacekeeping
force in the southern Yugoslav province of kosovo, have been
separated and assigned to other duties.
</P>
<P>
"Because it was a four-man patrol and an allegation was made
that money and effects were stolen, they are all under
investigation," a spokesman in the defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't know yet whether it's one or more that actually
are being accused," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the soldiers "would be dealt with quite severely"
if the allegations proved true.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian civilians claimed that the soldiers took mobile
phones, cameras and up to 10,000 pounds (about 15,000 U.S. dollars)
worth of Deutschemarks at a checkpoint in Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Military Police special investigation branch was looking
into the case, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Revenue Services Fail to Erase Gap in Financial Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESUBR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Revenue
Services (SARS) remains unable to reconcile a discrepancy of 413
million rand (about 61 million U.S. dollars) in its financial
records due to problems in its accounting system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Parliament's watchdog Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) on Monday, SARS operational manager Andrew Fisher said the
funds could only be reconciled once the problems were corrected.
</P>
<P>
If the funds were found to have arisen from an over-collection
of taxes, the taxpayers would be refunded, Fishe was quoted by the
South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The funds would remain in SARS' bank account until that stage.
</P>
<P>
SARS has blamed the discrepancy on problems associated with the
 organizations transformation from a cash to accrual basis of
accounting.
</P>
<P>
PAC's chairman Gavin Woods expressed concern at SARS' apparent
 inability to cope with the transformation of its systems.
</P>
<P>
"The non-compliance of basic accounting principles... indicates
gross financial irresponsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not acceptable that all accounting problems be
blamed on the transformation process.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on International Situation, China's Domestic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 26 (Xinhua) -- It's the views of the Chinese people
that the people of a country will decide what system the country
will set up and what path the country will take, Li Peng, Chairman
of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (
NPC), said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with President of the Ukrainian TV "New Channel,
" Aleksander Tkachenko, the top Chinese legislator elaborated on
the international situation and China's domestic polices.
</P>
<P>
The situation of the world is a focus of discussion of the
international community at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question raised by Tkachenko that there is a
prediction that China and the United States will become the two
polars of the world in the future, Li said he doesn't agree with
this point of view, as such a prediction goes against the reality
as well as the trends of development of the world.
</P>
<P>
China has always welcomed multipolarity and does not favor a
bipolar world or a unipolar world, since multipolarity is
beneficial to world peace and development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that China is still a developing country with a
population of 1.25 billion and a weak economic foundation and will
have to make long-term persisting efforts to build the country
into a moderately developed country in the mid-21st century.
</P>
<P>
Politically, China is opposed to hegemonism and is not after
hegemonism, and will never practice hegemonism even after it
becomes powerful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that some people deliberately exaggerate the strength
of China and spread the allegation of so-called "China threat."
Actually, these people do not wish China to become powerful, and
their assertion that China will become one of the world's two
polars is similar to the formulation of "China threat."
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic policies, Li said China's policies of
making economic development its central task, adopting reform and
open-up, practicing socialist market economy and ruling the
country by law are all summation of the people's practical
experience and embody the fundamental interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has found the road of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and practice has proved that China
has embarked on the right path.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Sunday for a three-day official goodwill visit
to Ukraine, the last leg of his six-nation tour. He has already
visited Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia and Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Ukrainian Counterpart on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), met here
Monday with Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, Ivan
Plyushch, on bilateral ties, cooperation between the two
parliaments and the international situation.
</P>
<P>
Extending his warm welcome to Li, Plyushch said Li's visit here
marks a major event in the course of Ukrainian-Chinese relations
of recent years.
</P>
<P>
Noting the frequent exchanges between the two parliaments,
Plyushch said China's achievements in all fields had left him a
deep impression when he visited the country. A NPC friendship
group also visited Ukraine not long ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator stressed such exchanges are indispensable in
promoting the overall development of Ukrainian-Chinese relations.
Many senior professionals in the Ukrainian parliament can also
help cement bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Li appreciated the traditional profound friendship
between Ukraine and China, regarding it as a wealth in the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established the diplomatic ties in 1992,
bilateral relations have developed in all areas and affluent
fruits yielded in cooperation in politics, economy, science and
technology, culture and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China attaches great importance to Sino-Ukrainian
relations. The two countries have no conflict of interests but
enjoy the same and similar stands on many international and
regional issues. They support and cooperate with each other on
the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his gratitude and appreciation for Ukraine's right
stand and its support to China on the issues of human rights,
Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Plyushch held a welcome banquet in honor of Li Peng and his
wife Zhu Lin after the talks.

<HEADLINE> Slovak President in Critical Health Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The health condition of Slovak
President Rudolf Schuster has worsened with both pneumonia and
problems with blood coagulability, according to reports from the
Czech news agency.
</P>
<P>
The state has not changed since this morning, said Josef
Leikert, a presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Schuster is still connected to the
respirator and under intensive treatment with antibiotics.
However, he added that the intestines, where a hole was discovered,
had started to function properly again.
</P>
<P>
Schuster was hospitalized on June 14 with a high fever.
Doctors examined the president and found a puncture in his colon.
Then Schuster underwent two "life-saving" emergency operations,
the first for his gut and the second for a massive abdominal
infection.
</P>
<P>
Schuster's condition temporarily improved on Sunday but then
deteriorated again. Doctors performed tracheotomy on him to
relieve the difficulty in breathing. They indicated that
Schuster's life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
Three Czech specialists from the team looking after President
Vaclav Havel and Havel's personal doctor Ilja Kotik are reportedly
to be in Bratislava to help Slovak colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Schuster, 66, was elected president last year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Launches Joint Report on Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
launched here Monday a joint report by four major international
organizations calling on both developing and industrialized
countries to implement their commitments to attack the root causes
of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"During the 1990s, United Nations world conferences set major
goals for economic and social development," said Annan at a
ceremony in the Palais des Nations. "All countries, developed and
developing alike, signed on to this agenda, often at the highest
political level."
</P>
<P>
He said that the collaborative report, co-authored by the U.N.,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the
International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, had provided some
answers to questions including whether the world had made good on
these commitments.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time ever that the four main international
bodies concerned with development have together reviewed progress
towards the internationally agreed goals for reducing extreme
poverty, and have articulated a common vision of the way forward,
according to the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Major points of the report, entitled "A Better World for All,"
include:
</P>
<P>
-- As growth increased in the mid-1990s, the proportion of
people living on less than one U.S. dollar a day fell rapidly in
Asia, but little or not at all in Africa. Income inequality
remains a barrier to progress in Latin America;
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100 million children will not be in school in 2015,
if current trends prevail;
</P>
<P>
-- The gender gap in primary and secondary enrollment is
narrowing, but not fast enough to reach the goal of eliminating
gender disparities in schools by 2005;
</P>
<P>
-- For every country that has decreased infant and under-five
child mortality rates fast enough to reach the goals, 10 lagged
behind and another one moved backwards, often because of HIV/AIDS;
</P>
<P>
-- Skilled care during pregnancy and delivery can do much to
avoid may of the half million maternal deaths each year;
</P>
<P>
-- During the 1990s, the use of contraception increased in all
regions, but Africa lagged behind;
</P>
<P>
-- By 1997, fewer than half the countries in the world had
strategies for environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacles to success, according to the report, are
inadequate policies, human rights abuses, conflicts, natural
disasters, HIV/AIDS, inequities in come, education and access to
health care, as well as unequal opportunities between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that developing countries' efforts to improve
conditions for their citizens are seriously hampered by a lack of
access to global markets, the debt burden, a decline in
development assistance, and inconsistencies in donor policies.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that there is no single solution to achieving the
goals, the report finds that greater commitment from both
developing and developed countries, as well as stronger voices and
more choices for the poor, can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is part of the solution, but not a guarantee in
itself, according to the report. Also important is more
investment in basic social services which can produce greater pay-
offs in terms of development, as well as ensuring that the
benefits of economic progress reach the poorest people.
</P>
<P>
It believes that openness to trade, technology and knowledge,
and the capacity to use it can also stimulate progress for the
poorest.

<HEADLINE> Working Draft of Human Genome Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A publicly funded project and a
private research center are to announce here on Monday noon that
they have finished decoding the human gonome -- a milestone in the
exploration of life.
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in the publicly funded Human Genome Project
and at the private company Celera Genomics Inc., are to announce
the historic achievement, which is regarded as important as an
man's walking on the moon. The announcement will be made at the
Capitol Hilton Hotel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Francis Collins, chief scientist of the Human Genome Project,
which was launched in 1990, said before the announcement that they
have completed a "working draft" of the human genome, which
contains the genetic sequence of an estimated 90 percent of the
sequence arranged in near perfect order on a genetic map.
</P>
<P>
Craig Venter, president and chief science officer of Celera
said scientists of his company has assembled the 3.5 billion
letters of genetic code into their natural order.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, joined at the White House announcement by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, hailed completion of the work, calling
it "a day for the ages."
</P>
<P>
"Today we are learning the language in which God created life,"
Clinton said, "We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity,
the beauty, the wonder of God's most divine and sacred gift."
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project is an international consortium
supported mostly by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the
Wellcome Trust, a philanthropic organization based in London.
Celera Genomics Inc. is a private company based in Rockville,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year effort involved thousands of scientists from United
States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France and China and cost nearly
three billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After completing the draft map of human chromosomes, scientists
will turn their work to annotation: learning the function of every
gene and how genes relate to one another.

LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina Hingis of
Switzerland and fifth-seeded American Venus Williams won in women'
s singles first round at the Wimbledon tennis championships here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both won in straight sets, with Hingis pulling off a 6-1, 6-2
victory over Spaniard Angeles Montolio while Williams beating
Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-1.

<P>
By winning the match, Hingis avoided a repeat of her 1999
Wimbledon humilation where he was defeated in the first round by
Australian qualifier Jelena Dokic.

<P>
Montolio was apparently no match for Hingis, except in the
final game where she saved seven match points.
</P>
<P>
Hingis no faces China's Yi Jing-Qian, a 6-2, 6-1 winner over
Italian qualifier Giulia Casoni.
</P>
<P>
Williams started her match sluggishly, losing her serve twice
in the first set including her opening service game.
</P>
<P>
But the American kept up the pressure with powerful forehands
which Hrdlickova failed to return time and again.
</P>
<P>
Williams wrapped up the second set in 21 minutes after
Hrdlickova double-faulted on match point.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes International Dunhuang Studies Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, (GANSU), June 26 (Xinhua) -- An international
symposium on Dunhuang studies will be held next month in Dunhuang
of northwest China's Gansu Province to mark the centennial
anniversary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave and the beginning
of Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Institute of Dunhuang Studies announced
today that a series of activities will be held from July 29
through August 3 in both Beijing and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, a Taoist priest, Wang Yuanlu, discovered a cave at the
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang which contained more than 50,000 sutras,
documents and paintings of nearly 10 dynasties from the 4th to the
11th century.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes was included by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on the
World Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars have contributed two-thirds of the 200
academic papers already handed in for the symposium, the largest
event of its kind since the Dunhuang studies was designated a
branch of learning 100 years ago, said Zhang Xiantang, deputy
secretary-general with the Academic Committee of the Institute of
Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
China has become an international center of Dunhuang studies. "
Chinese scholars have built a complete collection of materials in
fields such as Dunhuang-related literature, grotto archaeology,
and grotto art, and now lead the world with their research on the
subjects," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
However, the scholars have not had an easy time developing
Dunhuang studies; the majority of Dunhuang documents are scattered
abroad, therefore Chinese researchers in the 1950s and 1960s had
to resort to micro films bought from countries including the
United States, Britain, France and Japan to complete their studies.
</P>
<P>
China has made universally-acknowledged achievements in
Dunhuang studies since 1970s, with the research being expanded
into a dozen fields including religion, economy, nationalities,
languages, astronomy and medicine. Moreover, a number of
encyclopedias on Dunhuang studies by Chinese researchers have been
published.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Dunhuang Studies, which is based near the
Dunhuang Grottoes, is working with a Hong Kong-based publishing
house on a 30-volume series titled "Collection of Dunhuang
Grottoes." The institute has also published a 22-volume
encyclopedia, "Art of the Dunhuang Grottoes" in cooperation with a
publishing house from east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese grotto protection organizations, led by the Institute
of Dunhuang Studies, have extended the research of Dunhuang
Studies into the natural sciences. The groups have classified the
grottoes, improved renovation technology used for the murals, and
are using advanced techniques to repair grotto cliff cracks and
prevent deterioration of the caves.
</P>
<P>
Many research centers specialize in Dunhuang studies in China.
Universities and specialized research institutions in Dunhuang,
Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou offer advanced
courses in the field. Researchers of Dunhuang studies who are
based in Hong Kong and Taiwan have published lengthy book
collections, including the 140-volume "Dunhuang Treasures."

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Floods have killed nine people
and affected 365,000 others in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The floods have washed away 6,200 houses, devastated eight
counties and more than 7,000 hectares of farmland, resulting in
economic losses of 160 million yuan (about 19.2 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains started to pour in the city of Gangzhou on June 18
and brought about mountain torrents and landslides causing water
levels in rivers to rise.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governor Shu Shengyou has urged officials to take
measures to control floods and safeguard people's lives and
properties.
</P>
<P>
Water in four large reservoirs in the province has risen to an
emergency levels but water in five major rivers in the province is
stable.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters said they are closely monitoring the floods.

<HEADLINE> Manila Maintains Communication With Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government stressed
Monday that communication lines remain open between government
negotiators and the Abu Sayyaf for the release of 20 hostages in
Sulu province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno told
reporters here that the government continues to try to expedite
the release of the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions are continuing. At least even if no formal
meetings are taking place, the lines of communication have
remained open and the process is continuing for the release of the
balance of the hostages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Puno also disclosed that the government is hopeful that
medical missions for the hostages may be allowed to resume in "
next couple of days."
</P>
<P>
Puno said earlier that the government has ruled out the use of
a"final military option" for the safe release of the 20 hostages
still in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend the Abu Sayyaf released Malaysian hostage
Zulkarniam Bin Hashim, which was termed by chief government
negotiator Robert Aventajado as a sign of goodwill on the part of
the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado stressed that no ransom was paid for Bin Hashim's
release. He said he remains optimistic that the Abu Sayyaf would
continue with the negotiations, which recently went through a
cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
Hashim took off Monday afternoon for home at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group is still holding captive three Germans,
two French, two Finns, two South Africans, one Lebanese, eight
other Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf rebels on April 23
from the diving resort of Sipadan in neighboring Malaysia and
taken to Jolo island in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> 41 Die in Philippine Evacuation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said in a statement that 90
percent of the deaths in the evacuation centers were children.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez made the clarification in reaction to published
reports that deaths in evacuations centers in Mindanao have
already reached 92. The same reports tagged the evacuation centers
as "killing fields"themselves.
</P>
<P>
Evacuation centers by definition, Romualdez explained, are
emergency makeshift facilities providing temporary living quarters
for displaced people.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally we can expect overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions
and sometimes even lack of food," he said, even as he assured the
government is addressing the problems.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said the most common illnesses in the evacuation
centers are infectious in nature including diarrhea, skin
infections and respiratory diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Again we do not deny we have a problem, but there are efforts
to keep the evacuation centers more livable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said clashes between government troops and Moro Islamic
Liberation Front rebels have forced about 500,000 civilians in
Mindanao flee their homes since April this year.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Invest 1.5 Billion Dollars In Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens company will
invest 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in Asia by the year 2003, in a bid
to exploit the largest potential market for mobile business
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Mobile business is based on the integration of electronic
business, mobile communications and IP-based networks.
</P>
<P>
The investment plan was announced here today by Rudi Lamprecht,
president of Siemens Information and Communication Mobile Group.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest investment of its kind by Siemens in
Asia. The investment will be used in marketing, research and
development and production facilities in information and mobile
communication areas.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, one billion U.S. dollars will be spent in China,
which is regarded as Asia's biggest market for mobile business
solutions in the future.
</P>
<P>
Siemens and the Chinese Academy of Telecommunications
Technology have jointly developing a new standard for third
generation mobile networks, TD-SCDMA.
</P>
<P>
First trials of TD-SCDMA systems with Chinese mobile network
operators are scheduled to start early next year and commercial
systems are expected to be available at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Siemens recently signed a memorandum of understanding with
China Unicom, the second largest GSM network operator in China.
The partnership foresees close cooperation in the fields of GSM
and intelligent networks as well as in new technologies such as
WAP, GPRS and 3G.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has already forged regional partnerships with
application developers and content providers such as China.com and
Shanghai Online in order to deepen its penetration into the Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
The huge investment is expected to help Siemens to increase its
market share in all mobile technologies in Asia to 15 percent by
the year 2002, from the current eight percent.
</P>
<P>
This will make it possible for the company to reach its goal to
become one of the three largest suppliers of mobile
telecommunication solutions in Asia in the coming two to three
years.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Making a clear and compelling
statement on International Anti-Drug Day today, China executed a
dozen traffickers and publicly burned two tons of confiscated
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The dealers included three from Taiwan, one Hong Kong resident,
two Shanghai heroin dealers and four drug sellers in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province. Some 226 kg of heroin and 1,376 kg of
methamphetemine, known as "ice," were burned in the open air in
Fujian, east China.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Shanghai police have investigated 621
drug cases, nabbed 1,083 suspects and confiscated 48.3 kg of
heroin. Fujian Province in the last five months uncovered 1,370
drug-related cases, involving 795 dealers and 309 kg of drugs.
</P>
<P>
China's modern-day traffickers often use railways to smuggle
drugs, hiding the substances in everything from fruit to tape
recorders and hot pots. Some dealers swallow packets of drugs, or
conceal them in body cavities.
</P>
<P>
From January through May, southwest China's Yunnan Province, a
main drug-dealing base in the country, handled 1,076 drug cases,
sentenced 734 convicted dealers to life in prison or death, and
gave prison terms of up to five years to 525 people.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction is on the rise among China's young people. And
an increasing number of people from overseas have been involved in
drug-related crimes in the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Coalition Saved, for the Time Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- With the fate of a pro-Islamic
partner still undecided and the ties between another two partners
remaining strained, the Turkish coalition government might run into
fresh troubles.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians rejected last Thursday a motion to send
former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to the supreme court on charges
of fraud, withering a crisis for the coalition government. However,
it is widely believed that the life span of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit's three-way cabinet is still a question.
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist Action Party (MHP), Ecevit's far-right coalition
partner, joined the oppositions in calling for a supreme court
trial of Yilmaz, the leader of the coalition's center-right
Motherland Party (ANAP), for graft in land-selling during his term
as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 394 deputies present in the 550-member parliament,
216 voted against the motion.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, the opposition parties, namely, the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP) and the True Path Party (DYP), would
not hesitate to refer Yilmaz to the supreme court on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
But, the specter that former FP Labor Minister Necati Celik and
DYP leader Tansu Ciller are also facing corruption charges made
them willing to conclude a deal with the ANAP and the Democratic
Left Party (DSP), led by Ecevit who prefers to cabinet stability.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the deal between the four parties was working without
a hitch. In Thursday's vote, they joined hands, leaving the MHP
alone in its efforts to refer the leaders of the country's two
leading center-right parties, Yilmaz and Ciller, to the supreme
court.
</P>
<P>
The corruption allegations against Yilmaz will prevent the ANAP
leader from having a place in the cabinet. It was believed to be
one of the steps taken by the MHP to compete with ANAP in case of
an early election.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an early election is real because Turkish
constitutional court will decide whether the pro-Islamic opposition
Virtue Party (FP) is the successor to the defunct Islamic Welfare
Party or not in October.
</P>
<P>
If the court makes a "yes" verdict, the FP will be closed and 70
deputies in the parliament will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, if 5 percent or about 28 of the
550-seat parliament's deputies are absent, the country should be
forced into an early parliamentary election within three months.
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that the MHP and ANAP are trying to damage
each other as a part of their election strategy as the ANAP is
aiming to win the nationalist and conservative votes, wooed also by
the MHP, in the absence of the FP.
</P>
<P>
If the parliament had sent Yilmaz to the supreme court last
week, this would have caused the coalition's collapse. The
coalition has been saved, but for the time being. The ditch between
the two ruling partners will definitely affect the government's
unity.
</P>
<P>
Although the coalition leaders have sent the message that the
government will continue, there is already talk about how long this
may go on.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's vote, Ecevit said that "it would be
difficult for the government to be exactly as it was in the past.
The quarrel will have its psychological effects."
</P>
<P>
Due to the MHP-ANAP tension, the government will obviously
neither be able to make decisions as rapidly as it did last year,
nor work harmoniously because their ministers may refuse to
undersign decrees sponsored by each other, causing a deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Palestinian People May Return to Confrontation Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people may return
to the confrontation option, if negotiations with Israel fail to
notch up their national legitimate goals, a senior Palestinian
official has said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the Palestinian radio, Ahmed Abdel-
Rahman, secretary general of the Palestinian Cabinet, added the
independent Palestinian state will be recognized by the
overwhelming majority of the countries on the first day of its
birth.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian state will demand the international community to
apply the international penalty to Israel in case of its failure to
enforce the international legitimacy, the secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of supporters in the West Bank city of
Nablus, Arafat said on Sunday a statehood can be declared
unilaterally within weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We have a few weeks left ahead of us...the state will be
established with its capital Jerusalem," Arafat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Responding to last week's warnings by Israeli Chief of General
Staff Shaul Mofaz that the army might deploy tanks and helicopters
to put down clashes in the territories if the sides fail to forge a
peace deal by September and the Palestinians unilaterally declare a
state, Arafat said the Palestinians are prepared to fight back if
the Israeli troops use violence against them.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also reminded Israel of past battles that the
Palestinians fought against Israel, such as the seven years of
uprising during the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Eases Ban on Local Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has issued the directive to the Competent
Authority that ban on The Sunder Leader "be lifted with effective
from July 31, 2000 after a period of two months and 10 days," said
a government statement.
</P>
<P>
The president made the decision after considering the
recommendation of the Advisory Committee, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Competent Authority Ariya Rubesinghe on May 22 banned The
Sunday Leader and other publications of the M/s Leader
Publications (Pvt.) Ltd. for six months after several warnings to
obey the censorship laws.
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of the publications had made an appeal to the
Advisory Committee appointed by the president under the Emergency
Regulation seeking the revocation of the prohibition order. The
Advisory Committee thus had recommended to the president that the
six months ban be reduced to three months.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, Sri Lanka slapped censorship on both the local and
foreign media as fighting escalated in the northern Jaffna
peninsula between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who are
engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake their former
stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The government lifted the censorship on the foreign media on
June 5 as government troops had managed to stall the rebel assault.
</P>
<P>
Government officials had said the censorship on the local media
will definitely be lifted before the general elections which must
be held by mid-November.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has expressed confidence in establishing
Free Trade Area (FTA) by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the COMESA communication workshop in
Lusaka on Monday, Assistant Secretary-General Sindiso Ngwenya
said that COMESA will form the largest and the first FTA in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that the full removal of tariff and
non-tariff barriers in COMESA by October 31, 2000 will succeed in
generating business opportunities for all the citizens of COMESA,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same breadth, he said: "We should all be cognizant of
the fast changing pace in the globalization of world trade not
only in goods but also in services which include
telecommunications."
</P>
<P>
As the rules will continue to be made under the auspices of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), it is beneficial that the COMESA
member states combine their efforts in the negotiations process,
he added.
</P>
<P>
COMESA does offer the opportunity to create a truly successful
regional block that will attract foreign direct investment and
harness the potential of COMESA economies by offering a large
market and fair competition between companies operating in the
region, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Cautious on Zimbabwean Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
cautiously welcomed Monday the high turnout in the Zimbabwean
parliamentary elections which it said was registered in a "very
difficult" situation.
</P>
<P>
"The union welcomed the very high turnout despite incidents of
intimidation at polling stations and the union is waiting for the
final result," said Gunnar Wiegand, spokesman for European Union
External Relations Commissioner Christophe Patten.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc will keep on building a strong partnership
with a democratic Zimbabwe, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official reaction by the union toward the
Zimbabwean elections which were held on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The EU has dispatched 109 observers to monitor the elections
held after four months of holding white-owned farms by veterans
from the liberation war that led to the Zimbabwean independence
from Rhodesia in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5 million people were eligible for casting their
ballots in the elections for the 120 parliamentary seats and the
turnout was reported to appear the highest since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The EU has provided the southern African country with 1.83
million euro (1.75 million U.S. dollars) for the preparation and
process of the two-day elections.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting began on Monday and the final result is expected
to be out on July 3.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for New Regulations for Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- France Monday called for the
adoption of new regulations by the international community and
individual states to cope with globalization and the problems it
is bringing about.
</P>
<P>
The French State Secretary for Exterior Trade, Francois Huwart,
said that while globalization is an opportunity for all countries,
individual states should reach an agreement among them on how to
take advantage of it, discuss its prior objectives and attain a
consensus on the methods to cope with its problems.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a forum of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was focused on
the perspective of launching a new round of negotiations on trade
liberalization after the failure of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) talks in Seattle last November.
</P>
<P>
Official representatives from OECD's 29 member countries opened
the forum on Monday at the OECD headquarters in northwest Paris.
</P>
<P>
Huwart said that in the face of globalization, a balanced
economic development for all countries, jobs, education, health
and environment are the vital issues that all countries are
concerned with.
</P>
<P>
All these questions also call for the definition of new
national and international norms either through voluntary consent
or through constraint of international conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that many new questions, such as bio-technology, cannot
be treated within the national or regional frameworks only but
should be approached with international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Huwart said that some international organizations are faced
with a "crisis of legitimacy," which obliges them to carry out
reforms and to be endowed with more efficiency, transparency and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the WTO, which were the targets of many protesters
during the WTO talks in Seattle last November and World Bank and
IMF yearly conference in Washington two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Warning Announced Possible Volcanic Eruption in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Meteorological Agency
announced Monday a warning that a volcanic eruption could possibly
happen on Miyakejima Island, south of central Japan's Izu
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Agency issued the alert around 7:30 p.m.
local time after seismic activity on the island became strong at
about 6:30 p.m., with successive mild earthquakes taking place.
</P>
<P>
Warnings are usually issued when volcanic activities become
especially intense and urgent counter-measures are required.
</P>
<P>
Miyakejima, which has a population of about 3,800, is part of
the Izu Islands, administered by the Tokyo metropolitan government.
</P>
<P>
The highest peak on the island, the 814-meter Mt. Oyama, had
its latest eruption in October 1983, which has destroyed 413 out
of some 500 buildings, including residential houses.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Affairs and
Trade Minister Lee Young Binn will pay an official visit to Moscow
on June 28-29 to prepare for Russian President Vladimir Putin's
visit to Seoul, said the Russian Foreign Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
During Lee's stay in Moscow, "the parties will exchange their
opinions on a number of questions, with a special emphasis on the
Russian president's upcoming visit to the Republic of Korea and
the situation on the Korean Peninsula after the recent first inter-
Korean summit," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Losyukov said the two sides will also discuss a number of
other international issues.
</P>
<P>
The very fact of the South Korean minister's visit to Russia "
indicates the active role of Russia" in the regulation of the
situation on the Korean Peninsula, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Whether Russia will play a more active role will depend on the
development of the situation in this region, the deputy minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South Korean deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Trade Ban Ki Moon visited Moscow to inform Russia about the
results of the historic summit between the Democracy People's
Republic of Korean (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings with Ban, the Russian side expressed its
readiness to participate in meetings of various formats aimed at
solving the Korean problem and to create a favorable atmosphere
for the dialogue between the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Putin confirmed his intention to visit the
Republic of Korea in the near future after a planned trip to the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Kremlin announced that Putin had
decided to pay a working visit to the DPRK on July 19 prior to the
Group-8 summit slated for late July in Japan's Okinawa.

Another cloud-seeding attempt is expected at the end of this

<HEADLINE> Steel Works' Downsizing Brings Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The reform to improve efficiency
through downsizing in China's steel sector has shown good results
in a number of iron and steel companies.
</P>
<P>
Seventy large and medium-sized key iron and steel works now
have a per-capita annual steel output of 122.8 tons, according to
the State Administration of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers for production in these companies has
been reduced by 25 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the per-capita steel output is still much lower than
the world's average. Figures show that in 1996, the average per-
capita annual steel output in steel-producing countries and
regions reached 182 tons, and in some developed countries, the
figure was above 500 tons.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xichun, chairman of the China Steel Industry Association,
said that improving efficiency remains an important task for the
steel sector in the 21st century. "The current restructuring and
China's forthcoming entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
has made it ever more urgent than before," Wu said.

According to latest official statistics, plagues of oriental
grasshoppers destroyed 1.69 million hectares of crops in China by
June 22, including 215,300 hectares in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 3.88 million hectares of farmland have
been swarmed by Italian locusts.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts blamed the disaster for dry weather and
locusts from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"The locust plague will get worse in the coming years in China,
" said Zhu Enlin, an expert from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The worst-hit areas will be the Yellow River valley, the Bohai
Sea area and the western part of south China's island province of
Hainan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that about 30 million yuan (3.61 million US dollars)
has been allocated to deal with the locusts. However, another 30

to control plagues of locusts, according to sources from the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A total of 466,700 hectares of farmland hit by oriental
grasshoppers have already been brought under control in the
provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi and
Jiangsu and Tianjin Municipality, accounting for 65 percent of the
locust-stricken land.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said that about two thirds of the locusts have
been eradicated in the worst-hit areas in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
China has used ten aircraft and 90,000 pieces of machinery to
spray more than 11 million tons of chemical and biological
insecticides. Nearly 280,000 workers have been called in to rid
the locusts.
</P>
<P>
This summer's locust plague covers the middle and lower reaches
of the Yellow River, Xinjiang, the Bohai Sea area in north China,
as well as some areas in southwest and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,000 to 5,000 locusts per square meter in some of

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial output
increased by 10.9 percent year-on-year in May 2000 with cumulative
output for the first five months this year expanding by 13.9
percent compared to the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The expansion was mainly supported by the 20.5 percent growth
year-on-year in the electronics cluster which saw rise in
production of semiconductor industry, the computer peripheral and
the telecommunication equipment segments and a fall in that of
data storage segment and computer industry.
</P>
<P>
Chemical cluster led the growth in May 2000, increasing by 33.
4 percent over a year ago with pharmaceuticals and industrial/
speciality chemical segments surging up heftily by 113 percent and
29.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of petroleum products remained in the
doldrums with a decline of 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output of engineering cluster went up 13.5 percent in May 2000
compared to the same period last year and the increase was mainly
contributed by the precision and process engineering segments as
the transport engineering segment contracted by 5 percent in May
2000.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period in 1999, output of the electronics,
chemical and engineering clusters registered a cumulative growth
of 21.3 percent, 9.7 percent and 8.7 percent respectively in the
period from January to May this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A Workshop to discuss an Asian
Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the development of small and
medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in some areas of the Philippines
and Indonesia opened Monday in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the three-day workshop
aims at developing a strategy to address the constraints that
hinder the development of the SMEs in Philippines' Mindanao and
Palawan and Indonesia's Kalimantan and Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the new strategy proposes to provide the
SMEs access to technologies, markets and credits, and to support
coordination of the ongoing and planned development activities.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said supporting the private sector is an effective way
of spurring development and combating poverty in these relatively
underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
The bank estimates that SME development will cost 80 million U.
S.dollars each for Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
To maximize the impact of its SME effort, the ADB is seeking
the support of governments, the private sector, the international
donor community and nongovernmental organizations.

HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans leader
Chenjerai Hunzvi Monday warned that the war veterans will go back
to the bush if the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) loses the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency that they would take that move
to prevent the country from sliding back into the hands of
reactionaries.
</P>
<P>
"This is idle talk," said leader of the opposition Movement for
 Democratic Change Morgan Tsvangirai, adding, "No sensible
Zimbabwean will accept that. Why did they participate in the
election if they did not want any other result?"
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf Secretary for Administration Didymus Mutasa said, "It
is a bit too early for anything. We will cross the bridge when we
get there. Zanu- pf is confident of winning most seats in the
country."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe held its fifth parliamentary election over the
weekend, which for the first time was tightly contested in all the
constituencies by other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's war veterans have occupied over 1,500 white farms
since February this year to pressure the government to speed up
the land reform process.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs Fights Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has intensified its
crackdown on drug trafficking this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months, Shanghai customs seized 330 grams of
methamphetamine, known as "ice," in 10 air mail bags, latest
statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai customs also uncovered 15 smuggling cases, involving
heroin and ice amounting to 1,440 grams.
</P>
<P>
Eight suspects involved were detained, and six of whom have
been arrested. Among them, three persons had been sentenced, with
the heaviest penalty of up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai customs officers said in recent years smugglers tended
to smuggle methamphetamine through mail bags which were more
difficult to discover.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this situation, customs officers have adopted
state-of-the-art equipment to check mail.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, two drug traffickers attempted to hide
drugs in medicine capsules and mail them abroad. All suspects
involved in the case were detained by Shanghai customs officers
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai customs have also tightened monitoring passengers. In
March, a suspect identified as Xu was stopped at Hongqiao Airport
for bringing in drugs.

itself and Iran's human resources.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Philippine Efforts for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday said it will
continue to support the Philippine Government's efforts to secure
the release of the hostages being held by an armed group in the
Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar made the statement
here after talks with Alexander Aguirre, national security adviser
to Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid told reporters that a third team of Malaysian
medical volunteers would leave for the Philippines soon to treat
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hostage issue could not be prolonged as there are among the
hostages people whose health has been disrupted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Aguirre conveyed a message of thanks from the
Philippine government to Malaysia for its support and cooperation
in efforts to secure the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said that Aguirre had also reiterated that his government
would continue negotiating with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing problems in the
Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Aguirre also expressed the vital importance for strong and
close relations between the Philippines and Malaysia," Syed Hamid
said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing dismay over reports by sections of the Philippine
media, which he termed as inaccurate, Syed Hamid said "we regret
baseless and untrue statements."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is satisfied that the Philippine government has
disassociated itself from such statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Malaysia and the Philippines are aware about
the coming here of MILF members to meet OIC leaders and members
who are in Kuala Lumpur for the 27th Islamic Conference of Foreign
Ministers which begins here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said "there is an agreement among all ASEAN countries that
their citizens can come without a visa. They are Philippine
passport holders and are welcome unless they are criminals."
</P>
<P>
On whether the MILF has applied for observer status, Syed Hamid
said," nothing in the agenda. So I cannot discuss something not in
the agenda."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the OIC meeting here, the Philippines would
submit a report on the implementation of the MNLF peace settlement
in the Southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Ensure Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to strictly
maintain its present rice acreage, about four million hectares,
for at least 10 years, to ensure the rice output of the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision, according to a report of local English daily
Vietnam News on Monday, is part of a Vietnamese government
resolution signed by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai last week on
measures to restructure the rural economy and promote farm product
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the Vietnamese government says that of the
proposed 33 million tonnes of unhusked rice, 25 million tonnes
will be earmarked for domestic consumption and the country's food
reserve, and the remaining eight million tonnes for export.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the existing irrigation and drainage
network of the country must be ensured for four million hectares
of rice fields.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also stipulates that other food crops will be
cultivated on land unsuitable for rice, like swampy and coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables and fruit trees will be grown on arable areas
adjacent to major urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has reaped bumper harvests of rice for many years
running. The country exported more than 4.5 million tonnes of rice
in 1999, becoming the second biggest rice exporter in the World.

<HEADLINE> Levy Criticizes Arafat's Speech On Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's speech on the declaration of statehood can only harm the
Middle East peace process, said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat's speech showed that the Palestinian leader does not
want to reach an agreement with Israel," levy told the Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is distancing himself from the peace process, and from
the obligations and undertakings he's taken on if he unilaterally
declares a state," Levy added.
</P>
<P>
If Arafat declares a Palestinian state as he said on Sunday in
the near future without the agreement from Israel, Israel will take
measures to counter that, Levy added.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, Israel does not want to confront with the
Palestinians, but Israel will neither retreat nor make compromise
in the peace process if the Palestinians stage some kind of violent
actions against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy's remarks proved the harshest while commenting on Arafat's
Sunday speech in which the Palestinian leader vowed to declare an
independent Palestinian state within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of supporters in the West Bank city of
Nablus, Arafat said a statehood can be declared unilaterally within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We have a few weeks left ahead of us...the state will be
established with its capital Jerusalem," Arafat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Responding to last week's warnings by Israeli Chief of General
Staff Shaul Mofaz that the army might deploy tanks and helicopters
to put down clashes in the territories if the sides fail to forge a
peace deal by September and the Palestinians unilaterally declare a
state, Arafat said the Palestinians are prepared to fight back if
the Israeli troops use violence against them.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also reminded Israel of past battles that the
Palestinians fought against Israel, such as the seven years of
uprising during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The statehood declaration will most likely come in September and
the final decision will be taken by the Central Committee of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization which will meet in Gaza at the
beginning of July, Palestinian Minister for Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met Sunday night in Nablus with Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Council Speaker Abu Ala,
the chief negotiators for the final-status talks, a senior
Palestinian source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wants to review the two sides' positions and clarify some
points before the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who is expected to arrive here Tuesday evening to prepare
a three-way summit in July in Washington, between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross,
currently in the region ahead of Albright's visit, held several

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not For Nuclear Arms Race with India: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Monday reiterated Pakistan will not enter
into nuclear arms race with India and will never subject the
nation to economic deprivation.
</P>
<P>
"We would not enter into nuclear arms race with India and would
never subject our people to economic deprivation," he said while
delivering a speech at a local college.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Islamabad's nuclear policy, the chief executive
said Pakistan was forced in May 1998 to demonstrate its nuclear
capability in response to multiple Indian nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"The rationale behind our nuclear policy is purely security and
we only want to maintain a minimum credible deterrence to deter
any aggression against our homeland," he said, adding "Pakistan,
unlike India does not harbor any ambitions of regional or global
status. We fully support the creation of a strategic self-
restraint regime in the subcontinent and expect a positive
response from our neighbor."
</P>
<P>
However, he made it clear that security of Pakistan will remain
"paramount in our minds and hearts."
</P>
<P>
Apart from achieving minimum deterrence capability, General
Musharraf said the main thrust of Pakistan's nuclear program is on
peaceful applications.

<HEADLINE> OECD Threatens to Impose Sanctions on Tax Havens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Monday threatened to impose
sanctions against 35 tax havens, some of them closely linked with
France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The OECD accused these tax havens of practicing a "prejudicial
tax competition" by seeking to attract banking deposits from
individuals and companies who want to avoid paying taxes in their
own countries.
</P>
<P>
The tax havens on the OECD list include the British Virgin
Islands, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands
and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the warning is aimed at making sure that the
duty of tax-paying must be done equally everywhere in the world
and that tax must not be a key factor in investment decision-
making.
</P>
<P>
The 35 tax havens will have to decide in the next 12 months
whether to cooperate with the OECD or not to "eliminate the
prejudicial characters of their (tax) regime from now until the
end of 2005," said the OECD.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 29-member countries of the organization will
adopt "a common approach" including "defensive measures against
the territories which refuse to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
So far, only France has called for sanctions against the tax
havens which refuse to cooperate in the fight against financial
crimes such as money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, an OECD-affiliated organization accused 15
countries and territories of refusing to cooperate in the fight
against financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
These countries include Israel, Russia, the Philippines and
Lebanon, according to a statement published by the Group of
Financial Action on Capital Laundering.

<P>
PRAGUE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's gross domestic
product GDP) rose by 4.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter
of 2000, the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that in current prices the GDP amounted to 439
billion korun (11.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the period. After an
experimental seasonal adjustment, the GDP was up by 1.3 percent
from the fourth quarter of 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
The figure was much better than expected. The market had
expected a 2.5-percent GDP growth. Economists said they would
revise their full year forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Czech koruna jumped after the figure was released to 35.89
to the euro, from 35.99 before the data.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the result mainly to booming exports, which
were up 29.5 percent year-on-year. It is tied mainly to
developments in Germany.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly Holds Special Session on Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA) began a week-long special session here Monday to address
social development issues amidst the heightened concern over such
social issues as poverty, employment and worker rights in the age
of globalization.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Danish Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, Swiss President Adolf Ogi, and Chinese Vice
Premier Wen Jiabao were among more than 100 heads of state and
heads of delegations and observers present at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the special session is to advance the global social
development agenda that was set at the 1995 World Summit for
Social Development (Social Summit) in Copenhagen, Denmark,
according to a U.N. press release.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the progress and the obstacles encountered in
implementing the outcome of the Social Summit, countries
participating in the special session are expected to suggest and
agree upon new initiatives that will enhance efforts to create
jobs, reduce poverty and address a wide array of other social
concerns.
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, Annan will launch a landmark report on
poverty reduction entitled "Better World for All." The report is
an unprecedented collaborative effort by the U.N., the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The joint report finds that by 2015 world poverty can be
significantly decreased if developing and industrialized countries
implement their commitments to attack the root causes of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Rich Countries Should Play Due Role in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Monday that the rich countries have an
indispensable role to play in reducing global poverty.
</P>
<P>
"It is only natural that the poor countries of the world, which
have so few resources of their own, should look for help to the
rich ones," Annan told the opening meeting of the 24th special
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He urged the rich countries to further open their markets, to
provide deeper and faster debt relief, and to give more and better
focused development aid.
</P>
<P>
"Many of those rich countries have acute social problems of
their own," Annan said. "But none of them can be indifferent to
the social conditions in which so many people in poor countries
live."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.N. chief said that the leaders and
peoples of developing countries should also "show real
determination to mobilize their own resources, above all their own
human resources, to deal with their own social problems."
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he cautioned, those changes are less likely to come,
and will bring few real benefits even if they do come.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the relationship between economic growth and
social development, Annan pointed out that social and economic
welfare are not separate concepts.
</P>
<P>
"Without economic prosperity, no country can provide for all
the social needs of its citizens. But nor can any country be
called truly prosperous so long as many of its citizens are left
to fend for themselves against ignorance, hardship and disease,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nor yet can any country achieve prosperity by subordinating
all social concerns to the achievement of a few quantitative
benchmarks," he said. "What matters in the last resort is the
quality of life, a big part of which is the feeling that you
belong freely to your society, and that it also belongs to you."

<HEADLINE> Strike by Air France Controllers Gravely Disrupts Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A 24-hour strike by controllers of
Air France on Monday is disrupting most of the internal flights of
France and many medium-haul flights between France and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Air France officials estimate that 90 percent of the air
traffic across the French sky is expected to be disrupted on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The air company will guarantee only 15 percent of the internal
flights and medium-haul flights to other European countries on
Monday, while 60 percent of the long-haul flights to overseas
destinations will be secured.
</P>
<P>
The French private air company AOM has canceled all its flights
from Paris to Pergignan in southwest France, Toulon and Zurich,
and the flights by all air companies from Paris to Nice and
Marseille are seriously disrupted.
</P>
<P>
British Airways has canceled or delayed 50 percent of its
flights to France, while the Dutch KLM, has canceled all flights
to France and the German Lufthansa can fly only one plane out of
seven to France.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the pressure on passengers, the French state
railway company SNCF is providing 5,000 extra seats in trains
linking Paris and the northern city of Lille with southern French
cities and the Swiss city of Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The air controllers are protesting a European plan called "
Unique European Sky," which is aimed at rationalizing all air
traffic across Europe to solve the serious problem of delays in
departure and arrival by planes.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than 30 percent of the planes flying among
European states delayed in their departure by an average 15
minutes, resulting in billions of euros of loss.
</P>
<P>
The European plan could result in more privatization of air
companies, said the air controllers who oppose privatization of
their jobs.

CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman is discussing with international investors on
setting up a joint venture to build a 250-million-U.S.-dollar
polypropylene plant in the northern city of Sohar, a project
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Various international companies have shown interest in the
polypropylene project," Mohammed bin Suleiman Al-Kindy, Sohar
refinery project business manager was quoted by Monday's Dubai-
based Gulf News daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said it was too early to name the parties.
</P>
<P>
Oman said in May it was conducting a study to build the
polypropylene plant next to a planned 75,000-barrel-per-day
refinery in Sohar.
</P>
<P>
Officials earlier said that the refinery would provide the raw
materials for the new plant, which would process 300,000 tons of
propylene annually to produce polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Following promising discoveries in the Azerbaijani
Shahdeniz natural gas project, Turkey has expressed willingness to
buy Azeri natural gas, reported Turkish Daily News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Energy officials say Azeri natural gas is economically reliable
because only a 280-kilometer-long natural gas pipeline needs to be
built. A 490-kilometer pipeline from Azeri capital of Baku to the
Georgia-Azerbaijan border already exists.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is expected to make a written commitment in July in order
to start work on the pipeline as soon as possible and to ensure the
supply of natural gas by the winter of 2002.
</P>

reliability of its 85,000-barrel-per-day refinery, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed a three-year deal with PEC to optimize the
safety aspects and reliability of the refinery," Takaya Sugimura,
the refinery's general manager of maintenance, was quoted by
Monday's Dubai-based Gulf News daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the value of the deal.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The World Bank plans to contribute some 500 million U.
S. dollars to a proposed fund aimed at encouraging Turkey's use of
renewable energy resources, reported Turkish Daily News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank urges the Turkish government to give priority to the
use of renewable energy resources, such as hydro, wind and solar
power, which provide solid and long-term solutions through a
country's own resources.
</P>
<P>
Government officials are presently working on incentives to make
the sector appealing.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Abu Dhabi Duty Free (ADDF) will launch the world's
first duty free credit card next month, reported Monday's Dubai-

</P>
<P>
The card, to be launched on July 15, will be issued in two

Among the setbacks that pose a hurdle towards enhancing better
cooperation among members is the geographical diversity of Islamic
countries and the varied level of economic development among
Islamic nations, he told reporters after a meeting with the
Malaysian Malay Chambers of Commerce and Industry here.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the ICCI has high hopes of eventually
realizing the proposed Islamic Common Market and would seek ways
to counter these constraints by focusing on inter-Islamic trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently, inter-Islamic trade accounted for 11
percent of the world trade, but if petroleum was taken out, there
is only two percent left of Islamic trade.
</P>
<P>
He hoped inter-Islamic trade would reach 30 percent of the
world trade by next year as the chamber prepared for the
challenges of the new millennium, saying the Islamic countries
have everything including the basic resources and manpower.
</P>
<P>
The ICCI is the only institution within the 56-member
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), representing the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ICCI aims at strengthening closer collaboration in the
field of trade, commerce, insurance, shipping, banking, promotion
of investment opportunities and joint ventures in the member
countries, and through its Plan of Action, seeks to offer
promotional, advisory, information, training programs, technical
assistance and other services to the private sectors of the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ICCI official is here for the 27th Islamic Conference of
Foreign Ministers (ICFM) which is scheduled to open here Tuesday
by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan merchant ship was
attacked and badly damaged by separatist Tamil Tiger rebels early
on Monday off the northern waters, a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the MV Mercs Uhana had been attacked around
2:30 a.m. Monday by suicide cadres of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at sea off Point Pedro in Sri Lanka's northern
coast.
</P>
<P>
It said, "21 out of 28 crew members have been rescued and the
fire on board the ship has been brought under control."
</P>
<P>
The fate of seven other crew members is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been chartered by private traders to transport
food and other essential items to Jaffna where government troops
fought pitched battles with the LTTE rebels until last month and
stalled a rebel onslaught to recapture its former stronghold of
Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said efforts were being made to tow the
damaged ship to safe waters. They said the LTTE rebels might
mistake the ship for one carrying weapons to government forces in
Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Refuses External Military Aid to Stop Communal  Bloodshed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will not
ask for military aid from external forces to overcome the ongoing
communal bloodshed in Maluku and North Maluku provinces, a senior
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alwi Shihab
said, "we are still able to handle the ongoing communal bloodshed
in Maluku. We will not ask for military help from foreign
countries. I don't think so. I don't agree on that point. But if
they (foreign countries) will give infrastructure or humanitarian
relief, we will receive that. But not military."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the government will do its best to stop
bloodshed in Maluku and North Maluku provinces," Shihab stressed,
adding that foreign countries including the United States have
given positive response over the government's policy in handling
sectarian conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
"And the United States government has given their support to
Indonesia in handling communal conflicts in Ambon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after deciding to close Maluku province from the
outsiders on Friday, the government now has been considering to
impose state of civil emergency in Maluku and North Maluku
provinces in a bid to calm down situation and stop violence there
which has claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
Reports said at least 206 people have been killed in the fresh
clashes between Muslims and Christians which started on June 19 in
North Maluku province and Ambon, capital of Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Law and Legal Affairs Yusril Ihza
Mahendra said, "state of civil emergency is deserved to be imposed
in Poso (a city in the country's Central Sulawesi province),
Maluku province, and North Maluku province."
</P>
<P>
"We can't let communal bloodshed continues to happen there. We
have to do something, now," Mahendra stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Review Laws on Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
said it will review all existing laws and regulations that
restricted the flow of investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Monday quoted the Minister for Justice
and Constitutional Affairs Bakari Mwapachu as saying that if
there are any laws hampering the process of doing business in the
country, the government will amend such legislations or enact new
ones.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated the government's commitment to create a
business- friendly atmosphere for investors and traders, saying
his ministry is ready to amend laws and change outdated policies
to go in line with today's business trends.
</P>
<P>
According to a study recently conducted by the Confederation of
Tanzania Industries (CTI), quite a number of legislations are
making it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business.
</P>
<P>
Legislations said to be scaring away investors include the
Employment Ordinance Act, which allegedly prohibits the business
of recruitment.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Powers Act and provisions in tax laws such as the
Value Added Tax Act are also described by investors as
restrictive.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Students Urged to Avoid Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has urged students in the country to shun acts of
hooliganism and maintain peace, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, who on Sunday spoke at the official opening of a
Matssia police post in Kajiado District in southern Kenya, said
students should avoid resorting to violence whenever a problem
arise, but instead, seek dialog with the administration in the
learning institutions.
</P>
<P>
Recently, students in a number of high learning institutions
went into violence and damaged public properties in protest to a
nationwide power rationing.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president cautioned students that they would have
themselves to blame if they did not make good use of their time in
school.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti also urged parents and teachers associations, school
board of governors and university councils to pay maximum
attention to the running of their institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government will punish criminals taking advantage of power
rationing to cause mayhem during the night, Saitoti said,
attributing the rise in crime to the proliferation of firearms
into Kenya from neighboring states.

<HEADLINE> China Leads Drug Users to New, Healthy Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three year old Wen Zengjun
would have taken it as a dream: a drug addict as he was in the
past, he has became a boss again.
</P>
<P>
"The police has given me a second life," Wen recalled. He was
found in a coma in the street because of drug overdose during one
winter night two years ago. The patrol police rushed him to
hospital immediately.
</P>
<P>
Wen was sent by the local government to a mandatory drug
rehabilitation center after he left hospital in 1998. Five years
of drug addiction made Wen penniless.
</P>
<P>
The only mandatory drug rehabilitation center in Hohhot is
located in the heart of the city with no armed police.
</P>
<P>
After being let out from center, he started a restaurant in
Hohhot, capital city of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiaoya, his wife, said that Wen lost 300,000 yuan (about 36,
145 U.S. dollars) the family had obtained by managing a butcher
shop. Besides, Wen had borrowed money to buy drug without his wife
's knowing.
</P>
<P>
"I asked for a divorce many times," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"But I was told by police and social workers that only love
could help my husband resolve the problem."
</P>
<P>
Their 18-year old son knew nothing about his father's addiction.
He goes about his studies like any other students. His father's
addiction is kept private by the center.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse has become an increasingly serious problem in China
in recent years. By the end of 1999, there were 680,000 drug users
in China, up by 14.3 per cent or 85,000 addicts compared to the
figure in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Almost three fourths of China's reported 17,000 HIV carriers in
1999 who were drug addicts.

Wen had debts problems after he was released from the
Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
The local government offered Wen a helping hand by providing
him with a low-rent shop and tax exemption. Wen's restaurant
brought him a daily turnover of over 200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Drug addicts like Wen always get help from the government after
they were off the habit, said Bao Hongli, an official with the
Hohhot drug control office. The government helps them find work
and provides a pension for those who cannot work.
</P>
<P>
"We must take care of them just like a mother would take care
of her children," said Li Guizhen, a 60-year-old woman in charge
of the Guanghua No. 1 Neighborhood Committee in Hohhot who was
helping a former drug user find work.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 200 people in the center receiving
treatment, 70 percent of whom are self-funded. The rest is covered
by the government.
</P>
<P>
People here get up at seven and do morning exercises before
learning some skills such as cooking and hair-dressing which
prepares them for when they are finally leave from the Center.
</P>
<P>
It was in the center that Wen learnt to cook.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Majlis to Revise Conservative Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Iranian Majlis
(parliament) Mehdi Karrubi has indicated the legislative body is
determined to revise all laws that are old-fashioned or hindering
implementation of reform programs.
</P>
<P>
As agreed by the president and the judiciary branches of the
government, legislation which are old-fashioned, outdated or
irrelevant must be revised or amended, Karrubi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, secretary-general of the Assembly of Combatant Clergy
and a close ally of reform-minded President Mohammad Khatami, was
elected speaker of the Majlis on June 11. The sixth Majlis,
dominated by reformers, started work on May 27.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Secretary of the Guardians Council (GC) Ahmad
Jannati late Sunday, Karrubi also expressed hope that the Majlis
and the GC will cooperate well in the future. All legislation
passed by the Majlis has to be approved by the 12-member GC before
they can become laws.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Jannati expressed the hope that the new Majlis
will carry out its duties in the best possible way.
</P>
<P>
He also noted, however, that the Majlis does not have unlimited
authority and cannot solve all problems, hinting that the Majlis
has to be supervised and limited by bodies such as the GC and the
State Expediency Council, currently headed by former president
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
With reformers controlling the parliament, the Majlis and the GC
have actually become rivals. The conservative GC has for the past
months tried to block reformers from getting a upper hand in the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary election in February resulted in a landslide
victory by the reformers, who ended the long-time conservative
dominance of the parliament. The victory is an important step for
the reformers toward seizing all powerful state organs of the
country, most of which are still under conservative control.
</P>
<P>
The powerful GC, supervisor of the elections, tried to save some
face for the conservatives by annulling election results in a
number of constituencies and transferring reformist victories to
the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
With severe pressure from the conservative establishment, the
new Majlis, however, managed to convene on May 27.
</P>
<P>
On June 18, the new Majlis passed a motion to review the press
law, which was amended by its conservative predecessor in the dying
days of its term to impose more restrictions on the reformist
press.
</P>
<P>
The motion indicated that reformers in the Majlis have taken the
first step toward carrying out their pledges of revising all old-
fashioned legislation and push forward the country's reform
programs advocated by President Khatami since he took office in
1997.

</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>

cleared by the Turkish parliament of corruption charges, is
preparing to enter the three-way coalition government now.
</P>
<P>
It was said that he will be responsible for relations with the
European Union in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is planning to transfer its Incirlik
military base in southern Turkey to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which has perceived the southern flank of the
alliance as a zone for increasing threat.
</P>
<P>
The base is being used by the U.S. in its no-fly zone operations
to protect Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll, only 19 percent of the ordinary people
of the European Union countries will be pleased with the full
membership of Turkey, indicating that ordinary Europeans are cold
toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>

Portugal, Britain and Greece while the opposition mainly came from
Austria, France and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Pino Arlacchi, a high-level U.N. official for fighting drugs,
Sunday urged the Turkish government to make concerted efforts with

famous all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He said "Turkey is on the main road of heroin traffic. Seventy
percent of the Afghan heroin arrives in Europe passing through
Turkey. The income of the Turkish mafia from this traffic reaches
billions of U.S. dollars."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Must Work Together to Ensure Sustainable Fisheries:  Singapore Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) --ASEAN nations must work together
to ensure that fisheries are sustainable as a food source and a
foreign-exchange earner for the region, Singapore Minister for
National Development Mah Bow Tan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the ASEAN Fisheries Federation (AFF) 10th
Council Meeting &AMP; Business Conference and the International
Coalition of Fisheries Association (ICFA) Annual Meeting, the
minister told the participants that new challenges call for a
concerted and determined effort from ASEAN's government agencies
and their private sector counterparts to ensure that fisheries in
the region are sustainable, environment-friendly and thriving so
that future generations continue to enjoy fish as a regular part
of their meal.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the pertinent challenges ASEAN nations must face
up to ensure long-term viability of ASEAN fisheries, Mah Bow Tan
listed the three thrusts to carefully manage fisheries resources,
practise environment-friendly aquaculture and reduce post-harvest
wastage.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that efforts must be made to balance the size of
catch with the need to ensure that available resources are not
harvested beyond their replacement rate.
</P>
<P>
"To over-fish and not allow the resources to regenerate
themselves posses a real threat which we cannot afford to ignore,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance to make environment-friendly
aquaculture industry mature into a major fish producer in ASEAN,
citing aquaculture production is estimated to reach 40 million
tonnes by 2010 and account for 30 percent of the total fish
production of about 140 million tonnes in the world.
</P>
<P>
He urged for more focus on fisheries post-harvest technology
to reduce post-harvest loss resulting from poor handling and
preservation and to achieve greater efficiency in the utilization
of fish catches.
</P>
<P>
Fish is an important source of protein for ASEAN's 500 million
people and ASEAN's total fish production in 1996 was over 13
million tonnes with 2.6 million tonnes or 15 percent produced by
aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
The trade in fish and fishery products is a big business for
ASEAN nations as their total exports in 1996 reached 7.7 billion U.
S. dollars or 14.7 percent of world exports and their imports
totaled 2.1 billion U.S. dollars, representing net foreign
exchange earnings of over 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In ASEAN there were about 1.7 million people involved in full-
time fishing activities and another three million people involved
in part-time fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is one of the highest fish-consuming countries in
the region with per capita consumption at 26.8 kilograms yearly
and the nation's daily consumption at 60 tonnes of fishballs, fish
cake and other fish jelly products.
</P>
<P>
Local fish production, including aquaculture, only meets less
than 10 percent of Singapore's fish consumption and its trade in
fish and fishery products in 1998 was valued at one billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures One in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A young tailor was hurt when a
suspected homemade bomb exploded near him Sunday night in Davao
City in the southern Philippines, a police report reaching here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 18-year-old tailor sustained
shrapnel wounds on his head, face and legs, and was immediately
brought to the Davao Medical Center for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded around 7:45 p.m. near an electric post where
the tailor was waiting for a ride, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted witnesses as saying that two men on board a
public utility jeepney stopped at the scene prior to the incident.
</P>
<P>
One of them dropped by and left behind something near the
electric post and returned to their vehicle and got lost from the
area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Police brushed aside speculations that it was a handiwork of
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels who warned
since last month to unleash a series of bomb attacks in the city.
</P>
<P>
The explosion followed after seven bombs exploded in nearby
General Santos City, killing a woman vendor and wounding 40 others
last Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Take Over Air Traffic Control From Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will take over the
country's air traffic control (ATC) from Singapore, Minister of
Industry and Trade Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Come September, the agreement with Singapore (on ATC) will
expire. The (Indonesian) government wants to do it (the control)
by itself gradually," the minister said in a dialogue with the
Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's ATC activities will thereafter be centered
in Batam's Hang Nadim airport.
</P>
<P>
"This (takeover) will also refute allegations that Indonesia
does not have the right technology and human resources (for ATC).
Actually, we do have," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The handling of the air traffic control by itself would give the
side-benefits of enhancing control and monitoring of the air
territorial stability.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we have not been maximum in monitoring the
movement of foreign military aircraft entering Indonesia's air
territory. Now that we are going to manage the ATC by ourselves,
the matter will be handled differently," Pandjaitan added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Parties Call for Inter-Party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's main opposition parties
have once again called for resumption of inter-party talks to
discuss among other issues the electoral process as the country
draws closer to the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The United National Independence Party (UNIP), the United Party
for National Development (UPND) and Zambia Alliance for Progress
(ZAP) made the appeal here on Sunday, according to Monday's Zambia
Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The three parties threatened to review their participation in
the future elections until the issue of the electoral process is
settled to the satisfaction of all parties.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the three parties told a news briefing
that they acknowledged President Frederick Chiluba as chairman of
the inter-party talks and urged him to call for a meeting to
discuss the agenda set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The general elections will be held next year and the
inter-party talks, a dialog mechanism between the country's ruling
and opposition parties, have never held a meeting since December
1998 although a number of opposition parties and non-government
organizations have repeatedly called for the resumption of the
talks.

<HEADLINE> 20 Ugandan Students Arrested Over Disrupting President's Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 pro-multi-party
students have been arrested in Uganda when they attempted to
disrupt President Yoweri Museveni's rally at Makerere University
in the capital of Kampala, the New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The students displayed on Sunday different colored placards
with messages urging Museveni to resign and Ugandans to boycott
the June 29 referendum, singing slogans of the Ugandan People's
Congress at the top of their voices.
</P>
<P>
The president tried to calm the listeners at the rally, saying
"as good democrats, if you see what the majority want, just keep
quiet and listen."
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chancellor of the University John Sebuwufu said that
disciplinary action would be taken against the errant students.
</P>
<P>
"There was external influence on the students' action. They
were paid money and had to be seen to be working. The ring-leaders
were paid 10,000 Uganda shillings for every 10 students they
recruited," Hussein Kashillingi, a member of the university's
movement organizing committee, was quoted as saying.

</P>
<P>
Musyoka, minister in charge of education, made the remarks in

According to the official SANA news agency, the 70-member
committee of the 250-seat People's Assembly discussed the
nomination of Bashar by the ruling Baath party and expressed its "
total support" for his candidacy for the presidency. A full

The ruling bloc, comprising the LDP, the New Komeito party and
the New Conservative Party (NCP), gained a combined 271 seats,
which will allow it to pass bills at all lower house standing
committees even without the chairman's vote, the Kyodo news agency

stable majority in the lower house set by the ruling bloc. (Japan-

NANJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
east China's Jiangsu Province have reported more than 5.18 billion
yuan (about 624 million U.S. dollars) in profits for the first

<HEADLINE> Private Retirement Homes Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,075 private retirement
homes are now accommodating 24,000 Chinese senior citizens,
according to statistics from the China National Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 100 million people over 60 who make up 10
percent of the country's 1.2 billion population. It is estimated
that the figure will reach 400 million by the middle of 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional ways" of taking care of the aged can no longer
satisfy the increasing number, said an official with the committee.
Family's responsibility will be partly taken over by society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Usually the family will take care of parents after their
retirement. But with the increasing number of migrants in the
country, old people are hardly being taken well care of. Private
retirement homes are one of the ways available to those who have
no families.
</P>
<P>
At present, the State-run welfare homes for senior citizens and
collective-run old-people's homes have accommodated almost one
million aged people.
</P>
<P>
"Communities should help support the old," Premier Zhu Rongji
called in his government's report early this year.
</P>
<P>
A program aiming to improve welfare among the elderly was
launched this year by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Fund to Aid 1,000-odd High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Technology Innovation Fund for
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is to provide financial
support to over 1,000 high-tech ventures this year, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, Vice Minister of Science and Technology said at a
press conference today that the fund will focus on projects of
software development, biological pharmaceuticals, new materials,
resources and environment, new energy and high-efficient energy
saving and other kinds of high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Fund will give top priority to software
development projects as well as bio-pharmaceutical projects.
</P>
<P>
The fund was granted by the State Council last June with a
primary allocation of one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars).
It will support projects with intellectual property rights,
advanced technology, good market prospective after China's entry
of WTO, and upgrading of state-owned enterprises with high
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund will also support newly-established ventures
run by returned overseas Chinese students. The Ministry of Science
and Technology and the Ministry of Finance have in the past year
approved 1,281 projects of technology-based SMEs.
</P>
<P>
There had been over 70,000 technology-based SMEs registered in
China by the end of 1998, with a total turnover of 600 billion
yuan (72 billion dollars) and over 3.3 million employees.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Facing dissent within his cabinet over an upcoming Washington
summit and veiled threats from Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on a statehood declaration, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Sunday attempted to walk a tightrope in the
cabinet's first meeting since last week's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his ministers that it is important to send out a
unified message in advance of the historic decisions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, however, expressed pessimism about
the negotiations and indicated the time is not ripe for a summit
when no progress is at hand.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli intelligence assessments hold that Iran is planning a
second test launch of its Shihab-3 surface-to-surface ballistic
missile in the coming weeks. The preparations under way in Iran for
the launching of the missile, whose range is estimated to be 1,300
kilometers, have aroused anxiety in Israel and the West.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence stressed that the launch is of strategic
significance, not operational or tactical. Iran is believed to be
at least five years away from fitting a nuclear warhead to the
Shihab-3.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky Sunday during a
weekly cabinet meeting proposed a shorter work week with a two-day
weekend. Sharansky, speaking during a discussion on the national
preferences for the 2001 budget, recommended introducing Sunday as
a day off in addition to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the additional day of rest will help Israel
meet the challenges of globalization, suiting Israel to the
economic timetable of the global village. Prime Minister Ehud Barak
responded by saying it is an interesting proposal that will be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Sunday condemned a Saturday
arson attack on a conservative synagogue in Jerusalem as a "
horrible act that chills the souls of all Jews."
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses of the evening attack on the Ramot Forest
synagogue, in which windows were shattered and furniture destroyed,
said they saw a number of ultra-Orthodox people running away from
the site. No arrests have been made at this time.

<HEADLINE> First Quarter GDP Shows Slowing Economy in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand economy slowed
significantly in the first quarter of this year, according to
official figures released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said gross domestic product (GDP), which
measures the total economic activity, grew by 0.8 percent in the
quarter, after recording a 2.3 percent rise in the fourth quarter
and a 2.6 percent lift in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown in activity during the first quarter, the
economy grew by 4.4 percent in the year from April 1999 to March
2000.
</P>
<P>
This compares with zero growth the previous year and was the
highest annual growth rate since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Growth this quarter was strongly influenced by exports, up 2.1
percent. For the whole year, New Zealand exports grew 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and building activity recorded growth this quarter,
mainly on the back of good spring pasture growth and a surge in
new housing construction. However, the major contribution to the
increased activity came from the service industries, with the
largest contribution coming from increased activity in transport
and communications. The transport industry was buoyed in part by
record numbers of overseas visitors, up 8.9 percent in the first
quarter, compared with the same quarter a year ago.
Telecommunications continue to benefit from growing demand for
information technology-based products and services.
</P>
<P>
Business investment on fixed assets increased 1.6 percent this
quarter, following a 4.5 percent rise in the previous quarter. For
the year from April 1999 to March 2000, the increase was 7.8
percent, up markedly on the growth rates recorded in the previous
two years.
</P>
<P>
Latest surveys have shown sharp falls in business confidence
since March, which could rein in economic growth. Some local
economists predict growth for the second quarter of this year
could be as low as zero percent.

that these elections might lead to a change of government are
more than wild," Nkomo told reporters at a press conference in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the Constitution, Zanu-pf will most definitely
form the next government whatever the results of the legislative
election," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let's get it clear. President Robert Mugabe will form the
next government and this is something that has deliberately been
ignored or misrepresented by the media."
</P>
<P>
He said while the opposition might get some seats in the next
Parliament, no single opposition party had a chance of getting
anywhere near the two- thirds majority needed to push for some
Constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The government had, through the Constitutional Commission, come
up with a home-grown draft constitution in February which entitled
the party commanding a majority in Parliament to name a Prime
Minister who would have a say in the appointment of Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We were quite pleased to come up with a home-grown
Constitution. That draft was very well arranged, but in terms of
the Lancaster House Constitution the unfortunate provision is that
President Mugabe will form the next government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who want to cry foul are the same people who mobilized
for the rejection of the draft Constitution. So in any case
there is no way they could raise the required two-thirds majority
to affect amendments to the Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said that the government would still be constitutional
and President Mugabe did not have to be compelled to include
anyone from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"President Mugabe does not have to prepare to include the
opposition. The President will have the right to appoint people
into Cabinet. He can form a Cabinet of five if he wants," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"He does not have to source manpower from other parties. He
will have a sufficient number of Zanu-pf Parliamentarians from
which to appoint his Cabinet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The elections on Saturday and Sunday were to choose Members of
 Parliament only, and not the President whose term runs up to
2002, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Private Investment In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- More and more Shanghai residents
are turning to private investment for higher economic returns amid
continuous interest cuts from savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Most people choose to invest in such areas as welfare lottery,
securities, education, philately. Others open their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain higher yields from their investment than their
savings deposits, local people purchase new houses on loans while
renting old ones.
</P>
<P>
Cai Wenfang is one of the many examples. She invested some
money into her cousin's plantation garden. After three years, she
earned profits ten times more than from her savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Cao Jianming is another example. He plans to use one percent of
his income to buy lottery tickets. "Whether the investment is
lucrative depends on your luck, but once you win a prize in a
lottery, yields are much higher than what you have originally put
in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some people suggest investing in old people's homes. This will
not only alleviate the younger generation's burden in taking care
of their parents but can also create job opportunities for the
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some local and foreign enterprises have opened
franchise services in Shanghai. Shanghai Lianhua Co., Ltd., for
example, initiated a program to encourage people to run a
chainstore with 70,000 yuan investment.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warn that it is safer for the elderly to
retain their savings deposits rather than invest their money
because investment requires a certain level of know-how and
expertise.

<HEADLINE> Food Adulteration Pervasive in Nepal: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- There is a widespread practice
of adulteration of food in Nepal that badly affects the interests
of consumers, according to a survey released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adulteration amounts to 47.7 percent in sweets, 22 percent in
snacks, 74 percent in titoura (Nepalese food made of pulse flour)
and 32 percent in noodles, said a survey conducted by the Royal
Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST).
</P>
<P>
The survey said there are widespread cases of adulterating milk
with water and soda starch, ghee with vegetables and fat, honey
with sugar, dry tea with wood dust, edible oil with mineral oil
and chemicals, sugar with chalk powder, among others.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that delivering under-weight commodities for
the full price is considered clever by businessmen instead of
feeling guilty at violating the law.
</P>
<P>
It has become a tradition to extract some quantity from a sack
or a package containing designated quantities before selling the
sack or package, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed lack of effective implementation of the
Consumer Interest Protection Act as the main cause behind the
adulteration.
</P>
<P>
Since the fines imposed on those involved in adulteration and
selling commodities under weight are low, the practices are not
deterred.
</P>
<P>
Besides, as only one food inspector is available for 1.2
million people in Nepal and half of the inspectors reside in the
capital, it is difficult to detect cases of adulteration, the
survey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Securities
Commission (SC) has announced transitional arrangements for the
issuance of private debt securities (PDS) and the registration of

<P>
These amendments formulated after consultation with various
industry and professional bodies would make the SC the approving

Under the arrangements, the PDS issuers must comply with the
Companies Act 1965 requirements relating to trust deeds and
prospectuses and the relevant stock exchanges' listing
requirements.

The Issuers must obtain a letter of approval from the SC to

provided that the issue of the PDS takes place within a period of
six months from the date of the central bank's approval.

</P>
<P>
Fresh communal clashes between Christians and Muslims broke out
in Tantui village, Ambon, on Wednesday after two unidentified men
attacked three people. The clashes have spread to three other
villages.
</P>
<P>
Bloody street battles are reported to have raged again in the
city of Ambon, about 2,300 kilometers northeast of Jakarta, on
Sunday, killing at least 14 people and causing thousands to flee
to the mountains or to Halong Naval Base, 12 kilometers east of
Ambon.
</P>
<P>
A police housing complex and detention center in Perigilima, as
well as dozens of houses and a church were burned to the ground.

As of Sunday night, gunfire and explosions were still being
heard in several parts of the city.

"We are terrified as calls of war against Christians have been
broadcast through mosques," a local resident was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A local Catholic priest Agus Ulayana told the Jakarta Post that
the situation had simply gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is paralyzed here (Ambon), communications have been
cut and no transportation is available," Agus said.
</P>

Meanwhile, the Indonesian Navy Sunday detained 10 Maluku
traditional ships carrying assembled machine guns, sharp weapons
and poisonous arrows heading for Maluku islands.

"The Navy succeeded in confiscating assembled long and short
machine guns, sharp weapons, ammunition and other sharp objects
from the ships," Chief of the Eastern Fleet Command Admiral Adi
Hariyoso was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government on Friday slapped a travel ban to Maluku islands
in a bid to stem violent communal clashes that have claimed more
than 2,500 lives since they erupted in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly
Amien Rais Sunday supported the imposition of civil emergency law
in Ambon in a bid to halt the communal clashes.

because it has been going on for almost two years.
</P>

Indonesian Military (TNI) Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. also
expressed support to such measure, and pledged TNI would take
stiffer measures in handling the unrest in Maluku.
</P>
<P>

Sahuberua Sunday said there was no plan to declare a state of
civil emergency in the riot-torn provinces of Maluku and North
Maluku.

SHENYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to decorate the broken
bridge on the Yalu River, which forms part of the border between
China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Three-colored optical fibers will be used to outline the bridge.
The colors -- yellow, white and blue -- have been selected to

<P>
Most of the military supplies transported to the Chinese
volunteer army which fought side by side with DPRK troops during
the Campaign to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953)
were transported across the bridge. Located in Dandong, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, the bridge was a major target
of USA bombing raids, and only a 396-meter section survived the
war.
</P>
<P>
The bridge took six years to build, starting in 1905. It
originally had a length of 944 m and a width of 11 m.

International Anti-drug Day.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction has claimed an alarming number of Chinese in the

<HEADLINE> Private Entrepreneur In Revolutionary Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an is the hallowed revolutionary
base of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province, northwest
China and also home to the Yasheng Hotel, run by Du Chengshi, a
private entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
Du began business in 1993 after he resigned from his post as a
director of policy research under the Yan'an Prefectural
Administrative Office. Two years later, he built the Yasheng
Department Store.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he invested 100 million yuan (12.04 million U.S.
dollars) and built the 17-storey Yasheng Hotel, the biggest
private enterprise in northern Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Du's enterprises provide jobs for more than 1,200 local people
and have declared 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S. dollars) in
taxes to the state.
</P>
<P>
There are many private entrepreneurs such as Du in Yan'an in
agriculture, industry and the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an lags behind China's coastal areas in terms of economic
development because the city is located in Chinese hinterland and
has a week economic base.
</P>
<P>
"Those small and low-efficient stores, hotels and restaurants
can not change the backward looks of Yan'an," said Du.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an has worked out a series of preferential policies and
improved the investment environment to encourage the development
of non-governmental businesses, which now accounts for 22 percent
of the city's total gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
A private businessman from Wenzhou, east China's Zhejiang
Province, has invested 120 million yuan (14.45 million U.S.
dollars) in a computer center beside the Yasheng Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Du, however, is now building a hotel in Tianjin, a north China
municipality. He also plans to build high-class apartment
buildings and tourism attractions in Xi'an and Yulin in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to show that there are very good private
entrepreneurs in Yan'an," Du said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Veteran cyclist Christophe Capelle
won a mass sprint finish to lift the French championship crown and
his first individual title here Sunday, according to an AFP report.
</P>
<P>
The BigMat rider, an Olympic gold medal winner in the team
pursuit event at the 1996 Atlanta Games, beat former French
champion Jacky Durand and Anthony Morin to the post following the
243.1km run, AFP said.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old veteran was pleased with his performance
despite the effects of jet lag.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel very strong during the day. Last week I competed
in a World Cup track event in Mexico and I didn't feel well over
the past few days because of the time difference," Capelle was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless 1993 and 1994 French champion Durand had no answer
for the in-form Capelle who launched his attack aided by teammate
Guillaume Auger in the final kilometer of the race through western
France.
</P>
<P>
"I had great legs but I fell behind Capelle who was faster than
me," said 33-year-old Durand.
</P>
<P>
Capelle clocked five hours, 20 minutes and 44 seconds along
with a leading pack of some 31 riders.
</P>
<P>
However, the newly crowned French champion will not be
competing in the Tour de France from July 1-23 as his team did not
qualify.
</P>
<P>
"At BigMat Auber we're very disappointed not to be competing in
the Tour. I said this to Jean-Marie Leblanc (Tour de France
director). But that's life," added Capelle.

"About 90 percent of Beijing's historic sites and ancient

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China,
one of the country's four big State banks, has laid great stress
on its credit card business with the aim of sharpening its
competitive edge in preparation for the imminent entry of foreign
counterparts, said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
"Our credit cards will enable us to compete with other
commercial banks now that China's economy is making big strides
and its entry into the World Trade Organization is pending," today
's China Daily quoted Zhu Weiguo, director of the bank's credit
card department as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Commercial banks in China and other cards must have
comprehensive functions. This is our main goal," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of China's commercial banks' credit cards only
offer services like withdrawal, deposit and bill paying.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Bank's Golden Spike Card has witnessed rapid
growth in recent years thanks to the establishment of a sound
management system and an active exploration of new functions, Zhu
added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, the Golden Spike card had been
issued to customers in 330 cities and the number of contracted

<HEADLINE> China Faces Uphill Battle Against Narcotics: White Paper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Council Information
Office said in a white paper today that under the invasion of
illicit international narcotics tide to China, criminal drug-
related activities touched off by transit drug trafficking have re-
emerged.
</P>
<P>
"The number of drug addicts has kept rising, drug-related cases
have constantly increased, the drug scourge is becoming more
serious with each passing day, and the situation is grim for the
anti-drug struggle," the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China cracked 65,000 drug-related criminal cases, and
confiscated 5.364 tons of heroin, 1.193 tons of opium, 16.059 tons
of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as "ice''), and some
cocaine, MDMA and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug-related cases cracked and the total amount
of drugs confiscated increased by 2.4 percent and 33.6 percent,
respectively, over 1998, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The "Golden Triangle," one of the main sources of drugs in the
world which is adjacent to the southwestern border of China, is
the main cause of China's drug problem.
</P>
<P>
"At present, each province, autonomous region, and municipality
directly under the Central Government in China suffers from
illegal drug-related activities to a certain extent," it said,
claiming that "China has been turned from a victim of the transit
drug trade into a victim of both drug transit and consumption."
</P>
<P>
The number of drug addicts registered with the public security
organs in 1991 was 148,000, a figure which rose to 520,000 in 1995,
and to 681,000 in 1999. Now drug addicts account for 0.054 percent
of China's total population. Of the drug addicts, those taking
heroin make up 71.5 percent, and those under the age of 35 amount
to 79.2 percent, the White Paper said.

<P>
In China, addicts mainly receive treatment at compulsory
rehabilitation centers and treatment and reeducation-through-labor
centers, special schools for educating and saving addicts from
ruin.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has a total of 746 compulsory rehabilitation
centers and 168 treatment and reeducation-through-labor centers (
teams), the white paper disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese laws, all addicts are sent to compulsory
rehabilitation centers established by governments at all levels.
Those who resume drugs after receiving compulsory treatment are
sent to reeducation-through-labor centers administered by judicial
departments, where they are forced to undergo treatment side by
side with reeducation through physical labor.
</P>
<P>
Addicts who are unsuitable for receiving treatment in
compulsory rehabilitation centers are ordered to give up within a
fixed time under the guardianship of their family members and the
education and administration of the local public security stations,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that an investigation and registration
system and monitoring networks of drug abuse have been established
throughout the country, regularly collecting data and materials,
and promptly monitoring the conditions of addicts.

<P>
The state has also established drug dependence research centers,
drug abuse monitoring centers, drug dependence treatment centers
and narcotic drugs laboratories, and organized scientific research
institutions and experts to conduct research on scientific methods
of rehabilitation for addicts and pharmaceuticals for drug
addiction treatment.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the difficult problem of the high rate of relapse,
the Chinese government carries out the work of continuous help and
education for rehabilitated addicts upon their return to society,
relying on the masses and mobilizing all social forces," the white
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that local public security organs, community
organizations, units and families closely cooperate with
rehabilitation centers to establish a social help and education
system and various types of help and education groups, and fully
carry out the relevant measures.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that governments at all levels and
grassroots organizations actively help the rehabilitated addicts
to solve concrete problems in their life and work, so that they
will not be discriminated against in employment or admission to
higher education. Many addicts have returned to society and
started to lead a new life upon successful rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang
autonomous regions and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces have gradually
probed a new way of motivating the drug control work as a whole --
starting with the grassroots units (communities), and stressing
drug prohibition and the rehabilitation of addicts, to establish "
drug-free communities."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the National Narcotics Control Commission made
arrangements for activities to establish "drug-free communities"
across the country.

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China said today that from 1991 to
1999, its drug-control organs cracked more than 800,000 drug cases
and confiscated 39.67 tons of heroin, 16.894 tons of opium, 15.079
tons of marijuana and 23.375 tons of methamphetamine in the
nationwide campaign in narcotics control.
</P>
<P>
"China's anti-drug law enforcement organs enforce the laws
strictly and are waging a fierce battle against all drug-related
criminal activities, administering merciless punishment to those
involved in such activities", said a white paper entitled "
Narcotics Control in China" issued by the Information Office of
the State Council today.
</P>
<P>
In China, drugs mainly come from other countries, and the
Chinese government has done its best to ban transit drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, in the 1980s, the government
organized public security, armed police and customs organs, as
well as the civilian joint defense teams to coordinate the fight
against drug trafficking, mainly in the southwest border areas and
southeast coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Thus the country set up the three "lines of defense" to keep
drugs from flowing in: The first line was the borderland, where
exit and entry were subject to strict examination; the second line
was composed of checkpoints in inland regions; and the third line
consisted of checks on vital lines of communication, airports,
railway stations and harbors, said the white paper.

In the 1990s, said the white paper, efforts to ban transit drug
trafficking was further intensified and attention was paid to "
eradicating sources of drugs and obstructing their channels of
trafficking."
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that since 1982, more than 70,000 transit drug
trafficking cases have been cleared up in Yunnan Province alone,
and more than 80 tons of heroin and opium from the "Golden
Triangle" area have been confiscated. In May 1994, police in
Yunnan Province cracked an extraordinarily serious transnational
drug smuggling case, in which the "Golden Triangle" drug ring
kingpin was sentenced to death according to law.

Since 1999, under the unified organization of the National
Narcotics Control Commission, key areas like Yunnan, Guizhou,
Sichuan, Guangdong and Gansu provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region have paid great attention to drug-infested areas
and cracked a sequence of major drug-related cases, arrested a
contingent of drug-traffickers, wiped out a batch of drug-
smuggling gangs and eradicated a number of underground drug-
dealing markets and networks.

The paper stressed that the Chinese government prohibits the
cultivation of mother drug plants. It has always taken this as a
focal point of its drug control work and paid constant attention
to it as a way to nip troubles in the bud.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it said, "China has virtually eradicated the
illegal cultivation of mother drug plants."
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that China is a country with a large
population, and so it needs a lot of legal narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances.
</P>
<P>
"While endeavoring to protect people's health and meet the
needs of medical treatment, the government practices strict
control of 118 narcotic drugs and 119 psychotropic substances, and
their production, trading, use and import and export are
restricted to prevent illegal circulation", said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the Chinese government also exercises
strict control over the precursor chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that from 1997 to 1999, China cracked 548
cases of illegal buying, selling and smuggling of precursor
chemicals and confiscated more than 1,000 tons of illegal chemical
products.
</P>
<P>
"In collaboration with UN drug control organs and competent
departments of other countries, the relevant departments of China
have set up an international system to check the import and export
of precursor chemicals," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, China examined 568 such import and export cases,
and 35 cases of illicit trading were discovered and curbed. As a
result, 3,380 tons of chemical products were withheld from export.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1999, China cracked 360 cases involving the
production and trafficking of methamphetamines, dealing a heavy
blow to such activities, the paper disclosed.

Foreword
</P>
<P>
The present globalization of the drug issue has posed a grave
menace to human well-being and development. According to data
published by the United Nations in 1998, 21 million people
worldwide suffered from cocaine or heroin addiction, and another
30 million from the abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants.
</P>
<P>
On her southwestern border China is adjacent to the "Golden
Triangle," one of the main sources of drugs in the world. Since
the late 1970s, the illicit international narcotics tide has
constantly invaded China, and criminal drug-related activities
touched off by transit drug trafficking have re-emerged. The
number of drug addicts has kept rising, drug-related cases have
constantly increased, the drug scourge is becoming more serious
with each passing day, and the situation is grim for the anti-drug
struggle. In 1999, China cracked down 65,000 drug-related criminal
cases, and confiscated 5.364 tons of heroin, 1.193 tons of opium,
16.059 tons of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as "ice"),
and some cocaine, MDMA and marijuana. In 1999, the number of drug-
related cases cracked and the total amount of drugs confiscated
increased by 2.4 percent and 33.6 percent, respectively, over 1998.
The number of drug addicts registered with the public security
organs in 1991 was 148,000, a figure which rose to 520,000 in 1995,
and to 681,000 in 1999. Now drug addicts account for 0.054 percent
of China's total population. Of the drug addicts, those taking
heroin make up 71.5 percent, and those under the age of 35 amount
to 79.2 percent. By the end of 1999, of a total of 17,316 reported
cases of AIDS virus infection, those infected by intravenous
injections of drugs made up 72.4 percent. At present, each
province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the
Central Government in China suffers from illegal drug-related
activities to a certain extent, and China has been turned from a
victim of the transit drug trade into a victim of both drug
transit and consumption.

Illicit drugs bring calamity to any country and people.
Launching an anti-drug struggle to eliminate the drug scourge is
the historical responsibility of the Chinese government. In old
China, drugs once brought hideous disaster to the nation. But
after the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949,
the Chinese government led the Chinese people in a momentous
struggle against drugs. In a short period of three years, China
wiped out the scourge of opium, which had scourged China for a
century, thus performing a miracle acknowledged by the whole world.
Confronting the new drug problem, the Chinese government, taking
an attitude of supreme responsibility to the state, the nation and
the people, and the mankind as a whole, and standing firm in
strictly prohibiting illegal drugs, has adopted all necessary
measures and done its utmost to ban illicit drugs for the benefit
of the people.
</P>
<P>
I. Sticking to the Position of Strict Drug Control
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that drugs are a worldwide
public hazard confronting the whole of mankind, and drug control
is an imminent and common responsibility incumbent to
international society. Drugs harm people's health, give rise to
corruption and crimes, disrupt sustainable development and
endanger national security and world peace. Therefore, all illegal
activities involving drugs must be strictly prohibited and
eliminated. The Chinese people feel keenly the harm of drugs, and
know that drug control is in their fundamental interests.
Safeguarding citizens' lives, and protecting the people's
subsistence and development are the lofty responsibilities of the
Chinese government. For many years, the Chinese government has
taken drug control as a fundamental objective, and has formulated
and implemented a series of principles, policies and measures in
this regard.

-- Attending to drug control as a vital matter involving the
rise and fall of the Chinese nation. We take drug control as a
basic policy and include it in the program for national economic
and social development, and make it an important duty of
governments at all levels. The governments at all levels have set
up a drug control work responsibility system that suits the actual
conditions of China to maintain the permanent momentum in drug
control.
</P>
<P>
-- Implementing a comprehensive drug control strategy. We take
drug control as a complex social system project and a long-term
strategic task, and use various means in a comprehensive way --
law, administration, the economy, culture, education, and medical
treatment, to mobilize and organize all social walks of life to
participate in the anti-drug struggle.
</P>
<P>
-- Persisting in drug control according to law. In accordance
with the general plan of exercising the rule of law, we have
persisted in setting up and perfecting a system of laws and
regulations concerning drug control, administered and controlled
narcotics, psychotropic substances, and precursor chemicals,
prevented and punished drug-related crimes. We have resolutely
cracked down on various illegal activities involving drugs,
started drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation, corrected,
cured and rescued drug addicts, so as to guarantee that drug
control work proceeds in a law-governed manner.

In China, drug control is led by governments at all levels, in
the care of the drug control departments of public security
authorities, co-administered by relevant government functional
departments and participated in jointly by mass organizations. In
1990, the Chinese government set up the National Narcotics Control
Commission (NNCC), composed of 25 departments, including the
Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Health and General
Administration of Customs. The NNCC leads the nation's drug
control work in a unified way, and is responsible for
international drug control cooperation, with an operational agency
based in the Ministry of Public Security. In 1998, with the
approval of the State Council, the Ministry of Public Security set
up the Drug Control Bureau, which also serves as an operational
agency of the NNCC. Now, the governments of all the 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities and most counties (cities
and districts) in China have set up corresponding drug control
leading organs. Meanwhile, the public security organs of 24
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and of the 204
regions (cities and prefectures) and 735 counties (cities and
districts) under the jurisdiction of these provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities have set up police anti-drug squads.
The Chinese People's Armed Police, frontier defense force of the
public security authorities, judicial departments, Customs,
supervision and control organs of pharmaceuticals, and
administration departments for industry and commerce also
undertake corresponding anti-drug law enforcement tasks.
Governments at all levels in China include the funds required for
drug control in their financial budgets, and along with the
development of the national economy and the needs of the drug
control situation, the funds allocated for such purpose are
expected to increase every year. In 1998, the China Narcotics
Control Foundation was set up, with the approval of the State
Council, aiming at collecting funds from society at large to
support drug control work.

II. Constantly Strengthening Drug Control Legislation
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the building of the legal
system in drug control and persists in drug control according to
law. In view of the drug rampancy over the past 20-odd years,
China has speeded up legislation in drug control, and has
formulated and promulgated a whole array of laws and regulations,
thanks to which, great progress has been made in legal system
building in this field. Criminal legislation for drug control has
improved step by step. On July 1, 1979, the Criminal Law of the
PRC was adopted at the Second Session of the Fifth National People
's Congress (NPC), which specified the crimes of manufacturing,
trafficking and transporting drugs, and the relevant punishments.
In the 1980s, the NPC Standing Committee issued, successively, the
Customs Law of the PRC, the Regulations of the PRC on
Administrative Penalties for Public Security, the Resolution on
Severely Punishing Criminals Who Have Seriously Sabotaged the
Economy, the Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Smuggling, and
other laws, which formulated further regulations on punishing drug-
related crimes and raised the highest legal punishment for serious
drug-related crimes to the death penalty. On December 18, 1990,
the 17th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh NPC
adopted the Decision on Drug Control, which included comprehensive
regulations on the types of drug-related crimes and penalties, the
punishments for drug addicts and compulsory drug addiction
rehabilitation, and clearly specified China's universal
jurisdiction over the crimes of smuggling, trafficking,
transporting and manufacturing drugs.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, 1997, at the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC, the
Criminal Law of the PRC was revised. On the basis of absorbing and
retaining the main contents of the Decision on Drug Control, the
revised Criminal Law made important amendments and supplements to
the legal regulations on drug-connected crimes, thus further
improving China's criminal legislation in this regard. The Supreme
People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate made
relevant judicial interpretations of the revised Criminal Law. (

<P>
Severely punishing drug-connected crimes is one of the
outstanding characteristics of China's criminal legislation for
drug control. The revised Criminal Law fully embodies this
principle. First, the law comprehensively specifies the types of
drug-related crimes, guaranteeing that various drug-related
criminal offenses are punished by law. The law specifies 12 crimes,
which cover the smuggling, trafficking, transporting and
manufacturing of drugs, the illegal holding of drugs, the
harboring, transferring and concealing of drugs and illicit drug-
related money, the smuggling of materials for manufacturing drugs,
the illegal trading in such materials, the illegal cultivation of
mother plants of narcotic drugs, the illegal trading, transporting,
hand-carrying and holding of seeds and seedlings of such plants,
and the illegal provision of narcotics and psychotropic substances,
as well as the criminal punishments for these crimes. In addition,
the penalties for the laundering of drug-related money are
stipulated. Second, the law specifies that the criminal
responsibility of a person for smuggling, trafficking,
transporting or manufacturing narcotic drugs, regardless of their
quantity, be legally pursued and punished. The quantity of drugs
shall be calculated according to the verified amount of the drugs
smuggled, trafficked, transported, manufactured or illegally held,
and not in terms of purity. Third, economic sanctions are applied
against drug-related crimes. The law specifies that property shall
be confiscated or a fine imposed for drug-related crimes, aiming
at depriving drug criminals of their illegal income and destroying
their economic ability to commit drug-related crimes again. Fourth,
those who make use of or instigate minors to smuggle, sell,
transport or manufacture drugs, sell drugs to minors, or lure,
instigate, deceive or force them into taking or injecting drugs,
and those who have again committed drug-related crimes after
having already been convicted of the crime of smuggling, selling,
transporting, manufacturing or illegally holding drugs shall be
punished with severity. Fifth, criminals who smuggle, sell,
transport or manufacture large amounts of drugs shall be sentenced
to death. The fact that China legislatively punishes drug-
connected crimes with severity is required by the reality of the
anti-drug struggle, and shows China's stand for strict drug
control.

<P>
Strict administration to prevent the abuse of narcotics and
psychotropic substances is a very important content of the
building of China's anti-drug legal system. Hence China has
promulgated more than 30 relevant laws, statutes and regulations.
In September 1984, the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee
of the Sixth NPC adopted the Law of the PRC on the Management of
Medicines and Chemical Reagents. Article 39 of the Law specifies:
The state adopts special procedures for the administration of
narcotics and psychotropic substances. In 1987 and 1988, the State
Council promulgated the Procedures for Narcotic Drug Control, and
the Procedures for Psychotropic Substances Control, which specify
clearly the administration of the production, supply,
transportation, use, import and export of narcotics and
psychotropic substances. In 1995, the State Council promulgated
the Procedures for Compulsory Drug Addiction Rehabilitation, and
the Ministry of Health issued the Procedures for the
Administration of Pharmaceuticals for Drug Addiction Treatment.
Hence the work in this regard has laws to follow.
</P>
<P>
To prevent precursor chemicals from being diverted into illegal
channels, and crack down on relevant illegal or criminal
activities, Chinese legislative bodies and the Chinese government
have also issued a series of laws and regulations for the strict
control of such chemicals. The Criminal Law of the PRC, the
Customs Law of the PRC, and the Decision on Drug Control made by
the NPC Standing Committee include stern penalties for the
criminal offenses of illegally trading and smuggling precursor
chemicals, ephedrine and other raw materials and ingredients
intended to be processed into drugs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislative organs of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan,
Guangdong, Gansu, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang and Jiangsu provinces, and
the Guangxi Zhuang and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions have worked
out local drug control statutes in accordance with local
conditions.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has formed a preliminary anti-drug legal
system with criminal laws as the mainstay, and administrative and
local statutes as supplements, thus providing powerful legal
weapons for the anti-drug struggle.

strictly and are waging a fierce battle against all drug-related
criminal activities, administering merciless punishment to those
involved in such activities.
</P>
<P>
In China, drugs mainly come from other countries, and the
Chinese government has done its best to ban transit drug
trafficking. In the 1980s, the government organized public
security, armed police and customs organs, and the civilian joint
defense teams to coordinate the fight against drug trafficking,
mainly in the southwest border areas and southeast coastal areas.
It mobilized a large number of people, a great quantity of
materials and a large amount of money. Three "lines of defense"
were set up to keep drugs from flowing in: The first line was the
borderland, where exit and entry were subject to strict
examination; the second line was composed of checkpoints in inland
regions; and the third line consisted of checks on vital lines of
communication, airports, railway stations and harbors. In the
1990s, the work of banning transit drug trafficking was further
intensified and attention was paid to "eradicating sources of
drugs and obstructing their channels of trafficking." Checking was
publicly done on key lines of communication, and at airports,
railway stations, sea ports and harbors, so that a situation was
created in which defense was organized in a unified way and
actions were coordinated with due divisions of labor and incoming
drug dealers were subject to encirclement, pursuit, obstruction
and interception. The functions of relevant organs such as the
public security, customs, forestry, posts and telecommunications,
railway, civil aviation and other transport departments have been
brought into full play, culminating in a signal victory in the
battle against drugs. Since 1982, more than 70,000 transit drug
trafficking cases have been cleared up in Yunnan Province alone,
and more than 80 tons of heroin and opium from the "Golden
Triangle" area have been confiscated. In May 1994, police in
Yunnan Province cracked an extraordinarily serious transnational
drug smuggling case, in which the "Golden Triangle" drug ring
kingpin was sentenced by the judicial organ to capital punishment
according to law. For many years China's law enforcement organs
have consistently adopted a highhanded policy in dealing with drug-
related criminal activities and struck heavy blows at the
overweening arrogance of the drug-related culprits both at home
and abroad.

While stemming the trafficking of drugs from abroad, the
Chinese government has continuously organized special battles
against drugs, constantly focusing attention on areas where drugs
constitute a serious problem and hitting hard at drug crimes at
home. In the three consecutive years from 1983 to 1986, China
launched a nationwide campaign to crack down on criminal offenses,
targeted mainly at drug-related crimes. In August 1992, the Yunnan
provincial government organized an 83-day armed drug elimination
operation, in which a massive drug- and weapon-smuggling ring
which had been operating in the town of Pingyuan, Wenshan
Prefecture, Yunnan Province, with the characteristics of a
criminal syndicate was smashed at one fell swoop. From 1993 to
1996, in the southwest border areas, the Ministry of Public
Security launched a three-year campaign against drugs and firearms.
In 1997, according to a unified deployment the NNCC launched a
momentous anti-drug campaign nationwide, with great success. Since
1999, under the unified organization of the NNCC key areas like
Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangdong and Gansu provinces and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have paid great attention to drug-
infested areas and cracked a sequence of major drug-related cases,
arrested a contingent of drug-traffickers, wiped out a batch of
drug-smuggling gangs and eradicated a number of underground drug-
dealing markets and networks. From 1991 to 1999, China's drug-
control organs cracked more than 800,000 drug cases, and
confiscated 39.67 tons of heroin, 16.894 tons of opium, 15.079
tons of marijuana and 23.375 tons of methamphetamine.

China is a country with a large population. So it needs a lot
of legal narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. While
endeavoring to protect people's health and meet the needs of
medical treatment, the government practices strict control of 118
narcotic drugs and 119 psychotropic substances, and their
production, trading, use and import and export are restricted to
prevent illegal circulation. The health and pharmaceuticals
control and management departments, as well as the agricultural,
industrial and commercial administration, foreign trade, customs,
public security, railway, civil aviation and other transport
departments in different areas carry out security checks every
year on the production, trading, transportation, and import and
export of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The illegal
production, trafficking and supply or abuse of such drugs and
substances are promptly investigated and punished. A large number
of criminal cases of stealing, illegal buying and selling or
addiction of pethidine and other narcotic drugs have been
investigated and severely dealt with in Heilongjiang, Shanxi and
Shaanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the
northern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government prohibits the cultivation of mother drug
plants. It has always taken this as a focal point of its drug
control work and paid constant attention to it as a way to nip
troubles in the bud. Every year, the NNCC instructs governments at
all levels to promote the activities to eradicate drug cultivation
and to carry out a responsibility system along that line. Anti-
drug publicity and education is conducted among the people and
efforts are made to investigate illegal drug planting and to see
that drug growers are punished and the plants are uprooted
wherever they are found. The local governments in key mountainous
and forested areas organize special teams every year to
investigate and check the illegal planting of mother drug plants.
Since 1992, the NNCC and forestry departments have organized
aerial surveillance of suspected planting in the primeval forests
in the Greater Hinggan Mountains in northeast China and in the
Lianhua Mountains in northwest China, with modern scientific and
technological methods. As a result of all this, China has
virtually eradicated the illegal cultivation of mother drug plants.

IV. Exercising Strict Control over the Precursor Chemicals
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, transnational smuggling and trafficking of
precursor chemicals and of ephedrine have increased rapidly in
tandem with the prevalence of the global drug problem and the
extended production of chemosynthesized drugs. The Chinese
government takes seriously its responsibility to the international
community to strictly control these chemicals and ephedrine, in
earnest compliance with its duties under international anti-drug
conventions.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations on the control of such chemicals have
gradually been perfected. In October 1988, the relevant government
departments issued a document on the control of exports of acetic
oxide, ether and chloroform, which can be used for synthesis of
heroin and other narcotic drugs. In January 1993, China exercised
control over the export licenses for the 22 precursor chemicals as
listed in the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and in June 1996 it also
exercised control over the import licenses for these chemicals. In
April 1997, China's relevant foreign trade department issued the
Interim Regulations on the Control of the Import and Export of
Precursor Chemicals, and in December 1999, the Regulations on the
Control of the Import and Export of Precursor Chemicals was
officially issued. At the same time, local regulations on the
overall control of the production, transportation, trading and use
of such chemicals were formulated in provinces such as Yunnan and
Sichuan that border on the sourcelands of narcotic drugs. At
present, the Chinese government is formulating nationwide
regulations on the control of such chemicals.

<P>
Regulations on the control of ephedrine have steadily been
improved. From 1992 to 1998, the relevant government departments
issued several regulations on the control of ephedrine. In March
1998, the State Council issued the Notice on Further Strengthening
the Control of Ephedrine. The notice stipulates that the
production, trading, transportation, use and export of ephedrine
shall be subject to special control. In December 1998, the
relevant departments jointly issued the Notice on Issues
Pertaining to the Strengthened Control of the Export of Ephedrine-
typed Products, exercising control over the export of the 12
saline products, semi-finished products, derivatives and single
preparations of ephedrine. In June 1999 and May 2000, they issued
the Procedures for the Control of Ephedrine and the Regulations on
the Control of Transportation Licenses for Ephedrine, which have
further improved the rules on the strict control of ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
The competent departments and law enforcement organs at all
levels strictly implement the state's relevant laws and
regulations, and continuously strengthen the supervision and
control of the production and circulation of precursor chemicals
and of ephedrine. The legal production and trading of these
chemicals and ephedrine are protected by law, but the illegal
buying and selling, trafficking and smuggling of these products
shall be severely punished. The border areas and ports of entry
and exit of provinces and autonomous regions in southwest,
northwest and northeast China have consistently investigated and
banned the import of drugs as well as the smuggling abroad of
those chemicals and ephedrine in pursuit of their "two-way
investigation program." From 1997 to 1999, China cracked 548 cases
of illegal buying, selling and smuggling of precursor chemicals
and confiscated more than 1,000 tons of illegal chemical products.

In collaboration with UN drug control organs and competent
departments of other countries, the relevant departments of China
have set up an international system to check the import and export
of precursor chemicals. In 1999 alone, China examined 568 such
import and export cases, and 35 cases of illicit trading were
discovered and curbed. As a result, 3,380 tons of chemical
products were withheld from export. From April to December 1999,
China discovered six cases of such illegal trading, and withheld 1,
160 tons of potassium permanganate from export, during the global
drive known as "Purple Action." China joined with more than 20
countries, regions and international organizations, during this
campaign to thwart illegal trafficking in potassium permanganate.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, China has exercised strict control over
amphetamines and other psychotropic substances. In view of the
fact that criminal activities involving the manufacture and
trafficking of methamphetamines have become increasingly rampant
in the past few years, Chinese public security organs have
launched several campaigns specially against such activities,
particularly in the southeast coastal areas of the country. In
1999, the NNCC added the prohibition of drug manufacture to its "
simultaneous promotion of three prohibitions" anti-drug principle
(simultaneous prohibition of addiction, trafficking and
cultivation of drugs), making it the "simultaneous promotion of
four prohibitions" principle. Public security authorities across
the country have thenceforth intensified their operations against
the manufacture and trafficking of methamphetamines and other drug-
related crimes, and these operations have been crowned with
outstanding success. From 1991 to 1999, China cracked 360 cases
involving the production and trafficking of methamphetamines,
dealing a heavy blow to such activities.

V. Treatment and Rehabilitation
</P>
<P>
To protect the physical and mental health of Chinese citizens,
maintain public order, and wipe out once and for all the scourge
of drugs, the Chinese government attaches great importance to and
vigorously carries out the work of drug prohibition and the
rehabilitation of addicts. To this end, it has adopted
comprehensive measures for the rehabilitation of addicts, and
their treatment and recovery, integrated with compulsory measures
and social help and education, in a concerted effort to eradicate
drug abuse and save drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, drug takers must be rehabilitated.
Therefore, an investigation and registration system and monitoring
networks of drug abuse have been established throughout the
country, regularly collecting data and materials, and promptly
monitoring the conditions of addicts. The State Council has
promulgated the Procedures for Compulsory Drug Addiction
Rehabilitation, and the related department has formulated the
Guiding Principles for Commonly Used Therapies Applicable to
Opiates Addicts and the Procedures for the Control of
Pharmaceuticals for Drug Addiction Treatment, to standardize the
work of the rehabilitation and treatment of addicts in China. The
state has also established drug dependence research centers, drug
abuse monitoring centers, drug dependence treatment centers and
narcotic drugs laboratories, and organized scientific research
institutions and experts to conduct research on scientific methods
of rehabilitation for addicts and pharmaceuticals for drug
addiction treatment. Proceeding from its concrete conditions,
China has adopted various measures to rehabilitate addicts, taking
compulsory measures as the main principle. All addicts are sent to
compulsory rehabilitation centers established by governments at
all levels. Those who resume drugs after receiving compulsory
treatment are sent to reeducation-through-labor centers
administered by judicial departments, where they are forced to
undergo treatment side by side with reeducation through physical
labor. Addicts who are unsuitable for receiving treatment in
compulsory rehabilitation centers are ordered to give up within a
definite time period under the guardianship of their family
members and the education and administration of the local public
security stations. Some local medical institutions also offer
services for the rehabilitation and treatment of volunteer addicts.
In some areas, measures adaptable to local conditions have also
been taken to supervise and help addicts become rehabilitated
through mass organizations and organizations at the grassroots
level.

In China, addicts mainly receive treatment at compulsory
rehabilitation centers and treatment and reeducation-through-labor
centers -- special schools for educating and saving addicts from
ruin. Specific and concrete provisions are formulated in the
Procedures for Compulsory Drug Addiction Rehabilitation on the
construction, administration, rehabilitation measures and welfare
provisions of compulsory rehabilitation centers. Chinese public
security and judicial organs have also formulated regulations on
the hierarchical and standardized administration of compulsory
rehabilitation centers and treatment and reeducation-through-labor
centers. Governments at all levels also earmark large amounts of
funds for the establishment of special rehabilitation centers each
year. At present, China has a total of 746 compulsory
rehabilitation centers and 168 treatment and reeducation-through-
labor centers (teams). In 1999, over 224,000 and 120,000 addicts
received treatment at compulsory rehabilitation centers and
treatment and reeducation-through-labor centers, respectively. The
rehabilitation centers carry out strict, scientific and civilized
administration according to law, adhering to the principle of
saving addicts through reform education. They offer to addicts
safe and scientific treatment, legal and moral education, and
strict training to correct their behavior, and organize them to
learn scientific and general knowledge, carry out varied and
stimulating recreational and sports activities, and engage in
appropriate productive labor, by which they can both improve their
physical agility and master skills to earn their livings. All the
income from their work is used to improve their living conditions.
To fully respect and guarantee the legal rights and interests of
addicts, the centers carry out an open security system and
voluntarily lay their work open to the supervision of the deputies
to the NPC and the general public. State narcotics control organs
and health and anti-epidemic departments jointly carry out the
work of survey, education, prevention and cure in connection with
AIDS at the centers, and conduct investigations into HIV infection
among addicts in some provinces. Endeavoring to realize
standardized administration, a number of centers in Yunnan,
Guizhou, Gansu and Guangdong provinces have created the experience
of "undergoing treatment along hospital lines, offering education
along school lines, managing the environment along garden lines
and achieving rehabilitation along labor lines," and have been
called "places of rebirth where I bade farewell to drugs" by many
addicts.

To solve the difficult problem of the high rate of relapse, the
Chinese government carries out the work of continuous help and
education for rehabilitated addicts upon their return to society,
relying on the masses and mobilizing all social forces. Local
public security organs, community organizations, units and
families closely cooperate with rehabilitation centers to
establish a social help and education system and various types of
help and education groups, and fully carry out the relevant
measures, organically integrating compulsory rehabilitation with
help, education and consolidation measures. Mass organizations,
including the trade unions, the Communist Youth League (CYL)
organizations, the women's federations and the associations of
self-employed industrialists and businessmen, help with the work
of rehabilitating addicted women, workers and staff members, young
people and self-employed laborers by making full use of their own
advantages, to great effect. Governments at all levels and
grassroots organizations actively help the rehabilitated addicts
to solve concrete problems in their life and work, so that they
will not be discriminated against in employment or admission to
higher education. Many addicts have returned to society and
started to lead a new life upon successful rehabilitation.

Narcotics prohibition and the rehabilitation of addicts are
breakthrough points in the effort to completely solve the drug
problem. In recent years, the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi
autonomous regions and Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have
gradually probed a new way of motivating the drug control work as
a whole--starting with the grassroots units (communities), and
stressing drug prohibition and the rehabilitation of addicts, to
establish "drug-free communities." The basic procedure is as
follows: With small communities in cities (sub-districts) and the
countryside (towns and townships) as the lowest units, and under
the unified leadership of the organs of state power in the
communities, establishing administrative and working
responsibility systems of drug prohibition covering the whole
community, dividing up the responsibilities and assigning a part
to each unit and individual to realize the "drug-free" target and
establish "drug-free communities," continuously enlarging their
coverage, and finally realizing the "drug-free" target in a
particular county, city or province. Baotou City in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region is a model in this regard. The drug
problem used to be very serious in the city. However, there has
been a drive to pronounce communities there "drug-free" since 1994,
stressing drug prohibition and the rehabilitation of addicts, and
establishing the working system of dividing the responsibilities
among the help and education groups and all the local grassroots
units. In this way, a situation has been created where all people
in Baotou are taking part in the anti-drug struggle. At present,
the city has a total of 2,169 help and education groups,
implementing the related measures to over 2,000 addicts, and the
consolidation rate of rehabilitation over one year has reached
more than 70 percent. It has also established 1,436 "drug-free
communities" (90.2 percent of the total), and basically realized
the "drug-free" target in the entire area.
</P>
<P>
Experience has proved that the drive to make communities drug-
free conforms to the situation in China and the strategic
requirements of mobilizing the entire people to treat the drug
problem comprehensively. "Drug-free community" is an effective
vehicle for protracted combat vs drugs. In 1999, the NNCC
publicized nationwide the advanced experience of Baotou and other
cities and made arrangements for activities to establish "drug-
free communities" across the country.

VI. Raising the Consciousness of the Entire People Against
Drugs
</P>
<P>
The key to drug control work lies in arousing the consciousness
of the general public. China regards it as a fundamental and
strategic task to raise the consciousness of the whole nation
concerning the fight against drugs, and carries out extensive and
deep-going drug prevention education among all the people.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels attach great importance to
publicizing the dangers of drugs, and formulate plans every year
to carry out drug prevention education to persuade the public to
turn their backs on drugs. Local drug control departments often
carry out education, publicity and consultation activities
concerning the dangers of narcotics and the anti-drug laws, using
the news media -- newspapers, radio and television programs, and
by other methods appealing to the general public, closely
cooperating with the departments of publicity, culture, radio,
film and television, and press and publications. The NNCC Office
and its local branches have also opened special telephone lines
providing advice and information on drug-related issues. Yunnan
and some other provinces and cities have started periodicals and
opened web pages on the Internet in this regard. Every year on
June 3, the commemoration date of Lin Zexu's burning of opium
stocks in Humen beach, Guangdong Province in 1839, and on June 26,
the International Day Against Illicit Drug Trafficking and Abuse,
local governments organize large-scale activities to publicize the
dangers of narcotics. As drug taking is a major channel for the
spread of AIDS, during the period of the World AIDS Day on
December 1 every year, public health departments organize
publicity activities, with the theme "refuse drugs, and prevent
AIDS."

From May to July, 1998, the Chinese government held a two-month
national exhibition on drug control. A total of 1.66 million
people from all walks of life, including Chinese state leaders and
young students, visited it. The exhibition provoked strong
repercussions, and exerted a far-reaching influence. The NNCC also
turned the contents of the exhibition into a Wall Map of the
National Exhibition on Drug Control for distribution throughout
the country. It also organized half-year itinerant exhibitions
throughout China, at which a total of over 166 million people
received education directly. The success of the national
exhibition on narcotics control brought China's publicity level
in this regard to a new stage, and played an active role in
raising the consciousness of the entire people about the drug
problem, giving a boost to drug control work in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches special importance to drug
prevention education for youngsters. Special provisions aimed at
protecting young people from drugs are included in the Law of the
PRC on the Protection of Minors issued at the 21st meeting of the
Standing Committee of the Seventh NPC in 1991, and the Law of the
PRC on the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency issued at the 10th
meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth NPC in 1999. In
pursuance of the guideline of paying special attention to
education on narcotics control and prevention among youngsters,
governments at all levels take the education of primary and middle
school students as a basic part of narcotics control work. In 1997,
the State Education Commission (SEC) and the NNCC issued a notice
stipulating that drug control education as an integral part of
education to improve people's cultural quality should become
formally part of the program of ethical education in primary and
middle schools, and that anti-drug education should be carried out
in diverse forms and with definite aims in view in colleges and
universities and primary and middle schools. The NNCC and SEC have
jointly compiled a series of anti-drug education pamphlets for
students. The CYL has also developed a variety of colorful
activities to publicize the dangers of narcotics among young
people, and mobilize them to fight against drugs. Many provinces
and autonomous regions have unfolded the drug prevention education
activities mainly for youngsters. In 1999, according to the
requirements of the NNCC, drug control departments at the county
level and above established communication centers of drug
prevention education in 24,223 primary and middle schools to
directly guide the work in schools.

In recent years, integrated with the efforts to develop "drug-
free communities," drug control publicity activities have been
gradually extended to communities to cover every nook and corner
of society. Governments at all levels give every encouragement to
sub-district offices, towns and townships, residents and villagers
committees in their drug control work by strengthening the
construction of organizations of political power at the grassroots
level and self-governing mass organizations, and actively carry
out basic work on narcotics prevention education, integrating this
with the efforts to develop "civilized communities." In the
meantime, trade unions, the CYL organizations and the women's
federations at all levels carry out anti-drug education among
workers and staff members, anti-drug publicity organized by young
volunteers, and the activity known as "preventing drugs entering
families." Local patriotic religious organizations actively
mobilize religious believers and personages of religious circle to
fight against drugs, carrying on their good tradition of shunning
evil and promoting good. The associations of self-employed
laborers and private enterprise operators at various levels have
conscientiously carried out the recommendations in the Notice on
Extensively Carrying Out Drug Prevention Education Among Self-
employed Laborers and Private Enterprise Operators in China issued
by the China Self-employed Laborers' Association, and strengthened
drug prevention education among the 80 million employees of
private enterprises. In recent years, the NNCC has sent various
anti-drug publicity materials to compulsory rehabilitation centers,
houses of detention, public security houses of detention,
reformatories, reeducation-through-labor centers, prisons and work-
study schools for juvenile delinquents throughout China to
reinforce drug prevention education among the people who are most
likely to fall victims to narcotics.
</P>
<P>
To make drug prevention education a systematic and regular
practice, the NNCC has made overall arrangements to carry out the
"five-one project" of anti-drug education nationwide from 1999 to
2001: Every province, autonomous region and municipality should
establish a drug control education base; every primary and middle
school, college and university should carry out an anti-drug
education activity each year; and every district should organize a
batch of research achievements on anti-drug publicity and theory,
produce a number of literary and artistic works, and train a
contingent of young volunteers in this regard. The state gives
full support to Beijing, Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Dongguan in
Guangdong Province and some other cities in their efforts to build
permanent drug control education bases. In the meantime, China has
published the Yearly Report on Drug Control in China since 1998.

VII. Developing International Cooperation in Drug Control
</P>
<P>
It is highly necessary to strengthen international cooperation
in drug control to promote the battle against narcotics worldwide
and radically solve the drug problem in China. On the basis of
clinging to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (mutual
respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-
aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence), China has
all along actively participated in and promoted international
cooperation in drug control and played an important role in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government takes an active part in international
affairs connected with drug control. In June 1985, approved by the
NPC Standing Committee, China acceded to the UN 1961 Single
Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1971 Convention on
Psychotropic Substances that had been revised by the 1972 Protocol.
In September 1989, China obtained the approval of the NPC Standing
Committee to accede to the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, becoming one of the
first member countries to it. Beginning in 1984, China has sent
delegations many times to attend international drug control
meetings held by the United Nations, the International Criminal
Police Organization, the World Customs Organization and the World
Health Organization. In October 1989, China held the Asian Region
Anti-Drug Seminar in Beijing and in November 1996, hosted the
International Stimulant Specialists Meeting in Shanghai. The
Chinese government sent delegations to take part in the 17th and
20th UN special General Assembly sessions on drug control in
February 1990 and June 1998, declaring the Chinese government's
resolute anti-drug stand, policies and measures to the
international community.

China is an active supporter and promoter of cooperation in
drug control in the sub-region, as initiated by the UN. In May
1991, the NNCC of China hosted the first meeting of senior
officials of China, Thailand, Myanmar and the United Nations Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) in Beijing, to discuss the proposal on
multilateral cooperation against drug abuse in the sub-region. In
June 1992, China, Myanmar and the UNDCP signed the China/Myanmar/
UNDCP Joint Cooperation Project on Drug Control in Rangoon,
Myanmar. In October 1993, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and the
UNDCP signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Narcotic Drugs
Control, which stressed keeping contacts between high officials to
further the cooperation in drug control in the sub-region. On May
1995, China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and the
UNDCP convened the first minister-level meeting on cooperation in
sub-region drug control in Beijing. The meeting adopted the
Beijing Declaration and signed the Sub-region Drug Control Program
of Action. In 1999, the Chinese government sent delegations to
attend the sub-region minister-level meetings in Japan and Laos to
continue to promote enthusiastic cooperation in drug control in
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
China has constantly strengthened bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in drug control with other countries. In 1985 China
began to cooperate with the United States in drug control, and in
1987 the governments of the two nations signed the Sino-US
Memorandum of Cooperation in Narcotic Drugs Control. In 1997, the
heads of the two states signed the Sino-US Joint Statement
containing contents on cooperation in drug control, which upgraded
this cooperation between the two countries to a new level.
Subsequently, the governments of China and the United States
mutually accredited anti-drug liaison officers. Meanwhile, China
attached importance to the cooperation in drug control with Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In April 1996, China and
Russia signed the Agreement on Cooperation Against Illicit
Trafficking and Abuse of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances. In 1998 the heads of state of China, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan signed a joint statement, taking
cracking down drug-connected and transnational crimes as major
contents in cooperation among the five countries. In addition, the
Chinese government has signed bilateral agreements on cooperation
in drug control with the governments of Mexico, India, Pakistan,
Colombia and Tajikistan.

<P>
For many years, China has developed cooperation in many forms
with the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Australia, Thailand,
Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia in anti-drug information
exchange, training and law enforcement. Since 1996, China has
successively established a liaison officer system of anti-drug law-
enforcement cooperation in border areas with Myanmar, Laos,
Vietnam and Russia. Besides, the police authorities of China, the
United States, Canada, Japan and the Republic of Korea have on
many occasions jointly cracked cases of illicit traffic in drugs
through international anti-drug information exchange and judicial
cooperation, effectively deterring transnational drug-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has done its utmost to enthusiastically
help bordering countries to unfold anti-drug combat. Beginning in
1990, China has actively helped the northern parts of Myanmar and
Laos, where poppies were traditionally planted, to promote
alternative development by means of providing technological and
agricultural support and developing tourism resources. These
efforts, to some degrees, have promoted the economic and social
development in that region, consequently helping to reduce the
threats brought to China and international community by the "
Golden Triangle" drugs. At the same time, China has received
energetic support and help from the UNDCP in international
cooperation.

<P>
Over the past 20 years or so, China has made outstanding
achievements in drug control and gained a shower of praise from
international community. In the meantime, the Chinese government
has soberly realized that the waves of the rising international
drug tide is buffeting China more severely than ever and such
situation could not be eliminated in the short run. The drug
problem is still rampant in China and therefore the fight against
drug abuse in China is a heavy task, and there is a long way ahead
in this regard. At this important moment when a new millennium is
dawning on mankind and the old century is giving place to the new,
international community has realized more unanimously than ever
the urgency and importance of drug control. It is a common wish of
people of all countries to solve the drug problem as soon as
possible and to build this planet into a healthy, civilized, happy
and beautiful world. During the new century, the Chinese
government will wage an unremitting, thoroughgoing struggle
against drugs nationwide and will not stop its efforts until drugs
are eradicated. The Chinese government will, as always, strengthen
cooperation with other countries and make unremitting efforts to
completely eliminate narcotic drugs and build a world free from
the drug scourge.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes White Paper on Drug Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council today published a white paper entitled "Narcotics
Control in China", on the government's position on the issue and
the achievements it has scored in the work.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, the first of its kind ever issued by the
Chinese government, is to mark the International Anti-Drug Day. It
comprises a foreword and seven chapters.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper says that the present globalization of the drug
issue has posed a grave menace to human well-being and development.
According to data published by the United Nations in 1998, 21
million people worldwide suffered from cocaine or heroin addiction,
and another 30 million from the abuse of amphetamine-type
stimulants.
</P>
<P>
Currently the situation is grim for the anti-drug struggle in
China, it says. In 1999, the number of drug-related cases cracked
and the total amount of drugs confiscated increased by 2.4 percent
and 33.6 percent, respectively, over 1998; the number of drug
addicts registered with the public security organs was 148,000 in
1991, and it rose to 520,000 in 1995, and again to 681,000 in 1999.
Now drug addicts account for 0.054 percent of China's total
population.

<P>
In 1990, the Chinese government set up the National Narcotics
Control Commission (NNCC), composed of 25 departments, including
the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Health and General
Administration of Customs. In 1998, the Ministry of Public
Security set up the Drug Control Bureau. Now, the governments of
all the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities and
most counties (cities and districts) in China have set up
corresponding drug control leading organs, and 24 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have set up police anti-drug
squads. The Chinese People's Armed Police, frontier defense force
of the public security authorities, judicial departments, Customs,
pharmaceuticals supervision and control organs, and administration
departments for industry and commerce also undertake corresponding
anti-drug law enforcement tasks. In 1998, the China Narcotics
Control Foundation was set up with the approval of the State
Council, to raise funds from society at large to support drug
control work.

<P>
Attaching great importance to the building of the legal system
in drug control, China has formulated and promulgated a whole
array of laws and regulations and raised the highest legal
punishment for serious drug-related crimes to the death penalty,
the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1999, China's drug-control organs cracked more
than 800,000 drug cases, and confiscated 39.67 tons of heroin, 16.
894 tons of opium, 15.079 tons of marijuana and 23.375 tons of
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
China has virtually eradicated the illegal cultivation of
mother drug plants, and it is exercising strict control over the
precursor chemicals, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, China examined 568 such import and export cases,
and 35 cases of illicit trading were discovered and curbed. As a
result, 3,380 tons of chemical products were withheld from export.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the NNCC added the prohibition of drug manufacture to
its "simultaneous promotion of three prohibitions" anti-drug
principle (simultaneous prohibition of addiction, trafficking and
cultivation of drugs), making it the "simultaneous promotion of
four prohibitions" principle.

The White Paper says that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to and vigorously carries out the work of drug
prohibition and the rehabilitation of addicts.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it has adopted comprehensive measures for the
rehabilitation of addicts, and their treatment and recovery,
integrated with compulsory measures and social help and education,
in a concerted effort to eradicate drug abuse and save drug
addicts, it says.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has a total of 746 compulsory rehabilitation
centers and 168 treatment and reeducation-through-labor centers (
teams). In 1999, over 224,000 and 120,000 addicts received
treatment at compulsory rehabilitation centers and treatment and
reeducation-through-labor centers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China regards it as a fundamental and strategic task to raise
the consciousness of the whole nation concerning the fight against
drugs, and carries out extensive and deep-going drug prevention
education among all the people. Local drug control departments
often carry out education, publicity and consultation activities
concerning the dangers of narcotics and the anti-drug laws,
according to the White Paper.

The White Paper points out that governments at all levels are
taking the education of primary and middle school students as a
basic part of narcotics control work and making drug control
education as an integral part of education to improve people's
cultural quality to become formally part of the program of ethical
education in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
To develop international cooperation in drug control, China has
all along actively participated in and promoted international
cooperation in drug control and played an important role in this
field, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has acceded to a series of international
conventions on narcotics and psychotropic substances, and
participated in and presided over many international conferences
on drug control.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China has cooperated with foreign countries on many
occasions, and Chinese police and their foreign counterparts have
jointly cracked cases of illicit traffic in drugs through
international anti-drug information exchange and judicial
cooperation, effectively deterring transnational drug-related
crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Spaniards Alex Corretja and Albert
Costa have carried out their threat and boycotted Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
The players were angry they were not seeded for the Grand Slam
event which begins on Monday and pulled out of the tournament on
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed it was in protest at the All England Club's
method of giving grasscourt players preferential seedings.
</P>
<P>
Normally players would be fined for such a controversial move
but All England Club Chairman Tim Phillips said the club would
waive any
fines.
</P>
<P>
Corretja said: "Mentally I don't feel like playing this year's
Wimbledon because I don't see myself respected as a person and as
a player."
</P>
<P>
Corretja, Costa and Juan Carlos Ferrero, all ranked among the
top 16 in the ATP Tour rankings, missed being seeded last week in
Wimbledon's top 16 because of their poor record on grass.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero subsequently withdrew, claiming a late back injury.
</P>
<P>
Costa was to face Richard Krajicek in Monday's first round and
Corretja was to face American Todd Martin, another strong
grasscourt player.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Werner Eschauer takes Costa's place and German Michal
Kohlmann fills in for Corretja.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- World Cup winners France captured
the fourth and last semifinal berth of the Euro 2000 after Spain's
top striker Raul Gonzalez fired a last-minute penalty over the bar
to give France a 2-1 victory in the quarter-final match played in
Bruges of Belium.
</P>
<P>
France will meet Portugal in the semifinal scheduled in
Brussels on Wednesday for a place in the July 2 final.
</P>
<P>
Zinedine Zidane put France 1-0 ahead by curling in a 23-meter
free kick in the 33rd minute. With only 5 minutes later, Gaizka
Mendieta replied with a penalty to tied it at 1-all.
</P>
<P>
The French regained the lead a minute before the interval when
Patrick Vieira found Youri Djorkaeff with a diagonal pass and the
forward drove it between Santiago Canizares and his near post.
</P>
<P>
But the Spaniards, who scored two injury time goals to beat
Yugoslavia 4-3 in their third group game, should have forced extra
time when French 'keeper Fabien Barthez pulled down Abelardo
Fernandez and were awarded a penalty. But Raul blazed the spot
kick over the bar.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing really to say." said Spanish coach Jose
Antonio after the match.

"We played well and tried to win the game but we couln't and
now we're on our way home." he added.

The French went into the game on the back of a 3-2 loss to the
Dutch, who crushed Yugoslavia 6-1 in another quarterfinal, while
the Spaniards had won two games in a row after an upset loss to
Norway in their opening game.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Barak Government Survives First Test of Confidence Since Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government easily defeated a no-confidence motion in the
Knesset (Parliament) Monday evening, a sign that it has pulled
through the political crisis in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The voting of the motion, submitted by the major opposition
Likud party over Barak's alleged "intention to transfer the Jordan
Valley to the Palestinians," was 19 for, 56 against, with six
abstentions, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak agreed to transfer most of the Jordan
valley to the Palestinians in the recent talks. However, Barak had
stated that such media speculations were "inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
As expected, the ultra-orthodox religious Shas party, the major
rebellious ruling partner in Barak's coalition in the past few
weeks, ordered its Knesset members to vote with the government.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which threatened to quit the coalition, agreed to stay in
the government after reached an agreement with Barak's One Israel
bloc at the last minute on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement satisfied most of its demands, including funding
allocations for its ailing education network, legalizing its pirate
radio stations, having a say in the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The support of Shas, which has 17 seats in the 120-member
Knesset, for the government made Likud's no-confidence motion
virtually destined to failure.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Shas also helped the government to
block an early-election bill in Knesset's Constitution, Law and
Justice Committee Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary panel decided to recommend to the Knesset
plenary the dismissal of the bill calling for the dissolution of
Knesset, which passed its preliminary reading earlier in the month
with the help of then rebellious Shas.
</P>
<P>
Two votes from Shas members in the committee were pivotal, as
the recommendation was approved by a majority of eight to six.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by Avigdor Lieberman from National Union-
Yisrael Beiteinu to dissolve the 15th Knesset and hold early
elections, passed its preliminary reading by a vote of 61-48 in the
Knesset on June 7.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset plenary reportedly will discuss the bill on Tuesday
or Wednesday to give its final decision on the bill.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, if the bill is dismissed, the
oppositions should wait at least six months before tabling a
similar one asking for early elections.

<HEADLINE> Intefada on the Way if Peace Talks Fail, Arafat Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat threatened on Tuesday that the Palestinian people
will take up the intefada (popular uprising) again if a peace
agreement with Israel is not reached by September 13.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua in his office in Ramallah,
the West Bank, Arafat said if the deadline of September 13 passes
without a peace accord, he would walk out of Palestinian
territories and let the Israeli government to "talk directly with
his people."
</P>
<P>
"I have told U.S. President Bill Clinton not long ago that if
the peace talks with Israel fail, the Palestinian people will
return to the intefada" to gain their legal rights, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
September 13 is the target date for a final peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians settling the thorniest issues
such as the status of Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, borders,
water resources distribution and the fate of millions of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said earlier on Monday that if the
intefada emerged this time, "a blood river will run through the
Palestinian territories."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinian people have the right to declare an
independent state any time after September 13, but the timing will
be decided at the Palestinian Central Council meeting on July 2-3
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said Sunday that he would declare
Palestinian statehood within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also emphasized that he would "reject any attempt to
postpone the negotiations of the permanent status of Palestine" and
leave some issues unsolved this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed to seal a partial framework accord with the
Palestinians and leave some of the toughest issues for future
discussions, such as the status of Jerusalem and Palestinian
refugees' right to returning to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
On his upcoming meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Arafat said they would mainly discuss the implementation
of Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrives in the Middle East region on Tuesday in a bid
to breathe life into the stalled peace process and narrow the gap
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides for a summit meeting in
Washington between Arafat, Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we have not decided when or whether to hold a
trilateral summit meeting" which aims to reach a framework
agreement as soon as possible, Arafat said.

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presumptive Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush Monday suggested that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) be split into two
agencies to woo the Latino voters in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor told the League of United Latin American
Citizens that by splitting the INS into two, one agency will
welcome new immigrants and another will strictly enforce the
nation's borders.
</P>
<P>
"It's an agency that sends mixed signals to the people we're
trying to help," Bush said in a speech to an audience of about 600.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be saying loud and clear to people that the INS is
to help families and to help people understand the maze of rules

Bush also promised to lift the ban on the visit of the spouses
and minor children of legal permanent residents while their own
entry applications are being processed.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Greek Presidents Drive Bilateral Ties Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
and his Greek counterpart, Konstantinos Stephanopoulos, Monday
discussed here bilateral ties, international and regional issues
of common concern, pledging to advance bilateral cooperation to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
During the over-two-hour meeting in the Kremlin, the presidents
discussed in detail bilateral relations, and problems of
international security, including issues of combating
international terrorism, the situation in the Balkans, Putin told
journalists after the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also mulled ways to expand cooperation in the
fields of military technology and energy, especially in the gas
industry and the construction of electrical plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European direction of Russia's foreign policy is "one of
our priorities, and in that respect, our relations with Greece
have particular importance," he said, describing the development
of bilateral ties in latest years as "positive and effective."
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Greece are brought together not only by their
spiritual and cultural links, we also have evolved the same or
similar opinions and stands on a number of international issues of
late," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the prospects for the two countries' economic
relations are good although a certain decline in bilateral trade
was witnessed over the past 18 months as a result of the recent
world crisis, which dealt a heavy blow on Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain a very good relationship. There are no problems
between Russia and Greece, but only questions that need to be
discussed and solved together," said Stephanopoulos in reply, who
arrived in Moscow Sunday for an official visit, also the first
visit by a Greek president to Russia since 1993.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that both nations see broad potential for
strengthening bilateral interaction, which is developing
inspiringly.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo problem, Putin said the Balkan crisis should be
solved according to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Russia's support for Yugoslavia's territorial
integrity and called for involving the Yugoslav leadership in
solving the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to seek the full demilitarization of Kosovo
and the disarmament of the Kosovo Albanian army. All existing
problems should be settled proceeding from the norms of
international law," he stressed, welcoming Greece's proposal to
settle some of the disputes in legal form.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president told the joint news conference that Athens
"takes most seriously Russia's proposal for creating a pan-
European anti-missile system." He expressed the hope that such an
important matter would be settled on the basis of cooperation and
the mutual understanding of all interested countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Monday's summit, the two countries' foreign
ministers signed a convention on avoiding double taxation.

<HEADLINE> China Underlines Cooperation and Equality in World Disarmament Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China said here Monday that
the cooperation on an equal footing is essential for progress in
international disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told the plenary meeting of the United Nations
Disarmament Commission (UNDC) that "the Chinese delegation
maintains that cooperation on an equal footing is essential for
progress in international disarmament efforts. This has been true
in the past and will remain so in the future."
</P>
<P>
"This is also an important part of the new security concept
advocated by China, which is based on mutual trust, mutual benefit,
equality and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak,
should have an equal right to security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament is not intended to enhance the security of an
individual country or a group of countries," he said. "Disarmament
should not become a tool for stronger nations to control weak ones,
still less should it be an instrument for a handful of countries
to optimize their armament in order to seek unilateral security
advantage."
</P>
<P>
"To carry out cooperation in the field of disarmament, all
countries should accommodate each other's security concerns and to
abandon unilateralism and hegemonism," he said. "Some countries
pursue the doctrine of 'mine is mine, yours is negotiable', and
frequently impose economic sanctions on other countries under the
pretext of nonproliferation."
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach is by no means desirable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the framework of collective security, enhancement of
international cooperation and common efforts offer the only
correct and effective way to address the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation also requires all nations to respect and
abide by international arms control and disarmament instruments,
and to abandon cynicism in this area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A certain state asks others to fulfill treaty obligations,
while keeping freedom of action for itself," he said. "When
ratifying a treaty, it adopted domestic legislation in violation
of the purposes of the treaty."
</P>
<P>
"It even threatened to withdraw from a treaty under groundless
pretexts," he said. "Such are demonstrations of hegemonism and
double standard, which will undermine international disarmament
efforts."
</P>
<P>
"China has always attached importance to the UNDC, and has
participated in its every session in a constructive manner," he
said. "The Chinese delegation holds the view that the UNDC plays
an irreplaceable role in formulating guidelines for international
arms control and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"Under current circumstances when international disarmament
efforts have come to a crossroads, we need the UNDC even more to
explore principles and ways to advance the disarmament process,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session was presided over by the UNDC chairman,
Javad Zarif, who is currently Iran's deputy foreign minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the
World Bank signed Monday an agreement to develop a Shared Agenda
for Health in the Americas to coordinate efforts to help Latin
American and Caribbean countries improve health conditions and
public health services.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by IDB President Enrique V. Iglesias,
PAHO Director Dr. George A.O. Alleyne and World Bank Vice
President David de Ferranti, creates a coordination group of the
three organizations that will meet monthly to share critical
information and identify opportunities to implement joint actions.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will be focused on improving the health
conditions of the most vulnerable groups of the population and on
fostering quality and equal access to health services, the IDB
said.
</P>
<P>
This initiative will allow the three institutions to coordinate
and complement each other's activities in health in the region at
all levels at which they work, regionally, subregionally,
nationally, and locally, while continuing to pursue their ongoing
independent activities.
</P>
<P>
The document identifies three fundamental areas for
collaboration: support for the health sector reform process,
including not only health services but also basic sanitation;
institutional strengthening of public health programs, on health
promotion as well as disease prevention and control; and
strengthening the leadership of health authorities in all
developmental areas that affect health.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland authorities Monday
banned the Protestant Orange Order from marching through a Roman
Catholic neighborhood when it stages a parade in the flashpoint
Drumcree area on July 2.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report quoted the Parades Commission as saying in
Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, that it had imposed
the ban to avoid a "risk of disorder" in the area some 40 miles (
65 kilometers) southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, scuffles broke out during an Orange Order march
in west Belfast and an angry Catholic crowd hurled bottles and
bricks at police. A senior Catholic republican politician was
slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The Parades Commission said it could not allow this Sunday's
parade to go along the Catholic Garvaghy Road as the Orangemen had
proposed.
</P>
<P>
"A parade along the Garvaghy Road... risks being interpreted as
a deliberate attempt to raise tension," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's majority Protestants hold the parades to
celebrate ancient battlefield victories. They anger Catholics who
regard them as triumphalist.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order was not available for comment on the
commission's ban but it has condemned similar decisions in recent
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. B2B Non-Service Spending to Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Internet
business-to-business in the United States is expected to grow 20-
fold over the next five years, opening the doors for new business
models such as Net markets and coalition markets, according to a
study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 6 trillion U.S. dollars in online B2B trade is
expected by 2005, representing 42 percent of total U.S. B2B non-
service spending, according to the study by Jupiter Research, an
American research company specializing in Internet commerce. The
research defines online B2B trade as any sale made by business to
a business where either the terms of the transaction are agreed
upon online, or the majority of terms or item features are
configured online.
</P>
<P>
The research found that Internet B2B trade in the year 2000
will represent only 3 percent of the total U.S. B2B non-service
market, or 336 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the direct channel, the commerce of one seller to
many buyers, dominates 92 percent of the Internet B2B market. In
2005, however, 35 percent of the Internet B2B trade volume will be
conducted via a Net market, a matching up of many buyers and many
sellers, or through a coalition market, which comprises a
consortium of buyers or sellers, according to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
The value proposition of the Internet is on a grander scale for
the B2B space; the sheer size of B2B trade, coupled with
inefficient process, makes the Internet migration of business
strategies very attractive to companies, the study found.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next several years, businesses will face an array of
new opportunities to improve and expand their sales and
procurement processes," Jupiter said. "They must invest now, even
though the payoff will take some time; it will require several
years to see a substantial migration from today's manual, paper-
based solutions to tomorrow's Internet purchasing counter."

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealings Increase in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has experienced an increase
in drug dealings despite the stringent measures by the government
to combat the problem, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said on
Monday the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) had arrested 8,695
drug dealers in the last 10 years when officiating celebrations to
mark this year's National Day Against Drugs in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 alone accounted for a total of 1,867 arrests of
drug dealers and a seizure of narcotic drugs with a street value
of 6 billion kwacha (about 2 million U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the DEC to continue with its program of
disseminating drug- related information to schools, colleges and
the community in order to enable young people to resist
temptations to take drugs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, DEC Commissioner Raphael Mungole
urged the government to fund his organization adequately if it was
to fight the drug scourge in the country effectively.
</P>
<P>
He added that the arrest of 930 drug traffickers and seizure of
narcotic drugs with a street value of 3.4 billion kwacha (about
1.1 million dollars) on June 25 this year was an indication that
the DEC was committed in tackling the drug problem in Zambia.

LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed and 20
houses burnt as the feuding Ife and Modakeke communities in
Nigeria's southeastern Osun state clashed again over the weekend,
police said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started a day after President Olusegun Obasanjo
met with the traditional rulers of both communities as part of
effort to end the age-long crisis.
</P>
<P>
A panel set up by the government in May to mediate between the
 communities, after several dozens of persons were killed in
similar clashes, is yet to submit its report.
</P>

Land dispute and political control are at the core of the

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Develop Irrigation to Feed Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopian official
emphasized here Monday that Ethiopia had no alternative but
develop irrigation agriculture to produce sufficient food for its
population.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Nile 2002 Conference, Water
Resources Minister Shiferaw Jarso said Ethiopia can not hope to
feed its ever growing population with the kind of its present
farming method, which continues to depend on rain.
</P>
<P>
"It is because of our dependence on rain-fed agriculture that
we have repeatedly faced serious food shortages, and sometimes
famine", he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative for us except developing small, medium
and large scale irrigation schemes in order to secure adequate
food and create employment for the millions of rural population",
Shiferaw said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, about 10 million Ethiopians have
been in need of food aid because of crop failure as a result of
erratic rains during the past three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Ethiopian government's policy that irrigation
development will be carried out alongside hydro-power development
without causing significant negative impact to the co-basin
users," he said.
</P>
<P>
The eighth Nile 2002 conference is sponsored by the Canadian
International Development Agency, the United Nations Development
Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at encouraging discussion to foster cooperation
among the Nile riparian countries. The four-day meeting is being
attended by about 400 experts for the Nile riparian countries.
</P>
<P>
The 6,500 kilometer-long Nile, which is one of the longest
rivers in the world, runs across 10 countries. Despite
contributing 86 per cent of the water to the river, Ethiopia uses
a very small amount of the Nile resources.
</P>
<P>
Monday's sessions discussed country papers on policy nature,
and research papers on the social and environmental aspects of
developments of the Nile.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three days, the participants will also
deliberate, among others, on development priorities and management
of the Nile countries, solidarity and peace building among the
countries, the organizers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Lifting of Sanctions on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
on Monday that it opposes the lifting of U.N. sanctions against
Sudan until that country takes verifiable steps to end its support
for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the sanctions position, we do not support the
lifting of sanctions until the government of Sudan takes concrete,
verifiable steps to end its support for terrorist groups,"
spokesman Philip Reeker said in response to questions about recent
contacts between the U.S. and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a direct reflection of the U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 1044, 1054 and 1070, which set specific requirements,
which Sudan has not fulfilled," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said that Sudan has so far failed to turn over or
accounted for the suspects in a 1995 assassination attempt on the
life of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and to take convincing
steps to end its support for terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
As to U.S. special envoy Harry Johnston's recent trip to
Khartoum from June 12th to 14th, Reeker said that Johnston was
there to strengthen the Sudan peace process and to urge increase
access for humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity has reportedly urged the
Security Council to rescind sanctions imposed in 1996 after Egypt
accused Sudan of sheltering Moslem militants who tried to
assassinate President Mubarak in Addis Ababa a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
Observing the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking which falls on June 26, U.N. General Assembly
President Theo-Ben Gurirab said drugs are produced in both
industrialized and developing countries and in the rapidly
globalizing world, no country is immune of the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
In his message, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that
the huge sums of money generated by drug trafficking "fuels a
culture of corruption and violence which tears at the fabric of
civil society".
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to prevent drug abuse before it starts, as
drug trafficking responds to demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. Drug Control Program Pino
Arlacchi told journalist in New York that the internet was growing
more important as a means of exchanging information on how to
expand the illicit drug market and how to manufacture or find
illicit substances.
</P>
<P>
The International Day was observed against a backdrop of
growing drug menace. Wealth of today's worldwide illicit drug
trade is estimated at 400 billion U.S. dollars annually, according
to statistics of the United States where illegal drugs cost 110
billion dollars and claim 52,000 lives a year.

<HEADLINE> Survey Predicts Continued Volatility in U.S. Equity Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's top economists
and strategists predict that the U.S. market volatility recently
seen will continue over the next five years and forecast a sharp
decline in U.S. equity market returns, said a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. equity market is expected to return 9.1 percent
annualized over the next five years, dramatically below the 23
percent return over the last five years, according to a global
survey of 66 leading international investment institutions
conducted by KPMG LLP, the U.S. member firm of KPMG International
and professional service firm.
</P>
<P>
Double-digit returns are expected in specific asset classes
such as venture capital, international small cap-equities,
emerging market equities, small-cap equities, emerging market
bonds and international equities. For all other asset classes,
including global equities, large-cap equities, convertibles, real
estate, bonds and treasury bills, survey respondents forecast
single-digit returns.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates respondents expect venture capital
investments to provide the greatest return of any asset class over
five years, at 15.2 percent, followed by international small-cap
equities at 13.1 percent and emerging markets at 13 percent. The
only other asset groups expected to yield double-digit returns
over five years are U.S. small-cap equities with 12.4 percent,
emerging-market bonds with 10.6 percent and international equities
with a return of 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear indication that there is strong macroeconomic
support for a return to developing markets overseas as well as a
continuing rebound from the currency turmoil that ravaged the
markets in 1997," KPMG said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: German-Franco Axis Ensures European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, June 26 (Xinhua)--Visiting French President Jacques
Chirac Monday evening said the European integration would succeed
only when its German-Franco motor well functioned.
</P>
<P>
While giving a speech on the future of Europe to students at
Humboldt University, Berlin, Chirac urged Germany and France to co-
operate more closely for the future of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The further building-up of Europe, to which there is no
alternative, will succeed only when the German-Franco motor
functions well," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The road of European integration has met with a turning point,
"now the choice is necessary, and it can be painful to us all," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac praised a May speech by German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, who blueprinted a "European Federation." That vision is
an "intelligent option," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Fischer indicated in that speech a European constitution, a
bicameral parliament and a central government.
</P>
<P>
But presently the initiative of a "European Central Government
" has gone too far, said Chirac, "that will be totally
unacceptable to some member countries."
</P>
<P>
Every member in the future Europe will keep its identity and
nations will not disappear, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed what he told a Sunday television interview,
that a "European common constitutional framework" should be
drafted in two years.
</P>
<P>
The French President also urged the European youth to devote
to European integration.
</P>
<P>
"Never be skeptical, but be engaged in the construction of
Europe," he said, adding that the future Europe should not only
secure the democracy in every member country, but also create a "
European model" in social issues.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also indicated three-lingual courses in European
education system. "The European children should learn to speak two
foreign languages as early as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, the first French President to pay a state visit to
Germany in 13 years, arrived in Berlin Monday noon, when German
President Johannes Rau greeted him with military ceremony in front
of his presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France do not always share same opinion on
European integration. Deferent voices were heard when Rau said he
preferred a "European Charta" to Chirac's "European Constitution."
</P>
<P>
While giving speech at the state banquet for Chirac, Rau said
deferent laws in EU member countries should remain, and it was "on
the false way" to manage the total continent with a common basic
law.
</P>
<P>
There should be a "European Charta" to clearly divide the
powers of the European Union and its member countries, said Rau.
</P>
<P>
"The civil rights can be ensured in the way that only the most
needed are decided on European level," said Rau.
</P>
<P>
Before his trip to Berlin, the Chirac family had toured around
the Expo 2000 world fair in Hanover under the guidance of German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Chirac is due to give a speech in the Reichstag
building to depict more clearly his vision of Europe, which will
highlight his three-day visit to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Solana Urges Reinforced Cooperation in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's High
Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Spain's Javier
Solana, said here on Monday that reinforced cooperation in the EU
will be debated and decided before the end of the year at the
Inter-Government Conference to reform EU institutions in view of
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The former NATO secretary general, who met the press after
taking part in a book presentation, also said that the problem of
illegal immigration today is being tackled by individual Member
State governments but it was beginning to become an EU question.
</P>
<P>
While in Rome, the EU's foreign and security policy chief was
slated to meet with Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
Premier Giuliano Amato and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who
also attended the presentation of the book on national interests.
</P>
<P>
In regards to the IGC, Solana observed that "reinforced
cooperation" has officially been put in the agenda and thus will
be "debated and decided upon during the French EU presidency",
from July to December 31.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important decision," he added, "because at the
European Council in Helsinki, which opened the IGC, reinforced
cooperation was not on the agenda but now it is on the IGC agenda".
</P>
<P>
Reinforced cooperation allows EU members to move ahead on their
own in certain areas. The decision to place it on the IGC agenda
was made during the Portuguese EU presidency, which expires on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here Monday that
the introduction of a mechanism to allow for "reinforced
cooperation" in the European Union is fundamental and thus the
failure of the Inter-Governmental conference to reform EU
institutions would be"unthinkable".

<P>
NEW YORK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock ended higher
Monday as investors enthused over Philip Morris' merger
announcement ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 138.24 at 10,542.99
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 66.78 at 3,
912.12.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 13.83 at 1,455.31.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied today after Philip Morris, a cigarette and food
maker, announced on Sunday that the company planned to acquire
Nabisco holdings Corp., a snack food company, for 14.9 billion U.S.
dollars. Nabisco makes Ritz crackers, Snackwell's snacks and Oreo
cookies.
</P>
<P>
The announcement buoyed the Dow index and led broader market
higher. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup on the financial sector rose
while IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Amazon.com on the technology sector
were also higher.
</P>
<P>
But investors remained concerned about the Federal Reserve's
meeting on the monetary policy. Analysts mostly expected the
Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged on the 27-28 meeting.
</P>
